1
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,755
Each day felt special and warm

2
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,049
that winter.

3
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,054
And at the end of it, Woo-jae disappeared.

4
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,285
What about me made him choose to leave?

5
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,289
What did I do wrong?

6
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,675
Why did I think

7
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,554
I was to blame all those years?

8
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,938
I'm sorry.

9
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,622
FIRST SOLO EXHIBITION BY JEONG HUI-JU

10
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,553
EPISODE 4
WHAT SHOULDN'T BE LOVED

11
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,347
Woo-jae

12
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,433
really misses you.

13
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,078
I thought you two

14
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,122
had broken up.

15
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,251
You're right.

16
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,171
I should've broken up when you told me to.

17
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,426
I think I turned out this way

18
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,470
because of him.

19
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,473
He totally ruined me.

20
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,558
What are you--

21
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,144
Had I known the reason why he left me…

22
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,815
Had I known where and what he was doing,

23
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,234
I wouldn't have been in this much pain.

24
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,029
I told myself I'd never forgive him.

25
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:45,285
I made a promise to myself
God knows how many times.

26
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,540
But having resenting him
for all those years…

27
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,958
It's been unbearable.

28
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,257
Forgiving him seems easier.

29
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,511
So I'm going to forgive him.

30
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,812
Because Woo-jae

31
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,897
came back.

32
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,074
Whenever I think of the good times
I've had with Woo-jae,

33
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,285
you were always there too.

34
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,996
We should all get together soon.

35
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,459
-Actually, he's--
-No.

36
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,337
I don't understand.

37
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,008
Even married couples get over each other

38
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,218
once they divorce.

39
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,847
You only dated him briefly years ago,

40
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,309
and he dumped you coldheartedly at that.

41
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,270
But you haven't gotten over him
resenting him all these years?

42
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,064
I don't know how to feel about that.

43
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,192
I had my reasons.

44
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,905
Right. You were always quick to justify.

45
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,407
-I--
-If you're trying

46
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,034
to justify assaulting Li-sa

47
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,454
by giving excuses
about your personal misfortunes,

48
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,455
it's no use.

49
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,627
Whatever your reasons are, it doesn't
change the fact that you hurt her.

50
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,797
Let's not meet ever again.

51
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,903
Am I the only fool here?

52
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,906
If you want to leave, leave on your own.
You can't take Ho-su.

53
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,389
She should've

54
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,808
heard me out.

55
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,846
Hey.

56
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,223
Hi.

57
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:02,940
Hey.

58
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,651
Why were you sleeping there?

59
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,155
He wouldn't go to bed.
It wasn't easy tucking him in.

60
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,825
Goodness.

61
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,295
What did you do today?

62
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,966
I was preparing for the exhibition.

63
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,229
It must be tiring working until late.

64
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,923
LEE JU-YEONG

65
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,009
Ms. Gu, here's the video.

66
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,226
Doesn't it look real?

67
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,146
Well, we're not making anything
from scratch.

68
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,316
What do I need to do next?

69
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,615
Isn't it a bit too much
to have a bottle by yourself?

70
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,575
I'm expecting someone.

71
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,661
Another glass, please.

72
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,327
Because Woo-jae came back.

73
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,789
Woo-jae really misses you.

74
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,959
Bullshit.

75
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,828
Li-sa, let's go.

76
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,149
Do you know what this is?

77
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,152
-What?
-This flower.

78
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,949
That's a flower?

79
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,118
What? You don't know either?

80
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,539
When we were living there…

81
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:52,998
Where?

82
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,376
That place.

83
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,962
You were there too.

84
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,594
You were. I'm sure of it.

85
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,140
What was this flower called again?

86
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,017
Heath.

87
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,732
These wildflowers

88
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,610
bloom once a year in the wilderness.

89
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,655
Isn't it amazing?

90
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,708
Mom, isn't this pretty?

91
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,710
Li-sa, stay here.

92
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,149
Pull over.

93
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,860
I'll drive you to the school gate.

94
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,447
I don't want others to see us together.

95
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,498
By the way, where were you yesterday?

96
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,043
-What?
-Last night.

97
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,129
Mom was in her studio. Where were you?

98
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,798
Well…

99
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,939
You're late.

100
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,442
No, I'm good. I drove here.

101
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,363
What a shame.
You're paying for this bottle.

102
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,114
I didn't know you were married.

103
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:55,079
You were born on April 10, 1990,
and are married to Seo Woo-jae.

104
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,707
Am I right?

105
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,417
Is that a problem?

106
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,670
Hold on.

107
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,799
Why are you even interested
in my personal life?

108
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,551
I'm not interested in you.

109
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,763
But I am interested

110
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,932
in your husband.

111
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,105
Where have you

112
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,731
hidden him?

113
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,359
Hidden?

114
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,278
That's rich coming from you.

115
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,118
Does she know

116
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,495
what kind of person her husband is?

117
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,624
Probably not.

118
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,294
She'd have left if she did.

119
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,509
How have you endured it
knowing everything?

120
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,555
You've decided to sweep
everything under the rug

121
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,810
and believe you can still keep
living as a good husband and father.

122
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,813
Is that arrogance

123
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,606
or just a delusion?

124
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,819
If you don't stop, I swear…

125
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,196
I'm done.

126
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,407
Why bother arguing
when we're both miserable?

127
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,038
You don't know me enough
to peg me as a miserable person.

128
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,831
Maybe you're not.

129
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,044
Where is Woo-jae?

130
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,379
What'll you do with him if I tell you?

131
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,299
Does Hui-ju know?

132
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,217
I'm not sure if it's a good thing,

133
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,429
but she refused to hear me out.

134
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,518
Why don't you just drink?
I think we'll be here for a while.

135
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,615
PUBLISHING CONTRACT

136
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,912
We haven't published
a fourth-edition essay in a long time.

137
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,666
Are you working on your next one?

138
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,045
You should.

139
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,591
I thought of what our readers
would want to read about,

140
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,176
and I'm stuck.

141
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,972
Of course, they want
to hear about your story.

142
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,516
Really?

143
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,519
I doubt they want to hear
about how I went from rags to riches

144
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,812
by marrying a wealthy man.

145
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,777
I'm aware of it.
I know people gossip about me.

146
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,862
And I won't deny it.

147
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,032
You've made it this far
because you're good.

148
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,327
You have so many fans
who love your paintings.

149
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,748
And I have my husband
to thank for that, at least partially.

150
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,794
I was able to solely focus on my work

151
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,547
unlike others who struggled
to make ends meet.

152
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,677
So I doubt any advice or comforting words
from me will mean anything to them.

153
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,348
It'd be nice to share
those honest thoughts.

154
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,393
I should just write them in my journal.

155
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,603
Then did you ever have a painful--

156
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,357
No, I don't like bringing up the past.

157
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,901
I like where I am now.

158
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,832
We'll hire eight new teachers
for the major courses within this year.

159
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,919
The Office of Education approved it.

160
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,839
Three are internally-selected,
and we'll hire the rest this month.

161
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,634
What about the general course teachers?

162
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,929
We can't dismiss them
due to the teachers' rights.

163
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,057
We're considering transferring them

164
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,560
to schools under our foundation
or sending them to other schools.

165
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,688
In a year or two,
we'll need more teachers.

166
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,149
So let's have them come back after a year.

167
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,150
Yes, sir.

168
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,070
Form a school personnel committee.

169
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,281
And make sure they all sign
the Declaration of Ethical Conduct Form.

170
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,743
I believe Mr. Lee Hyeong-gi
from Taerim Foundation will--

171
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,622
The medical foundation
has nothing to do with our school.

172
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,958
-Please take care of it yourself.
-Yes, sir.

173
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,835
And leave out anyone
who was selected through connections.

174
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,296
But sir, the foundation has already--

175
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,549
The internally-selected teachers
could become a problem.

176
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,928
Please relay this message to Mr. Lee.

177
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,179
But…

178
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,973
You may leave.

179
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,517
Have the residents been signing

180
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,436
the consent forms?

181
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,189
Yes, sir.

182
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,734
This region is commercially depressed.

183
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,653
So they're open to moving

184
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,572
or switching their line of work
if the compensation is enough.

185
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,993
But some are still against it.

186
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,257
How about some coffee?

187
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,676
I look forward to learning a lot from you.

188
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,304
How do you have
such decisiveness and good judgment?

189
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,306
They come from experience.

190
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,392
-Right.
-In other words, you're talented.

191
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,644
Not at all.
I've worked hard to get this far.

192
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,313
Hello.

193
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,023
Let me.

194
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,232
I'll wrap it up then.

195
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,694
-Let's go.
-Okay.

196
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,404
-Drink on your way.
-Okay.

197
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,548
Hey, I thought we were going
somewhere nice, not here.

198
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,760
This hospital's coffee tastes the best.
I wonder why.

199
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,345
You're right.

200
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,848
Gossiping and coffee
go well with each other.

201
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,185
Seeing even the wealthy die eventually
makes you

202
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,729
feel a bit better
about cleaning up after them.

203
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,105
You're right.

204
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,526
Seeing others suffer is so entertaining.

205
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,779
I only stick around

206
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,115
because it's so entertaining
to see you grovel in front of Ms. Park.

207
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,826
-Has she changed at all?
-What do you think?

208
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,453
How terrifying.

209
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,997
Hang in there.

210
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,916
She'll end up in there soon.

211
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,634
I heard their beef pâté is scrumptious,

212
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,719
but they're always fully booked.

213
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,139
You're the best.

214
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,810
And here's what you asked for.

215
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,689
He'll be back in Seoul tomorrow.

216
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,984
I told him I'd give you his number,
so send him a text first.

217
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,155
We must've had good connections
when he was a cop,

218
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,741
seeing how he always gets the job done.

219
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,951
Thanks.

220
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,870
I should thank you.

221
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,665
While I was at it,

222
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,917
I convinced him to come fishing again.

223
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,421
Why did you even break up?
You guys were doing great.

224
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,259
It's simple. We didn't love each other
enough to endure everything.

225
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,018
Are you seriously going
to leave like this?

226
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,729
I haven't been out in ages,
so I have many errands to run.

227
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,274
-Did you call a cab?
-I did.

228
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,443
How's Ho-su? Is he more attached to you?

229
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,071
Not at all.

230
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,741
He's different from kids his age.

231
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,786
He loves his grandma more than me.

232
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,749
At times, I'm afraid
that he'll choose her over me.

233
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,794
Other times, I wonder if I truly love him.

234
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,756
And that thought scares me
more than anything.

235
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,925
Of course you love him.

236
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,055
The fact that you crave his love
and are afraid of losing him

237
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,141
proves that you love him.

238
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,521
Don't doubt yourself. Okay?

239
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,192
My cab's here.

240
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,818
-Bye.
-Bye.

241
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,574
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

242
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,993
She looks like one of my customers.

243
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,077
Your customer?

244
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,205
Is it one of your regulars?

245
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,957
No, she just left a strong impression.

246
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,918
-Bye.
-Bye.

247
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,878
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

248
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,136
Right.

249
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,098
Rheumatism?

250
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,977
Apparently, my immune system
fails to recognize my own body

251
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,772
and ends up attacking it.

252
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,608
It's a chronic disease,
so you must take good care of it.

253
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,193
It must've been painful.

254
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,445
At times, pain isn't that bad.

255
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,199
When you suddenly wake up
in the middle of the night…

256
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,868
Have you ever felt that way?

257
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,414
Your limbs feel so stiff
that you can't even move.

258
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:46,002
You're not aware of your surroundings
and wonder if you're dead.

259
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,672
That's a symptom of rheumatism.

260
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,344
Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain

261
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,472
and realize
that you're not dead after all.

262
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,141
Then you can breathe again.

263
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,687
You feel this pleasure--

264
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,855
It's foolish to enjoy the pain.

265
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,693
Put your arm down.

266
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,404
You're right.

267
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,948
I am a fool.

268
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,867
I won't deny that.

269
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,329
But I'm not evil enough
to enjoy seeing others suffer.

270
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,584
I'm regretting what I did…

271
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,754
to Li-sa.

272
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:37,429
Can you help me meet with her again?

273
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,352
I haven't been able to see her

274
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,107
since that incident
because her parents wouldn't let me.

275
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,738
I have no ulterior motive.

276
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,658
You told me
I should apologize to her sincerely.

277
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,706
Yes, you should. Before it's too late.

278
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,460
I will.

279
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,463
So that

280
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,424
she knows how to apologize
when she does something wrong.

281
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,224
NEUROSURGERY DR. AN MIN-SEO

282
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,771
My afternoon shift has started.
If it's not urgent…

283
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,983
Were you aware of it?

284
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:37,072
The children of the hospital directors
who favor you…

285
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,911
Did you know I jumped through hoops
to get them into the art school?

286
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,163
But it all went down the drain.

287
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,793
I oversee all the legal teams
in our foundation.

288
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,129
But your brother considered
his school separate.

289
00:27:55,548 --> 00:28:00,303
You know I'm not well-versed in that area.

290
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,139
Exactly.

291
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,643
Your stupidity is
what makes me look like a fool.

292
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,353
Are you a doormat?

293
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:13,733
Are you going to waste your life slaving
away for that money-grubbing family?

294
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,488
That's my family you're talking about.

295
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,365
-How could you say--
-Exactly.

296
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,169
Why aren't you sly like them?

297
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,672
You take after your father

298
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,299
and only know how to treat patients.

299
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,301
Right?

300
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,220
Right?

301
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,348
Doctor An, your patients
are waiting for you.

302
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:58,278
I'm the one you'll spend
your remaining life with, not them.

303
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,487
Got that?

304
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,703
Don't be content with your position here.

305
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,373
Climb up the ladder.

306
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,450
Come in.

307
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,659
Hello.

308
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,455
Let's see.

309
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,416
You've gotten much better.

310
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,647
Thank you.

311
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,902
Thanks to your help,
I avoided disciplinary actions.

312
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:26,616
The more generous Taerim is,
the better the image and value it'll have.

313
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,582
LAWYER LEE HYEONG-GI

314
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,088
MS. GU HAE-WON
HAS SENT A VIDEO

315
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,632
I'll be glad to help again.

316
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,676
I trust that you'll get me rehired.

317
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,849
Turn the handle smoothly

318
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,267
so you won't spill anything.

319
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,810
This is much easier.

320
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:54,769
-Right?
-Yes.

321
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,858
Wash the portafilter well,
or it'll look like your face.

322
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,526
Come on.

323
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:02,735
We have a customer.

324
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,699
I can take a break in five minutes.

325
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,617
One cup of coffee, please.

326
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,126
I've never gotten
a brand-new phone before.

327
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,879
I've always used
secondhand or thrown-out ones.

328
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,423
Your dad never bought you one?

329
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,094
What does he do for a living?

330
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,387
I don't know.

331
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,555
You don't know?

332
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,807
Aren't all dads like that?

333
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,519
You never know what they're up to,
and they always drink at home.

334
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,897
I don't have a mom, so don't ask.

335
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,357
RESTORING DATA

336
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,695
Excuse me.

337
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,657
-It's on me.
-Thank you.

338
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,828
Does he know as well?

339
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,955
-Know what?
-That you don't have a mom.

340
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,753
Don't open up to everyone
just because they're friendly to you.

341
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,381
-What?
-About how you don't have a mom

342
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,260
or any money.
Or about your dad drinking every day

343
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,804
and how that makes you feel lonely.
Things like that.

344
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,848
Why not?

345
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,019
Because you'll look vulnerable.

346
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,898
They can pretend to worry about you
and easily win you over.

347
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,567
What's wrong with that?
They're concerned about me.

348
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,486
Because it's terrifying

349
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,404
when those people change.

350
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,532
It's better to be safe than sorry.

351
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,077
How would you know?

352
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,079
You have a husband and are well-off.

353
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,416
Because there was a time

354
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,337
when I had no husband or money
and only a mom who'd drink every day.

355
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,493
I'll clean it up.

356
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,412
Thank you for the phone.

357
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,997
What about this phone?

358
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,500
You can keep it.

359
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,836
Check it when you're bored.

360
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,639
LI-SA'S TUTOR

361
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,058
Hello, ma'am.

362
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,521
Li-sa isn't home yet,
so we should postpone today's class.

363
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,859
It rings, but she's not picking up.
I think she's doing it on purpose.

364
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,043
Where is she?

365
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,170
Who?

366
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,632
Your art teacher.
She was just here with you.

367
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,883
Where did she go?

368
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,472
Where the hell is she?

369
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,019
You skipped your tutoring class
and didn't answer your phone.

370
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,522
-What were you doing with--
-What about you?

371
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,650
Why did you meet with Ju-yeong
behind my back?

372
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,531
-At the cafe this afternoon--
-I told you

373
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,157
that she's a leech.

374
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,201
-It was because you--
-I told you

375
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,162
she sponges off others
to get what she needs!

376
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,789
So why won't you listen to me?

377
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,458
Li-sa.

378
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,961
An Li-sa!

379
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,422
Why won't you answer me?

380
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,299
What were you doing with--

381
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,135
She apologized.

382
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,887
That's it? Did she say anything else?

383
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,347
What else--

384
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,392
What else does she need to say
other than that she's sorry?

385
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,646
Then why would she come
all the way here to see you alone?

386
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,482
Because she wanted
to apologize for what she'd done.

387
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,863
What?

388
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,950
Do you think she hit me
because I did something wrong?

389
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,493
Do you believe that lunatic?

390
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:21,596
GAMJATANG

391
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,112
I'd like what she's having.
No side dishes, please.

392
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,325
There are no empty tables.

393
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,915
But others will think
that we're eating together.

394
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,791
Is that bad?

395
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,710
I don't mind.

396
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,255
But I don't want that woman
from before to get the wrong idea.

397
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,799
No, she won't be coming here today.

398
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,385
An older girlfriend?

399
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,348
I don't think she's your mom.

400
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,391
Neither.

401
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,560
-Then who is she?
-What about you?

402
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,562
Do you have a boyfriend?

403
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,065
No.

404
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,277
I have a husband.

405
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,454
BUS STOP

406
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,132
Are you going home?

407
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,761
Your bus.

408
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,683
It broke down
at the three-way intersection.

409
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,978
I see.

410
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,562
It'll take some time.

411
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,066
Hop in. We're going in the same direction.

412
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,470
I'll let you know that I don't usually hop

413
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,180
into a stranger's car.

414
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,516
But today, I'm a bit exhausted.

415
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,063
But I'm not a stranger.

416
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,775
That's true.

417
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,571
That's why you should be more cautious.

418
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,825
Those around you can be

419
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,077
even more dangerous.

420
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,378
I have some stuff to drop off at the bar.

421
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,173
Can I drop you off here?

422
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,507
Sure.

423
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,932
Oh, right. Look.

424
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,852
Don't tell her that you saw me today.

425
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,147
-What?
-My daughter, Hae-won.

426
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,190
Don't tell her.

427
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:21,776
Okay.

428
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:23,986
And

429
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,072
thank you.

430
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,012
How long have you been waiting? Hold on.

431
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,934
RICE MEAL

432
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,185
Give me one minute.

433
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,032
Don't like my mom.

434
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,202
I don't.

435
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,121
Then why give her a ride?

436
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,624
Oh, that? You see,

437
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,254
the bus broke down
at the three-way intersection.

438
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,047
She likes handsome men.

439
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:30,094
They can be scumbags
as long as they're good-looking.

440
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,346
But you're…

441
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,560
Okay.

442
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,020
I'll ignore her from now on.

443
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,648
You seem like a decent guy. That's why.

444
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,693
My mom has gone through some stuff.

445
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,572
People like her
tend to torment those around them.

446
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,781
That's a relief.

447
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,785
There are many
who torment others for no apparent reason.

448
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,415
You wouldn't know why
no matter how many times you wondered

449
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,333
why they're doing it.

450
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,629
Anyway, I warned you.

451
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,924
What? Where are you going?

452
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,719
Didn't you come here to drink?

453
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,443
But I'm not a decent guy.

454
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,187
I believe you. I'm sorry.

455
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,777
If that teacher approaches you again,

456
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,362
then tell me--

457
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,489
I'm going to rinse off now. Get out.

458
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:22,665
I just did that out of worry

459
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,125
that she'd hurt you again.

460
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,839
I'm sorry for not telling you
that I was meeting--

461
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,049
Get out.

462
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:45,980
Li-sa, no one can steal me from you.
You do know that, right?

463
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,328
I had no other intentions.

464
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,081
I just wanted

465
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,709
to buy some time.

466
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,686
Born on October 24, 1985.

467
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,439
The resident registration number
is 152831.

468
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:01,360
His name is Seo Woo-jae.

469
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,821
Correct. Woo-jae.

470
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,783
One more person, please.

471
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,455
Gu Hae-won, born on April 10.

472
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,583
Correct.

473
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,045
Thank you.

474
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,761
Hello.

475
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,515
Where's Min-seo?

476
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,600
She had surgery scheduled this morning.

477
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:37,563
She should look after her body
before tending to her patients.

478
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:40,857
Ho-su.

479
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,821
Ho-su, you shouldn't draw on this.

480
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,656
-Give that back.
-You have your book.

481
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,241
-Read this.
-Hey.

482
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,786
Don't worry about my grandson,
and take care of your family.

483
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,622
Your mom called and thanked me.

484
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,041
Must I continue putting up with this?

485
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,296
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

486
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,757
Of course you didn't know. Again.

487
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,968
So Hyeon-seong did it by himself?

488
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,056
Her business fails every single time,
and yet, he keeps giving her money.

489
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,058
That's an illness.

490
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:19,563
She shamelessly asks for money
and whines about how hard she works.

491
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:23,525
Tell her to just stay home.
I'm sure you give her an allowance.

492
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,779
-Mother.
-Am I wrong?

493
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,448
You should stop too.

494
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,284
You've done more than enough
for your poor mother.

495
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,370
Most people exchange loyalty
for money, but she…

496
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,959
Goodness, my puppy. Come here.

497
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,339
Goodness.

498
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,641
Let's see.

499
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,520
I'm sure she didn't say that out of spite.

500
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,065
I'd rather she did, to be honest.

501
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,107
Sorry?

502
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,362
It's more appalling
if she's saying such awful things

503
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,155
with no spite.

504
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,167
Don't mind me. I just forgot something.

505
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,919
You should've called.

506
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,129
-It's my phone that I forgot.
-I see.

507
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,525
It must look realistic.

508
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,527
That's what's most important.

509
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:44,624
BILLIARD HALL

510
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,127
PROTECT OUR PROPERTY RIGHTS

511
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,685
What is it?

512
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,191
I was wondering if you were still open.

513
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,402
I heard this place is getting sold.

514
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,030
Who the hell said that? You should leave.

515
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,456
Are you Lee Ju-yeong's father?

516
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,000
What the hell are you talking about?

517
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,968
BILLIARD HALL

518
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,188
Ms. Gu.

519
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,243
So you're telling me
that if I hold out and don't sign this,

520
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,994
the school plan may fall through?

521
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,915
This entire building will be cleaned up.

522
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,584
It's not part of the school region,

523
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:13,463
but if any of the stores aren't
student-friendly, it won't happen.

524
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:17,259
For example, this billiard hall?

525
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,260
Correct.

526
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,054
I wouldn't be able
to move out even if I wanted to.

527
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:25,183
I put this house up as collateral
for this place.

528
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,103
How could I possibly leave
without a premium?

529
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,980
That's why you should get compensation.

530
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,901
However, you may end up with nothing
if you get too greedy and it's canceled.

531
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:40,156
So you must listen to me
and sign it after a negotiation.

532
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,367
I trust you.

533
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,452
If I get compensated,

534
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,329
I'll treat you--

535
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:50,000
You should treat Ju-yeong, not me.

536
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,629
Right. Ju-yeong.

537
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,881
Art school will be pricey

538
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,174
even if she receives government benefits.

539
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,720
That's fine

540
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,140
as long as you're her teacher.

541
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,975
That's my wish as well.

542
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,022
So you should listen to me carefully

543
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,816
and never be rash.

544
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,528
Be patient and look at the big picture.

545
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,992
Okay. I'll do that.

546
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:27,913
Goodbye.

547
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,232
Did we have to meet here of all places?

548
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,069
I felt like we should.

549
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:07,327
Six months ago, they moved into a place.

550
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,871
But I don't know
if they're actually living there.

551
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,832
It's not that far,
so you can go check yourself if you want.

552
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:15,377
Okay.

553
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,797
Is Dong-mi doing well?

554
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:22,926
Yes.

555
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,527
HOUSEHOLD REGISTER
SELF: SEO WOO-JAE, WIFE: GU HAE-WON

556
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:46,324
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE
SEO WOO-JAE, GU HAE-WON

557
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,912
Marriage?

558
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:55,667
We're not having a wedding.
We're just registering our marriage.

559
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,962
They mean the same thing.

560
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,093
There are many ways
for you two to study abroad together.

561
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,429
You're too young to get married.

562
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,265
I found out that there are
many benefits for married couples.

563
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,808
What benefit do you need

564
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,477
when you passed the language exam
and got admitted?

565
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:20,191
What did he do while you were studying
German and preparing your portfolio?

566
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:24,904
Does he even want to go?

567
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,908
If you do go, he'll have to study
for the entrance exam,

568
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,287
and you'll have to do
part-time jobs to make ends meet.

569
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:33,913
Hui-ju.

570
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,208
You'll have to provide
for someone else while studying abroad.

571
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,293
How will you--

572
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,336
You know I have good stamina.

573
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,213
Marriage isn't a dream.

574
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,092
It's your only chance
to dramatically turn your life around.

575
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,805
Just because it worked for you
doesn't mean it'll work for me.

576
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,145
I know how you feel.

577
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,066
But you really don't need to worry.

578
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,735
I'm going to be happy.

579
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,313
Are you here to see the house?

580
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,899
Someone else came by a few days ago.

581
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,026
It's a good apartment.

582
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,402
I see.

583
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,705
Let's begin the shoot.

584
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,291
Look at the camera. One, two.

585
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,918
Good work.

586
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,837
Can I talk to the bride?

587
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,445
I'll take some shots of the bride.

588
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,697
Okay. Here we go.

589
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,616
Okay. One, two.

590
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,120
One, two.

591
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,164
Good.

592
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,084
Put your shoulder a bit forward. Good.

593
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,378
Here we go. One, two.

594
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,380
Move.

595
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,842
Is this what you wanted?

596
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,679
Look at me.

597
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,392
Do you want me to get married like you?

598
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,103
So that we can all be miserable?

599
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,780
Seeing how you came this far,
you don't want to end it with her either.

600
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,367
You're wrong.
I only came because you asked me to.

601
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,160
If you don't want me to, I won't.

602
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,173
Just say the word.

603
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,762
Tell me to stop.

604
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,899
Here we go. One, two.

605
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,736
-Okay. You're done.
-Thank you.

606
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,994
Are you done?

607
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,954
It was so awkward.

608
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,666
I didn't know smiling
was so difficult. My face feels stiff.

609
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,962
You should at least have
some photos, right? You did well.

610
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,214
I don't think I can do this twice.

611
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,850
You look so gorgeous.

612
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,353
You're literally shining.

613
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,272
Thank you so much.

614
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,274
Don't mention it.

615
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,739
Hey, Woo-jae.

616
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,336
I'm going to be happy.

617
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,029
Who are you kidding?

618
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,301
Am I interrupting?

619
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,012
I'm kind of stuck today.

620
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:06,764
What's up?

621
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,102
I was organizing
some clothes in the bedroom,

622
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,147
and this fell out of your purse.

623
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,233
I was wondering what it was.

624
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,821
Oh, right. I told you before.

625
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,824
Li-sa threw and broke Ju-yeong's phone.

626
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,368
But why do you have it?

627
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:31,205
She's really something.
I bought her a new phone,

628
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,333
and she told me to go through it
if I got bored. There was nothing.

629
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,380
There was something.

630
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,646
Did you already see this?

631
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,064
Yes.

632
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,527
Don't get the wrong idea. Ms. Gu and I--

633
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,695
I don't.

634
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,909
You look really irritated in that video.

635
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,207
Others may get the wrong idea, but not me.

636
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,045
Should I be relieved or frightened?

637
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:25,176
Maybe it's for the better. Be careful
not to cause any misunderstandings.

638
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,433
By the way, I wonder why she took that.

639
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,438
Maybe Ms. Gu told her to.

640
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,276
The teacher

641
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,530
who visited Ju-yeong's
and counseled her several times

642
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,281
was Gu Hae-won.

643
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,536
People who aren't well-off

644
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,372
tend to get attached
to teachers who give them attention.

645
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,754
Maybe Ju-yeong's the one who told her
where Li-sa's dance studio is.

646
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,422
What?

647
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,592
Ms. Gu came to her dance studio
to apologize to her.

648
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,345
I was wondering how she found out.

649
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:16,936
There's definitely something
going on between Ms. Gu and Ju-yeong.

650
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,813
I'll meet with Ju-yeong again--

651
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,649
No, focus on your exhibition.
Leave this to me.

652
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:31,284
I don't want to cause a commotion
until our school gets approved.

653
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,035
I'll take care of it.

654
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,789
This is under my jurisdiction now.

655
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,750
I'll let you be.

656
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,057
THE MEANING OF SILENCE,
FROM DRAWING TO CARVING

657
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,166
THE MEANING OF SILENCE,
FROM DRAWING TO CARVING

658
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:23,878
Who's the artist?
I heard that you handpicked him.

659
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:28,132
You wouldn't know even if I told you.
At least not yet.

660
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:31,344
I'll introduce you during the reception.

661
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:53,616
Doesn't it leave
a strong impression despite being bland?

662
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:57,411
I love it. I truly do.

663
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:03,459
You know, I used to prefer arts
that were majestic and spectacular.

664
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:08,089
Ones that expressed anger
towards violence in society

665
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:10,341
and strived to save mankind through art.

666
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:15,930
Back in college, I had a crush
on a senior who studied sculpting.

667
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,181
This is what he said.

668
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,517
He didn't even like to see me smile.

669
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,310
He despised laziness.

670
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:26,107
He said wealthy women who did this
as a hobby could never create art.

671
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,944
He loathed how poor he was

672
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,780
but also used it as a shield.

673
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,827
You must've liked him a lot.

674
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,788
It sounds like you're pining for him.

675
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,206
Back then, yes.

676
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,168
Back then, I believed pitying him

677
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,629
and torturing myself
was considered sublime love.

678
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,801
I'm curious about his work.
It must be so captivating.

679
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:57,763
He's dead. He was devastated
by this world's lack of understanding.

680
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,224
And he destroyed all his work.

681
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:08,899
That's why I love your work.

682
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,818
Your purpose is clear,

683
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:14,321
yet the audience can make
their own interpretations. I love that.

684
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:19,035
You should've written
the testimonial for my exhibition.

685
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,829
I was turned away
for being such a passionate fan.

686
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:23,748
Ma'am.

687
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:25,875
By her.

688
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:28,085
-This way.
-Okay.

689
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,089
Watch your step.

690
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:37,678
This must be your first time
attending a reception in a while.

691
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:41,557
The artist is someone
I am taking extra care of.

692
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,520
This is his first exhibition,
so he must be tense.

693
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,023
And he knows no one in Korea.

694
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:53,360
He was too sick to work on any
for a while.

695
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,656
Please guide him well.

696
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,241
Sure.

697
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,123
-I see you put in a lot of effort.
-Yes, a bit.

698
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:23,265
Sir.

699
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,377
I came without any attachments,

700
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,296
but why haven't you put anything aside?

701
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,881
Is this funny to you?

702
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:21,008
I'm sorry for leaving you all alone.

703
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:23,302
Does it look like I'm worried
and nervous to you?

704
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,138
All of the things that I missed out on,

705
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,890
I'm going to make it
the way it should have been.

706
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,268
-Hui-ju.
-It's been a while.

707
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,853
How have you been?

708
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:35,064
Do you know me?

709
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:36,899
