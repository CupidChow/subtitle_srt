1
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,861
I won't let you run off this time.

2
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,864
I'm going to get back everything

3
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,533
that I lost.

4
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,717
Woo-jae.

5
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,262
Woo-jae?

6
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,601
You're right.

7
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:46,606
I did love you with all my heart.

8
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,402
I gave it my all.

9
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,657
I even chose to ignore
and deceive my family

10
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,245
to the point where
I was horrified at myself.

11
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,842
But it's over now.

12
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,426
We were sick of each other.

13
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,390
We saw each other at our worst.

14
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,729
It's over. Don't try to salvage it.
Don't long for it.

15
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,858
When will you stop clinging to the past?

16
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:37,240
Give it your all to the person
beside you now, okay? I beg you.

17
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,332
You're the one
who cut our relationship short.

18
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,129
I haven't even started yet.

19
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,979
You're up early.

20
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,191
I stayed up all night painting.

21
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,069
I want to finish this project
as soon as I can.

22
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,278
Hopefully.

23
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,949
You must be exhausted.
You know the orientation's today, right?

24
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,368
I know. I'll be there on time.

25
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,079
I'll wake the kids up. Have a seat.

26
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,596
The shoulder pain worsened
after I started working longer hours.

27
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,433
It's quite stiff.

28
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,854
Blood clots are sensitive
to temperature, humidity, and weather.

29
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,690
And it gets more painful at night.

30
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,776
I should've gotten it treated properly
right after I hurt it.

31
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,570
The shots only help so much.

32
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,031
You need to strengthen your muscles here.

33
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,367
But for now, you need rest.

34
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,870
And be sparing with the shots.

35
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:52,250
They temporarily numb the pain,
but at times, pain is needed.

36
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,337
It's your body's way of warning you
to be more careful from now on.

37
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,090
A warning?

38
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,637
I guess this pain's giving me
a timely warning.

39
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,223
Sorry?

40
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,560
Seo Woo-jae!

41
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,479
Ho-su's my son! I raised him!

42
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,190
I won't let you turn him
into a twisted person

43
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,651
with an inferiority complex like you!

44
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,930
Mr. Seo! Hold on.

45
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,977
I think I need to tell you this.

46
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,937
What is it?

47
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,272
Ms. Gu…

48
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,234
Take good care of her.

49
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,279
She seems to be struggling lately.

50
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,615
I know I'm being nosy.

51
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,950
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,454
But since you're her husband…

53
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,872
I'm not her husband anymore.

54
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,584
It was only on paper,

55
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,836
but soon not even that.

56
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,174
If you have feelings for her,

57
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,468
don't worry about me.

58
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,804
Because she's not the one

59
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,306
I'm in love with right now.

60
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,474
What?

61
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,519
I… I don't understand.

62
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,437
I actually envy you.

63
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,691
The woman I love has a family of her own,

64
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,987
so I have no choice
but to hide my feelings.

65
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,829
Does that woman

66
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:57,875
also have feelings for you?

67
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,088
Yes.

68
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,631
Don't do it.

69
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,011
She won't abandon her family.

70
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,680
That doesn't matter.

71
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,520
Because Hui-ju's worth loving
despite all that.

72
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,326
Most high schools nowadays

73
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,622
focus on subjects that'll help prepare
their students for college.

74
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,042
Arts high schools are no exception
and simply a stepping stone

75
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,336
to art universities for students.

76
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,630
"A Taerim graduate."

77
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,550
We, the faculty, promise to do our best

78
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,012
to make sure those words
will mean something to others.

79
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,936
Please say something too, Ms. Jeong.

80
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,146
I'm a fan of yours!

81
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,607
I decided to send my kid here
because of you.

82
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,859
-It's nice to see you.
-Please.

83
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,277
It seems you are

84
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,238
more interested in her than my briefing.

85
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,284
Ms. Jeong, please say a few words.

86
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,498
TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS
PARENTS' INVITATIONAL ORIENTATION

87
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,051
You all know
that I never went to college, right?

88
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,598
You won't have to worry

89
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,310
about your family's status
or which college you graduated from.

90
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,564
You'll be acknowledged
for being a Taerim graduate.

91
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:48,236
Our students will be able
to enjoy the present.

92
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,112
I'll strive to make that happen

93
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,031
by guiding…

94
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,911
our chairman down the right path.

95
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,204
Thank you.

96
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,005
-Can I have your autograph?
-Sure. Thank you.

97
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,423
You actually bought this?

98
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,175
It's such an honor.

99
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,970
You take such great care of your body.

100
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,888
-I agree.
-You're flattering me.

101
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,723
Let's take a photo.

102
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,268
-Sure.
-Does Hui-ju know

103
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,936
about what you did to me?

104
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,188
Probably not.

105
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,442
Had she known,
she would've left you long ago.

106
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,497
I loved your book.

107
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,111
Did you come here with Woo-jae?

108
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,203
Are you okay with Hui-ju…

109
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,874
seeing you like this?

110
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,506
She'll try to be good to you
for some time out of guilt.

111
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,593
But she'll soon get tired of it.

112
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,805
"I think I've done more than enough,

113
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,016
so why is he still like that?"

114
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,022
Her guilt will turn into frustration.

115
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,361
She'll never be able to really know
what it's like to be betrayed.

116
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,363
Only you and I

117
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,908
know what that's like.

118
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,459
Gosh. Is that so?

119
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,394
What brings you here?

120
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,411
Those two must click so well.

121
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,043
How dare you come here?

122
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,879
Why are you even here?

123
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,091
To see you. You looked great up on stage.

124
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,177
You looked like a great trophy wife.

125
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,183
Stop being so reckless.

126
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,603
I really want to see this project through.

127
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,166
Did you visit the school today?

128
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,834
Yes.

129
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,005
Why?

130
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,799
I missed her.

131
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,304
Go home first. I have work left to do.

132
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,187
They say you need courage
to divorce someone,

133
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,482
but I can't say I completely agree.

134
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,905
Staying married putting up with everything

135
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,407
also requires courage.

136
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,785
Because it's much shittier.

137
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,583
We're a married couple no matter what.

138
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,420
We vowed to be by each other's side

139
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,590
no matter how torturous it may be

140
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,884
until death do us part.

141
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,556
Do you still want to break up?

142
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,603
Then just die.

143
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,814
Or kill me instead.

144
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,503
You need to come here.

145
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,219
All right.

146
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,097
I'll talk about it with your mom.

147
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,808
Was that Jeong-hwan?

148
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,352
I wanted to talk to him too.

149
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,110
Did you tell him to come to Korea
during the summer break?

150
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,612
I forgot.

151
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,615
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

152
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,372
Okay.

153
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,463
Close the door on your way out.

154
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,476
Goodness. I can't believe
you'll be going to school.

155
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,269
My puppy.

156
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,108
This is the school he'll attend.

157
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,820
It'll start in September,
so you have time. Get ready.

158
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,241
I'm not giving you a choice.
I'm informing you.

159
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,161
It's time to take my meds.

160
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,299
I guess Min-seo isn't going.

161
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,301
I heard this was important.

162
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,389
She slipped in the bathroom
and hurt her face.

163
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,100
What terrible timing.

164
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:19,019
She does surgery after surgery.
It's not surprising.

165
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,106
She should let someone take her place,

166
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,151
so she can begin overseeing the hospital.

167
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,406
I mean, it's time
for our mother-in-law to take it easy.

168
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,229
Min-seo. It's me.

169
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,692
I'll call your brother
if you don't open the door.

170
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,652
Do you hear me?

171
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,845
Why are you quiet
when you were just brazenly knocking?

172
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,889
Leave then.

173
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,685
I thought someone as smart as you
would handle things differently.

174
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,401
I was beaten by my father growing up.

175
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,283
He beat me whether I was obedient
or when I ran away.

176
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,913
Thinking he would beat me more if I cried,
I even tried holding back my tears.

177
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,873
But he beat me for being headstrong.

178
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,046
I did nothing wrong,
but he'd beat me all the time.

179
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,549
Just thinking that I deserved it

180
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,843
made everything simpler.

181
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,221
Why are you telling me this?

182
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,308
Do you think we're the same?

183
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,769
Not at all.

184
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,314
Unlike me, you don't need to wait.

185
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:29,942
What?

186
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,403
All that I could do was wait.

187
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,617
But fortunately,
my father passed away early.

188
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,419
But such fortunate situations

189
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,132
don't come so easily.

190
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,803
You need to make the decision.

191
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,598
And I know you're capable of doing that.

192
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,742
Does Jeong-hwan know

193
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,078
what kind of person his father is?

194
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,124
I'm sure

195
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,918
he's homesick.

196
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,136
But he doesn't come home
during his breaks. Why do you think?

197
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,497
Did you notice on your way here?

198
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,250
The GTX will be going through there.

199
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,629
And this area has been chosen
to be the next development area.

200
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,673
Did you see how all the roads were paved?

201
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,634
And look around.

202
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,678
There are no unpleasant facilities,
are there?

203
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,892
Fifty-five townhouses will be built here.

204
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,813
Read the brochures I gave you
and take a look around.

205
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,315
NEW CONSTRUCTION SITE

206
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,443
Honey, when will you get here?

207
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,611
Are you almost here?

208
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,904
HONEY

209
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,294
-Hey.
-You bitch.

210
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,423
Was scamming me not enough?
How dare you seduce my husband?

211
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,217
-You crazy bitch. How dare you?
-Hey!

212
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,510
Hey, wait!

213
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,596
-You're mistaken! We can talk it out!
-How dare you seduce him!

214
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,933
GIRLS' RESTING ROOM

215
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,357
You spread this rumor, didn't you?

216
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,775
FIRST-YEAR AT SEOAN HIGH
WITH HER SUGAR DADDY CAFE OWNER

217
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,778
I quit working there ages ago.

218
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,154
A sugar daddy?

219
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,282
Did you see us? Did you?

220
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,411
I did. I just wrote what I saw.

221
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,746
What did you see?

222
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,126
I saw you two walking
into an alley full of motels.

223
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,756
There's a shopping mall there.
He bought me a present since--

224
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,510
Exactly. Why would he
get you something for no reason?

225
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,221
Why don't you blabber
about my dad and quit making up lies?

226
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,182
Then I'll talk about what I saw as well.

227
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,769
-What?
-About your mom and Ms. Gu's husband.

228
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,899
You know Ms. Gu and I are close.
Did you think I didn't know?

229
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,359
How dare you?

230
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,863
I only kept it a secret
since we were still friends.

231
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,157
Do you think I won't do it?

232
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,495
Hey! Lee Ju-yeong! Hey!

233
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,398
Did you see Mom?

234
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,778
She's sorry.

235
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,907
She must've wanted to brag
since it was the opening event.

236
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,785
Why bother bragging
when it's going to be another flop?

237
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,123
Give it to her.

238
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,503
I can't do this to my husband anymore.
This is the last time.

239
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,797
So tell her never to call me again.

240
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:06,051
I won't give her any money
through you ever again.

241
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,720
Hui-ju.

242
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,597
That's enough. Let's go.

243
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,766
Wait. I'm not done praying.

244
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,685
About what?

245
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,813
I was praying for you.

246
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,024
Don't bother. I don't believe in prayers.

247
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,778
People only do that
when they feel completely hopeless.

248
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,739
About Ms. Gu…

249
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,287
Apologize to her first.

250
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,961
That's what a strong person does.

251
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,882
Only the weak pity themselves
and refuse to admit they're wrong.

252
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,386
And you're not weak.

253
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,267
You're strong. I know this for a fact.

254
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,104
You and Seo Woo-jae…

255
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,065
You shouldn't have done it

256
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,526
to Ms. Gu and Hyeon-seong.

257
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:07,863
You…

258
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,868
Did Hae-won tell you?

259
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,035
No.

260
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:18,039
It showed. I didn't need her to tell me.

261
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,751
It just showed.

262
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,134
Apologize?

263
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,431
Sure. I can apologize over and over again.

264
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,560
But she's the one
who refused to accept my apology.

265
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,103
Why?

266
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,398
So people like you would pity her.

267
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,444
Apologize to her?
I can definitely do that.

268
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,196
Not because I want forgiveness,

269
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,074
but because I pity her for ruining
her own life by living in the past.

270
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,876
Apologize to her.

271
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,882
Apologize sincerely. For your own sake.

272
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,969
Don't lose your chance to be forgiven.

273
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,222
Do you remember what you said?

274
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,058
You truly wished for my happiness.

275
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,310
You said I deserved it.

276
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,192
Then I'm sure you know what you must do.

277
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,045
When did you do all of this?

278
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,590
Since the molds are ready,

279
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,884
we can make as many duplicates as we need.

280
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,886
But I think it'd be best for you to focus

281
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,389
on your signature work
for the upcoming project--

282
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,308
Of course. I'm working on that too.

283
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,311
I know, but you're doing
all those ads and interviews.

284
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,523
So I'm just worried
that you're overworking yourself.

285
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,650
I'd like you to sell them for me.

286
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:13,113
I noticed people criticize artists
if their works sell well.

287
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,740
But that makes no sense.

288
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,660
Artists don't always have to be poor.

289
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,953
That's true.

290
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,833
Well, your father created art
in a different--

291
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:29,504
He only considered his work to be art.

292
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,799
Who was he to judge?

293
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,635
Other people's opinions matter the most.

294
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,223
He'd torment himself
and even his son because of that.

295
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,852
But I'm different.

296
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,403
Darn it.

297
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,115
He fell in love
with someone else for a while.

298
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,950
Did you see who that woman was?

299
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,160
I did.

300
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,287
Through a painting.

301
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,622
He drew a painting of her.

302
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,792
I could feel his emotions
through his paintings.

303
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,341
You knew I'd be here, didn't you?

304
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,302
You should've called first.

305
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,013
That painting your husband drew…

306
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,806
Was it of my mom?

307
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,104
Did you tell Ju-yeong about it?

308
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,731
What do you mean?

309
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,235
She threatened to spread rumors
about them. Stop her.

310
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,946
Why would she do that?
Did something happen between you?

311
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,948
It's all your fault!

312
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,451
She and I fell out because of you!

313
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,119
I used to be her only friend.

314
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,623
You stole her from me and hit me
because you hated my mom!

315
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,458
So fix everything!

316
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,257
If she says anything stupid,

317
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,842
it'll be all on you. Okay?

318
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,219
So fix it!

319
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,473
-Isn't that Ms. Gu?
-Let's just go.

320
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,063
Is everything fine between you guys?

321
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,773
Yes.

322
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,335
Mr. Yoon.

323
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,380
Don't get the wrong idea.

324
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,844
It's true that
I once led her to buy the wrong land,

325
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,471
and I'm truly sorry about that.

326
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,934
But I'm not the type
who'd seduce married men.

327
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,521
Okay.

328
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,981
I'm serious.

329
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,151
I know.

330
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:59,487
You believe me, right? You do, right?

331
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,030
Yes.

332
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,536
Whenever I listen to you,

333
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,499
I can't help but think,
"I see. That could happen."

334
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,295
Everything makes sense, and I believe you.

335
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,050
Wait.

336
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,520
Do you remember
when I said you looked familiar?

337
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,941
I almost remembered just now.

338
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,533
Your house is a mess and there's
nothing but junk food lying around.

339
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,160
I told you to look after Ju-yeong.

340
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,664
What happened to your face?

341
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,544
There's no need for that.
She's staying at the dorm.

342
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,714
Feeding her something good
on the weekends is enough.

343
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,800
And she's all grown up.

344
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,843
When I was her age, I had you--

345
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,764
Seriously…

346
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,687
It's been hard for me too. Really hard!

347
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,981
So why aren't you concerned about me?

348
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,983
And who's to blame for that?

349
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,237
You're the one
making life harder for yourself.

350
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,952
There you go again.
Every time you have nothing to say--

351
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,203
Let her run away.

352
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,664
What's so wrong with that?

353
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:38,962
They say long battles benefit no one.
Even The Art of War says so.

354
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,343
Why don't you sit down
and have a drink with me?

355
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:56,062
Does Hui-ju know about what you did to me?

356
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,439
Probably not.

357
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,652
Had she known,
she would've left you long ago.

358
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,080
What were you thinking so hard about?

359
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,666
Gosh. I must've dozed off.

360
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,001
What is it?

361
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,378
Remember you mentioned

362
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,840
an overseas residency program for Seon-u?

363
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:27,552
Right. There's that
and also an internship.

364
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,138
They're the best
for sports physical therapy.

365
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,806
Is he interested?

366
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,976
I plan to make him go.

367
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,023
Can you look more into it?

368
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:44,068
Studying abroad will be
a great opportunity for him.

369
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,062
DIVORCE AGREEMENT
HUSBAND: SEO WOO-JAE

370
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,351
You're the one at fault.

371
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,064
So how dare you demand a divorce first?

372
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,401
You will never get back with her
no matter what.

373
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,197
This has nothing to do with her.

374
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,742
I want to break up
because I'm not happy with you.

375
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,869
Are you trying to save face?

376
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,080
You're funny.

377
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,083
You're just a cheater.

378
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,212
No. You don't even have a mistress.

379
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,215
Hui-ju doesn't want you back.

380
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,802
Dr. Jeong Seon-u likes you.

381
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,013
You knew that, didn't you?

382
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,432
You enjoyed it while knowing his feelings.

383
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,100
So what makes you so different?

384
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,770
How foolish of you.

385
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,314
I'm not doing this
because you love someone else.

386
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,277
It can happen. Hui-ju is charming.

387
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,738
I used to admire her too.

388
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,327
But all those lies you told to fool me!

389
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,291
You deceived me,

390
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:08,004
the very person who trusted you the most.

391
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,300
That's what drives me crazy!

392
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,135
That's exactly why you should stop.

393
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,718
You still confess regularly.

394
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,804
I do.

395
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,974
IT MIGHT RAIN TODAY, DON'T FORGET YOU
UMBRELLA, DON'T SKIP OUT ON LUNCH

396
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:06,646
Even my mom doesn't remind me
to eat as often as you do.

397
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,026
Let's go eat.

398
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,829
Is that really enough?

399
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,665
Yes.

400
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,669
I wanted to eat this in this neighborhood.

401
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,797
Maybe it's because

402
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,592
this was the first neighborhood
I lived in Seoul.

403
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,764
I'm sick of this place
but always miss it as well.

404
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,599
I'm sick of my hometown,

405
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,060
but I never miss it.

406
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,441
But I do miss my friend from time to time.

407
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,864
Do you mean the one who died?

408
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,241
You met her a couple of times.

409
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,243
The lady who comes to see me.

410
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,413
She's his mom.

411
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,207
Unlike my mom,

412
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,626
she'd do anything for her son.

413
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:16,215
Thanks to her, he was able to escape
that horrible neighborhood first.

414
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,886
So we lost touch for a long time
and reunited in high school.

415
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,140
He had changed a lot.

416
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,100
But…

417
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,437
instead of being happy for him,

418
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,106
I was jealous.

419
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,571
Gosh. But I was too ashamed
to let my feelings show.

420
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,700
So I acted pretentiously
and caused an accident.

421
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,286
An accident?

422
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,829
It was a car accident.

423
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,874
I didn't have a license.

424
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,878
I encouraged him to do it with me,

425
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,714
but he died and I survived.
So it's all my fault.

426
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,096
I confess not so that we'll be forgiven,

427
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,307
but so that I don't forget it.

428
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,602
What about his mom?

429
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,604
She can't bring herself to forgive me.

430
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,566
Since I know
that's what's keeping her going,

431
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,487
I don't dare to ask for her forgiveness.

432
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,828
Look. I'm sorry about last time.

433
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,415
I knew you were in pain.

434
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,336
I was selfish.

435
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,641
TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL CHAIRMAN'S DAUGHTER
IS TERRIBLE AT DANCING

436
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,818
Her dad owns the school.

437
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,820
He put her in the special class.

438
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,905
What about all the sincere students?

439
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,157
They're a bunch of crooks
that favor the rich.

440
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,325
What a shady school.

441
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,380
How is Li-sa?

442
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,591
She won't come out of her room.

443
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,721
Are you certain that Ju-yeong did this?

444
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,348
She's the only one who filmed Li-sa.

445
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,183
But they were friends.

446
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,103
This is such a malicious rumor.
It makes Li-sa look like--

447
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,439
It'll be difficult
to get it deleted from our end.

448
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,816
It may even worsen the situation.

449
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,194
You've met Ju-yeong several times.

450
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,904
Why don't you try persuading her?

451
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,659
We can only make a move
once she deletes the video.

452
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,705
Okay.

453
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,040
So this is how you're helping Ju-yeong?

454
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,085
This is your definition
of taking care of her?

455
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,383
You know what she did to Li-sa, don't you?

456
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,553
Imagine how hurt and upset
she was to do that.

457
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,811
I guess Ju-yeong is
following in your footsteps.

458
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,108
Li-sa was the one who started it.

459
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:06,028
So? What are you trying to gain
by joining the kids' fight?

460
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,950
I get that you can't understand
how a mother feels.

461
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,452
But where's your conscience as a teacher?

462
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,414
Excuse me. Who are you?

463
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,749
Who are you to barge in here and yap away?

464
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,836
My daughter was her student.

465
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,421
Leave.

466
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,506
You had me fired
and still blame me as a teacher?

467
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,508
So, what is this--

468
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,301
Ask her yourself.

469
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,054
If you're so innocent,
tell her yourself what happened.

470
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,978
What? Do you not want
to drag your family into this?

471
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,859
Then tell Ju-yeong
to delete that video this instant.

472
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,987
Even if Li-sa is to blame,

473
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,531
tell her that doing this
won't do her any good.

474
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,868
Teach her properly
that this was the wrong approach.

475
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,035
Excuse me!

476
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,246
Mom, it's okay.

477
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,795
Gosh.

478
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,758
What's the matter?

479
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,887
Did Ju-yeong do something?

480
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,432
Is it because
I didn't look after her properly?

481
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,314
Goodness.

482
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,126
Do you feel better now?

483
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,297
It's okay.

484
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,760
I understand why you had to go that far.

485
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,806
Nothing's going on
between the manager and me.

486
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,226
Besides, he has
a really pretty girlfriend.

487
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,352
I know.

488
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:06,065
He's been intentionally uploading more
photos of them together on social media.

489
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,445
Still, you should take down that video.

490
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,573
It won't do you any good.

491
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,413
Because it's not true.

492
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:27,419
Remember you said
Li-sa looked really cool when dancing?

493
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,800
You know that she's more than good enough

494
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,302
to attend that school.

495
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,099
I just gave her
a taste of her own medicine.

496
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,481
She's being like that
because she's obsessed with you.

497
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:53,153
You should pity her instead of hating her.

498
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,950
Don't waste your life hating someone.

499
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,205
I'm speaking from experience.

500
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,958
Don't be like me, Ju-yeong.

501
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,929
What are you guys doing, leaving me out?

502
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,267
-Here.
-What's this?

503
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,646
Here.

504
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,276
-Is it good?
-It's so tasty.

505
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,322
You better not leave me out ever again.

506
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,407
You should've called me.

507
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,908
Gosh.

508
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:41,952

The video has been removed,

521
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,133
and we shut down the anonymous forum.

522
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,635
We'll have Li-sa's grades made public

523
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,846
and put an end to this rumor.

524
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,972
It's been resolved.

525
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,307
Resolved?

526
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,644
Every time Li-sa makes
even the tiniest mistake,

527
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:36,817
they'll bring up the past
and try to tear her to pieces.

00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,195
Can we really say it's been resolved?

529
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,239
It's our job to prevent…

530
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:47,453
that from happening
and defend her even if it happens.

531
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,372
You finished it.

It looks amazing.

533
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,213
My goodness. When did they grow so big?

534
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,143
Mr. Seo, you're active
even when you're not sculpting.

535
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,605
You garnered over 100,000 subscribers
on YouTube fairly quickly.

536
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,983
You're one of the hottest artists
well-received by the public.

537
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,487
Recently, you surprised everyone
by stating that an artist

538
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,491
shouldn't be afraid of their work
being put on the market.

539
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,160
Who would you say influenced you the most?

540
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,495
I'm honored to say

541
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,539
that artist Jeong Hui-ju
was the first buyer of my work.

542
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,418
Through her, I gained confidence
that I was going down the right path.

543
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,048
How ludicrous.

544
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,679
What's done is done.
Stop them from releasing more.

545
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:50,766
Yes, ma'am.

546
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,856
Where did the feisty, old you go?

547
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:03,028
Seeing that you look so depressed,
I'm not surprised your husband cheated.

548
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,037
It wasn't easy
to get you a full-time position.

549
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:16,291
It's far from Seoul, but you'll
get support since it is an art colony.

550
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,671
Look for a house nearby
that can be used as a studio.

551
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,589
What are you doing?

552
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,677
I heard you were fired from the gallery.
Why are you throwing a pity party here?

553
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,013
Just leave.
Go live quietly and peacefully.

554
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,812
And here I thought you were
going to hand me an envelope full of cash.

555
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,106
I'm leaving.

556
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,107
Hey.

557
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,318
Hui-ju is still a member of my family.

558
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:48,198
If needed, I'll bash her or destroy her.
But I won't let others touch her.

559
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,538
When your elders do you a favor,
accept it. Don't be impudent.

560
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,048
RECOMMENDATION LETTER
NAME: GU HAE-WON

561
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,553
This isn't doing me a favor.
You're trying to send me into exile.

562
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,566
Keep an eye on her
and make sure she's not up to anything.

563
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,864
How could she be so careless
and have a photo taken of her with him?

564
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,367
You didn't know?

565
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,661
Why did you take the photo?

566
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,459
It was a meet-and-greet.

567
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,794
It was public, so anyone could come.

568
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,881
It would've looked weird had I refused.

569
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,343
You should take this more seriously.

570
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,142
He doesn't think twice
about being reckless

571
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,354
because he believes you're being swayed.

572
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,816
I'm not and I don't want to.

573
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:08,570
Don't get involved with him anymore.
Don't give him any excuses.

574
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,448
What are you saying?

575
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,826
Are you saying I should back out of--

576
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,412
Even my mom found out.
Don't you know what that means?

577
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,122
You should be lying low.

578
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,041
-But--
-He's acting out

579
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,043
because he knows you won't give it up.

580
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,921
And like everyone else,
getting rejected exasperates him.

581
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,965
Backing out of the exhibition now
will cause a huge inconvenience.

582
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,427
I don't want to ruin
Mr. Woo's last exhibition.

583
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,641
Is it that important?

584
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,227
That's not what this is about.

585
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,111
Then choose.

586
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,448
Is it your family or that bastard?

587
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,582
Honey…

588
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:45,125

Have a good day, honey.

DO NOT ENTER
COLLAPSE HAZARD

596
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,567
They've assessed the structure

597
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,819
and will begin
the reinforcement work next week.

598
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,865
This area will be
completely transformed by next year.

599
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:48,832
Why are you talking about what I already
know after calling me all the way here?

600
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,709
To cheer you on.

601
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,589
You're finally realizing the dream
you talked about down there.

602
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,136
I believe we share the same dream.

603
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,597
Many of the multiplex housing units
around here

604
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,851
were bought under
your family members' names.

605
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,270
I thought they'd be a good investment.

606
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,108
I'm going to help out as much as I can
until Taerim Art Center

607
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,735
is well established.

608
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,737
But not after that.

609
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,408
An Hyeon-seong used to be
indecisive and incompetent.

610
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:27,370
But thanks to you, he's managing
a school and even a foundation.

611
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:32,542
However, I refuse to watch him waste
the hospital's hard-earned money

612
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,879
on something so useless anymore.

613
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,592
That's up to our mother-in-law to decide.

614
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:44,012
Right.

615
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:50,101
She's an experienced businesswoman
who only believes what she sees.

616
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,939
What's the advantage
of living in a digital world?

617
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:58,026
It's that everything can be traced.

618
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,573
You'd be in a pickle
if she found out that you two

619
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,325
are still close, wouldn't you?

620
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,869
CALL LOGS

621
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,584
From now on, discuss everything with me.

622
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,379
What for?

623
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:22,133
You and I are nothing short
of unwelcome strangers to her.

624
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:28,098
I don't care what she thinks
as long as Hyeon-seong stands by my side.

625
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:34,396
Who do you think she considers
to be her successor? Him or you?

626
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,316
You must know well
since you always cater to her.

627
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,654
Threaten me all you want,

628
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,573
but you'll never be her successor.

629
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,326
So don't kid yourself.

630
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,376
What?

631
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,837
Will you hit me too?

632
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,299
Did you think I didn't know your secret?

633
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,844
You're just a coward
with an inferiority complex

634
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,555
who hits your wife.

635
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,184
Do you think she's enduring it
because she's scared?

636
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,229
Did you think someone as smart as her

637
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,606
didn't keep any evidence?

638
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,650
Don't be mistaken.

639
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,569
She's stronger than you.

640
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,697
She's not consumed by her greed like you.

641
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,074
She has a son to protect.

642
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,005
What did you say? What evidence?

643
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,507
What evidence does she have?

644
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,593
That's what you're curious about?

645
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,930
You don't deserve to be a parent,
you scumbag.

646
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,225
Why do you think

647
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,688
Hyeon-seong took
such great care of his wife's lover?

648
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:10,366
I have proof that he fixed his rental car
on the day of Woo-jae's accident.

649
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,703
What could it mean? What do you think?

650
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,879
Are you afraid of him going down?

651
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:27,175
Then tell me.
What proof does my wife have?

652
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,094
Let me go!

653
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,097
Let's be frank with each other now.

654
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,682
You and I are in the same boat.

655
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,274
Hui-ju.

656
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,319
What are you…

657
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,926
It was an accident. I…

658
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,148
What are you doing?

659
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,566
There was an accident.

660
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,360
Yes, that's the place.

661
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,740
No. It's just me.

662
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,920
He fell five stories.

663
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:35,637
He has multiple fractures, no
consciousness, and his pupils are dilated.

664
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,526
There was no need to hide it.

665
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:53,154
Once he regains consciousness,
they'll find out I was with him.

666
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,323
Why did you lie to them?

667
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:59,410
He willingly climbed up a building
that was being demolished.

668
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,663
He was the one who slipped and fell.

669
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,499
There's no lie here.

670
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,583
No.

671
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,171
I could've grabbed his hand.
I could, but--

672
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,048
I would've pushed him away anyway.

673
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:15,843
I won't let anyone harm you.

674
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,438
Hello? Yes, this is he.

675
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,234
No. I'm nearby.

676
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,489
Wait at home. I'll call you later.

677
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,716
HYEON-SEONG

678
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:03,057
What in the world happened?
Explain it to me.

679
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,519
It seems he slipped and fell
off the gallery construction site.

680
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:11,733
The police are investigating right now.
I'll go look into it.

681
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:14,819
Come in.

682
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,743
His brain pressure is too high
due to a massive hemorrhage.

683
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:25,079
We've administered mannitol
and opened up his skull.

684
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,165
Get an OR ready.

685
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,375
What if it goes wrong?
Leave it to someone else.

686
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,544
I'm the most competent doctor here.

687
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,879
That's not what I meant.

688
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,633
Due to multiple hemorrhages,
we can't operate on him immediately.

689
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,801
For now, we should monitor him to be safe.

690
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,470
I'm aware of that,

691
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:43,181
but you're saying you won't do anything!

692
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,725
Even if it's a success,
he could get paralyzed or--

693
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,061
That's why I'll operate on him.

694
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,065
Even if something happens,
I'll take responsibility.

695
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,819
Because I'm his family.

696
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:01,217
Unlike me, you don't need to wait.

697
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:04,262
You need to make the decision.

698
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,100
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

699
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,149
We have a witness.

700
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,616
How is Mr. Lee doing?

701
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,870
Why were you with him?

702
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,082
What were you two scheming?

703
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,292
Scheming?

704
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,794
I was just walking by when I saw it.

705
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,925
Is this area cursed or something?

706
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,429
Bad things happen here often.

707
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,265
You were just walking by?

708
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:54,604
All right. I'll find out for myself
about what happened.

709
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,647
I advise you not to do that.

710
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,738
You'll only put Ms. Jeong in a pickle.

711
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,407
What?

712
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,326
This was just an accident.

713
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,078
Let's keep it that way.

714
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:20,004
I'm sure it won't be that hard
since you've already done it before.

715
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,469
That's best for Hui-ju.

716
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:29,639
Mr. Seo.

717
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,517
You should be careful

718
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,394
how you address my wife.

719
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,313
I'm afraid I can't.

720
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,192
You see,

721
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,612
we still have lingering feelings.

722
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:46,280
Feelings?

723
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:48,783
What kind of feelings?

724
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,120
Are you sure it's not just you?

725
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:02,046
Lust-crazed hormones
are the only thing you're feeling.

726
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:07,051
Do you still not know why
she left you and came back to me?

727
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,720
I guess you don't remember that part.

728
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:28,197
INCORRECT PATTERN

729
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,951
SEO WOO-JAE

730
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,922
You finally picked up.
I called you many times.

731
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,386
He's still undergoing surgery.

732
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:51,679
What did…

733
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,181
the police say?

734
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,267
I'll tell you in person.

735
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,107
I can't do that.
My husband is home, so I can't--

736
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,483
Why are you lying?

737
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,279
I know he's not home right now.

738
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:14,285
Come out. Or should I go inside?

739
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,820
I need to step out for a bit.

740
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:51,739
Don't go.

741
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,827
It's late, and Dad's not home. Don't go.

742
01:05:56,911 --> 01:06:00,081
It won't take long. I'm sorry, Li-sa.

743
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,333
Mom.

744
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,062
Come inside.

745
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,492
He's still undergoing surgery.

746
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:39,787
If something goes wrong--

747
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,707
Nothing will go wrong.
Why do you think I was there?

748
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:47,753
He said there was a way
to kick you out of the family,

749
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,255
as long as I helped him.

750
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:01,142
All of our texts and calls are in here.

751
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,770
He was blackmailing you.

752
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,441
He tried to threaten you
as you ran away and slipped.

753
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,693
He brought it on himself.

754
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,784
It's better that he fell.

755
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,746
Otherwise, I would've killed him.

756
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,504
I will kill anyone

757
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,966
who dares to harm you.

758
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,026
No--

759
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,486
Stop--

760
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,272
This is wrong.

761
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,192
We shouldn't do this. This is--

762
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:37,655
No.

763
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,741
What you're doing right now…

764
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:44,870
You can't justify your actions
by saying it was all out of love.

765
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,124
You don't truly love me. Please wake up.

766
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,669
You don't love me. Wake up!

767
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:53,420
Who are you to judge my feelings?

768
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,423
I still love you.

769
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,637
No, you don't!

770
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,722
You're just upset that I rejected you!

771
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,933
You're just desperate!

772
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:09,562
You're mistaking it for love!

773
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,106
This is wrong!

774
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,152
No, Woo-jae! This isn't love.

775
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,947
Please stop it. This is wrong.

776
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:22,199
This is wrong, Woo-jae!

777
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,033
Did you go somewhere this late at night?

778
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,577
What is going on?

779
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,295
Do you trust your husband?

780
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:41,922
He's a man, after all.

781
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:44,216
You don't think he can't cheat too?

782
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,013
What have you done to him?

783
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:07,740
EPISODE 14
DID NOT LOVE ANYONE

784
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,816
Do you know why betrayal is so cruel?

785
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,527
You met my mom, didn't you? Why?

786
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:46,737
You really don't know?

787
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,116
Let's end this quickly.
You'll be better off that way.

788
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,744
I also had a chance
to become a mother once.

789
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:56,330
If you were worried,
you should've gone right away.

790
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,082
That's a lie!

791
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,503
You can't escape from me.

792
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:03,754
That's enough!

793
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:05,964
Those two left with each other again.

794
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,759
Lies. Don't lie to me!

795
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,844
My story…

796
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,058
ends here.

797
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,060
What a dull ending.

798
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:21,146
Isn't it?

799
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:28,570
