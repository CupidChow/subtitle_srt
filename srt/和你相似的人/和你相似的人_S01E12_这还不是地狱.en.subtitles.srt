1
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,412
Were you…

2
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,958
with Woo-jae?

3
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,715
Are you back together with Woo-jae?
Is that it?

4
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,264
Just say something.

5
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,687
What should I say?

6
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,067
If I said I'd been here all night,

7
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,070
would you believe me?

8
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,201
Say something. Anything at all.

9
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:04,624
Or should I ask when you found out
and how much you know?

10
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,752
And despite knowing it all,

11
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,005
how were you able to treat me
no different from before?

12
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,259
Should I ask
what your true intentions are?

13
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,721
Make an excuse at least.

14
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:29,482
I can neither lie nor make an excuse.

15
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,740
I choose to say what I must
rather than what I want to say.

16
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,494
I know I was wrong.

17
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,624
I can't be so shameless.

18
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,089
It was foolish of me.

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,052
I did something utterly terrible.

20
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,822
It's all my fault.

21
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,992
I'm the reason why
Hae-won kept following me

22
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,412
and pestered you.

23
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:30,793
I'm the reason why
she approached Li-sa and Ho-su.

24
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,092
I'm to blame.

25
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,012
It's all my fault.

26
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,640
I ruined everything.

27
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,353
Why did you do it?

28
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,522
It was a mistake.

29
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,319
Saying anything else would be an excuse.

30
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,071
There was no reason.

31
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,368
I've been atoning for what I did
to you and our kids.

32
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,495
I regret it.

33
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,289
I regret it every single day.

34
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,834
I know that won't change anything,

35
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,587
but please know this.

36
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,216
If I could turn back time,
I'd do it at all costs.

37
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,225
I know it's impossible to forgive me.
I would've felt the same.

38
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,073
I'll do as you say.

39
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,204
If you can't stand being around me,

40
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,249
I'll leave.

41
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,099
Are you alone? No one else came?

42
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,352
Like who?

43
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,234
Have you been here all day?

44
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,947
I asked you a question.

45
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,034
But you already know the answer.

46
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,748
Why did you go to the hospital today?

47
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,000
You didn't have an appointment.

48
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,881
Did you meet with Hui-ju?

49
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,430
What do you want me to do?

50
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,974
Do you want me to break up with you?

51
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,018
Is that it?

52
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,854
If it was that easy,
you should've done it sooner.

53
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,941
You've had many chances.

54
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,070
Before registering our marriage
seven years ago,

55
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,738
or before our wedding.

56
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,785
But now, you say it
as if you're doing me a favor.

57
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,788
You should've died back then.

58
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,543
Then I wouldn't have resented you so much.

59
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,926
But then again,

60
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,346
you're not really who you used to be.

61
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,682
You're as good as dead to me.

62
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,769
I'm going to remember

63
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,355
how I wronged you.

64
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,734
And I'll ask
for your forgiveness until you finally do.

65
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,911
It pains me that I can't even remember
what I need to apologize for.

66
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,709
Watching you break down because of me…

67
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,171
is torturous.

68
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,841
Good.

69
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:11,305
That's exactly why
I'm keeping both of you close.

70
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,773
RICE & BAR

71
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,866
When did you get here? He's waiting--

72
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,242
He left.

73
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,412
He did?

74
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,205
Gosh.

75
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,666
He ordered a drink

76
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,253
and sat there for five hours straight.

77
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,423
What an annoying customer.

78
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,593
I'll drink twice as much next time.

79
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,557
You look like you want a drink now.

80
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,976
Is it that obvious?

81
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,066
It doesn't feel so great

82
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,611
to be someone whose existence…

83
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,323
is torturous to another.

84
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,828
I'm sure my grandpa didn't raise me
to become someone like this.

85
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,581
You don't feel that great,
and the other is in pain.

86
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,500
So why bother doing it?

87
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,671
I can't help this rage inside me.

88
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,641
Then relieve it like this.
Why let it grow?

89
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,101
There's no cure for that.

90
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,691
I'm so pathetic.

91
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,694
How did I turn out like this?

92
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,030
Don't you ever get mad at yourself

93
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,533
or another person.

94
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,162
It'll just eat away at yourself.

95
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,707
I'm speaking from experience.

96
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:32,321
If you can't stand
being around me, I'll leave.

97
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,518
Please give me a bit of time.

98
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,232
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,944
I really am.

100
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,633
I wouldn't have looked all over for you
if I wanted to end things.

101
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,893
You and our family
are all that I've ever fought for.

102
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,023
And I'll never give that up.

103
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,486
Don't you ever…

104
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,748
leave my side again.

105
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:18,214
EPISODE 12
NOT HELL YET

106
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:26,764
Something about the foundation's funding
for Mr. Seo's hospital bills

107
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,140
seems a bit odd.

108
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,852
What do you mean?

109
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,688
Around the time of Mr. Seo's accident,

110
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,982
Hyeon-seong was in Ireland too.

111
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:44,448
It was confirmed that Hui-ju
had attended an art fair at that time.

112
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,784
But we don't know where Hyeon-seong was.

113
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,703
In my opinion--

114
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,206
I don't pay you to give me your opinions.

115
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,751
Just provide me
with the information I want.

116
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,337
How dare you track my son?

117
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,590
We shouldn't rule out
the possibility of an issue--

118
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,970
Having issues isn't the problem.
It's about whether it's fixable or not.

119
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,892
I'm not paying you for nothing.
Just do what I tell you.

120
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,861
They've all been compensated,

121
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,323
and we've given them
more time to move out.

122
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,327
The demolition can begin right away
since there are no residents.

123
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,996
We've also announced

124
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,666
the bidding of the supervision service
for the renovation.

125
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,503
Has Lee Ju-yeong come to school yet?

126
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,298
She's been absent
ever since the incident with her father.

127
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,884
-Should I contact her through her teacher?
-It's okay.

128
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,427
If she continues not to attend,

129
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,596
take her out of the roll
with a grace period.

130
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,265
-You may leave.
-Sir.

131
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,811
Mr. Lee Hyeong-gi has been acting strange.

132
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,399
He's digging into the accident in Ireland.

133
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,115
Should we be concerned about him?

134
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,826
No, sir.

135
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,078
I don't care if he digs into it,

136
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,124
but I'd like to know why he is.

137
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,417
Yes, sir.

138
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,743
I read about contempt

139
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,579
in a book once.

140
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,666
The one who feels it

141
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,252
is subjected to unbelievable pain.

142
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,007
But the one who causes it
doesn't even show changes in their brain.

143
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,678
No wonder they can keep doing it.

144
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,641
Does it hurt?

145
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,310
I was pretty hurt too.

146
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,942
Since we're family,
we should share our pain.

147
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,111
NEUROSURGERY OFFICE
DR. AN MIN-SEO

148
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,128
You're here too.

149
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,880
I was just about to leave.

150
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,641
What is it?
You didn't say you were coming.

151
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,977
I came for Ho-su's therapy

152
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,187
and thought I'd stop by and say hi.

153
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,481
I don't think we're that close.

154
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,317
Leave. I have to tend to my patients.

155
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,452
Why would someone
as bright as you put up with it?

156
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,372
What do you even know?

157
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,499
Since you put up with it, he keeps--

158
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,876
Keeps what?

159
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,383
Keeps putting his hands on you.

160
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,305
That's none of your business.

161
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,726
-But--
-I put up with it because I can.

162
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,478
That's the only issue we have.

163
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,730
And that will become a problem one day.

164
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,483
Don't lecture me.
You even failed to keep your son safe.

165
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,609
Min-seo.

166
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,903
My husband knows that he's wrong,

167
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,073
so he treats me well most of the time.

168
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,035
He's not actually sorry.
He's just worried that you'll leave him.

169
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,872
You know that he's just a coward.

170
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,831
I do.

171
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:07,294
I'm enduring it
because people are all garbage anyway.

172
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,174
Your husband is no different.

173
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,136
Don't stick your nose in my affairs.

174
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,430
I'm only doing this because we're family.

175
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,767
Family?

176
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,230
I'm afraid you're gravely mistaken.

177
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,484
If you and Hyeon-seong get a divorce,
you and I are pretty much strangers.

178
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,947
Don't be so cocky
thinking you have something on me.

179
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,989
Get out.

180
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,132
I never thought of it like that.

181
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,843
I was just worried.

182
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,460
Was it Ms. Gu?

183
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,052
I doubt you did this
out of loyalty. So why?

184
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,431
Did she promise
to give you money if you served some time?

185
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,317
And did you believe that?

186
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,613
The school will have no problem
carrying out the construction.

187
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,406
Now,

188
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,159
what do you think you'll get?

189
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,870
The compensation?

190
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,290
Do you think you'll get any?

191
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,711
Do you still not get it?

192
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,422
She…

193
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,550
used you.

194
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,352
Sit down.

195
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,896
Sit down and listen to me.

196
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,491
JINI BANK

197
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,368
The compensation fee is in there.

198
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,119
Since your father has bad credit,

199
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,872
it was wise of him
to open a bank account in your name.

200
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,127
You'll only be able to withdraw a small
amount every month for living expenses.

201
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,506
Once you become an adult,
you can do whatever you want with it.

202
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:04,388
It must be impossible for me to go
to Taerim High School of Arts now, right?

203
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,806
There are many other schools.

204
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:10,143
There's no reason for you to go
there and endure people's glares.

205
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,188
Do you think Li-sa

206
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:18,110
has already told everyone
about what my dad did?

207
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,319
What if she has?

208
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,030
Will you continue not going to school?

209
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,118
If you don't graduate, it's your loss.

210
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:30,539
Ignore the others. Don't miss
the opportunity in front of you.

211
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,042
Opportunities don't come twice.

212
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,134
Can we meet if you're free?

213
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,343
Let's have some coffee.

214
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,053
Is anything wrong?

215
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,814
DELETE

216
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,190
DELETE MESSAGES?

217
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,196
I wondered why you had become so lax.

218
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,911
I signed you up with that volunteer
recruitment for ex-convicts.

219
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,455
We'll begin this weekend.

220
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,168
You need to set an example for them.

221
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,713
They should know that even if they sin,

222
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,382
they can turn over a new leaf
as long as they live on.

223
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,886
Aren't you tired of it?

224
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,307
You should just hate me.

225
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,602
I know you don't want me
to ask you for forgiveness, but--

226
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,271
Don't be ridiculous.

227
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,067
I've already forgiven you, Seon-u.

228
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,404
It's my calling to protect you

229
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,656
and guide you in the right direction,

230
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,286
so you'll never forget what you did
and repeat the same mistake ever again.

231
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,587
For my dear Jeong-seop
who has passed away,

232
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,216
you just need to do as I say.

233
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,262
Okay?

234
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,311
Okay.

235
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,776
See you this weekend.

236
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,307
What are you doing?

237
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,770
INCHEON TO DUBLIN

238
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,438
Why did you look this up?

239
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,734
Running away again?

240
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,320
No. I want to find the old me.

241
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,991
And once I do,
I'm going to ask you for forgiveness.

242
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,204
I should try everything I can.

243
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,478
Aren't you coming to bed?

244
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,692
I'm bombarded with work.

245
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,238
The new staff management system
is so different.

246
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,073
It's a completely new system.

247
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,867
Go to bed first.

248
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,251
I went to the hospital today.

249
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:10,508
And Seon-u asked
if everything was okay between us.

250
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,600
He called me this afternoon.

251
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,144
-He did?
-He asked me to take care of you

252
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,146
since Ho-su's incident
must've shocked you.

253
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,067
"My sister was forced
to grow up at a young age,

254
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,194
so she never asks for any help."

255
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:33,073
He told me to cut you some slack
even if you make a mistake.

256
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,703
What's gotten into him today?

257
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,997
What's so bad
about his worrying about you?

258
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,375
I'm glad that he's my brother-in-law.

259
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,294
Compared to you two,

260
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,466
my sister and I are like strangers.

261
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,931
You should be more attentive to her.

262
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,518
She seems to be
going through a tough time.

263
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,728
She makes life difficult for herself.

264
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,481
That's who she is.

265
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,277
She's been like our father
ever since she was young.

266
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,445
But our father wasn't respected at home.

267
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,447
So, to my mother and me…

268
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,703
No. She always strives to look perfect in
others' eyes and only cares about herself.

269
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,663
But still--

270
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,291
She's hypnotized herself.
She listens to no one.

271
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:38,763
Hui-ju.

272
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,640
Yes?

273
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,352
Don't walk on eggshells
around me. It's not like you.

274
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,941
I believed you
when you said you regretted it.

275
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,655
Tell your brother
that we're completely fine.

276
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,450
That things are great as ever.

277
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,501
Thank you.

278
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,552
Right. Spare me some time tomorrow.

279
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,482
Did you make a reservation?

280
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,692
Yes. Under An Hyeon-seong.

281
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,486
I see. I'll show you to your seat.

282
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,030
Is she with you?

283
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,204
Did Ms. Lee invite you too?

284
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,932
Is Ms. Lee not coming? I thought she was.

285
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,893
I knew you'd feel uncomfortable
if we invited you,

286
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,436
so I asked for her help.

287
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,271
She's not to blame.

288
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,733
I wanted to treat you as a thank-you
for bringing Ho-su back to us.

289
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,406
-The usual, please.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,953
This brandy is
from our restaurant owner's collection.

291
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,664
I was told to serve you this
the next time you came.

292
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,897
It's venison. Their signature dish.

293
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,735
We come here every now and then
because the owner likes Hui-ju's work.

294
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,069
Try it.

295
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,991
It's all thanks to you two
that I've made it this far.

296
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,038
You told me
that being consistent was more important

297
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,332
than my age, and you were right.

298
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,503
At times, perseverance beats talent.

299
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,092
I truly believed
you would become a great artist.

300
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,969
If only you didn't quit midway.

301
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,596
She didn't quit.

302
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,807
She's just taking a break because of me.

303
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,809
She didn't quit painting.

304
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,897
Is that so? I'm curious about your work.

305
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,693
I'm sure you've seen her early work.

306
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:43,114
I imitated her work
in the beginning because I liked it.

307
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,660
I was pretty good at expressing
destruction and deterioration

308
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,537
through my paintings.

309
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,637
This glass is from our trips.

310
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,264
You remember it. It's your favorite.

311
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,558
Thank you.

312
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,230
What was the name
of this black mushroom again?

313
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:19,025
You told me that
when we were on our trip to Provence

314
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,236
Trompette de la mort.

315
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,531
I barely recognize the name.

316
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,616
"The trumpet of the dead."

317
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,078
Since the mushrooms look like trumpets.

318
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,331
But shouldn't it be the other way around?

319
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,333
I'm not sure.

320
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,597
Why bother treating me
when you want to rip me to shreds?

321
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,811
This was my husband's idea.
I still don't trust you.

322
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:59,357
There may be no proof,
but I know that you egged Mr. Lee on.

323
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,361
Then what is this? Are you fattening
me up before the slaughter?

324
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,782
You said watching my downfall
was your definition of revenge.

325
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,121
You and I have
very different definitions of revenge.

326
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,501
Because I'm going
to show you how happy I am.

327
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,922
Are you sure you're happy?

328
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,967
You looked very uncomfortable.

329
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,637
Sitting there like a trophy wife.

330
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,973
You once told me

331
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,686
that marriage is the only chance
to dramatically turn one's life around.

332
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:43,359
Well… Looking at you,
I can't say you're wrong.

333
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,157
But it's pathetic
that the transformation isn't that great.

334
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,118
You're like a shackled slave

335
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,662
who's greatly mistaken
and thinks she's the owner.

336
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,041
You seem a bit pitiful.

337
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:05,548
That's rich coming from someone who's
dedicated her entire life to stalking me.

338
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,345
I almost pitied you there.

339
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,514
Thank you for saying that.

340
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,016
That photo you sent me.

341
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,227
You wanted to know who saw it, right?

342
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,856
It was my husband.

343
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,737
We talked it out all thanks to you.

344
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,073
Thank you.

345
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:05,316
I was surprised to hear
that you had majored in theatre,

346
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,277
but your poker face was remarkable.

347
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,367
They seem to be taking their time.

348
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,955
Are you sure
you don't want to check up on them?

349
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,459
I've forgiven my wife for what she did.

350
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,714
So don't try to bring her down
with her past…

351
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,215
No.

352
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,428
Don't even think
about approaching my family.

353
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,304
But I haven't forgiven her.

354
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,516
So why must I do that?

355
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,476
You're a smart person.

356
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,481
I'm warning you because
I could pay you back tenfold.

357
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,744
Are you okay?

358
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,330
You don't look too good.

359
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,919
Go first. I don't want
to cause any misunderstanding.

360
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,466
Okay.

361
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,641
What if I kill her?

362
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,188
How will you pay me back tenfold?

363
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,149
Will you dig me out of my grave
and chop me into pieces?

364
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,742
Thank you for dinner.

365
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,495
-Anytime.
-No.

366
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,747
I'm not comfortable
with this kind of gathering.

367
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,208
We'll get going then.

368
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,335
Let's go.

369
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,568
I wonder if that dinner was necessary.

370
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,738
I wanted to show them…

371
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,826
that we were doing just fine.

372
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,502
Thank you. And I'm sorry.

373
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,913
Go sleep inside. I'll sleep here.

374
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,335
They looked happy, didn't they?

375
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,301
What makes us so different?

376
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,390
Seeing her reminded me

377
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,935
of how much I wanted to be like her.

378
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,902
One of the people I'm supposed to despise

379
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,280
is someone I admired so much.

380
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:46,370
And the other one is
someone I loved dearly.

381
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:56,130
Don't you feel bad
that I have to hate both of them?

382
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,916
-Want to go? Take it.
-Send it right now.

383
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,084
She's here.

384
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,963
What took her so long?
I can't believe her.

385
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,506
What are you doing?

386
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,800
Stop laughing, Na-yeon.

387
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,301
When did I ever?

388
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,137
-It reeks.
-I want to go out.

389
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,723
-What?
-Let's open the windows.

390
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,016
Let's do that.

391
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,312
-What is that?
-It stinks.

392
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,815
-Li-sa, where are you going?
-The restroom.

393
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,735
-Hey.
-Look at her.

394
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,655
She's even throwing away
her textbooks. Shitty attitude.

395
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,629
You didn't text me back,
so I decided to just come here.

396
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,589
I'm sorry.

397
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,175
My sister

398
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,470
was like a mom to me.

399
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,808
I was born into a poor family.

400
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,520
Since everyone else was poor,
I had no aspirations.

401
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,775
I'm only able to live like this
thanks to my sister.

402
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,780
My sister never got
what she wanted before getting married.

403
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:48,451
She had to support our mom and me.
The only dream she had

404
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,871
was to live in a house
that had an indoor toilet.

405
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,210
Then she met Hyeon-seong.

406
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,047
A sudden luxurious lifestyle
must've flustered her.

407
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,092
She must've felt lost.

408
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:09,555
It was probably a mistake
she made out of loneliness.

409
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,432
What are you doing?

410
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,479
It's different for her now.
Her family is all that she has.

411
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,981
She will never
get back together with Woo-jae.

412
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,318
It could be a misunderstanding.

413
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,528
Hui-ju is so blessed.

414
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,157
She has a brother who defends her

415
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,078
and a husband
who forgave her for having an affair.

416
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,455
And now you want me to suppress my anger?

417
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,127
How are you all so cruel?

418
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,255
I'm sorry.

419
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,133
How disgusting.

420
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,928
Let me apologize on her behalf.

421
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,475
I can't fathom how much pain
you felt from their betrayal.

422
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,811
But Hui-ju

423
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,648
will never make the same mistake, so…

424
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,552
SEO WOO-JAE

425
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,659
JEONG HUI-JU

426
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,706
Hello?

427
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,626
Hello?

428
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,087
It's me, Woo-jae.

429
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,381
What is it?

430
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:16,265
I'll send my rough draft
for the project to Ms. Lee.

431
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,854
Right. I'll share mine too once I'm done.

432
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,607
-Goodbye.
-Don't hang up.

433
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:31,322
You didn't answer me the other day,
so let me ask you one last time.

434
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,411
I left Hae-won and flew to Ireland

435
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,872
because of you.

436
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,087
And it seems to me that you let me
stay with you for the time being.

437
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,132
Am I right?

438
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,141
Seeing how I left without telling her,

439
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,269
I must have planned to return.

440
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,189
So why did I stay in Ireland all alone?

441
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,741
I don't know.

442
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,994
Then…

443
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,291
why did we break up?

444
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,233
The reason why we broke up…

445
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,446
No. The reason why I abandoned you…

446
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,041
Mom, isn't this pretty?

447
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,587
Mom, look at this.

448
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,630
Li-sa, stay here.

449
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,158
How could you come here?

450
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,826
Are you nuts?

451
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,287
Anyone would go nuts in my shoes.

452
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,835
Don't do this. Go home.

453
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,338
Wait for me back home. Okay?

454
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,093
-Don't go.
-Woo-jae, don't do this.

455
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:02,014
I have no choice right now.
Why are you doing this to me?

456
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,641
Then take me with you.

457
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,436
Take you where? There?

458
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,022
Go home and wait for me.

459
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,025
Woo-jae!

460
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:17,112
Woo-jae, why are you doing this?
Please don't do this!

461
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,947
Don't leave me.

462
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:24,036
Please, Woo-jae.
Go wait at home. I'm sorry.

463
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,800
Did you sleep with him?

464
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,011
-What?
-Did you sleep with that bastard?

465
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,458
Did you sleep with that bastard? Tell me!

466
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,627
Do you still love him?

467
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,755
Answer me!

468
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,971
I hated your recklessness.

469
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,425
What are you doing?

470
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,886
I wanted a drink too.

471
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,349
Go somewhere else. I don't want to--

472
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,642
I came to drink together.

473
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,602
Why?

474
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,063
You seemed lonely.

475
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,982
Who? Me?

476
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,109
Yes. That's what I see.

477
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,947
At a brunch cafe in broad daylight…

478
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,785
Did you think no one would notice it here?

479
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,996
So you caught me. Now leave.

480
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,543
Excuse me. One beer, please.

481
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,507
But I also

482
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,261
liked that recklessness of yours.

483
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,654
I may have forgotten many things.

484
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,532
But I still remember
how beautiful your art was

485
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,911
and how incredible you were as a painter.

486
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,207
Done.

487
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,877
Take a look. What do you think?

488
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,467
Is it bad? Is it?

489
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,470
-I like it.
-Really?

490
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,849
In that case…

491
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,482
What does that mean?

492
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,860
"Hae" meaning "ocean"
and "Won" meaning "abundance."

493
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,531
My grandpa named me so
so that I'd be thoughtful and well-off.

494
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,161
I'll come back.

495
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,998
No matter how painful the memories are,

496
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,876
I'll recover them.

497
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,676
HAE-WON

498
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,194
These are just a few body parts,

499
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,114
but they look more dynamic
and intense than his previous work.

500
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,909
I guess working hard at his studio
for days on end paid off.

501
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,246
Once they're made into molds,
they'll be even better.

502
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,959
Gosh, I lost track of time.

503
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,547
You should go.
I'll contact Mr. Seo myself.

504
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,132
He's not in Korea right now.

505
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,259
He's not? Then where is he?

506
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,720
In Ireland.

507
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:18,557
I trust that he'll finish up
the rest of his pieces,

508
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,058
but why all of a sudden?

509
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,687
He wants to retrieve his memories.

510
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,982
I understand. He must be so frustrated.

511
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,567
Yes.

512
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:33,071
He promised to recover the memories
no matter how painful they may be.

513
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,158
I'll just have to wait.

514
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,718
IRELAND

515
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,044
LET'S TAKE A RAIN CHECK. I'M BUSY TODAY.

516
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,796
HONEY, CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE FREE.

517
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,672
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

518
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:38,804
Excuse me.

519
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,515
Don't sleep here. Go sleep at home.

520
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,684
Jeong-yeon?

521
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:46,853
Jeong-yeon?

522
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,816
Did you call me?

523
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,736
Did you just call my name?

524
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,571
Yes.

525
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,365
Jeong-yeon.

526
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,034
Gu Jeong-yeon, right?

527
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,662
Come on.

528
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,457
Why would you be calling my name?

529
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,584
Sorry?

530
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,384
"Call my name

531
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,886
as I have called hers."

532
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:25,976
"I will go to you and become your flower."

533
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:33,233
It was my favorite poem
back in high school.

534
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:42,200
What is it, Mr. Yoon?
Why did you call my name?

535
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:47,372
What's so special about calling your name?
Isn't that what names are for?

536
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,291
Then say it again.

537
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,377
"Jeong-yeon."

538
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,006
Call me even more tenderly.

539
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,716
You're creeping me out.

540
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,677
This is strange.

541
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,305
Why do you look handsome?

542
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:07,267
What? Why don't you look ugly anymore?

543
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,730
I must have gone nuts.

544
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,274
You're just drunk.

545
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,861
I'm fine. I'm good.

546
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,864
I'm not leaving.

547
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,033
I'm going to stay here with him.

548
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,120
NEW LUXURIOUS TOWNHOUSES

549
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,999
Why keep these at home
when Ju-yeong is there?

550
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,045
Is this where you spent your deposit?

551
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,340
This is so frustrating. You never learn.

552
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:41,301
Do you really not know?
Or are you purposely--

553
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,218
Ms. Gu.

554
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,097
Have you eaten yet?
I made some beef stew yesterday.

555
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,224
-I'm not hungry.
-Have some first.

556
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,352
If you're still mad afterward,
then get mad.

557
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,105
If you get upset with someone,

558
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:57,025
eat and take a nap.
Then you will feel better.

559
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:01,196
We tend to feel irritable
not because of what they did

560
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,948
but because we're tired.

561
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,290
God…

562
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,668
How is it that you know everything?

563
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,128
See?

564
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,798
Why did you take it out on me?

565
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,341
Right?

566
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,468
-How dare you?
-Jeong-yeon.

567
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,261
Okay.

568
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,020
Goodness.

569
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,778
We shouldn't send him
to kindergarten for now.

570
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,572
The teachers don't look
comfortable either.

571
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,490
Change schools.

572
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,661
Better yet, hire a private tutor
who'll teach him English

573
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,287
so he can go abroad next year.

574
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,289
Where's Hui-ju?

575
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,459
Li-sa's dance exam is today. She's there.

576
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,169
Replace her too if you can.

577
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,462
Mom.

578
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,382
There are many women who can
replace her as a mother, a wife,

579
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,301
and especially my daughter-in-law.

580
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,470
Ho-su might hear you. Watch what you say.

581
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,099
One should be most calculating
when choosing whom to marry.

582
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,268
I only said yes
since you vehemently refused

583
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,104
to marry anyone else
or have kids if it wasn't with her.

584
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,691
You take after me, but you got
your taste in women from your dad.

585
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,652
Can you please…

586
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,613
Please.

587
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:30,410
It's been over a decade, and Hui-ju is
the mother of your grandchildren.

588
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,328
Yet you still treat her with contempt.

589
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,248
What would that make
this life I've chosen to lead?

590
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,292
You can start afresh. What's the problem?

591
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,795
You're still young.
Why let her wrap you around her finger?

592
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,550
Because I love her.

593
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,179
I love her more than

594
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,639
she loves me.

595
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,349
You lunatic.

596
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,812
That's exactly why
I told you to be more calculating.

597
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,568
In a relationship,
one side is bound to love the other more.

598
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:07,781
It's impossible for the feeling
to be exactly mutual.

599
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,909
So why does she have
the upper hand? You lack nothing!

600
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,371
-Hey.
-Grandma.

601
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,749
Ho-su, it's okay.

602
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,709
Sleep more.

603
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,298
He's a saint. He truly is.

604
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,723
He's seriously

605
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,519
forgiven you for everything?
Is that even possible?

606
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:40,814
I don't know either.

607
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,483
Is it really possible?

608
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:51,616
He must only have doubts and no proof.
Then it's possible.

609
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,910
Nowadays, it's not easy to forgive

610
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:57,372
because proof is left
on all of our devices.

611
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:15,849
Gosh, Hui-ju. You are truly blessed
with a wonderful husband.

612
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,268
Hey, this is the epitome of true love.

613
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,062
I envy you.

614
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,941
I should be a better wife.

615
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,865
How is Ho-su doing?

616
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,954
Crazy bastards who mess with children
should get the death penalty.

617
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:43,209
I think this is the punishment I get
for doing what I did in the past.

618
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,254
Don't you say that out loud.
You need to be shameless.

619
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:50,258
In-laws blame the mom first
if anything happens to her kid.

620
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,511
And your mother-in-law
is the chief director? Good grief.

621
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:57,557
She's always been eager to kick me out,

622
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,102
even before this incident happened.

623
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,691
But she won't allow it
if I demand a divorce.

624
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,986
-Why not?
-I can only leave

625
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,655
if they kick me out
for something I've done.

626
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,699
I have no freedom of choice.

627
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:20,246
How could someone like her
give birth to your husband?

628
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:26,920
What about you?
How did it go with that guy?

629
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,171
Thought you'd never ask.

630
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,216
It's over! Damn it.

631
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:37,388
You should never rekindle an old flame.
The breakup just gets messier.

632
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,307
And I caused that.

633
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,228
I feel too terrible
to even say that I'm sorry.

634
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:47,065
Even friends need
to benefit from each other.

635
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,691
But I'm always the one

636
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:53,655
crying on your shoulder.
You must be sick of me.

637
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,200
I can't say that I'm not.

638
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,036
But I'll allow it if it's you.

639
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,997
Why?

640
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,250
Don't you remember?

641
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,086
We're both crazy bitches.

642
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,277
Did you hear?

643
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,575
You know, about the old man in room 305.

644
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,159
Are the rumors true?

645
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,579
I heard she gives him handjobs for money.

646
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,247
What a crazy bitch.

647
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,083
She's no different from a prostitute.

648
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,128
Shouldn't we report this
to the higher-ups?

649
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,338
I heard Dong-mi has done it
numerous times.

650
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,507
The patient on the fifth floor…

651
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,933
What's so bad about that?

652
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,936
He's alive
and has urges like everyone else.

653
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,355
Imagine his suffering.

654
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:13,359
What's so bad about relieving that?

655
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,740
She's also a crazy bitch.

656
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,244
No one in this hospital is normal.
They're all crazy.

657
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,370
Let's go.

658
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,958
A crazy bitch?

659
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,419
You're right. I remember.

660
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,678
Even after I inherited
this fishing spot from that old man

661
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,181
and went through
that nasty feud with his children,

662
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,390
only you defended me.

663
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,393
You said I deserved this place

664
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,563
since I stayed by his side
until the very end, unlike his children.

665
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:54,150
So you own a big share of this place.

666
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:59,864
Feel free to come here whenever you wish
as long as I own this place.

667
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,498
Yes. Hello.

668
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,541
Yes.

669
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,252
Really?

670
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,297
I see. Thank you.

671
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,718
Li-sa passed with flying colors.
At least that's over with.

672
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,305
You're so elated.

673
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,686
Did you do well on the exam?

674
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,480
Of course. But shouldn't you
be apologizing to me first?

675
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,025
I'm sorry that my dad
is a horrible person.

676
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,611
We've cut ties, though.

677
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,740
Do you really not see him anymore?
Is that possible?

678
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,701
Yes.

679
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,871
I'm better off without him.

680
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,165
I guess.

681
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,209
LEE JU-YEONG
HAS SENT A VIDEO

682
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,923
LEE JU-YEONG

683
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,758
I don't need these anymore.

684
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,386
I'm not going to Taerim.

685
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:05,847
I'm…

686
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,726
going here instead.

687
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,523
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM

688
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,191
The dormitory is excellent.

689
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,736
I'll stay at Ms. Gu's
or her mother's during breaks.

690
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,863
What? When did this happen?

691
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,823
You saw how they all bullied me.

692
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,368
I'll be bullied
if I attend Taerim since you'll be there.

693
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,580
I can always make new friends.

694
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:33,750
Once I graduate, I'll move out
with the money from your dad.

695
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,961
Their visual production department
got many awards.

696
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,880
Many of the students became successful.

697
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,506
This school is much better for me.

698
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,679
-Hey.
-Hi.

699
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,514
I have plans.

700
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,850
This is my treat.

701
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,062
You're early.

702
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,814
I am. Did we have many customers?

703
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,437
Mr. Seo departed for Ireland
yesterday morning.

704
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:49,654
"Jeong"?

705
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,908
As in Ms. Jeong?

706
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,046
Again?

707
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,799
I can't pass up on stout.

708
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:16,305
We'll get one of this,
two glasses of stout,

709
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:21,560
and extra soda bread. Then we're good.

710
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,813
Okay.

711
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,999
When the beer is served,

712
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,877
drink it first before the food comes out.

713
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,754
-Beer first?
-Yes. Slowly.

714
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,257
After that, have the clam chowder.

715
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,552
And don't stuff your face
with the soda bread. Just dip it.

716
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,929
Then you'll slowly get full.

717
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,641
Then no one will know that we're broke.

718
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,282
I told you it'd be enough.

719
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,005
-Slowly?
-Yes.

720
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,474
Eat slowly.

721
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:00,659
Are you okay?

722
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:03,120
Did you get hurt?

723
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:04,997
Let me see.

724
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,752
What's wrong? I heard you did well today.

725
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:12,546
You met up with a friend too.
What's the matter?

726
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,840
Since when did you care?

727
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,051
Do you even care about me?

728
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:22,473
Li-sa, how could you say that?

729
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:23,766
I'm just--

730
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,353
Why would you-- Li-sa!

731
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:32,233
Gosh.

732
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,362
Why aren't you here yet?

733
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,405
Are you going to keep me waiting?

734
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:41,867
Of course not. I'm on my way now, Mother.

735
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,453
Did Ho-su take his medication?

736
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,878
I saw that the compensation
was sent to Ju-yeong's account.

737
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,631
Thank you.

738
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:59,135
I didn't do it to hear that from you.

739
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,304
You once asked

740
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:06,058
if Woo-jae was hospitalized
in Sligo General Hospital.

741
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,186
He was.

742
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:13,941
But unlike what you know,
it wasn't just because of the accident.

743
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:19,613
I heard Ho-su was born in that hospital.

744
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,033
I heard it was very tough

745
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:26,078
for Hui-ju to give birth to him alone
far away from home.

746
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:31,500
But do you believe that?

747
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,263
You should check it.

748
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,475
I'm also curious whose name was written

749
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:50,895
as her guardian.

750
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:33,270
Ho-su.

751
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,150
Open your mouth.

752
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,500
Let's go to the Cliffs of Moher.

753
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:45,671
When we look at something so beautiful,

754
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,924
we'll want to live.

755
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,345
Standing way up there,

756
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,265
who would you think of?

757
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:23,792
I can't do this anymore.

758
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,210
Did I

759
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,421
have feelings for you?

760
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,386
Do you remember?

761
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:40,350
I don't think there's any need
to try to remember what's already past.

762
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,520
If you don't remember it,
then it's never happened.

763
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:02,080
Hui-ju.

764
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:07,377
Jeong Hui-ju.

765
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:13,050
Jeong Hui-ju!

766
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:59,680
I'm going to get back
everything that I lost.

767
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:01,098
Ho-su's my son.

768
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:03,016
You remember.

769
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,602
Ho-su is my son.

770
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:08,063
I let her in because I needed a grandson!

771
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,902
Is it clear to you now
who Ho-su's father is?

772
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:17,656
-Did Mr. Seo get his memories back?
-Jeong Hui-ju!

773
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:20,701
You have no idea
how passionate Hui-ju can be.

774
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,411
You will never get to know.

775
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,707
You said you loved him, didn't you?

776
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,917
Come back to me.

777
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,545
I won't let you run off this time.

778
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:38,468
