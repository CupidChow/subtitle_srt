1
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,950
I hurt Li-sa. I'm truly sorry.

2
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,660
Hannah.

3
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,454
You remember.

4
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,418
Hui-ju. It's really been a long time.

5
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,176
You're right.
It has nothing to do with that incident.

6
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,390
She didn't…

7
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,019
come here to apologize.

8
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:07,585
EPISODE 2
YOUR NAME IS

9
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,517
I guess I was of help to you.

10
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:31,192
But then again, you're likely to
create new things if you keep imitating.

11
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,739
After all, that was how art first started.

12
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,099
Gone?

13
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,477
How can an unconscious man disappear?

14
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,564
The nurse said a woman named Hannah
came with papers and requested

15
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,816
the hospital to discharge him.

16
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,736
Hannah?

17
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,780
Yes. Only family members
are allowed to discharge the patients,

18
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,782
and she submitted the papers.

19
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,534
He has a family?

20
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,077
I'll look into it.

21
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,623
The John Doe's name was Seo Woo-jae.

22
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,170
Sir?

23
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,340
Is he still in Ireland?

24
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,633
I'm sorry, sir.

25
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,553
His passport's expired,
so it'll take some time to check.

26
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,272
Hannah?

27
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,860
Hannah?

28
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,255
Why did you do it?

29
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,695
Where's Li-sa?

30
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,281
-She's gone to bed
-Already?

31
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,326
She met her friend this afternoon.
I guess she's tired.

32
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,786
A friend? Who?

33
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,414
I'm not sure.

34
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,167
Also, Ho-su is with his grandmother.

35
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,878
She said she'd send him home
after feeding him dinner.

36
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,671
I told her not to.

37
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,341
Thank you. You may go home.

38
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,302
-Okay. Good night.
-Good night.

39
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,431
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

40
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,279
Why did you let her in
if you were going to be bothered so much?

41
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,951
She got on her knees.
I couldn't just send her away.

42
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,788
Even if she comes back
to apologize, ignore her.

43
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:18,086
If she makes you feel uncomfortable,
it's wrong even if she means well.

44
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,254
You know you can't hold your liquor.

45
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,466
It's to help me sleep.

46
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,306
What's the matter?
Did something happen today?

47
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,517
Well, I just…

48
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,686
I lost something by mistake today.

49
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,688
What did you lose?

50
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,942
It's nothing important.

51
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,278
I just need to find it. I'll find it.

52
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,700
Why did Ms. Gu
suddenly have a change of heart?

53
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,954
I don't know.

54
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,332
But I'm certain
she has an ulterior motive.

55
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,838
People don't change for no reason.

56
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,807
If she withdraws the suit,
isn't it a good thing for us?

57
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,812
Well, we don't know for certain

58
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,730
if it's good or bad.

59
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,475
It's noisy!

60
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,977
It's so noisy!

61
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:44,023
It's so noisy!

62
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,822
Li-sa.

63
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,908
Li-sa!

64
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,161
I can't hear.

65
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:58,955
What?

66
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,582
I can't hear anything!

67
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,252
I can't hear a thing!

68
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,129
-I can't hear!
-Goodness, Li-sa!

69
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,132
-I can't hear anything!
-What's with her? Is she nuts?

70
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,218
-You can't hear?
-I can't!

71
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,387
-Honey! Hyeon-seong!
-She's being weird.

72
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,805
What's wrong?

73
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,098
What are you saying?

74
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,225
Can you not hear me?

75
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,018
-Hey.
-I can't hear you!

76
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,645
-Can't you hear us?
-I can't hear!

77
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,146
-Li-sa!
-Dad's in the study.

78
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,316
-Go to the study. Li-sa.
-Li-sa!

79
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,610
Li-sa, look at me. It's okay.

80
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,404
-Look at me.
-Mom.

81
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,655
Look at… What?

82
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,490
-My throat hurts.
-Hold on.

83
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,909
-Look at me. What should I do?
-My throat hurts!

84
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,995
-Do you not hear me?
-I can't hear anything!

85
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,622
How many times must I repeat myself?
I can't hear you!

86
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,542
-I can't hear a thing!
-Okay.

87
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,377
-Get out!
-Calm down.

88
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,468
-I'll have the same.
-Okay.

89
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,553
Hello.

90
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,347
Li-sa keeps causing trouble.

91
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,727
You should've just kept her in England
even though she was lonely.

92
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,938
Thanks to her,
my husband is going through a hassle.

93
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,153
Well, Ho-su needs to go to kindergarten.

94
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,698
You should watch out.
My mom might steal your son away.

95
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,620
This is why I don't let
Jeong-hwan visit Korea often.

96
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,081
I wouldn't worry about Li-sa though.
She spent enough time with her.

97
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,082
Plus, she's a girl.

98
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,501
But does that matter these days?

99
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,795
It does to her.

100
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,923
She prefers sons.

101
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,260
You took her son from her,
so she wants yours.

102
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,014
People aren't objects you can just take.

103
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,019
But that's just how she is.

104
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,439
Times may have changed,
but some just remain the same.

105
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,941
Especially old people

106
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,611
who are wealthy.

107
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,366
Because it's been proven
that their way is right.

108
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,368
Your drinks are ready.

109
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,804
Did the doctor come to see her?
What did they say?

110
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,722
That her ears are fine.

111
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,015
Then what's wrong?

112
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,767
Apparently, it's psychological.

113
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,311
She needs more counseling to find out why.

114
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,734
Where did you go in the middle
of the night without telling me?

115
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,195
I couldn't sleep, so I went for a walk.

116
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,197
But you drank.

117
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,119
MOTHER

118
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,162
I should go.

119
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,664
Li-sa just fell asleep.

120
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,500
And don't forget to pick Ho-su up.

121
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,168
Okay.

122
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,833
TOWNHOUSE MAINTENANCE OFFICE

123
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,364
She met her friend this afternoon.
I guess she's tired.

124
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,130
Grandma, Bob is the name
of the dinosaur in this book.

125
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,299
Is that so? His name is Bob?

126
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,884
Yes. Isn't it funny?

127
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,094
His entire body is green.

128
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,263
He takes the train alongside people.

129
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,432
He can also eat over 7,000 hotdogs.

130
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,852
That many? My goodness.

131
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,397
She violated the Juvenile Welfare Act?

132
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:41,153
I heard Ms. Gu caused a commotion
during class last month.

133
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,698
If some of the students were offended,

134
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,243
it could be an issue
even though the others were okay.

135
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,789
If the teachers' rights clash
with the students' rights,

136
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,083
the latter apparently come first.

137
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,169
Must we go this far
when she's dropped all charges?

138
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,505
Why did you let her sue us
in the first place?

139
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,841
What if it fails?

140
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,135
We'll raise an issue
with what she said in class.

141
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,056
If the disciplinary committee acknowledges
that it had a negative effect

142
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,976
on teenagers' view of
sexually graphic material,

143
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,479
she may not receive criminal penalty,
but she won't get to teach again.

144
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,441
That's not too bad.

145
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,611
Let's not rush ourselves.
It might cause a bigger issue.

146
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,699
How can you say that
after what your daughter has gone through?

147
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,035
We should teach her
not to mess with the wrong people.

148
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,789
It's already evident
that we have the upper hand.

149
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,624
Even if Li-sa is the victim--

150
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,753
Who cares who has the upper hand
in a battle?

151
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,880
We just need to win.

152
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,091
Grandma, look at this.

153
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,971
Goodness, your drawing is better
than the book, sweetie.

154
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,057
Who do you take after to draw so well?

155
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,059
I want some ice cream.

156
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,062
Ice cream? Okay.

157
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,078
Were you going to just walk away?

158
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,457
I'm sorry.

159
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,795
Good. What a good boy you are.

160
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,841
But that's no longer edible, is it?

161
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,143
Ho-su.

162
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,440
What are you doing here?
Are you by yourself?

163
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,525
-Where's Dad?
-He's on the phone.

164
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,862
You were waving at someone. Who was it?

165
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,030
I don't know.

166
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,366
Why would you wave at a stranger?

167
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,368
I accidentally got ice cream on her.

168
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,455
Wait, you're having ice cream
before lunch?

169
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,624
A dinosaur-looking lady bought it for me.

170
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,752
Dinosaur?

171
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,548
Lady?

172
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,344
The dinosaur lady is gone.

173
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,947
Excuse me. Hello.

174
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,745
-I'm the physical--
-I know.

175
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,582
-Do you go to this church?
-No.

176
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,502
It's near the hospital,
so I just dropped by.

177
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,879
I see.

178
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,173
Goodbye, then.

179
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,467
I was curious.

180
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,930
I wanted to see the faces of those
who confessed their sins.

181
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,937
I hope those who commit
serious sins don't do that.

182
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,818
Look at her. She looks so much at peace.

183
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,280
It shouldn't be that easy to be forgiven.

184
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,157
It isn't.

185
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,807
Can you hear now?

186
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,812
Does it hurt at all?

187
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,906
I heard your friend came yesterday.
Was it Ju-yeong?

188
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,454
Li-sa.

189
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,841
Did something happen that upset you?

190
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,845
Is there anything you want to tell me?

191
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,056
No.

192
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,603
Do you not want to talk about it?

193
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,940
-I need to go to the bathroom.
-Okay.

194
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,443
Let me know anytime
if you want to talk about anything.

195
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,028
I'm always here for you.

196
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:35,799
AN LI-SA
THIS ACCOUNT IS PRIVATE

197
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,101
-Hello.
-Hello.

198
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:01,992
Hey.

199
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,664
Don't be nervous.

200
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,918
I can't help it.

201
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:17,591
Right. I guess this place
could be intimidating for students.

202
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,974
Doesn't it look realistic?

203
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,146
Li-sa held me from behind.

204
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,689
I only filmed my legs first

205
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:36,360
then dropped my phone
after tying it with a string later.

206
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,905
You did this all by yourself?

207
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,991
Yes. Doesn't it look real
because it's all shaky?

208
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,452
It does.

209
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,665
It must look realistic.
That's what's most important.

210
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,879
You don't look like a dad.

211
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,299
That's a compliment.

212
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,556
This is about Li-sa, right?

213
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,308
Yes.

214
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,769
Did something happen yesterday?

215
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,563
She was a little ill.

216
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,649
It wasn't because of me.

217
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,361
She was the one who invited me over.

218
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,738
But I left because she was all cranky.

219
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,451
I used to put up with her, but I heard
that's not the right thing to do

220
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,287
and that I should be honest.

221
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,997
You should be honest?

222
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,333
Yes. I heard that a true friend is
someone you can be honest with

223
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,878
about your feelings
whether you're happy or sad.

224
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,339
If you just put up with it,
you become a doormat.

225
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,342
Who said that?

226
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,343
Mimi.

227
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,430
I mean, the art teacher.

228
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,101
Ms. Gu?

229
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,399
CONFESSIONAL

230
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,335
How do I look?

231
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,006
How does it feel to be forgiven?

232
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,758
I'm not sure.

233
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,677
I haven't been forgiven yet.

234
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,013
What did you do so wrong?

235
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,723
You seem like an honest man.

236
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,768
Gosh, you're a poor judge of character.

237
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,896
That's true.

238
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,357
Seon-u, let's go eat.

239
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,903
There's a nice kalguksu place
in Hongeun-dong.

240
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,867
My lunch break will be over soon,
so I don't think I can go that far.

241
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,952
But you still need to eat.

242
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,662
Where should we go?

243
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,086
I was here first.

244
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:00,921
Sorry?

245
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,548
I also made lunch plans with him.

246
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,425
Would you like to join?

247
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,137
How about tonkatsu?
I know a place in front of the hospital.

248
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,555
Let's go.

249
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,232
I'm sorry, but I have other plans.

250
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,171
You eat well.

251
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,174
I do. I need to eat well
and live a long, healthy life.

252
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,261
No need to get all serious.

253
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,305
But I am serious.

254
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,268
Are you in debt?

255
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,103
Sorry?

256
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,105
To the woman we met earlier.

257
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,273
Her?

258
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,026
I don't think I can call it a debt.

259
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,699
Since it's not something I can repay.

260
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,623
So…

261
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,127
Thank you for saving me back there.

262
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,759
I got fired. I'm unemployed right now.

263
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,721
And things will only get harder.

264
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,265
It doesn't sound so bad
when I say it like this, right?

265
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,143
You should talk about it.

266
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:44,399
Not to me. I mean someone
you feel comfortable with.

267
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,110
Okay.

268
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,447
UNJEONG GOMTANG

269
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,994
Yes?

270
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,288
Hey.

271
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,124
Right now?

272
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,128
I'm sorry, but I'm with someone right now.

273
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,341
Would you like to come here then?

274
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,515
Who was that guy?

275
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,477
Just someone I know.

276
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,731
Do you meet him often?

277
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,858
What's your relationship?

278
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,279
Are you here to find out who I'm seeing?

279
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,282
Why are you curious about that?

280
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,787
You're right. That's none of my business.

281
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,833
Li-sa was pretty ill last night.
She was even taken to the ER.

282
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,877
Goodness. Why?

283
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,796
I heard it's psychological.

284
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,048
I think it's because

285
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,384
of what you did to her.

286
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,803
How about I talk to her?

287
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,388
No, you can't.

288
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:43,310
I think she saw you while she was out
to meet her friend Ju-yeong.

289
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,520
And that must've shocked her.

290
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,732
What were you still doing there

291
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:53,153
in front of my house
after leaving my studio?

292
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,405
I was taking a walk.

293
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,199
You have such a nice walking trail.

294
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,872
You decided to take a walk
when you came to apologize?

295
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,499
I had a lot on my mind.

296
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,211
But I'm sorry if you were offended.

297
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,426
Li-sa remains tight-lipped
about what happened that day.

298
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,346
Her therapist thinks

299
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,974
she's avoiding what makes her angry.

300
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,811
Keeping it bottled up
could cause an episode like that.

301
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,607
Before the incident,

302
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,443
Li-sa was a cheerful, sweet,
and kind girl.

303
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,571
This never happened before.

304
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,823
Really? Never?

305
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,787
All the parents I've met are like this.

306
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,956
They never think
their children might be the problem.

307
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,127
They're only worried
that their friends or teachers

308
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,629
might rub off on them.

309
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,052
I heard you said something to her.

310
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,929
What did you tell her…

311
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,391
after hitting her?

312
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,020
I told her to stop…

313
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,735
because I know everything.

314
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,456
Your drawings will be included
in your grades.

315
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,418
You must finish it during class.

316
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,922
Unless it's absolutely necessary, you
won't be given extra time to finish it up.

317
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,136
That'll be all.

318
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,637
-How did you do?
-How was it?

319
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,473
-You drew a lot.
-I think I did pretty well.

320
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,896
-What's the next class?
-I don't know. Math?

321
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,690
Math? How boring.

322
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,071
You can't blame someone for
buying someone else's talent or effort.

323
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:05,452
However, having no respect
for other people is a different story.

324
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,247
I guess she turned out that way
since no one told her it was wrong.

325
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,084
She believes she can get away with it.

326
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,379
Li-sa is still young,

327
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,089
so she can still change.

328
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,718
I'm not saying I'm proud of what I did.

329
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,430
Now that I think back,

330
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,601
I don't know why I was so enraged.

331
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,231
She's lying.

332
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,568
It's a lie.

333
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,530
That's why I'm asking you.

334
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,783
It could've been a misunderstanding.

335
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:50,079
I know you and Ju-yeong have been close
ever since you came to the school.

336
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,332
I'm sure you had your reasons.

337
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,377
Everything had been fine until recently.

338
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,798
But Ju-yeong changed
because of that crazy bitch.

339
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,637
So Mom, don't meet that woman.

340
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,502
The phone can't be picked up…

341
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,338
Why isn't he picking up?

342
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,437
Hui-ju.

343
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,315
What brings you here?

344
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,068
Why haven't you been picking up?

345
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,736
Don't you check your texts?

346
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,531
I left my phone at the hospital.

347
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,952
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

348
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,912
Gu Hae-won.

349
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,749
How do you know her?

350
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,169
She's just a patient of mine.

351
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,964
Do you usually eat with your patients?

352
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,341
No. I just ran into her yesterday.

353
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,927
How do you know if it was a coincidence?

354
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,347
She's the teacher who hit Li-sa.

355
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,057
I can't believe she came to you.

356
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,937
It looks like you had no idea,
so stay away from her from now on.

357
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,566
She hasn't been disciplined yet,

358
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,569
and Li-sa is still going through
a hard time because of her.

359
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,154
Don't make me say it twice.

360
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,256
-Hello.
-Hello.

361
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,592
-Can we talk for a minute?
-Sure.

362
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,988
How is Li-sa doing?

363
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,698
She's a smart girl,

364
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,202
so with a little bit of guidance,
she'll catch up just fine.

365
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,622
But she's overly coolheaded
for someone her age.

366
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,417
It may seem
like she's brushing it off for now,

367
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,586
but she could explode later on.

368
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,381
Kids her age can be unpredictable.

369
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,597
Can I have some ice cream?

370
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,308
Yes. Put your backpack down,
wash your hands,

371
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,394
and say hi to your sister's tutor first.

372
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,356
I'm also worried about that.

373
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,359
She keeps saying she's fine,

374
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,111
-but usually--
-My ice cream.

375
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,739
Please.

376
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,368
I'm talking with her.
Can you please wait a little?

377
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:22,333
And I'm scared to ask her again
because it might make things worse.

378
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,003
Ho-su, I told you not to rub your eye.

379
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,796
Just press down on it.

380
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,172
Don't rub it.

381
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,926
If it itches,
you should apply ointment to it.

382
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,345
Ma'am, can you please apply ointment
on Ho-su's eye?

383
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,263
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,807
You could bleed, you know?

385
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,393
Ho-su.

386
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,564
I want ice cream!

387
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,859
I'm sorry.

388
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:51,654
Kids his age naturally require
a lot of attention.

389
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,282
Li-sa wasn't like him.

390
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,491
But with Ho-su,

391
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,370
it feels as if I'm always
doing things wrong.

392
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,333
So about Li-sa…

393
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,170
TO THE WORLD WITH YOUR DREAMS FROM TAERIM

394
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,130
TEMPORARY TEACHER RECOMMENDATION

395
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,840
So Ms. Gu was recommended by the VP

396
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,134
instead of going through
the proper procedure?

397
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,971
That's correct.
The VP's daughter asked for the favor.

398
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,184
Are you saying she was hired

399
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,936
because she was an acquaintance?

400
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,982
Her papers looked fine,
and she had a good reputation.

401
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,776
We only needed her for a semester,

402
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,778
so I didn't think too much about it.

403
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,321
I see.

404
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,573
I'll talk to her myself.

405
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:43,122
There was a complaint
against us becoming an arts high school.

406
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,167
Here are some picket signs
that were outside the Education Office.

407
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,668
Take a look.

408
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:55,384
PROTECT OUR PROPERTY RIGHTS

409
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,815
This isn't a surprise.

410
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,026
Let's promote those who are
in favor of the transformation.

411
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,820
You may leave.

412
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,998
DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

413
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,169
Mr. Seo Woo-jae was issued
an emergency passport

414
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,380
and has left Ireland.

415
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,216
I'll send you the family certificate

416
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,885
that was submitted
to the hospital for his discharge.

417
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,104
Where did you go?

418
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,845
We'll put up a canvas here
so that the audience can participate.

419
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,432
The wooden windows will be installed here.

420
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,100
Every time the windows open,

421
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,061
they will hear the wind
and other sound effects.

422
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,148
And the design will be done as you asked.

423
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,321
Did you hear about the intro video
that'll be put up at the entrance?

424
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,655
Here is the questionnaire.

425
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,326
Let us know if there are any works
you'd like explained separately.

426
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,204
But I feel uncomfortable
about shooting a video.

427
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:50,124
People will be given guidebooks,
but they prefer videos these days.

428
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,669
The president also looks forward to it.

429
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,005
You know how much she loves your work.

430
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,925
Will I get to see her in person this time?

431
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,385
Yes. She'll be back in Korea
to see your exhibition.

432
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,720
I see.

433
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,475
EXHIBITION UNDER PREPARATION

434
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,686
That spot was always vacant.

435
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,232
I haven't heard of the artist,
but the president recommended her.

436
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,108
You know she loves finding rookies.

437
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,195
The exhibition schedule
is similar to yours.

438
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,447
Is that so?

439
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,548
Ms. Gu Hae-won?

440
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,096
You're not what I expected.

441
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,641
You seem disappointed. I'm sorry.

442
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,103
Let's talk on our way.

443
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,658
They're the ones.

444
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,953
How do you have them?

445
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,381
You can't quit this, can you?

446
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,884
No, but not because it reminds me
of the old days. It's just so delicious.

447
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,677
Of course.

448
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,222
Why think of the sickening past?

449
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,561
So how's Li-sa?

450
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,855
She says she's okay.

451
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,733
She seems okay in front of me.

452
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,153
Teenagers are like that.

453
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,907
Why didn't you bring Ho-su?
I really wanted to see him.

454
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,203
I just can't handle that kid.

455
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,373
I think he's determined to hate me.

456
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,749
He shows me no affection.

457
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,876
Don't show it.

458
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,839
Kids feel it
when their mothers are tired of them.

459
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:34,306
Isn't it scary to live here alone?
It's been years.

460
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,224
No.

461
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,188
People scare me more.

462
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,190
Gosh, seriously.

463
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,285
So what's bothering you?

464
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:02,626
I don't have kids, so I doubt
you're here to get advice about them.

465
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,919
Now, tell me.

466
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,301
I guess it's something serious

467
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,928
Don't tell me, then. I prefer not to know.

468
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,600
About that guy you used to date.

469
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,935
Which one? I've dated tons.

470
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,231
The one who retired
from working at Yongsan Police Station

471
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,774
and spent all day fishing.

472
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,694
That old-fashioned guy?

473
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,945
Are you still in touch?

474
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,448
We could be. Why do you ask?

475
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,911
I ran into someone
I never wanted to see again.

476
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,539
So I want to check something.

477
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,417
You don't even want
to see them again, so what for?

478
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,670
I want to know if we met by coincidence

479
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,839
or if it was intentional.

480
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,027
I met Li-sa's dad.

481
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,238
LEE JU-YEONG

482
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,739
Did he give you a hard time?

483
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,662
No, he seemed like a great guy.

484
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,748
A great guy?

485
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,392
What do you want?

486
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,353
What do you mean?

487
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,772
Why are you here?

488
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,943
Do I need a reason to come over?

489
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,786
You obviously came for a reason.

490
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,542
What is it?

491
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,794
Did a guy rip you off again?

492
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,212
You little brat.

493
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,594
Why were you sleeping this early
with your coat on?

494
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,472
Dad…

495
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,187
I mean, your grandfather is worried sick
because he can't reach you.

496
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,522
Give him a call tomorrow.

497
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,654
You can't be like that to my dad.
Have you forgotten how he raised you?

498
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,032
-I haven't.
-And you do this?

499
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,327
That's exactly why.
I'm embarrassed to face him.

500
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:48,500
He's not easily shocked
thanks to what I've put him through.

501
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,418
Just call him.

502
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,172
He even called your school,
but he couldn't reach you.

503
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,798
Don't tell me you got fired.

504
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,925
-I quit.
-Why?

505
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,803
-I had something to do.
-As if.

506
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,057
By any chance, did you--

507
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,266
No.

508
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,022
I swear it's not what you think.

509
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,997
What is it now?

510
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,124
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

511
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,376
You just had chips.

512
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,336
This won't fill me up.

513
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,754
Get up now.

514
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,968
I wonder how he ended up
opening a bar in this shabby neighborhood.

515
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,281
What the hell? Why is it so good?

516
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,034
He's a much better cook
than the former owner.

517
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,747
When did she leave though?
She didn't even tell me.

518
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,877
This liquor is both sweet and spicy.

519
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,381
It's a good starter.

520
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,175
Sir.

521
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,053
You look familiar. Do you live near here?

522
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,388
No, I don't.

523
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:26,974
Are you two…

524
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:28,851
sisters?

525
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,104
You look so much alike.
Is she your older sister?

526
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,607
-She's my mom.
-Really?

527
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,485
Gosh, you really don't seem like it.

528
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,362
You look so young.

529
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,532
She had me when she was 17.

530
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,784
Gosh, what are you even saying?

531
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,871
Sir.

532
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,292
Why don't you give this to your wife?

533
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:58,005
First-time buyers get to have
their skin checked and exfoliated.

534
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,173
GU JEONG-YEON

535
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,800
Can I just use this myself?

536
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,678
I'll give you more samples for you.
Give that to your wife.

537
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,180
I'm single.

538
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,934
I knew it. I knew you were single.
I can tell you were never married.

539
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,186
No, it's not that.

540
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,022
She passed away.

541
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,817
Right. I guess that could be it too.

542
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,904
At our age, it's not unusual
for people to pass away.

543
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,280
Right. Of course.

544
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,494
My mom's single too.

545
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,164
But I don't think her husband is dead.

546
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,290
Hey.

547
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,211
I'll have whatever she's drinking.

548
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,634
Hey. You didn't need to say that.

549
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,345
-You don't need to do this either.
-Do what?

550
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,598
Come here and check if I'm still alive.

551
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,478
I purposely moved to your neighborhood.

552
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,605
What are you talking about?

553
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:02,027
If I become suicidal again,
I'll call you first

554
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,987
and ask for help.

555
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,748
Ms. Jeong, we're ready to shoot.

556
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,333
Okay.

557
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,712
You're known for pursuing happiness
in the moment.

558
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:21,838
That's right.

559
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,133
Because misfortune comes
whether you like it or not.

560
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,929
So I try to find happy moments

561
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,473
and paint them on my canvas.

562
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,476
Hello, I'm Jeong Hui-ju,
and I'm a painter.

563
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,064
I used to be a housewife

564
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,650
until I sent my daughter abroad.

565
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:45,821
Suddenly, I lost my purpose
and felt empty inside.

566
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,950
One day, I visited her.

567
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,452
But she was too busy adjusting,

568
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,955
so I felt lonely even when I was with her.

569
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,709
I was happy to see her,
but it only lasted a few days.

570
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,130
I felt scared and frustrated
to be left alone.

571
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,799
I wanted to communicate,

572
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,428
but I could only say

573
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,180
a few words in English.

574
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:16,685
That's when I began painting.

575
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,730
I knew no one there.

576
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,566
And nobody knew me either.

577
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,192
I was neither a wife

578
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,821
nor a mother there.

579
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,782
I communicated through my paintings.

580
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,538
That's how it all began.

581
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,198
Every story has a beginning.

582
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,035
My story begins here.

583
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,793
And there was you.

584
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,420
I'm sorry.

585
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,800
You were radiating, and your name was…

586
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,431
You can call me Hannah.

587
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,227
I want to study

588
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:45,357
at the Berlin University of the Arts.

589
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:47,984
Thank you.

590
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,779
Who is next? Introduce yourself.

591
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,019
Did you talk to Ju-yeong?

592
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:49,189
They did fight,
but they made up before parting ways.

593
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,398
That's how kids are.

594
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,030
Do you really think Li-sa bullied her?

595
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,032
What did Li-sa say?

596
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,284
I don't know. She's upset with me.

597
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,329
She thinks I believe Ms. Gu and not her.

598
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,290
Ms. Gu was hired through
the vice principal's recommendation.

599
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,377
Recommendation?

600
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,214
Apparently, the vice principal's daughter
used to work with her at the same school.

601
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,382
They did?

602
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,264
-Which school?
-Why?

603
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,892
-I want to meet with her.
-In person?

604
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:26,893
Yes.

605
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,230
I think I should.

606
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,330
Ms. Gu? Yes.

607
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,833
I recommended her to my dad.

608
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,085
Were you two close?

609
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,338
No, not really.

610
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,632
I still don't get it.

611
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,219
But I was supposed to go
to Taerim Middle School.

612
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,889
Sorry?

613
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:07,809
Ms. Gu had been appointed
as a full-time teacher here,

614
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,438
and I'd failed to get my contract renewed.

615
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,817
When she heard that I was going to Taerim,

616
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,236
she said she was going
to quit this school.

617
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:24,826
So you're saying
Ms. Gu suggested it first?

618
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,208
I told her it was a temporary position,
but she didn't mind.

619
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,921
I was just grateful,
so I asked my dad for a favor.

620
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,340
Is there a problem?

621
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,703
After we met yesterday,

622
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:12,874
I felt bad about Li-sa
and watched the video again.

623
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,757
I'm scared of myself.

624
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:26,471
I could see myself turning into a monster.

625
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,767
You have to believe me.

626
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,021
I feel terrible
for what I did and how I hurt Li-sa.

627
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,984
I'm willing to do anything
to make up for it.

628
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,235
I mean it.

629
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,447
I'm truly sorry.

630
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,333
DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

631
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:08,596
The nurse said a woman named Hannah
came with papers and requested

632
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,598
the hospital to discharge him.

633
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,051
I'm so sorry.

634
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,095
You…

635
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,140
Why did you approach me?

636
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,309
What?

637
00:55:57,353 --> 00:56:01,357
You even harassed Li-sa.
What did you come here for?

638
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,421
What do you mean?

639
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:26,508
That's strange.

640
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,887
What makes you think that?

641
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,374
PRICE: 577,500 WON

642
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,466
PRICE: 658,000 WON

643
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:15,932
Yes?

644
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,727
What's the matter? I told you it's on me.

645
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,980
What is it?

646
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,482
SPECIAL DISCOUNT

647
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:47,547
It's for your wedding shoot.
You should've gotten something nicer.

648
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,883
The original price was
more than 300,000 won.

649
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,176
We got a really good deal.

650
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,262
I've never shopped
at a place like that before.

651
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,639
It's so fun.
I'm afraid it might become a habit.

652
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:10,236
I don't know if you'll like it,
but I got the thickest one

653
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,072
since I'm sure
it's quite chilly in Germany.

654
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,575
Hui-ju.

655
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,203
I wanted to get you a nicer one,

656
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,663
but I figured you wouldn't accept it.

657
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,374
This is worth
two months of my lunch money.

658
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,377
I bet it's warm.

659
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,318
You finally look like a bride.

660
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,697
Thank you for the photo shoot.
I bet it's expensive here.

661
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,742
Yes. I purposely picked this place
to make you feel the pressure.

662
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,664
I still don't get
why you're rushing the wedding.

663
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,000
Look at you smiling.

664
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,922
What's taking him so long?

665
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,632
He's never on time.

666
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,436
Hey.

667
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:31,901
How do I look?

668
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,153
You look pretty.

669
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,699
Ma'am, please get ready.

670
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,866
Coming.

671
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,874
Let's begin the shoot.

672
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,502
Okay. One, two.

673
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,922
That's good. One, two.

674
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,718
Shall we take it standing up now?

675
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:58,970
Here we go.

676
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,309
Good. Smile.

677
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,436
Good.

678
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,230
Good.

679
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:11,816
Great.

680
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,278
Move your right shoulder just a bit.
That's great.

681
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,447
I'll begin now.

682
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,407
All right. One, two.

683
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:23,995
Loosen up.

684
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,289
Sir, smile a bit.

685
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,832
-Okay.
-Good.

686
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,668
Smile. One, two.

687
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,296
Smile.

688
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,007
Good. Now, this is the last one.

689
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,675
One minute.

690
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,802
-Hui-ju.
-Yes?

691
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,304
Come join us.

692
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,056
No, I'm good.

693
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,808
But it'd be nice.

694
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,565
Join us.

695
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,617
All right. Let's take the photo.

696
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,661
One, two.

697
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,662
Oh, right.

698
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,962
It's too hot to wear it in here.

699
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,839
Because you bought it for me.

700
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,636
-I'm ready.
-Look at the camera.

701
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,971
One, two, three.

702
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,475
-Can you stand closer?
-Okay.

703
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,770
Look at the camera. Here we go. One, two.

704
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,816
Have you ever tried avoiding a dog?

705
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,653
If you run, it chases after you even more.

706
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,240
It's useless.
Let's not see each other again.

707
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:10,369
Woo-jae really misses you.

708
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,664
