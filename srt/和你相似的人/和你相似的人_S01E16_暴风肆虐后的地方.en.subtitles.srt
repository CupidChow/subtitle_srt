1
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,074
Hui-ju came to me.

2
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,118
A proud woman like her asked me for help.

3
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,039
She asked me to stop you.

4
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,727
You don't love me. Wake up!

5
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,062
Who are you to judge my feelings?

6
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,064
This isn't love!

7
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,700
No--

8
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,660
Stop--

9
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,501
Hello, Ms. Lee.
I should've called you first--

10
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,419
Ms. Jeong,

11
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,046
did Mr. Seo visit you today?

12
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,172
Sorry?

13
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:57,635
Maybe I shouldn't have provoked him
like that, but he just wouldn't listen.

14
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,680
Watch out for him.

15
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,892
Okay.

16
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,757
Did you have a drink?

17
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,385
A bit.

18
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,554
I couldn't bear the pain.

19
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,935
There are many people here. Leave quietly.

20
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,812
We'll talk at the gallery tomorrow.

21
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,316
You should've been straightforward with me

22
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,237
instead of hiding behind Ms. Lee.

23
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,327
Make the video public.

24
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,746
Let people be the judge of it.

25
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,331
Show it to them.

26
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,709
You're drunk.

27
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,836
I'll call a cab, so--

28
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,090
Did you want to ruin me
by making me out to be the bad guy?

29
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,927
Did you scheme all this? Is that it?

30
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,512
Lower your voice.

31
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,894
You're anxious about so many things.

32
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,564
So why do you treat me like this?

33
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,400
What?

34
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,345
You think it was all a scheme? How so?

35
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,431
You know it better than I do.

36
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,808
You showed up unannounced that day.

37
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,477
Was that my scheming too?

38
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,774
I don't intend to hurt you.

39
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,111
I just needed a reason
to opt out of the project.

40
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,821
A reason Ms. Lee would understand.

41
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,532
Why were you so desperate
to opt out of the project?

42
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,868
Because I wanted to stop making mistakes.

43
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,706
Woo-jae.

44
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,877
Please let me go.

45
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,007
Your career has just begun.

46
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,886
And you have the potential
to do whatever you want in the future.

47
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,806
But I can't be the one by your side.
It shouldn't be me.

48
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,268
Don't call it a mistake.

49
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,438
You had feelings for me.

50
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,024
That was a mistake?

51
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,277
I did. I loved you.

52
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,113
But it was all a mistake, so I ended it.

53
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,157
And I felt guilty about it.

54
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,329
When I said I wanted the best for you,

55
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,623
I truly meant it.

56
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,586
So why are you complicating everything?

57
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,296
You're one to talk.

58
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,634
You abandoned me and ran away,

59
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,762
but I believed you'd come back.

60
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,516
And when I was blindly waiting for you,

61
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,353
your husband hit me with his car
and disguised it as an accident.

62
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,691
Did you think I was going to let you two
live happily ever after?

63
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,320
You're wrong! That's not what happened!

64
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,990
My husband was with me that night.

65
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,953
I'm sorry about the accident,
but he had nothing to do with it.

66
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,415
Liar.

67
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,336
That's what I remember.

68
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,349
I'll compensate you
for the years you lost.

69
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,269
As much as I can.

70
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,062
But that's it.

71
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,107
It's over between us.

72
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,577
I think you can leave now.

73
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,041
What are you so afraid of?

74
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,671
Is it…

75
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,798
me?

76
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,018
Are you scared of me, Hui-ju?

77
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:07,862
Woo-jae.

78
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,533
Woo-jae, wait. Seo Woo-jae!

79
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,327
That hurts!

80
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,247
Woo-jae…

81
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,366
Woo-jae…

82
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,621
Woo-jae, wait. Seo Woo-jae!

83
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,956
That hurts!

84
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,543
Woo-jae…

85
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,546
Woo-jae…

86
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,839
-I can't let you go like this.
-Woo-jae…

87
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,716
If I can't have you,

88
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,719
nobody can have you. That's only fair.

89
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,013
Wait…

90
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:23,980
Woo-jae!

91
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,802
No! Stop!

92
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,035
No, Woo-jae!

93
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,621
No!

94
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,300
Ho-su, don't do that.
Be careful or you'll get hurt.

95
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,429
Li-sa, when did you go out--

96
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,098
Li-sa!

97
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,144
One minute. Li-sa!

98
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,572
Li-sa.

99
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,617
Li-sa.

100
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,994
Open…

101
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,746
Let me talk to her.

102
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,414
When did you get here?

103
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,875
What's wrong?

104
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,046
I got upset, and it must've startled her.

105
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,676
I need to fix this myself.

106
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,929
I got this, so you should go downstairs.

107
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,347
Ho-su is all alone.

108
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,185
Dad!

109
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,231
Coming, Ho-su.

110
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,299
Li-sa, it's me.

111
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,347
Are you okay?

112
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,853
How is he?

113
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,822
Fortunately, he wasn't that badly hurt.

114
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,574
He's okay.

115
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,828
So… So don't worry too much.

116
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,039
You should go to bed.

117
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,461
And we can talk again tomorrow, okay?

118
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,789
I think we should
let Li-sa get some rest tonight.

119
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,292
You see…

120
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:18,339
I shouldn't have gotten upset
and cornered her like that.

121
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,426
Her teacher told me not to upset her,

122
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,637
but it's quite difficult.

123
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,371
Your delivery is here.

124
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,165
-Chicken!
-Thank you.

125
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,792
-Enjoy.
-The wings are mine!

126
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,173
We ordered fried chicken for dinner.

127
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,385
Good job.

128
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,388
This looks tasty. Let's go eat.

129
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,141
Gosh, it's your favorite,

130
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,768
soy sauce chicken.

131
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,273
It looks so good.

132
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,993
SEDATIVES

133
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,507
If you drink this,
Ho-su will want some as well.

134
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,217
Drink this instead.

135
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,137
Your mom's orders.

136
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,808
This is good too.

137
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,394
Li-sa didn't have dinner yet.

138
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,146
I'll handle it.

139
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,316
Anyway, I should go
talk to her teacher tomorrow.

140
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,860
Why? Did she do it again?

141
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,155
We'll talk later.

142
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,410
Give me more chicken, Dad.

143
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,164
All right. Let me debone it

144
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,792
for your convenience.

145
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,878
Gosh, it looks tasty.

146
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,969
Is it good?

147
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,896
No, Woo-jae! Don't do it!

148
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,481
Woo-jae!

149
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,375
Woo-jae.

150
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,396
"Cassandra once said this to her."

151
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,900
"'If you stab a human,
you will end up dying too.'"

152
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,113
"This incident was engraved
in Maya's memory."

153
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,116
"Maya's wish was to…"

154
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,808
Where are you headed?

155
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,905
Be careful, or you'll crash.
Do you also want to die?

156
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,743
See? You can't escape from me.

157
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,119
That's enough.

158
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,537
We'll always be together.

159
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,915
-Now, in the future,
-That's enough.

160
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,959
-and even after death.
-That's enough!

161
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,679
I love you.

162
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,682
I love you.

163
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,269
I love you.

164
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,521
One day,

165
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,317
a silver bell from a monastery in Sligo
fell into the lake.

166
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,655
Even to this day,
those with pure hearts and souls

167
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,616
can hear the bell chiming.

168
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:32,953
Do you hear it?

169
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,707
There's no way I'd be able to hear that.

170
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:07,362
FINALE
AFTER THE STORM

171
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,566
Did I sleep here?

172
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,444
You slept like a baby.

173
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,991
Gosh.

174
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,667
I haven't slept this well in a while.

175
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,752
It seemed so.

176
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,714
You were sleeping so soundly
that I watched you for a while.

177
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,177
Ho-su.

178
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,720
An Ho-su.

179
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,515
Time to get up.

180
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,358
What are you doing here?

181
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,236
Let's have breakfast.

182
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,532
What happened to him?

183
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,744
Is he really okay?

184
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,246
Is he alive?

185
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,418
Come on.

186
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,421
People don't die that easily.

187
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,385
It's not that easy to kill a grown man

188
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,680
with a stab from a tiny hand like yours.

189
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,603
-Then how is he?
-He's fine.

190
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,438
Even the doctor said so.

191
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,026
Listen carefully.

192
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,155
You only did that to help me.

193
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,533
He barged in here and choked me.
He's in the wrong.

194
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,370
You didn't do anything wrong. Okay?

195
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,206
Answer me.

196
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,506
I promise.

197
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,885
Nothing happened yesterday.

198
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,097
Everything's totally fine.

199
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,058
You can forget what happened.

200
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,746
Hui-ju?

201
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:28,873
Hui-ju?

202
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,000
What?

203
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:32,961
Gosh.

204
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,052
Is the preparation going well?

205
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,723
There's not much I need to do.
Hyeon-seong is taking care of everything.

206
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,601
Hui-ju, are you okay?

207
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,729
I must've slept wrong.

208
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,566
Gosh. Lie down. Let me massage your neck.

209
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,318
It's okay.
It'll go away once I take a nap.

210
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,665
Li-sa. I thought
I wouldn't get to see you today.

211
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,918
Mom's car isn't here.

212
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,838
Well, she just left.

213
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,007
I was playing a game with Ho-su.

214
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,176
I see.

215
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,682
I don't want to take up your time. Go in.

216
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,476
Okay.

217
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,858
Uncle.

218
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,904
Do you still envy me?

219
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,615
You once told me

220
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,367
you envied me for having a mom.

221
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,453
But she sides with you every time.

222
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,122
Even if I kill someone?

223
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,295
Do you still think that way?

224
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,509
I do, since it's your mom.

225
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,844
She'll be always on your side.

226
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,749
It's the same passcode.

227
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,543
Come anytime you want.

228
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,922
And these…

229
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,555
What are you doing?

230
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,440
Hey.

231
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,695
This? Woo-jae…

232
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,033
He wants to leave. He says he'll leave.

233
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,369
He's done making wrong choices.

234
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,130
Well… You know how he is.

235
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,093
He's always reckless and unpredictable.

236
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,432
But why are you packing his bags for him?

237
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,228
Don't get me wrong. He asked me to--

238
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,730
Woo-jae is dead.

239
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,984
Did you think I wouldn't know?

240
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,366
Cat got your tongue?

241
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,724
Three of you went in. But Li-sa and you…

242
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,937
Only two of you came out.

243
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,442
It's best not to lie
if you're going to get caught so soon.

244
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,281
I guess you forgot about this.

245
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,159
But then,

246
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,287
I didn't know what to do either.

247
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,790
I can only imagine how you felt.

248
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,212
You may have meticulously dodged security
cameras and gotten rid of his body,

249
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,882
but the blood and fingerprints…

250
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,302
on this pen will point to Li-sa--

251
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,387
You're wrong.

252
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,307
Then? Was it you?

253
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,893
What?

254
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,900
I thought it was you.

255
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,487
But I guess it was Li-sa.

256
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,366
That explains why you're acting this way.

257
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,539
Hae-won.

258
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,042
Please turn a blind eye to this.
I beg you.

259
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,130
Even if I get arrested for it, my husband…

260
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,260
Hyeon-seong will never abandon me.

261
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,138
He'll hire every single competent lawyer
in this country.

262
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,726
I'm sure it'd be a cakewalk to argue
that I was tired of his stalking

263
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,687
and that I did what I did in self-defense.

264
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,148
Then I won't be punished.

265
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,110
Is that what you want?

266
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,906
No, right?

267
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,409
I'll give up everything.
I'll never paint again.

268
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,954
I'll leave my family as well.

269
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,748
I'll never come back.

270
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,795
I'll never show up
in front of you or anyone else.

271
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:54,133
I'll make myself out to be
a heartless bitch who deceived

272
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,928
and left everyone
after having an affair with Woo-jae.

273
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,058
I know I should've come clean ages ago.

274
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,604
Since my repentance is long overdue,
I'll pay for it even longer.

275
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,690
Everyone will curse me.

276
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,443
And my family will be

277
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:17,281
so ashamed of the fact
that I was a part of their family

278
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,493
that they'll want to remove me
from their memory.

279
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,411
So, please.

280
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,792
I'm sorry, Hae-won.

281
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,337
I wanted to apologize to you
countless times.

282
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,218
But I decided not to
because I was afraid of losing everything.

283
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,930
So laugh at me all you want

284
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,558
and enjoy watching me fall.

285
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,228
But please spare Li-sa.

286
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,648
I'm the one who sinned,
so why should she pay?

287
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,192
Please spare her, will you?

288
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,284
You're right.

289
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,495
Li-sa is innocent.

290
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,542
Can you really give up everything?

291
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,172
You're willing to live

292
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,176
in the prison you made for yourself
until the day you die.

293
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,137
Is that what you're saying?

294
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,591
Why are you cleaning
when you're behind on work?

295
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,301
It's squeaky clean.

296
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,513
You know how easy it is
to get distracted when you can't focus.

297
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,975
But still, this is just… Gosh.

298
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,812
You even washed your car.
You're going to be exhausted.

299
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,983
Cleaning helps me sort myself out.
I like it.

300
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,027
What brings you here?

301
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,780
Well, I haven't seen you all day.

302
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,115
Aren't you going to bed?

303
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,952
Go to bed first. Let me finish this up.

304
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,954
No one can stop you.

305
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,539
By the way, where's that painting?

306
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,419
-What?
-Our family portrait.

307
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,676
That?

308
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,263
I completely ruined it
while retouching it.

309
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,640
Why did you do that? It was already great.

310
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,808
Exactly.

311
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,311
I shouldn't have been a greedy idiot.

312
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,689
I should've been content with it.

313
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,902
But I decided to retouch it
and ruined everything.

314
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:06,033
It's okay. You can always paint it again.

315
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,702
It's all right.

316
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,033
Why did you change your mind
all of a sudden?

317
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,872
I realized I was being selfish for wanting

318
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,709
to keep Ho-su by my side.

319
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,922
This is a great opportunity for him.

320
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,718
I don't want
to be the reason he misses it.

321
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,722
Like you said,

322
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,392
Ho-su will be the one
to inherit all that you've built.

323
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:19,106
That's all the more reason…

324
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:26,072
he should be given the education you want
and I should be grateful.

325
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,208
I purchased them based on my preferences,
so it isn't very cohesive.

326
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,920
Once the gallery opens, I'd like you

327
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,173
to display them permanently,
so the visitors could enjoy them.

328
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,384
I'll leave it to you, Yun-jeong.

329
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,969
You most certainly have a keen eye.

330
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,974
These works will be enough
to fill up an entire exhibition hall.

331
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,062
I know you'll do well.

332
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,439
And my husband…

333
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,735
Mr. An will help manage it.

334
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,784
I guess this will be my last time here.

335
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:28,050
JEONG HUI-JU'S SOLO INVITATIONAL EXHIBIT

336
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,806
WE ALL HAVE A WINDOW IN OUR HEARTS

337
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,767
WE CAN EITHER STAY INDOORS
OR OPEN IT AND GO OUTSIDE

338
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,200
What made you want to come here?

339
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,163
You're the one
who introduced this food to me.

340
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,499
On the first day. Do you not remember?

341
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,086
You brought me here on our first date.

342
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,255
Gosh. You know what?

343
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,885
It was so bland.
I didn't know what I was eating,

344
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,636
but I was too famished to say no.

345
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,057
I wanted to treat you
to the tastiest dish.

346
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,609
Thank you.

347
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,237
Hold on.

348
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,493
Vinegar…

349
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,167
-Thank you.
-What?

350
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,836
Whenever I went to a buffet,

351
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,007
I was always determined
to have all the food they served there.

352
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,968
But I'd end up

353
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:57,181
filling my first plate
with gimbap and japchae.

354
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,142
So I'd be full
after having that one plate.

355
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,019
I used to be a fool like that.

356
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,358
But thanks to you,

357
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,653
I'm now able to appreciate
many great things in life.

358
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,324
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

359
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,660
Here.

360
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,378
It's so good.

361
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,968
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

362
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,921
Do you still want to break up?

363
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,300
Then just die.

364
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,026
Ma'am.

365
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,446
Don't ever forgive me.

366
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,490
Just continue

367
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,160
despising me.

368
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,537
That way,

369
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,498
you'll still see me.

370
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,752
I'm not running away.

371
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,297
I just want to do my best
for Jeong-seop's sake too.

372
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,720
You know I can't hold a candle to him.

373
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,058
You might not be satisfied
with the result,

374
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,393
but I'll try my best.

375
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,022
I'll become a better person

376
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,818
who can help others when they're in need.

377
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:27,998
Here.

378
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:32,878
This is the hospital address
I'll be working at and my number.

379
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,590
Feel free to call me anytime you want.

380
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,176
I'll call you every day too.

381
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,065
Then, take care.

382
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,057
HOME ADDRESS, HOSPITAL ADDRESS,
HOSPITAL PHONE NUMBER

383
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:32,146
HOW TO MAKE INTERNATIONAL CALLS

384
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,775
Do you think

385
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,487
he would want his friend
to live a life of suffering forever?

386
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,324
Was that the kind of person he was?

387
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,403
Honey!

388
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,077
Who are you guys?

389
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,413
-You're mistaken. I'm meeting a friend.
-Let's go.

390
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:35,083
Tell them! Gu Jeong-yeon! Hey!

391
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,295
You bitch! God damn it!

392
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:53,977
You startled me.

393
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,480
When did you come?

394
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,026
Tell me I did the right thing.

395
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,778
What?

396
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,655
Just say it to me.

397
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,909
"Jeong-yeon, well done."

398
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,374
Well done, Jeong-yeon.

399
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,628
What did you do, though?

400
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,090
My dad used to tell me

401
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:28,845
that it's foolish to say things
you don't really have to say.

402
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,182
That's why

403
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,395
I've never told Hae-won
who her dad was. And I never will.

404
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,938
Don't tell her.

405
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,817
Besides, she looks
exactly like you anyway.

406
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,531
What's wrong?

407
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,325
I don't know.

408
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,162
I don't know
how things turned out this way.

409
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,541
That's life.

410
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,168
Most of the time,

411
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,505
you're not in control
of what goes on around you.

412
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,427
Thank you.

413
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,471
What's gotten into you today?

414
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,348
And I'm really…

415
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,065
hungry.

416
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,484
Get me something to eat.

417
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,155
Okay.

418
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,240
One minute.

419
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,847
And I'm truly…

420
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,441
sorry.

421
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,203
Get up.

422
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,080
Get up.

423
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,416
Support your body with your arms.

424
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,212
You should at least have enough strength

425
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,424
to sit on the toilet by yourself,
shouldn't you?

426
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,343
Do I have to clean your shit as well?

427
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,983
I'm the one who'll be
by your side to the end.

428
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,319
Listen to me. Grab it!

429
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,283
What's wrong?

430
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,744
Offended by my tone?

431
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:48,170
Your formal tone
was much more repulsive to me.

432
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,057
Get up.

433
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:22,871
It's hot.

434
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,754
When are you leaving?

435
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,382
This weekend.

436
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,889
Why? Does it make you sad?

437
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:49,564
This is our last meal together.
We should've had something better.

438
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,274
Why is this our last meal?

439
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,568
It's not like I'm not coming back.

440
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,989
Oh, right. I have something for you.

441
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,541
Take it.

442
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,378
I'm not asking you to come with me.

443
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,756
Just feel free to come
whenever you need a break.

444
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,177
Come on.

445
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,973
You don't have to come, so just keep it.

446
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,349
Consider it insurance.

447
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,280
You came after weeks.
Are you leaving already?

448
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:41,032
You even spent the weekend on campus.
What's going on?

449
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,411
The upcoming exam is very important.
I'll come visit next week.

450
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,580
You better. I'll be waiting.

451
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,500
Are you really okay going by yourself?

452
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,877
I have company.

453
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,550
Bye.

454
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,222
Hey, what should we get to eat?

455
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,891
-Anything's good.
-Anything?

456
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,059
Let's go.

457
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,568
You should've come out to say bye.

458
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,904
I already said goodbye.

459
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,364
We hugged, and I even gave her some money.

460
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,701
Why are you packing?

461
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,746
I'll stay in Daejeon for a while.

462
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,707
There's a vacant spot
at a skincare shop there.

463
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,085
Hey, check this out.
Doesn't it look luxurious?

464
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,005
-What is it?
-What?

465
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,716
Why are you running away this time?

466
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,844
It's not like that this time.

467
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,598
It's great that
there's someone who needs me.

468
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:50,018
Besides, you're going
to move back in here.

469
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,316
Has he not called you yet?

470
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,443
Is he ghosting you again?

471
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,032
Is it over for good?

472
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,994
Yes.

473
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,414
I won't be able

474
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,875
to see him ever again.

475
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:18,004
Goodness. It's so easy for him, isn't it?

476
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,214
Never mind.

477
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,510
There's no need to get worked up over him.

478
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,722
It's for the best
to wrap things up quickly.

479
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:32,268
It's much better
than being treated like a doormat.

480
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,189
Good job.

481
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,484
Well done.

482
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,161
Ms. Gu Jeong-yeon, this is the police.

483
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,414
Ms. Gu?

484
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,839
Mom. What's going on?

485
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,152
NO FISHING, DANGER

486
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,114
It looks so dreary already.

487
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,993
This is what happens
when you stop tending to a place.

488
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,831
The dock on the other side

489
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,250
has also shut down,
so there aren't any boats there.

490
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,841
So where will you go live now?

491
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,511
I've settled in one place for too long.

492
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,097
The nomadic lifestyle
doesn't sound too bad.

493
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,934
Should I go with you?

494
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,144
As if.

495
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,814
Do you think you can leave
your kids behind and do that?

496
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,568
What will you do now?

497
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,864
Once I leave,
you'll have no one to turn to.

498
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,411
You may live a fancy lifestyle,

499
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,705
but you have no one you can lean on.

500
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,666
You don't have any parents.

501
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,419
You even sent
your one and only brother abroad.

502
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,171
What will you do now?

503
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,464
Beats me.

504
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,344
Thanks for listening to my whining
all this time.

505
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,845
I'm glad you know.

506
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,308
What about that?

507
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:39,521
There's not much I can do for you
as you embark on a new journey.

508
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,941
You know how rich I am, right?
So just take this.

509
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,110
But, that's…

510
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,237
Just take it.

511
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,406
That truck is too big
for your petite body.

512
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,325
I can't…

513
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,953
-If you don't take it--
-I'll take it.

514
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,665
I can't believe this.
You're really giving this to me?

515
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,083
Yes.

516
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,794
I love you.

517
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,645
Hey.

518
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,022
What are those flowers for?

519
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,319
What would you like?

520
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,408
Sir, let me buy you a drink today.

521
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,534
Me?

522
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,661
What for?

523
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,663
I heard about what happened with my mom.

524
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,875
She's being questioned
by the police right now,

525
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,169
so I'd like to apologize on her behalf.

526
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,089
You don't apologize
on someone else's behalf.

527
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,218
And your mom already apologized enough.

528
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,764
I'm sorry.

529
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:20,371
And I don't have the right to forgive her.

530
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,707
I was at fault too.

531
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,377
From my wife's point of view,
both your mom and me are…

532
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,505
No.

533
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,008
I'm more at fault.

534
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,805
Strictly speaking,
Jeong-yeon was also a victim.

535
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,600
But what she did was still wrong.

536
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,686
So she needs to pay for it.

537
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,271
That's best for her too.

538
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,440
That way, she can start afresh.

539
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:01,287
She won't be coming back here again.

540
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,042
I told you.

541
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,795
She flees when she's in a tough spot.

542
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,143
-Do you want to make a bet?
-What?

543
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:28,106
I won't be leaving here anytime soon,
so I'll wait for her.

544
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,733
I have a knack for waiting.

545
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,819
You can treat me then.

546
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,238
To the most expensive and oldest drink.

547
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:38,575
Mr. Yoon, do you like…

548
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:44,330
Because of my work,
it's hard for me to trust anyone.

549
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:49,002
Trust leads to expectation,
which leads to disappointment.

550
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:53,423
But Jeong-yeon keeps trusting
no matter how many times she's betrayed.

551
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,595
And it may look foolish,
but it takes a lot of courage.

552
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,890
So I'm going to trust her.

553
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:10,273
The loser buys
that 40-year-old liquor, okay?

554
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,745
RICE & BAR

555
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,171
RICE MEAL

556
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,921
When will you be leaving?

557
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,758
Just one more night.

558
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:23,262
Let me spend one more night
with the kids, and then I'll leave.

559
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,268
You said I wouldn't know

560
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,397
how a mother would feel, right?

561
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,569
But I think I do.

562
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,746
I also had a chance
to become a mother once.

563
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,012
Were you…

564
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,557
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.

565
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,521
I just wanted to tell you that.

566
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,696
You should go.

567
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:52,769
While packing my bag, I found this.

568
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,646
I don't need it.

569
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:58,649
I just wanted you to know

570
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:03,029
how brightly you used to shine

571
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,072
and how…

572
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,451
jealous I was of you.

573
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,183
It's okay.

574
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,646
It's okay.

575
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,025
Honey.

576
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,158
What…

577
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,835
Sir, there's something you need to see.

578
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,380
Ma'am, check this out.

579
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,465
Goodness.

580
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,592
Is that why--

581
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,137
What is it? Is there something you know?

582
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,430
No, nothing.

583
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,099
-We're a bit dumbfounded too.
-Hello.

584
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,561
Even I'm confused about what's going on.

585
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:04,895
Yes.

586
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,946
Where's Woo-jae?

587
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,366
Where is he?

588
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,369
I haven't seen him in days.

589
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,788
And the studio is a mess.

590
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:23,998
What's going on?

591
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:27,168
What are you two scheming this time?

592
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,378
Whatever it is,
it has nothing to do with me.

593
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,761
I can't reach Hui-ju.

594
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:41,599
Something must be going on.

595
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,560
Call Woo-jae.

596
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:47,730
I'm sure that bastard
did something to her again.

597
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:51,025
Ms. Gu. Please.

598
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,530
Hui-ju could be in danger right now.

599
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,245
Is that what you think?

600
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,542
Does it seem to you
he kidnapped her or something?

601
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,297
Hui-ju and Woo-jae…

602
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,341
Those two

603
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,886
left with each other again.

604
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,305
What?

605
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:26,560
You're wrong.

606
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,397
Hui-ju left of her own volition.

607
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:32,233
No one forced her.

608
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,529
What are you… No. You're wrong.

609
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,656
Why would she leave her family? Her kids?

610
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:40,241
She did it back then too.

611
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,994
What's stopping them from doing it again?

612
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,375
She must've felt guilty this time,

613
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,086
seeing how she sent me a text.

614
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:54,505
Lies. Don't lie to me!

615
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,884
Would you like to read it?

616
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:16,152
WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW OUR HEARTS
I'M SORRY. PLEASE DON'T LOOK FOR US.

617
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:20,656
You don't want to believe it, do you?
You think it makes no sense, don't you?

618
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,870
Oftentimes, the truth

619
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,456
is more painful and shocking than any lie.

620
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,461
Woo-jae…

621
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:42,136
He left everything behind just for her.

622
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,890
And I don't plan on
looking for him this time.

623
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,658
If this turns out to be a lie,

624
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,121
I'll kill both of you.

625
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,350
I just wanted you to know

626
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:33,729
how brightly you used to shine…

627
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,525
and how…

628
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,695
jealous I was of you.

629
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:13,495
How dare that crazy bitch do this to us?

630
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,249
She closed her bank account
and credit cards.

631
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,044
Her phone has been disconnected
since last night.

632
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:25,466
She already filled out a form to hand over
her art collection to the new gallery.

633
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:28,677
And she only took the dashcam footage
leaving her car behind.

634
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,971
Check thoroughly again.

635
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,182
Make sure
she didn't take anything that's mine.

636
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,227
Don't let any more news come out
about her disappearance.

637
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,229
Get Li-sa ready to study abroad as well.

638
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,982
People are going to gossip
about that bitch.

639
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,692
She doesn't need to hear that.

640
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:47,279
And you.

641
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,698
Don't you dare go looking for her.

642
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,576
Everyone needs to think
that we kicked her out!

643
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:56,872
She should've knelt down
and begged for my mercy.

644
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,458
How dare that crude bitch
run away instead?

645
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:03,796
She's impudent to the very end!
What does she take me for?

646
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,471
If anything,
I should be the one to get mad.

647
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:15,182
So, please…

648
01:13:17,684 --> 01:13:18,977
be quiet.

649
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,084
Hello?

650
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:45,337
You're leaving today, right?

651
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,174
Are you at the airport?

652
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,134
Yes, Hyeon-seong.

653
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,345
Thank you for this. I'll do my best there.

654
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,307
And your sister…

655
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:01,728
We talked yesterday.
She said she wouldn't come to the airport.

656
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:06,817
You know how nonchalant she can be
once she makes a decision.

657
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,239
Right. That's her.

658
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,660
Have a safe trip.

659
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,581
Call me when you get there.

660
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:29,816
Have you gotten in touch with Mr. Seo?

661
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:32,194
No.

662
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:37,407
I'm sure you tried too.
That's probably why you reached out to me.

663
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,576
We're quite flustered too.

664
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,371
This is really affecting the project.

665
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,957
Mr. Woo isn't happy

666
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,668
about all those rumors
going on around his project.

667
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:51,672
I'll hand over all his work and drafts
regarding the project.

668
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,217
You can remove his name.

669
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:01,640
Please get rid of all his work
at the gallery too.

670
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,560
But is that what he…

671
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:08,230
He left before he could finish anything.

672
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:10,524
It's the price he must pay.

673
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,653
But still, what if he returns?

674
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,365
No.

675
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,911
He won't return.

676
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,528
Hey, you picked up.

677
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:00,657
You're leaving today, right?

678
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,575
Yes.

679
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,243
Well…

680
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,706
You didn't throw out
the ticket I gave you, did you?

681
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,043
No. It'd be a waste.

682
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:15,547
I'll wait for you.

683
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,220
Don't wait. I won't be going.

684
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:25,390
Then I'll just come back.

685
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:29,269
Take care of yourself until then.

686
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:32,272
And thank you for picking up.

687
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:34,941
I wanted to see you one last time,
but I held myself back.

688
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,113
Do you still have time?

689
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:41,448
What?

690
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,159
Wait there. I'll say goodbye in person.

691
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:20,654
I totally forgot…

692
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:26,535
that I was the very person
who took everything from you.

693
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:37,796
As I expected,
will my story never have a happy ending?

694
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:43,301
I wanted to forget everything
and start anew.

695
01:18:44,302 --> 01:18:48,598
My real story hasn't even begun yet.

696
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:53,770
Is this how it all ends?

697
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,909
I have yet to find any traces of her.

698
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:11,580
The good news is that there haven't been

699
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:14,124
any Jane Does around her age.

700
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:15,459
SEOUL, GYEONGGI MAP

701
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,587
It's quite probable
that she covered up her traces

702
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:20,630
and left of her own volition.

703
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:24,718
I'll look for her in other ways too.

704
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,261
Don't.

705
01:19:30,515 --> 01:19:31,725
Let's stop here.

706
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:53,497
Have you really not heard from her?

707
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:01,588
You came here for nothing.

708
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,886
If she calls, please let me know.

709
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:11,473
No. If she calls me, I'll--

710
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:12,557
No.

711
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,393
She won't call.

712
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:23,235
She abandoned her own kids for some guy.

713
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,825
I doubt she'll call her friend.

714
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:33,036
I don't believe
that Hui-ju would leave for an affair.

715
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,623
She poured her heart out to me.

716
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:40,544
She truly regretted
what she had done in the past.

717
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:42,921
Her feelings were genuine.
I can guarantee that.

718
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,884
But she ran away with him out of the blue?

719
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,387
That's not what happened.

720
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:54,558
I'm sure there was another reason--

721
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:56,268
I don't care about the reason.

722
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:59,437
I don't care where she is
or whom she's with.

723
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,438
Because--

724
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:07,362
No matter how terrible the situation,

725
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:15,161
it doesn't change the fact
that she left me without saying…

726
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:22,168
a single word.

727
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:06,129
I hope you're not still
wasting your time looking for her.

728
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,634
We reported her missing
but still couldn't find her.

729
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:13,887
She's determined to stay hidden
in this tiny country.

730
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:17,974
Who knows? Maybe the rumors
about their committing suicide are true.

731
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,310
I understand.

732
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,145
Dad.

733
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:23,813
Ho-su.

734
01:22:26,983 --> 01:22:28,026
Where's Li-sa?

735
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:35,992
Li-sa.

736
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,328
Will you…

737
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:44,417
really be okay?

738
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:47,796
Yes. I'm sick and tired of this place.

739
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:55,553
Why would you ask her that now?
She'll only cause trouble if she stays.

740
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:58,932
Ho-su.

741
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,644
I'll fly over soon. I promise.

742
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,062
Go first with Grandma.

743
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,275
Due to a meeting,
I can't go to the airport.

744
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:10,652
I'll visit next month.

745
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:38,221
You're so relentless every morning.

746
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,016
Lugging around that half-wit…

747
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:45,645
Take good care of the hospital
while I'm gone.

748
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,605
I'll fly back
as soon as the kids get situated.

749
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,692
Don't you worry. Haven't I proven enough?

750
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,403
You should've been like this sooner.

751
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:56,656
But then again, you do take after me.

752
01:23:57,782 --> 01:24:00,910
You should go.
I have a directorate meeting to attend.

753
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,330
Bye. See you during the break.

754
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,043
Li-sa, make sure Ho-su takes his medicine.

755
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:21,347
When will you put an end
to this pity party of yours?

756
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,016
There's plenty of women lined up for you.

757
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:25,602
Min-seo.

758
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:30,982
Never mind.

759
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:34,277
Will you be okay?

760
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,989
Management was never your forte.

761
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:47,290
With each gain, there comes a loss.

762
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:57,235
A FEW YEARS LATER

763
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:08,705
You have long, beautiful fingers.

764
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:13,543
I used to be beautiful at your age too.

765
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,422
You're still so young,

766
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:20,592
why are you working here,
taking care of old people?

767
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,513
I like it here.

768
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,391
You like it here? Don't be like that.

769
01:26:28,474 --> 01:26:31,769
Go out there and enjoy your life.

770
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:36,065
This is nothing short of a prison.

771
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:38,693
There's nothing…

772
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:41,696
that I can enjoy or have

773
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:45,325
that's better than this.

774
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:47,577
Goodness, gracious.

775
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:51,206
If my legs were stronger,
I'd rush out of here in an instant.

776
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:53,374
I'm sick of this place.

777
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,419
Every day is excruciatingly long.

778
01:26:56,502 --> 01:27:00,298
That's why you should reconcile
with Jeong-suk.

779
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,675
You always argue out of nowhere.

780
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:06,137
She keeps rubbing me the wrong way.

781
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,348
She only treats me well when she's happy

782
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:10,516
and always complains about her life.

783
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:15,313
No matter how old you are,
you still hate and get jealous, you know?

784
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,982
But she's so self-centered.

785
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:19,567
It's irritating.

786
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:28,344
GU HAE-WON, FIRST SOLO EXHIBITION

787
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:35,268
GU HAE-WON, FIRST SOLO EXHIBITION

788
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:42,233
I finally saw you again
after a very long time.

789
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:49,449
And you had just begun your story.

790
01:28:52,952 --> 01:28:55,496
It's now time for my story to end.

791
01:28:56,289 --> 01:29:00,251
CLOSED
FISHING AREA NO LONGER IN BUSINESS

792
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:08,968
DANGER
DO NOT ENTER

793
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:28,613
THIS ACCOUNT IS PRIVATE

794
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,518
It's not hell just yet.

795
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:04,440
My story ends here.

796
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:12,860
