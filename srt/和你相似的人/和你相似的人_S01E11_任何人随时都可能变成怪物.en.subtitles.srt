1
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,817
Look at this.

2
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,778
-Which color do you want?
-Look at this.

3
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,237
Where are you?

4
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,324
-What? You're not sure?
-Where are you?

5
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,785
-What do you want?
-Hey. Look at this.

6
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,496
-Don't touch that. Put that back.
-That's not for boys.

7
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,209
Look at this.
They came and put this up again.

8
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,544
They are going to start tomorrow.

9
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,257
Where could I go
when I haven't been compensated yet?

10
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,011
On top of that, that jerk An Hyeon-seong
isn't answering my calls.

11
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,056
He is looking down on me. I know he is.

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,559
I shouldn't have signed

13
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,686
the consent form that easily.

14
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,271
I shouldn't have signed it.

15
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,858
If you didn't sign it,
you wouldn't even be here.

16
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,402
I even went to see him at school.

17
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,948
But they stopped me at the main gate.
They treated me like some criminal.

18
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,117
For matters like this,

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,537
you must talk to each other
face to face to prevent misunderstandings.

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,831
They wouldn't
even let me enter the school!

21
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,499
Then go to his house.

22
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,840
It's his son's birthday tomorrow.
A lot of people will come to the party.

23
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,050
He won't be able
to kick you out that easily.

24
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,127
Clearly, something inside me is broken.

25
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,719
Don't do it.

26
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,265
Don't do what?

27
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,058
Whatever it is.

28
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,315
Don't do whatever it is
you're planning right now.

29
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,364
I can tell when someone is
about to make a big mistake.

30
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,116
I always have.

31
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,166
I should go.

32
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,584
You don't want to either.

33
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,463
Then nothing will change
even if you do it.

34
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,886
I know.

35
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,228
I know.

36
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,233
I know that I cannot undo
what already happened, but I can't stop.

37
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,904
TO HUI-JU

38
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:02,450
In the end,
my story won't have a happy ending.

39
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,542
I'll rip you to shreds!

40
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,420
Gu Hae-won! Where are you?

41
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,631
Give me my son back!

42
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,758
Ho-su!

43
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,813
EPISODE 11
ANYONE, ANYTIME, CAN BE A MONSTER

44
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,277
I heard that Dracula
and vampires are totally different.

45
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,863
My friends keep telling me
that I should be a vampire.

46
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:45,118
But they don't know
that Dracula only sucks on women's blood.

47
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,706
What's more,
Dracula is actually the son of a dragon.

48
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,208
I'm the only one
who knows that at my kindergarten.

49
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,545
My dad told me all about it.

50
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,048
So their fangs are big andâ€¦

51
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,008
What?

52
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,511
My house isn't this way.

53
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,309
Dracula shouldn't wear silver bracelets.

54
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,103
He burns if he comes into contact
with silver or sunlight.

55
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,401
You talk too much just like your dad.

56
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:24,574
Mister! You're here
for my birthday party, right?

57
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,410
Mister!

58
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,169
What's going on here?

59
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,713
Go ask security.

60
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,299
Get them to show us more footage
besides this one.

61
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,925
I asked what you were doing.

62
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,594
Ho-su isn't home yet.

63
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,763
He's probably playing--

64
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,474
His kindergarten teacher saw
this man taking Ho-su.

65
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,559
We should call the police first.

66
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,936
Don't make a fuss. Nothing happened yet.

67
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,897
The guests are waiting.

68
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,733
-Tell them to eat first as he's late.
-Mother--

69
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,527
Close acquaintances
will be the first ones to gossip.

70
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,613
Those close to you can be the harshest.

71
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,074
No need to give them fodder for gossip.

72
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,243
Let's look for him
in the immediate area first.

73
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,460
Hui-ju.

74
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,671
Look! A clown!

75
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,092
Kids, don't run. You can't run here.

76
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,302
Gosh. It's pretty chaotic, isn't it?

77
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,763
-Yes.
-You put on an amazing party.

78
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,557
-Thanks. Please enjoy the party.
-We are enjoying it.

79
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,646
-Ms. Jeong.
-Where is she?

80
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,563
Pardon?

81
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,067
Where's Gu Hae-won?

82
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,570
She's taking the morning off.
She'll be here later today.

83
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,366
There she is.

84
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,251
I told you I'd kill you
if you touched my child.

85
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,336
What are you talking about, Hui-ju?

86
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,840
People are watching.
Are you sure about this?

87
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,969
-Ms. Jeong!
-Where is my son?

88
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,055
Ms. Jeong, what are you doing?

89
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,182
Let go and talk it out.

90
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,602
Where are you?

91
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,313
What about Ho-su?

92
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,443
The costume of the man who took Ho-su
wasn't from the event agency.

93
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,654
I called the police. Come back home--

94
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,532
No. You come here.

95
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,117
I'm going to find Ho-su.

96
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,624
The GPS on her phone
was on the whole time,

97
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,918
so we confirmed that
she was around your house.

98
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,338
But she was using public transportation
when your son was dropped off.

99
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,383
And the duration matches
the duration of her commute to work.

100
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,261
I'll call you once we check
the camera on the bus.

101
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,805
-You can go home now.
-Why are you letting her go?

102
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,726
What about her call history?
She could've gotten someone else to do it.

103
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,563
Ma'am, we don't have any witnesses
or evidence that she kidnapped your son.

104
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,523
We cannot hold her here.

105
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,318
And by being here,
she's cooperated with the investigation.

106
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,570
I'll help you too.

107
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,656
I'm good at finding people.

108
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,331
You should answer your phone.

00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,001
JU-YEONG'S FATHER LEE IL-SEONG

110
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,138
I want you to also feel the pain
of having the most precious person

111
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,265
stolen from you.

112
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,602
But I don't think that's your husband.

113
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,481
Stop her. It's her. She took Ho-su.

114
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,067
Where did you take him? Where is my son?

DIRECTOR LEE JEONG-EUN

117
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,710
-Hello?
-Mr. Seo. Is Ms. Gu all right?

118
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,172
Have you talked to Ms. Jeong?

119
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,676
Did something happen
between Hae-won and Ms. Jeong?

120
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,678
I guess you haven't heard.

121
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,764
You should call Ms. Gu right now.

122
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,069

TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

125
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,552
What are you doing here?

126
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,391
Going to his house was pointless.

127
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,810
He still won't answer my calls.

128
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,861
Then call him until he answers.

129
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,531
You must make him come
and see what he's done.

130
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,493
When talking doesn't work,
you must make him see it.

131
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,591
Get a grip.

132
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,221
How can I get a grip right now?

133
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,726
And what's with you, Mother?
You dote on Ho-su.

134
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,895
How could you be so calm?

135
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,855
Worrying about it doesn't solve anything.

136
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,483
You must stay cool-headed
at times like these.

137
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,193
What if they demand a ransom?

138
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,410
Did you just laugh? Have you gone mad?

139
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,331
Did you just laugh
after you failed to keep your child safe?

140
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,418
Things must be so convenient for you.

141
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,129
What?

142
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,423
You can just adore Ho-su

143
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,719
and blame me, his mom,
for everything that's gone wrong.

144
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,181
-Hey!
-Mom! That's enough.

145
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,351
What did I do? She's lost her mind.

146
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,895
She forgot her place
and is talking back to me.

147
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,899
Tell us if there's anyone with a grudge
against you who'd do something like this.

148
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,611
I'm sure they're after money.

149
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,155
Why do you think they chose
a boy from a rich family?

150
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,740
For God's sake.

151
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,540
You must answer every phone call you get.

152
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,624
Okay.

153
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,212
You should answer your phone.

00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,788
Ms. Jeong, it's me.

00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,081
-Where areâ€¦
-Where are you?

00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,170
-Are you with Hae-won?
-Is Hae-won--

161
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,049
I just got a call from Ms. Lee.

162
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,384
What happened?

163
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,181
It's my son's birthday today.

164
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,725
Hae-won came to see me.

165
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,642
Today of all days.

166
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,854
-Ms. Jeong.
-Nothing was wrong until she showed up.

167
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,148
-Ms. Jeong?
-But Ho-su

168
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,400
went missing!

169
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,777
What are you talking about?

170
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,783
Can you please look into this?

171
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,077
You live with her. Please?

172
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,748
I'm on my way to see her now.

173
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,084
-I will talk to her first. And I--
-Where is she?

174
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,878
I'll go there too. Where?

175
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,047
I'm not sure what happened yet.

176
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,382
So I'll call you
after I look into this first.

177
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,009
How can I trust you?

178
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,512
How can I trust you two?

179
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,056
Damn it.

180
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,911
Damn it.

181
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,414
Damn it.

182
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,416
Stop it.

183
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,794
Don't touch that. No!

184
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,549
No!

185
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,151
Where is he? Ho-su.

186
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:27,783
It was the 3-cushion Championship final
against an Italian player named Vito.

187
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,621
You see, Vito was
the world champion at the time.

188
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,039
Ho-su.

189
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,500
-At the beginning of the final match,
-Ho-su.

190
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,296
He got three shots of nine points
in a row. It was a slugfest.

191
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,924
Vito went second.

192
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,344
And until the fourth inning,
he was seven points ahead.

193
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,471
Everyone said I would lose the match.

194
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,808
But from the tenth inning onward,

195
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,977
he kept missing his shots.

196
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,896
But that's when I startedâ€¦

197
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,525
my ten-point scoring streak
and kept making high runs.

198
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:06,155
I kept making high runs!

199
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,283
I kept making high runsâ€¦

200
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,577
I kept making high runs, you know.

201
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,580
Do you need money?

202
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,541
I'll give you money.

203
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,836
Where's my son?

204
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,049
I was the first Asian pool player
to beat a world champion.

205
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,843
Cut the crap and tell me! Where is my son?

206
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,057
Where is he?

207
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,980
Mr. An.

208
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,150
I think you are mistaken.

209
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,654
I'm the one who talks here.

210
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,491
You should listen to what I have to say.

211
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452
I will.

212
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,038
I will listen to you.

213
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,498
Butâ€¦

214
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,503
you will have to tell me
only what I'm interested in.

215
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,634
I can put up with your disgusting nature,

216
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,552
but I won't let you take what's mine.

217
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,597
Bullshit.

218
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,559
You're not a good father either.

219
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,437
Even in this situation,

220
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,400
you care more
about your pride than your child.

221
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,779
How are you any different from me?

222
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,077
How are you any different from me?

223
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,621
How are you any different?

224
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,128
You see, Ho-su is my son.

225
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,549
And I'm supposed to keep him safe.

226
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,885
But if I fail,

227
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,349
I will show you
how you and I are different. You bastard.

228
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,310
Where's Ho-su? Where is he?

229
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,480
-Where is Ho-su?
-Calm down.

230
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,608
-Where is he?
-You're just like me.

231
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,235
-Calm down.
-How are weâ€¦

232
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,572
How are we any different?
How are we different?

233
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,298
TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

234
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,388
Why are you here?

235
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,808
Answer me.

236
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,938
-Let go. Then we can talk.
-Answer me first.

237
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,276
Did you find Ho-su? Is he all right?

238
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,779
That's none of your concern--

239
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:54,990
How did you know?

240
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,867
Where is Ms. Jeong?

241
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,119
I need to talk to her--

242
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,002
You dare ask me againâ€¦

243
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,172
about Hui-ju?

244
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,550
"Again"?

245
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,728
Sir, we need you to come in.

246
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,585
Mr. Lee, tell me where you've been
since 11 a.m. on the 10th.

247
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,464
We confirmed that
you kept trying to contact

248
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,342
the victim's father for several days
before the kidnapping.

249
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,803
Was there a reason behind these calls?

250
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,181
Mr. Lee.

251
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,308
Did you hold a grudge
about the demolition?

252
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,310
-Is that why you planned this?
-I got it.

253
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,647
Mr. Lee. As of this moment,

254
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,441
I'm arresting you as a suspect,
not a person of interest.

255
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,696
You have the right to defend yourself
and hire a lawyer.

256
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,116
Wait. Why are you saying
I'm the only one who messed up here?

257
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,869
He's the one who made a mistake
to begin with.

258
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,497
Are there different sets of laws
for different people?

259
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,042
You must pray to God
that my son comes back safely.

260
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,669
Take him away.

261
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,382
Sir, I'll compensate you for everything.

262
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,009
I'll do whatever you want.

263
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,304
Please tell me where Ho-su is.

264
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,471
I don't know.

265
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,224
I'm begging you.
Please tell me where he is.

266
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,643
Tell me where he is.
I'll do everything you ask.

267
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,812
I swear to you. I'll do anything.

268
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,148
-I really don't know.
-Sir, please.

269
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,233
-Let's go.
-Sir.

270
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,234
Sir.

271
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,533
You need to explain to me

272
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,911
why you are here at this exact moment.

273
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:08,207
There's no way that dumb man
planned the whole thing by himself.

274
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,835
Hae-won made him do it.
Hae-won is behind this!

275
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,337
You knew, didn't you?

276
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,632
You said you'd go see her.
Why are you here? What did she say?

277
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,425
I'll look for your son too.

278
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,968
I'll ask Hae-won.

279
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,805
I'm worried about him too.
Please believe me.

280
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,478
The police will investigate this.
Why don't youâ€¦

281
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,813
You told me!

282
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,941
You said Hae-won has been coming here!

283
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,235
You said people like them
tend to get attached

284
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,695
to teachers who give them attention.

285
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,198
What about our son? I'm so sorry to Ho-su!

286
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,534
Do something! Find Ho-su!
How am I going to find him?

287
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,788
I feel so awful for him. Ho-su!

288
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,000
How can I just wait?

289
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,137
Are you cold?

290
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,396
You're all right now.
The bad man isn't here anymore.

291
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,818
Your clothes got dirty.
Let's throw them out.

292
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,447
How they got dirty will be our secret.

293
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,868
Even I make mistakes when I'm scared.

294
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,121
Do you want to get dressed?

295
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,756
All good.

296
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,327
You're right on time.

297
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,537
What are youâ€¦

298
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,420
-What are you doing?
-That's what I should ask you.

299
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,547
Do you know what's going on right now?

300
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,676
She just couldn't be patient.
I guess she called you.

301
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,802
Hae-won!

302
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,349
It's all right. He's not a scary man.

303
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,022
He's already scared.
You're scaring him more.

304
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,448
I'm sorry. Ho-su, you remember me. Right?

305
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,283
We met at the ballpark.

306
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,162
Let's go home. Your parents are worried.

307
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:54,915
Okay?

308
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,552
Ho-su.

309
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,764
Happy birthday.

310
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,508
Who was it?

311
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,014
Spit it out.

312
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,685
The demolition process began

313
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,063
at the building where the gallery will be.

314
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,190
And a tenant held a grudge for it.

315
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,485
Those lowlifes.

316
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,863
What about Ho-su?

317
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,158
-No news yet.
-What about Hyeon-seong?

318
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,078
He's stopping by the police station.

319
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,338
JU-YEONG

320
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,756
Where are you?

321
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,051
Your father got arrested
for kidnapping my brother.

322
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,888
Has he gone mad? Where is my brother?

323
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,183
Why are you asking me that?

324
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,605
Have you gone mad too? He's your dad.

325
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,568
Hey, answer me.

326
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,613
What, are you in on it with him?

327
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,953
You're Ju-yeong, right?

328
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,497
Hello.

329
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,832
Do you want tteokbokki?

330
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,919
Yes.

331
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,921
Good. I wanted fritters and sundae too.

332
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,923
I'll order everything then.

333
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,425
Let's order four fried seaweed rolls.

334
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,539
Ho-su!

335
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,793
Ho-su.

336
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,878
Ho-su.

337
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,259
Children are open books.

338
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,054
They always follow their instincts
and act accordingly.

339
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,268
It's only been half a day.
But wasn't it awful?

340
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,020
I know how it feels.

341
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,523
How it feels to lose someone.

342
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,733
Do you?

343
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,945
What do you know?

344
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,744
I'm glad that your son is all right.

345
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,955
I said I would help you.

346
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,331
Shut up.

347
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,335
Ho-su. Let me look at you.

348
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,547
My goodness. Ho-su.

349
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,924
Explain this to me.

350
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:37,637
I begged Mr. Lee to do the right thing
because Ho-su didn't do anything wrong.

351
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,264
Shut your mouth!

352
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,438
Ho-su wasn't there at the billiard hall.

353
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,190
It means that
you took him before I got there.

354
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,067
After leaving the police station,

355
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,278
I went to see Mr. Lee right away.

356
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,449
He was upset when they suddenly began
demolishing the building. So I wondered--

357
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,160
Then shouldn't you
have called us or the police first?

358
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,208
Mother.

359
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,337
-Mother. Ho-suâ€¦
-Let's go, Ho-su.

360
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,464
Mother.

361
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,300
Mother.

362
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,972
What happened? She said
she couldn't reach the two of you.

363
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,851
Ms. Gu called us
to tell us she'd found Ho-su.

364
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:35,028
I told you,
you should've answered your phone.

365
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,323
I'm sorry.

366
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,241
Why are you sorry?

367
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,578
We shouldn't be apologizing.

368
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,747
Those people should be thanking us.

369
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,377
Go home. It's late. Let's talk about this
at the police station tomorrow.

370
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,309
Gosh.

371
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,984
What are you doing?

372
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,655
These aren't the clothes I put on him.

373
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,329
Ho-suâ€¦

374
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,876
Those two outside.
Who are they involved with?

375
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,004
You or her?

376
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,104
Explain this to me.
I can't just let this slide.

377
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,939
But it's none of your concern.

378
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,233
How could you do that?

379
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:58,737
A man who held a grudge against them
used their son with bad intentions.

380
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,157
Luckily, that boy's back home safely.

381
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:07,120
As for the ruined birthday party,
he'll have many years to do it over.

382
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,083
Many kids die without celebrating
their birthdays even once.

383
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,378
All right?

384
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,046
This isn't that simple.

385
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,800
"Simple"? How is any of this simple?

386
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,051
"Luckily"?

387
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,096
Have you thought about his family
who was worried sick all day?

388
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,015
It's their burden to carry.

389
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,102
And you're not their family. You're mine.

390
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,150
I'm leaving. I need to stop by somewhere.

391
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,103
I thought all the trouble
I went through as a kid made me tough.

392
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,440
That's how I accepted it

393
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,151
because I couldn't help it.

394
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,614
But I don't have to go through it here.

395
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,951
We can easily
avoid everything bad. But whyâ€¦

396
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,578
I'm scared.

397
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,582
If I had to give up my limbs
to keep him safe, I would do it.

398
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:41,422
I'm so scared that my kids might
get hurt because of me.

399
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,633
Where's my mom?

400
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,387
She went out after a phone call.

401
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,931
She's not back yet?

402
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,266
She'll be back.

403
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,021
Ms. Gu.

404
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:42,692
Did Li-sa's brother go home?

405
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,986
Yes. He did.

406
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,989
That's good.

407
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,992
What about my dad?

408
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,833
Don't go to the billiard hall again.

409
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,960
It's too dangerous there now.

410
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,254
Okay.

411
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:04,923
Right.

412
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,677
I signed it.

413
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,684
PETITION FOR GUARDIANSHIP OF A MINOR

414
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,021
AS THE MINOR HAS NO OTHER FAMILY,
APPOINT THE PETITIONER AS A GUARDIAN

415
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,065
PETITIONER: GU HAE-WON
MINOR: LEE JU-YEONG

416
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,485
Are you sure about this?

417
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,322
Probably.

418
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,407
This is not the time to act tough.

419
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,243
It's really important.

420
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,996
It can determine your future.

421
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,582
I know.

422
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,503
It was scary to live alone
while my dad was away.

423
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,798
But oddly enough, I wasn't anxious.

424
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,425
It was more comfortable.

425
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,513
I'll pretend I don't have a father.

426
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,063
-Ju-yeong.
-Without the recent events,

427
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,192
I wouldn't have even known
that my mother was dead.

428
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,739
He wronged me too.

429
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,910
He lied about how
she abandoned me and left home.

430
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,248
He's responsible
for making me hate my mom.

431
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,960
He ought to be punished for that.

432
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,028
What are you doing still up?

433
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,905
Grandma told me to throw them out
because they're bad luck.

434
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,490
But I was curious.

435
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,666
TO HUI-JU

436
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,260
What's this? Did you open this?

437
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,387
No. What is it?

438
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,684
TO HUI-JU

439
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,453
Did the man

440
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,457
take you like this?

441
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,752
Yes.

442
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,712
And did the man

443
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,090
tie your hands like this?

444
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:54,842
Yes.

445
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,428
You must have been frustrated.

446
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,056
But you were a brave boy.

447
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,687
Have you always been close to this lady?

448
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,900
She and I are close.

449
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,276
Did she say

450
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,571
any mean things to you
or do bad things to you?

451
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,283
She's not a bad person.

452
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,041
Hui-ju, are you all right?

453
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,211
You didn't get any sleep, right?
You look tired. Sit here.

454
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,672
Drink some warm water.

455
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,217
-Here.
-Okay.

456
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,933
What happened? Where's Hyeon-seong?

457
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,479
I came alone because he had to stay
a bit longer to make a statement.

458
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,982
What about Mr. Seo?

459
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,110
Didn't Mr. Seo
and his wife bring him home?

460
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,488
Strangers found him
when his parents and the police couldn't?

461
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,907
Isn't that more suspicious?

462
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:04,162
Without Lee Il-seong's testimony,

463
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,414
it's hard to prove her connection.

464
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,084
And even if he claims
she instigated the whole thing

465
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,128
and she's an accomplice,

466
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,505
it will be a groundless claim
without any evidence.

467
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,840
On top of thatâ€¦

468
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,763
What have you done, Mr. Lee?

469
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,934
This is the recording file
Ms. Gu submitted to the police today.

470
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,061
He's become a suspect

471
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,481
in another criminal case
while his criminal case is still ongoing.

472
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,609
So he'll face a heavier sentence.

473
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,574
That jerk is not answering my calls.

474
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,618
He's not answering.

475
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,204
He still won't answer my calls.

476
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,540
Still, you can't just take his son.

477
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,169
Ms. Gu.

478
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,880
You've made a terrible mistake.

479
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,799
I told you to go meet with him.

480
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,010
I never told you to take his son.

481
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,805
But I wasâ€¦ What happened wasâ€¦

482
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,476
He didn't see your face, did he?

483
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,393
What?

484
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,105
No. With that thing you gave me
the other day--

485
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,523
That's a relief.

486
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,027
You should stop dragging
his son into this matter.

487
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,113
And you should make
your demands clear to Mr. An.

488
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,909
After all, the school is
the cause of all this.

489
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,501
Those people will use
this incident as a chance

490
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,254
to ruin your life,
so you can never go against them again.

491
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,839
And they'll even use Ju-yeong to do that.

492
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:43,469
What? Then why wouldn't I do
the same to them?

493
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,721
They ruined my family!

494
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,556
They ought to feel what it's like too.

495
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,601
They'll sell anything for money.
So they'll realize their mistake

496
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,728
once their son is sold off somewhere too!

497
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,942
Damn it.

498
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,571
I can understand your desperation.

499
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,618
No one's tried
to listen to your side of the story.

500
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,871
That's why
you must have made this decision.

501
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,583
You know, I wasn't going toâ€¦

502
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,837
I didn't want to take things this far.
You know that.

503
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,298
Of course.

504
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,552
You didn't want the boy
to get hurt either. Right?

505
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,889
Even if things don't work out for you,

506
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,935
I'll make sure you get
the compensation money you want.

507
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,479
Trust me.

508
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,405
Where is the boy now?

509
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,659
Don't be a monster who steals a child

510
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:53,164
from his parents. Don't steal
the most important thing in their world.

511
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,379
You're all right.

512
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:02,631
You're okay.

513
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,050
YOU CAN OWN A TOWNHOUSE TOO!
PROPERTY SALE AGREEMENT

514
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,135
So did you think about it?

515
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:10,097
There's only one unit left.
I just don't want you to lose your chance.

516
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:19,648
I see. Okay. I'll hold it until tomorrow.

517
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,527
Then I'll call you tomorrow again. Bye.

518
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,239
Jeong-yeon.

519
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,450
Who's that?

520
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:37,249
She's a student Hae-won used to teach.
She wants me to look after her.

521
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,668
She's a student.
She should be at school now.

522
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,506
I don't know.
I'm sure there's a good reason for it.

523
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,218
What's that?

524
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,182
Right! I didn't tell you about this.

525
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,353
I used the deposit from my house
to buy land there.

526
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,522
The price went up tenfold in the last run.

527
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,359
You can invest with as little
as 30 million won. But for you â€¦

528
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:04,985
No.

529
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,280
Never mind.

530
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,324
Why not?

531
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,661
I have money too.
You said it went up tenfold.

532
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,541
Let me try it out first.

533
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,751
If it doesn't work out,
Hae-won will scold me.

534
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,676
Yes, ma'am. Did you think about it?

535
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,264
Of course. You saw my contract too.

536
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,807
Yes.

537
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,060
TO HUI-JU

538
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,228
You left this, right?

539
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,731
I doubt that you gave me
an empty envelope. What's this about?

540
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,194
You didn't see what was inside? Why not?

541
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,619
I asked what was inside.

542
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,206
You'll be in trouble
if someone else sees it.

543
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,462
Answer my question.

544
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,689
When they returned Woo-jae's belongings,

545
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,649
there was only a single photo.

546
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,546
I think it looked something like this.

547
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,057
Do you recognize it?

548
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,528
When I saw that photo, I wonderedâ€¦

549
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,532
if you went together,

550
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,618
if you ran into each other thereâ€¦

551
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:23,457
and who that baby was.

552
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,131
After guessing what happened,
I tried to understand you two.

553
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,011
I told myself that
you wouldn't do that to meâ€¦

554
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,307
because I really liked you.

555
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,478
The thought that you might die
before me because you're older,

556
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,691
and the thought
of living my life without youâ€¦

557
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,904
was enough to make me sad.

558
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,037
But now I think,
"She'll probably die before me."

559
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,581
"It's such a big relief."

560
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,084
I have those thoughts now.

561
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,092
I know what you're imagining.

562
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,220
But you are wrong.

563
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,265
Ho-su is my husband's son.

564
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,810
I didn't go there with Woo-jae.

565
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,022
-We just ran into--
-I don't want to hear your excuses.

566
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:33,777
I only need to watch
your life getting ruined.

567
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,825
I will not break down like you.

568
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,126
I've seen a lot of people like you.

569
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,047
People who destroy themselves
because of their victim mentality.

570
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,426
They need to rationalize their misfortune,
so they slander other people.

571
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:01,555
And these pathetic people do everything
to make everyone miserable like them.

572
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,557
And you're one of them.

573
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,603
That's why you even
dragged a little child into this.

574
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:12,524
You weaseled your way out of this
after turning a father into a criminal.

575
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,737
You're the monster.

576
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,993
Everyone will be sick of you
and leave you.

577
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,456
You will live a lonely life
in suffering. Not me.

578
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,130
Seeing how you're very chatty,

579
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,342
you must be very anxious right now.

580
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,137
I guess I was right.

581
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,189
If I'm a monster,

582
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,983
what are the people who made me this way?

583
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,908
I wonder who saw the photo I sent you.

584
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,412
If you find out, let me know too.

585
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:24,012
TO HUI-JU

586
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,273
I wonder who saw the photo I sent you.

587
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,287
This is Unit D.

588
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,456
I want to check the surveillance footage.

589
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,255
We didn't install any cameras
at the front door for privacy reasons.

590
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,257
You can only check the one in the alley.

591
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:33,707
Why are you here?

592
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,001
I'm worried about you being alone here.

593
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,296
I don't feel good about it.

594
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,797
You're not worried about me.

595
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,884
You're worried about what I might do.

596
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,031
You know, Ho-su's dadâ€¦

597
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,452
reads Ho-su a lot of children's books.

598
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,081
But they are different
from the stories I knew.

599
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,210
Hansel and Gretel's father and stepmom
rescue them in the new story.

600
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,712
And the three little pigs

601
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,507
make up with the wolf
and even build him a nice house.

602
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,552
It's ridiculous.

603
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:30,472
"When people do something wrong,
they pay dearly for it."

604
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,641
Wouldn't teaching that be more helpful?

605
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,147
If they grew up only listening
to unrealistic happy endings,

606
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,609
wouldn't they be disappointed?

607
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,366
Kids should also know how cruel and harsh

608
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,327
this world is.

609
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,955
Why have you become so twisted?

610
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,755
I'm sure Ho-su learned it too.

611
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,384
That there are adults
who use and hurt kids.

612
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,724
And he shouldn't trust just anyone.

613
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,572
What on earth

614
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,450
have I done to you?

615
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,347
Are you a dummy?
Why did you follow a stranger?

616
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,100
He wasn't a stranger. He was Dracula.

617
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,604
And I'm not a dummy either.

618
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,314
That's right. Ho-su isn't a dummy.

619
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,318
But you should be more careful next time.

620
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,071
You shouldn't follow people like that

621
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,531
when we're not there
even if you think you know them.

622
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,160
I heard Ms. Gu found you.

623
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,953
How? What did she say to you?

624
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,872
If you're done eating, go upstairs.

625
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,292
Why? I'm curious.

626
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,044
Go upstairs.

627
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,340
Are you serious?
I can't even ask a question?

628
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:38,016
Ho-su, if you're done, go up and brush
your teeth. Then I'll read you a story.

629
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,277
Like Li-sa said,

630
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,781
we should ask Ho-su what happened first.

631
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,783
I don't want to make it worse for him.

632
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,954
He's seeing a therapist tomorrow.
Leave it to the expert.

633
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,581
-But still.
-Ho-su is still young

634
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,166
He might be able to forget.

635
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:07,003
We don't have to force him to remember.

636
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,133
Okay.

637
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:20,642
Did you put away
the birthday presents for Ho-su?

638
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,854
No. Why are you suddenly asking me that?

639
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:27,607
I'm giving out party favors.
I want to make sure I got everyone.

640
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,370
TAERIM HOSPITAL

641
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,587
Ho-su, should we use this color?

642
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,758
-Here?
-Yes, there.

643
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,970
I don't think
I've ever tried to be a good mother.

644
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,265
I didn't want your mother
to find fault with me.

645
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:05,520
I didn't want people to say I paint
as a hobby because I met a rich husband.

646
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,272
So I tried so hard to be good.

647
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:13,111
Is it because I didn't have a good mother?

648
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:22,037
From time to time,
I even got jealous of my own children

649
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,249
because I pitied myself
for not having any opportunities as a kid.

650
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:35,717
And there were times when I took
Li-sa and Ho-su's hardships lightly.

651
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:43,433
Do you think the children realized it?

652
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,563
That I'm a horrible mother?

653
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,070
No parent is perfect.

654
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,201
I don't have to be perfect.

655
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,831
But I didn't want to be a mother
who hurt her own child.

656
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,586
Please,

657
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,673
keep Ho-su safe.

658
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,889
Go and get some fresh air.

659
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,100
I'll watch him.

660
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:27,769
Okay.

661
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,725
My goodness. That's a great drawing.

662
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,228
-Oh, my. Did you draw that, Ho-su?
-Yes.

663
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,230
Gosh. You're so good!

664
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,942
Where did you get this crazy talent?
Seriously.

665
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,862
I brought a present for you. Ta-da.

666
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:22,490
It's your favorite candy. Here.

667
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,911
Don't tell your mom.

668
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,455
Where's Hui-ju?

669
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,665
She went out for some air.

670
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,792
She's stressed out lately.

671
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,086
Ho-su, let's go to your grandma.

672
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,881
Hui-ju is coming too? I'll go with you.

673
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,968
Let's go! Uncle will take you there!

674
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,142
Take this.

675
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:52,270
I just want to thank you
for bringing him home safe and sound.

676
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,357
I didn't do anything to deserve a reward.

677
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,571
Why don't we buy a few of his pieces?
Ask Ms. Lee about it.

678
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,157
-Sure.
-I'm sorry.

679
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,951
I'm not selling any of my pieces yet.

680
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,162
What do you mean? We already bought one.

681
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,456
Pardon?

682
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:15,543
My daughter-in-law already
bought one of your pieces.

683
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,586
Didn't you know?

684
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,052
I heard that the buyer
wanted to be anonymous.

685
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,890
Is that so? I wonder why she said that.

686
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,485
I'll be off, then.

687
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,272
Is Ho-su all right?

688
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,149
Why were you with the Chief Director?

689
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,197
-You--
-What did you tell my mother-in-law?

690
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:30,118
She wanted to pay me a reward
to thank me for bringing back Ho-su.

691
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,247
I turned it down. That's all.

692
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,292
He came back to Korea recently?

693
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:41,171
He was in an accident in Ireland,
so he was in the hospital for years.

694
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,130
And Mr. Anâ€¦

695
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,383
paid for the medical bills.

696
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,178
Didn't Hyeon-seong start going to Ireland

697
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,721
to see Hui-ju?

698
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:53,183
Yes. For about three years,

699
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:57,353
Hui-ju and Mr. Seo
were in Ireland at the same time.

700
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,441
Do you thinkâ€¦

701
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,945
I don't want your opinion.
Look into it and get me the facts.

702
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,489
Yes, ma'am.

703
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,617
Grandma!

704
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,329
Goodness. My baby.

705
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,623
Did you come to see me?

706
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:22,087
I guess someone else was here.

707
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,672
Ho-su, what would you like to eat?

708
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,093
I should cook you
a nice birthday meal tomorrow morning.

709
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,345
What do you want to eat?

710
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:33,598
-Ice cream.
-Ice cream?

711
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,101
What about the photo?

712
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,393
What photo?

713
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,105
The one you took!
Why did you have to take that?

714
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,856
What photo are you talking about?

715
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,821
Hae-wonâ€¦

716
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,241
didn't say anything to you?

717
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,452
It feels shitty to be this clueless fool,
stuck between you two.

718
00:56:55,537 --> 00:57:00,458
Both of you won't explain anything to me
but keep putting it on me.

719
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,130
What am I supposed to do then?

720
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,302
Never mind if you don't know.
Actually, it's better that you don't.

721
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:15,223
No. I hate it
when you make me feel like a big idiot.

722
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,184
I can't stand it anymore.

723
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,729
What then?

724
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,816
You said it was brief. Right?

725
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,195
You said it was brief and casual.

726
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,033
Why are you so anxious then?

727
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,834
I knew you wouldn't answer me.

728
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,629
I have to remember it, don't I?

729
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,799
I'll remember it no matter what.

730
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,051
I will get back

731
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,929
my memories on my own.

732
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,769
Your husband knows.

733
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:06,274
You dare ask me againâ€¦

734
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,068
about Hui-ju?

735
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,446
I'm sure he knows

736
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,615
that I loved you

737
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,492
and probably about our affair too.

738
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,665
It seems you two also have many secrets.

739
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,504
What are you doing here?
You didn't pick up my call.

740
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,757
Wellâ€¦

741
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,552
Is it over? Where's Ho-su?

742
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,845
He must've been tired.
He fell asleep soon after.

743
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,681
My mom didn't want to disturb his nap.

744
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,849
She'll send him home
after feeding him dinner.

745
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,395
That's good.

746
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,691
-Are you going back to school?
-Yes, I am.

747
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,109
You were here the whole time?

748
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,487
Yes.

749
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,200
I'll go home first then.

750
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,243
What brings you here at this late hour?

751
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,084
I'm the only one here.

752
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,628
I don't think you're here to see me.

753
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,715
Seo Woo-jaeâ€¦

754
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,633
Seo Woo-jaeâ€¦

755
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,593
Where is he?

756
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,393
Are you looking for Woo-jae

757
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,312
or Hui-ju?

758
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,777
Seriously? You acted like
the most understanding husband.

759
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,285
I guess you were in a rush.

760
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,086
Now you look like someone I can relate to.

761
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,005
Wait.

762
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:43,217
I can understand what
you're going through more than anyone.

763
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,850
That's where Woo-jae is.

764
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,353
I don't know who's there with him, though.

765
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,528
MS. GU HAE-WON

766
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:06,157
People tend to ignore that feeling
when something bad is going to happen.

767
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:09,076
I get that they don't want to believe it

768
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,871
and want to pretend that nothing's wrong,

769
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,999
but choosing to ignore it
won't make it go away.

770
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,296
You should go and see it for yourself.

771
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:28,137
See if you can pretend to be fine
even after seeing it with your own eyes.

772
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,765
I'm curious to find out too.

773
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,589
MS. GU HAE-WON

774
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,929
WOO-JAE

775
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,896
14, UNJEONGDONG-RO, GANGBUK-GU

776
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,805
You should go and see it for yourself.

777
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:57,977
See if you can pretend to be fine
even after seeing it with your own eyes.

778
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,813
I'm curious to find out too.

779
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:38,953
TO HUI-JU

780
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,878
Where were you?

781
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,757
What time is it?

782
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,092
Where were you?

783
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:37,136
What?

784
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:41,098
Where did you go late at night?
Where did you go? Who did you see?

785
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,143
I didn't go anywhere.

786
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,352
Answer me.

787
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:56,781
Where are you going again?

788
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,949
I'm not going anywhere.

789
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,201
Just say something.

790
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,954
-Say what?
-Lie if you have to!

791
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,851
I'd rather have you lie to me.

792
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:29,271
That's the least you can do for me!

793
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:51,544
TO HUI-JU

794
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:03,764
RECORDING

795
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,866
Are you back together with Woo-jae?

796
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,118
I'll do as you say.

797
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,578
I'll leave.

798
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,538
Running away again?

799
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,748
Did you sleep with that bastard? Tell me!

800
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,375
Do you still love him?

801
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:35,004
You just got divorced.

802
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:37,423
What if I kill her?

803
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,466
Do you want me to break up with you?

804
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,051
Why did we break up?

805
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:44,513
If I could turn back time,
I'd do it at all costs.

806
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,057
Ho-su, open up.

807
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,642
I'm going to remember.

808
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,644
No matter how painful the memories are,

809
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:53,480
I'll recover them.

810
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:54,690
Jeong Hui-ju.

811
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,569
Jeong Hui-ju!

812
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:05,326
