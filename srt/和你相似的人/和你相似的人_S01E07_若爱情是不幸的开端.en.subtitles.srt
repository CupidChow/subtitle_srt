1
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,696
What are you playing at?

2
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,241
What is that you're trying to achieve?

3
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,295
Why are you so scared of me?

4
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,633
Did something happen between us?

5
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,477
Stop dodging my questions. Just tell me.

6
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,771
So I can be careful around you.

7
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,026
Mr. Seo.

8
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,956
Fancy seeing you here.

9
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,334
Hello.

10
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,670
What brings you here?

11
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:20,640
TAERIM FOUNDATION'S FAMILY DAY,
EMPLOYEES' FAMILIES ARE INVITED

12
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,311
I wanted to see if I liked baseball.

13
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,397
PROGRAM
EXHIBITION BASEBALL MATCH WITH KIDS

14
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,194
I saw the poster at the hospital.

15
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,989
I noticed it was happening today
and was nearby, so…

16
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,367
But I didn't know you were here.

17
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,332
Dad, play catch with me.

18
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,376
Play catch with me.

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,753
Sure. Let's go.

20
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,558
-Is this comfortable?
-Yes.

21
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,229
Let's play catch. Let's go.

22
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,441
Okay. Go ahead.

23
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,821
So you happened
to see the poster and came here?

24
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,739
There you go.

25
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,075
Yes.

26
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,871
-I thought I did.
-You're only throwing strikes.

27
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,957
I wonder

28
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,169
if I really came here because of baseball.

29
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,175
Ho-su, where did you learn to do this?

30
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,427
-You!
-You got it from me?

31
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,809
All right. Throw it to Mom!

32
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,563
-I don't know if I can catch it!
-Throw it to Mom!

33
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,940
Dad, catch!

34
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,319
-Mom.
-Yes?

35
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,570
-Higher.
-Catch it.

36
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,655
Mom!

37
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,408
Ho-su, I'll throw it high.

38
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:14,212
EPISODE 7
IF LOVE IS THE BEGINNING OF MISFORTUNE

39
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,057
All right. Come in.

40
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,730
The order of events will
be identical to that of Mass.

41
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,442
After my sermon,
your wedding will take place.

42
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,946
I will approach the bride and groom
after my sermon.

43
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,323
Then the bride can put
the bouquet on the table,

44
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,952
and both of you can take off your gloves.

45
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:50,290
That's when I need a witness each
from both of you to step forward…

46
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,875
Ms. Gu, is it true that you were fired?

47
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,378
When are you coming today?

48
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,631
Filming without consent is illegal.

49
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,800
And so is doing it for someone else.

50
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,013
Do you think you'll be special to her
if you do what she tells you to do?

51
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,557
No. If you were special to her,

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,226
she wouldn't have let you commit a crime.

53
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,816
Don't let those who don't care
about you take advantage of you.

54
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,612
You should start identifying
those who are giving you a chance

55
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,948
and helping you…

56
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,703
Everything she said is true.

57
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,456
It's good advice
from a successful painter.

58
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:32,957
What?

59
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:38,796
But people like her who can afford failure
shouldn't give out such advice.

60
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,424
Don't you see?

61
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,761
People like us won't get
another chance if we mess up once.

62
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,598
Is it so wrong to be a bit sly
to get what we want?

63
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,685
You can.

64
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,107
Right. Li-sa acted
totally nuts at the exhibition.

65
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:03,321
She kept being rude to that sculptor
and threw a fit at her mom.

66
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,118
Li-sa's mother came with you guys?

67
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,203
Yes.

68
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,705
Ms. Gu. I can make drinks now.

69
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,499
Wait here.

70
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,885
Why are you leaving?
Aren't you here to see Ju-yeong?

71
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,725
That's fattening.

72
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,562
Did you not come in because of me?

73
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,524
I came because I couldn't reach her.
What is this? So annoying.

74
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,151
That's not the right word.
You're disappointed.

75
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,033
If you are curious about someone,
it means you are interested.

76
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,328
And if you are annoyed because
she won't reciprocate your interest,

77
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,955
you must be sad and disappointed.

78
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,333
You're full of crap.
You're totally off base here.

79
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:01,546
I just thought that
you should face your feelings as they are.

80
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,342
Did you enjoy the exhibition with her?

81
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,677
Why did you invite me?

82
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,138
The sculptor is my husband.

83
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,807
You're married?

84
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,518
Why did you pretend to be single?

85
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,770
I did no such thing.

86
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,772
Did it seem so because we were apart?

87
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,023
Why?

88
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,112
He fell in love

89
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,698
with someone else for a while.

90
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,201
There it is. See you around.

91
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,983
Seeing how you watched
the game until the end,

92
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,903
you must've liked baseball.

93
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,615
Right. I guess I did.

94
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,996
-Bye, then.
-Get in, please.

95
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,082
They're all leaving,
so it's hard to get a cab now.

96
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,542
No. Thank you for the offer.

97
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,461
Please get in. We have space.

98
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,394
Any plans on having kids?

99
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,979
You seem to like kids.

100
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,109
I'm neither fit nor confident
to be a dad right now.

101
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,861
No one feels ready to be a parent.

102
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,947
You just do your best
with whatever you have.

103
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,910
But I've never imagined
myself being a dad.

104
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,621
Well, it isn't something
you can just imagine.

105
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,374
Being everything to your kid.

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,336
You can't give up
just because it gets hard.

107
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,213
And giving up on them isn't right.

108
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,843
On top of that, it's not something
other people can do for you. You know?

109
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,598
Then I guess I'm not ready yet.

110
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,854
Having someone whom I love more
than myself and must be responsible for…

111
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm not ready for that yet.

112
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,674
What's wrong?

113
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,140
Just go around her.

114
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,153
Honey.

115
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,697
Don't get out. It will just get worse.

116
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,199
What is this?

117
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,243
Get out, or your car will get dirty.

118
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,126
Give me a minute, honey.

119
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,553
Ms. Gu! What do you think
you are you doing?

120
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,391
Honey, go check on Ho-su first.

121
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,186
Honey.

122
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,276
Come here, Ho-su.

123
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,195
Hae-won!

124
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,460
What scares you so much
to feel the need to go this far?

125
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,423
-Let go.
-Stop.

126
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,885
Let go. Let go of me!

127
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,095
Let go!

128
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,012
-Stop.
-Let go!

129
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,382
He fell in love
with someone else for a while.

130
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,935
Here we go.

131
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,397
Hold on. Let's just take this off, Ho-su.

132
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,024
Did you two fight?

133
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:56,901
No.

134
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,903
Then why bring your sleepy son here?

135
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,448
Lie down. There you go.

136
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,617
Grandma?

137
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,370
My puppy. What did you do?
Why do you look so exhausted?

138
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,832
I hit a home run today.

139
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,459
Good boy.

140
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,252
Dad…

141
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,673
Mom smells sweet.

142
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:25,930
He must've had a dream.

143
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,391
Ho-su, you can sleep here
with your grandma today.

144
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:35,606
I wonder why your mother smells sweet.

145
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,860
She got mad

146
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,279
at some man.

147
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,660
So the dinosaur lady had a fight with her.

148
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,329
Good night.

149
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,013
You're not going to tell me?

150
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,516
They gave me a ride with good intentions.

151
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,019
With good intentions? They hate me.

152
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,021
What good intentions?

153
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,481
I ran into them.

154
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,567
They had no ulterior motives.

155
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,609
Exactly.

156
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,821
Why do you keep running into them?

157
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,991
That's even stranger.

158
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,493
-Hae-won.
-Don't meet them when I'm not with you.

159
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,162
She might say something
to make you hate me.

160
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,747
What on earth…

161
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,333
What's that look?

162
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,003
You don't believe me?

163
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,505
Why would I hate you
because of something they say?

164
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,675
Are you sure you won't?

165
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:51,098
I don't know why
we're arguing over someone else

166
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,893
when we're doing fine.

167
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,980
No.

168
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,982
We're not fine.

169
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,403
I'm just pretending to be okay.

170
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,657
Honestly, I'm not okay at all.

171
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,829
I bet you didn't know that.

172
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:18,459
You don't even know
how I've been all these years.

173
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,129
So how could it be okay?

174
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,405
What are you doing here?

175
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,537
Do you remember that guy
we met at the exhibition?

176
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,623
What?

177
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,710
You draw someone

178
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,672
because you love them.

179
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,716
That's what he said.

180
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,887
It's getting late. Go to sleep.

181
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,181
I don't have time to listen to you.

182
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,270
-The heath…
-What?

183
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,525
You know, the flowers.

184
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,487
They were all over the hill
where you went to draw a long time ago.

185
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,405
Do you remember?

186
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,293
And I think I saw him there.

187
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,132
What are you talking about?

188
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,844
I remember seeing him there.

189
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,226
How could you have seen him there?

190
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,730
You were little.
You're remembering it wrong.

191
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,816
No. I'm sure it was him there.

192
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,734
That was your dad.

193
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,947
Your dad was there with us.

194
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,789
Then I should ask Dad.

195
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,714
I had no idea.

196
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,595
I'm sorry I didn't know.

197
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,441
I'm sorry.

198
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,056
Dad. When I went to see Mom with you
when I was little,

199
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,349
those flowers there.

200
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,561
-Flowers?
-Yes, what were they called?

201
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,857
What flowers?

202
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,709
She asked me that question before.
What flower?

203
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,768
Honestly, I'm not okay at all.

204
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,147
You don't even know
how I've been all these years.

205
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,947
Did you meet my daughter Li-sa?

206
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,033
Pardon?

207
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,330
POSTS
120 LIKES

208
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:57,542
Right, I did.
I met her at your exhibition.

209
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,631
What did you

210
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,258
tell her?

211
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,679
What nonsense did you tell her? She--

212
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,265
It's cold. We can talk sitting.

213
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,815
If you keep acting this way,

214
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,362
it makes me think I was someone awful.
And that scares me.

215
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,408
Hae-won told me that I used to hate you.

216
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,702
I'm not here to talk about our past.

217
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,956
-I think Li-sa--
-Heath.

218
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,380
I only told her the name of the flower.

219
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,593
As our meeting was brief,
nothing else happened.

220
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,390
I understand why you are worried.

221
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:58,478
I heard that Hae-won hurt your daughter
when she was her teacher.

222
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,650
From now on, I will try
to be careful not to run into her…

223
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,653
again.

224
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,662
I would appreciate that.
And I apologize for barging in.

225
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,672
It's true that you hated me.

226
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,342
So I don't feel comfortable
around you either.

227
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,555
But I think there's any need
to try to remember that.

228
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,560
If you don't remember it,
then it's never happened.

229
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,656
That was in the past.

230
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,117
Even if I hated you in the past,

231
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,578
I don't hate you now.

232
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,122
Actually, I'm concerned about you.

233
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,417
I know that it's my place
to worry about you.

234
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,962
You look like you're being chased.
And that bothers me.

235
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,256
That's all I feel now.

236
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,885
Let go. You'll hurt your hand.

237
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,137
I just wanted to tell you…

238
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,725
not to worry.

239
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,245
JEONG HUI-JU

240
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,593
He's worried about me? How ridiculous.

241
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,017
GU HAE-WON

242
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:05,522
You'll be an intern for three months
and assist Mr. Seo as you learn the ropes.

243
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,947
I know artists don't like
to be part of an agency

244
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,032
because contracts make them
feel tied down.

245
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,201
But to have a stable working environment,

246
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,496
they definitely need
to be sponsored by the galleries.

247
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:25,000
With these conditions, I don't think
Woo-jae will turn down your offer.

248
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,295
He should work
on his next project right away.

249
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,879
We must keep the momentum going.

250
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,299
Okay.

251
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,719
Mr. Seo told me that

252
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,138
you were the rookie
everyone had their eyes on.

253
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,557
Why did you stop drawing?

254
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,652
I actually have

255
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,489
a few of your early pieces.

256
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:02,537
But the themes and style of your works
have changed a lot

257
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,998
from back then.

258
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,546
Was there any reason behind the changes?

259
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,675
Well, artists are human after all.

260
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,804
So the paintings are bound to change
based on the life of the artists.

261
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,766
Since I find my inspiration around me,

262
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,809
the changes would've been more noticeable.

263
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:31,316
That must mean you've lived a good life.

264
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,654
-Sir. Could I talk to you?
-Yes?

265
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,740
Okay.

266
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,581
Have you been living a good life then?

267
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,589
I liked your early pieces more
because I could feel Woo-jae's influence.

268
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,259
But your current paintings…

269
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,054
They are suffocating.

270
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,100
It's like you purposely
painted only pretty things.

271
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,397
But I'm glad to see that you are happy…

272
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:16,277
because you must not be lonely enough
to steal someone else's man again.

273
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,753
When I saw this painting, the angle…

274
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,096
You want me to work with Mr. Seo?

275
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,348
There's a building
that will be demolished soon,

276
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:49,394
that was designed by Asia's Best
Architect Award winner, Woo Jeong-hyo.

277
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,479
So I'm thinking
of doing an exhibition there.

278
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,734
I know that well-known artists like you

279
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,153
prefer to work alone.

280
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,655
So I'm asking you for a favor.

281
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,949
For my gallery and Mr. Seo.

282
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,619
I don't understand why I should.

283
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:10,457
If this is because
I recruited your curator--

284
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,586
My gallery was chosen
for next year's Art Basel.

285
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,466
There's a special "unlimited" exhibition,
curated by the critics.

286
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,093
I'm sure you know
that only two of galleries in Korea

287
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,803
will have a chance to participate.

288
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,599
An entry to Art Basel

289
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,727
will be enough to attract attention
from the global market.

290
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,522
And you might be the one
who gets that chance.

291
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,781
Opening a gallery itself is a gamble.

292
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,158
We're not some conglomerate.

293
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,994
They are filthy-rich,
so a failed business won't hurt them.

294
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,997
And look.

295
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,917
Wasn't this an expansion job?

296
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,754
Why does it cost this much?

297
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,466
We reduced 20 percent
of the total construction cost.

298
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,969
And we've already got 35 percent
of the budget from investments.

299
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,680
You always do whatever you want.

300
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,058
Why ask me
if you're not going to listen to me?

301
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,185
Can you support Hui-ju on this?

302
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,478
She needs to earn it.

303
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,105
How can I support her
when she fights people?

304
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,191
She didn't fight anyone.

305
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,027
It was just a baseball game,
but it was a work event.

306
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,487
How could she…

307
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,948
Wait. Is this about that thing?

308
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,492
I told you it wasn't what it looked like.

309
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,744
I may disapprove of her,

310
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:33,039
but I will not let you divorce her
because of your affair.

311
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,344
Was Mr. Seo at the baseball game?

312
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,395
I'm sorry I'm late. I thought
the meeting was happening now.

313
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,772
You're not late. You're right on time.

314
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,191
I want you to drive to Samin Hotel.

315
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,695
Okay.

316
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,992
So, about the gallery…

317
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,789
What did you talk about?

318
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,207
It was about the foundation.

319
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,087
But she didn't invite me
and just wants to use me as a driver?

320
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,633
Then you can

321
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,927
update me later.

322
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,470
Are you coming?

323
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,249
PSYCHIATRIC COUNSELLING ROOM

324
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,709
Hello.

325
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,631
I'm sorry about yesterday. Hae-won--

326
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:09,385
She must be very upset about her job.
Please comfort her.

327
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,304
Thank you for understanding.

328
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,599
I do understand,
but as you've seen yesterday,

329
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,809
we're not very comfortable
around each other.

330
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,314
I'd like for you to also move hospitals.

331
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,526
-Hyeon-seong.
-Do you have time today?

332
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,072
Let's eat dinner at our house.
Your sister wants to see you more often.

333
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,366
-See you later.
-Okay.

334
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:39,624
-I'll talk to him later--
-Ms. Jeong is your sister?

335
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,710
Yes, she is.

336
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,217
I see Dr. Choi is taking care of you.
Dr. Choi is great.

337
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:54,263
Yes, an honest and good person.

338
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,599
But progress is slow.

339
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,145
-Since the problem is me.
-Gosh. Don't think of it like that.

340
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,983
It could be better
only thinking of the present,

341
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,527
than being stuck on the past.

342
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,655
Ms. Jeong said something similar.

343
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,198
Pardon?

344
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,243
I'm not sure what is going on.

345
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,247
Everything is jumbled up.

346
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:25,837
Whenever you're confused, just think,
"The emotions I feel right now are real."

347
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,675
And whatever it is that happened,
I'm against you moving hospitals.

348
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,764
You see, I'm the best there is.

349
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,642
Take care.

350
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,904
I'll set up a meeting
with architect Woo Jeong-hyo soon.

351
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:52,822
Okay.

352
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,955
By the way,
Ms. Gu agreed to work at my gallery.

353
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,124
She majored in art too.

354
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,209
She has a great eye for interpreting art.

355
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,545
I like that she respects artists too.

356
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:11,841
Besides, I like having
happy couples around. It's therapeutic.

357
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,553
I'm so happy to see
that Mr. Seo formed a happy family

358
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,263
unlike his father.

359
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:22,477
And it's ironic how a man like his father
raised such a loving person like him.

360
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,896
I don't know much about him.

361
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,232
But even if he wasn't
a good father to Mr. Seo,

362
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:32,070
I'm sure he was the best father
to the artist within Mr. Seo.

363
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,782
Not only did he pass down his talent,

364
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,826
but also a sense of hunger
that couldn't be satiated.

365
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,289
I'm sure Mr. Seo will prove his worth.

366
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,256
I should be on my toes.

367
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,103
Hey. How was work?

368
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,568
Why did you send me
the money from your sale?

369
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,321
I don't have anything to spend on.
You can spend it.

370
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,409
I want you to do whatever you want
with that. That's my wish.

371
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,204
I'll get you some tea.

372
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,467
Let's have a wedding.

373
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,181
We never had one.
We only registered our marriage.

374
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,059
Let's use the money for that.

375
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,736
We can invite a lot of people,

376
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,114
take tons of photos,
and wear pretty clothes too.

377
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,410
We're already married.

378
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,872
Exactly. I want to show people
that we are married.

379
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,582
I want everyone to know.

380
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,542
We don't have anyone to invite.

381
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,336
It's not like I have any other family.

382
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,672
And I don't have any close friends.

383
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,382
My family is your family.

384
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,384
We have my grandpa and my mom.

385
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,804
We can invite people from the gallery
and your recently-gained fans.

386
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,810
You just have to say yes.

387
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,562
I'll plan everything.

388
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,862
You told me to do what I wanted with it.

389
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,990
I want to be congratulated.

390
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,910
I want people to congratulate us.

391
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,135
Should we make our own invitations?

392
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,929
It's been ages since I drew anything.

393
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,099
When should we have the wedding?
Where should we have it?

394
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,060
What do you think about the gallery?

395
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,316
Goodness, Ho-su. The elephant's ears
are bigger than its trunk.

396
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,526
Its name is Paka.

397
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,613
Paka has big ears,
so he can even fly with them.

398
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,574
Goodness. They can be wings too?

399
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,035
This is super cool.

400
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,288
Look. He should be an artist.

401
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,998
He's talented, isn't he?

402
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,127
Was Hui-ju also artistic
when she was young?

403
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,217
I had never seen her draw as a kid.

404
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,387
We were lucky to go to school.

405
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,847
I'm really grateful to you

406
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,767
for helping her follow her dream.

407
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,312
I didn't help much.
Your sister is just talented.

408
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,986
Goodness, Hui-ju. How long
have you been standing there?

409
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,614
You should've told me
you were coming over.

410
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,949
I invited him over.

411
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,452
Every hospital is trying
to steal him from our hospital,

412
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,079
so I'm trying to keep him at ours.

413
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,749
You wanted to study
sports physical therapy.

414
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,711
USC has a good residency program.

415
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,089
Or you can go for a full-time
clinical internship in St. Louis.

416
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,675
After you study there for two years,

417
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,428
why don't you run your own center
within the hospital?

418
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,388
Gosh. That's such a generous offer.

419
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:31,058
He cares about you more than I do.
That's never crossed my mind.

420
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,480
What about Li-sa?

421
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,982
She's not home yet.

422
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,193
I thought she already called you.

423
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,042
What took you so long?
I texted you hours ago.

424
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,711
I came as soon as my shift ended.

425
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,796
I'm not going home today.

426
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,382
I'll crash at your place.

427
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,385
My dad is home.

428
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,721
So what? I can sleep in your room.

429
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,729
What's that for?

430
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,023
Who knows what might be useful later?

431
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,358
I'll film everything.

432
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,282
-Did you pick one?
-Yes.

433
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,877
She's blowing up your phone.

434
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,296
You didn't tell her?

435
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,550
Darn it. What about your mom?
Where is she?

436
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,053
Who knows? She might be dead
on some alley for all I know.

437
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,599
-Did they divorce?
-No.

438
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,978
She just left.

439
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:44,150
He keeps badmouthing her,
saying that she left for another man.

440
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,317
But I totally get why.

441
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,905
Would you want
to live with someone like him?

442
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,118
In any case, she did abandon you.

443
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,828
How can she like men over her kid?

444
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,373
I like men who are nice to me.

445
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,000
They are gross.

446
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,171
Why are they gross?
You just haven't met the right person.

447
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,422
You're full of it.

448
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,340
-Then have you ever kissed anyone?
-Yes.

449
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,177
Stop lying.

450
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,845
When? Who? How?

451
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,061
Like this. It's not a big deal.

452
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,776
Come on! Get off me! You stupid.

453
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,613
Don't mind him.
He falls back asleep after that.

454
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,406
-Bring me more drinks.
-I'm leaving.

455
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,741
You're not sleeping over?

456
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,826
It's so loud. How can I sleep here?

457
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,287
The path out of here is complicated.
Wait up!

458
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,629
You should have called a cab to the house.

459
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,882
I wanted to walk with you.

460
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,094
Then you should visit more often.

461
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:59,141
Well, I want to.

462
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,312
But I don't feel like myself here.
I feel out of place.

463
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,527
Hey. What happened yesterday?

464
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,820
What do you mean?

465
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:16,033
Hyeon-seong and Mr. Seo
ran into each other at the hospital.

466
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,412
He asked Mr. Seo
to switch to another hospital.

467
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,082
What?

468
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,543
Why?

469
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,711
Ms. Gu was mentioned,
so I think I know why,

470
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,630
but it wasn't my place to ask.

471
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,812
-That's my cab. I'll get going. Bye.
-Bye.

472
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,744
He asked Mr. Seo
to switch to another hospital.

473
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,830
And I think I saw him there.

474
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,556
What are you thinking about?

475
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,689
I'm trying to figure out
why I went to Ireland all of a sudden.

476
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,524
Stuff like that.

477
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,653
Well, it wasn't so sudden.

478
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,614
You always wanted to go.

479
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,325
Your favorite sculptor…

480
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,492
Rowan Gillespie?

481
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,202
Yes.

482
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,788
-And the Cliffs…
-Cliffs of Moher.

483
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,624
of Moher.

484
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,922
Since we all die at some point,

485
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,301
you wanted to die in a place like that.

486
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,433
So no one would know
if you were dead or alive

487
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,270
because no one would find your body.

488
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,379
Hae-won!

489
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,342
What was that? That was dangerous.

490
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,304
I needed to believe.

491
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:48,227
I needed to believe
that you wouldn't let me get hurt.

492
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,801
I AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BELOW,
SEO WOO-JAE

493
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,846
IDENTIFICATION VERIFIED VIA PHONE,
ACCOUNT REACTIVATED

494
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,392
CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR CAR'S VALUE?

495
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,270
HWAIN BANK,
YOUR CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN UPDATED

496
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,358
EMBASSY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
IN IRELAND

497
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,989
HELLO, THIS IS THE EMBASSY
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA IN IRELAND

498
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,746
Mr. Seo Woo-jae,
Korean police received a report

499
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,790
that you had gone missing.

500
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,460
We confirmed
that you departed for Ireland.

501
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:59,173
So Interpol and our embassy
were requested to cooperate.

502
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,141
Yes. You were reported missing
on July 20th, 2014.

503
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:15,063
The embassy located your whereabouts
after finding your travel logs to Ireland.

504
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,191
And the missing person report
was cancelled at your request.

505
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,486
Who first made the report?

506
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,946
Gu Hae-won, your wife.

507
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,166
It's about Ms. Gu.

508
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,085
She quit. I thought
you were informed of it.

509
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,630
I was wondering how exactly that happened.

510
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,132
The disciplinary committee
decided to dismiss her.

511
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,134
As there's much talk
about our high school,

512
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,719
Mr. An didn't want any scandals.

513
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:49,097
So he wrote a letter
of recommendation for Ms. Gu.

514
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,724
And Ms. Gu won't

515
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,936
be able to cause problems
regarding the incident.

516
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:58,273
That means my husband
met up with her in private.

517
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:07,908
I heard I would've died
if I was found any later.

518
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:11,578
So I wanted to express my gratitude
to the man who saved me.

519
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,216
Choi Jun-yeong?

520
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,678
Yes. From what I heard,
he took me to the hospital

521
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:32,266
and was the one who linked me
to Taerim Foundation for my medical bills.

522
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,643
I was wondering if I could find this man.

523
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,732
It is true that I donated some money
because my son was born there.

524
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,361
But we only sponsor their social programs.

525
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,113
We don't pick the recipient.

526
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:51,326
It must have been the hospital's decision
who chose to sponsor you.

527
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,955
I asked the hospital too.
But I was unable to get an answer.

528
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,126
Leave the documents here.

529
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,628
We'll look into it as much as we can.

530
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:05,382
-Is that all?
-Yes. Thank you.

531
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,806
Mr. Seo.

532
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,645
Does Ms. Gu know
that you came here for this matter?

533
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,444
Are you looking for a new hospital?
Or I can--

534
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,280
No. I got much better at your hospital.

535
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,324
And I can't easily get a new psychiatrist.

536
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,784
Please be a bit more understanding.

537
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:45,213
Sir, your wife was here just a moment ago.

538
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,549
Just now?

539
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,676
Where is she?

540
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,304
She just left
when she knew you had a visitor.

541
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,805
I saw her car leave.

542
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,644
Tell Mr. Choi I want to see him here now.

543
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,853
Yes, sir.

545
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,422
Because I know very well

546
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,132
how I've gotten this far.

547
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,679
I'm almost there.

550
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,159
Hello. This is Gu Hae-won.

551
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,703
Yes. Can we talk for a minute?

552
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,664
It's about Ju-yeong's high school
admission counsel.

553
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,667
Her father couldn't make it, right?

554
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,795
I should have been there at least.

555
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,547
But I didn't want
to run into Li-sa's mother…

556
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,718
I see. She came.

557
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,058
Right. Then some other time…

GUIDE TO WEDDING MASS

559
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:00,408
You should just
start coming to weekly service.

560
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,120
Do you have a long lunch break?

561
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,040
You work at the gallery now.
You came this far?

562
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:10,710
I came here to see if I could do
something here, but they said no.

563
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,712
If the church said no,

564
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,423
maybe you shouldn't?

565
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,343
You think so?

566
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,430
Where's Mr. Seo? Why are you here alone?
And you've stopped getting treatment.

567
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,558
I don't know.

568
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,562
I wonder where he went.

569
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,301
CONFESSIONAL

570
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,472
I have to go out. I can't be in here.

571
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,728
What does she have on you?
Why do you let her walk all over you?

572
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,943
RITES OF CONFESSION

573
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,029
This must be the confessing side.

574
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,241
No. You should confess to a priest.

575
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,911
This world is so unfair.

576
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,916
So is love.

577
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,670
It takes two people to fall in love.

578
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,923
But when it ends,

579
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,926
one of them can just easily walk away.

580
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:47,390
And when the other one is in pain,
they're considered obsessive or clingy.

581
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,562
I find that really unfair.

582
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,567
-Hey…
-I wanted to have a wedding here.

583
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,237
Breaking a promise made here would

584
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,990
make you feel like
you'd really be punished.

585
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,038
But they said no.

586
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,795
There are so many restrictions.
I thought God was supposed to be generous.

587
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,838
Well, what about Mr. Seo?

588
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,466
Only one of you needs to be a believer.

589
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,219
Or what about your parents?

590
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:27,931
It might not be enough for a nuptial Mass,
but you can at least rent the church.

591
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,519
Thanks for trying
to listen to my useless crap.

592
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,314
I won't bother you anymore.

593
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,607
I never thought

594
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,318
it was useless.

595
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,195
And you're not bothering me.

596
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,073
When I'm alone,

597
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:48,660
I often think
about the things you tell me.

598
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,165
Why are you so kind?

599
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,253
It must be taxing
to always be the good guy.

600

GUIDE TO WEDDING MASS

601
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,992
I thought I made myself clear.

602
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,581
You two must have gotten close already.

603
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,006
That woman…

604
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,180
Does she know you're a murderer?

605
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,822
Where have you been all day?

606
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,951
Where else? I was in my studio.

607
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,913
Why didn't you answer your phone?

608
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,709
I just missed your call. So I called back.

609
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:30,512
What's wrong?

610
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,388
Hae-won.

611
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,645
Did I

612
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,855
run away from you?

613
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:46,444
I was reported missing.
And you were the one who reported it.

614
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,367
Did I really disappear on you
without giving you an explanation?

615
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,496
Why did I?

616
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,340
I'd like to know too.

617
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:13,138
You said you would tell me
everything once you came back.

618
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,014
So I waited, but you never came back.

619
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,604
Waiting for you was so hard.

620
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,192
So there was a point
when I wished you'd had an accident.

621
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,655
If you were dead…

622
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:38,580
It wouldn't have been as painful.
I could have just mourned for you.

623
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,627
But it turned out you were in an accident.

624
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,550
And you showed up
in front of me as a different man.

625
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,138
So I can't even resent you.

626
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,640
How irresponsible of you.

627
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,814
You may have come back,
but I'm still waiting

628
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,567
for you to explain everything.

629
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,540
When will you get your memories back?

630
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,043
What did your doctor say?

631
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,962
I'll go with you next time.

632
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:48,358
I think you should visit
the architect's studio at least once.

633
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,818
-Let's see when you're all available.
-Okay.

634
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,414
Artist Choi is here for you.

635
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,624
Is it already time?

636
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,628
Woo Jeong-hyo isn't available today.

637
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,713
So you can all meet next week at the site.

638
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:18,471
Ms. Lee. I wanted to ask you something.

639
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,725
Woo-jae and I never had our wedding.

640
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,311
So we want to hold a wedding soon.

641
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,481
A wedding? When?

642
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,066
We haven't set the date yet.

643
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:34,070
We don't have a lot of guests to invite.
So it's iffy to rent a venue.

644
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,572
That brings me to my question.

645
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,491
Could we rent your gallery
just for one day?

646
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,995
Of course, as long as the schedule allows.

647
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,663
You can discuss it with my staff.

648
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,457
-Excuse me. I have another meeting.
-Bye.

649
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,793
Thank you.

650
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,850
Congratulations.

651
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,270
I hope you will be happy this time.

652
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,273
Why did you say that?

653
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,443
You want us to be happy this time?

654
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,446
Then were we unhappy before?

655
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:39,427
MOM

656
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:46,100
You can't drive right now.
Pull over. I'll drive.

657
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,394
My grandpa was hurt back then too.

658
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,147
That's how you started
teaching Hui-ju in my place.

659
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,316
This is awful.

660
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,818
We don't know how he is yet.
I'm sure he's okay.

661
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,195
No.

662
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,030
I'm not worried about my grandpa.

663
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:02,325
It's awful that
I'm reminded of those days.

664
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,176
What's wrong?

665
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,387
I heard you were sick!

666
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,014
Those people at the health center.

667
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,517
They always call my family.

668
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,103
I can't even get my medicine
without making you worry.

669
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,771
Did your mom make a fuss again?

670
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,149
She's not even here. Why all the fuss…

671
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:48,329
What are you doing? Come on. Stop.

672
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,789
Stop it.

673
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,590
An accident?

674
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,759
How many times must I tell you?

675
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,178
You were in an accident,

676
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:08,015
so you were unconscious
in bed for all these years?

677
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,809
I'm sorry.

678
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:15,106
We'll have a wedding this time
even if it's small.

679
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,607
Why should it be small?

680
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,777
Throw a big one,
so everyone in our town can come.

681
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,405
We'll go on our honeymoon too.

682
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,576
Cat got your tongue?

683
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,453
It's your wedding too.

684
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,123
I'm sorry.

685
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,918
Do you even make money?

686
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:56,272
You're a real son of a bitch.

687
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,065
Hell, I'd prefer a dog.

688
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,115
Don't just stand there. Take this down.

689
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,200
Yes, sir.

690
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,961
If I ever hear my baby say
she doesn't want to live,

691
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,422
I'll tear off your limbs and eat them.

692
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:31,057
It seems like it might rain.

693
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,767
Take these all down.

694
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,668
We should head back, but I'm so sleepy.

695
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,218
You've been exhausted all day.

696
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,428
We'll sleep over.

697
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:13,266
We didn't even bring your meds.

698
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,601
Don't worry.

699
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:19,063
No, we can't.

700
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,234
We have to go plan the wedding.

701
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:28,322
And our honeymoon too.

702
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,743
Sure. Let's do that.

703
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,289
Let's go to the Cliffs of Moher.

704
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:40,835
Sure.

705
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:49,468
I'm sure they will look so beautiful

706
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,847
in person, right?

707
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,186
When we look at something so beautiful,

708
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,106
we'll want to live.

709
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:05,776
Right.

710
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,618
I'm curious.

711
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,623
Standing way up there…

712
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:22,835
who would you think of?

713
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,895
I'm curious.

714
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,898
Standing way up there…

715
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,696
who would you think of?

716
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,989
There's not much else besides the wedding.

717
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,866
Is it because of Woo-jae?

718
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:24,743
Tell me, Woo-jae. Do you love me?

719
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:28,164
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize!

720
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:31,584
If you turn away from her again,
Hae-won will die.

721
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,420
It's not like
accidents happen with a warning.

722
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,505
I want to be like you, Hui-ju.

723
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,883
I thought I ran away best I could.

724
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,510
Together with you holding my hand.

725
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,804
Even if that path is nothing
but a torturous hell,

726
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:47,933
I vow to be with you together.

727
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:54,523
