1
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,662
When mixed with black, most colors
lose their hues and become dark.

2
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,132
Only yellow,
the brightest hue in the color spectrum,

3
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,011
turns green instead of becoming dark.

4
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,016
It's the color
of the bright and dazzling sun.

5
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,852
And at the same time…

00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,663
MARRIAGE VOW

7
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,708
…when faded even so slightly,

8
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,920
it represents tragedy and sorrow.

9
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,964
That's yellow.

10
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,968
And so are you.

11
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,728
It's me, Seo Woo-jae!

12
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,733
Are you all right?

13
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,008
I just thought there was something wrong.

14
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,891
That's fine. Four meters sound good.

15
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,392
Of course.

16
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,187
Even so…

17
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:12,233
we will need at least 30 pieces. Yes.

18
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,362
There will be plenty of time.

19
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,780
Of course.

20
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,546
Why do we have to hide?

21
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:35,423
We did nothing wrong.

22
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,305
I…

23
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,724
I…

24
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,395
Go back.

25
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,898
You never saw me here.

26
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,609
Go back to your place.

27
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:22,405
EPISODE 9
WAVERING WITHOUT THE WIND

28
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,340
-What's taking him so long?
-This is odd.

29
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,427
My goodness. I'm going to kill that jerk.

30
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,896
Only you in this world

31
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,024
can make me feel who I am.

32
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,530
I will not forget that you belong with me.

33
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:50,785
I vow to spend
the rest of my life with you.

34
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,505
MARRIAGE VOW

35
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:21,274
When I went too far away
and lost my way to you

36
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,026
and when I couldn't see

37
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,321
any path in the darkness,

38
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,663
you were my guide.

39
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,293
Even if the path to you is bumpy

40
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,795
and is nothing but a torturous hell,

41
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,049
as you still reached out your hand to me,

42
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:51,762
I vow…

43
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,574
Even if that path is nothing
but a torturous hell,

44
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:18,206
I vow to spend
the rest of my life with you.

45
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,053
Hui-ju.

46
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,640
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

47
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,517
-I'm good.
-What about your car?

48
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,727
The insurance company took it.

49
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,524
Shouldn't you get checked out first?
Hui-ju!

50
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,622
You're not going to see a doctor?

51
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,291
I'm completely fine.

52
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,043
Then why do you still have a long face?

53
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,046
You didn't hit anyone,
and you can just fix your car.

54
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,464
You drove here many times.

55
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,551
Were you distracted?
How did you crash into the guardrail?

56
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,888
I was running away.

57
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,813
I ran away because
I thought I would cause trouble.

58
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,358
What are you talking about?
You already got in trouble.

59
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,738
I went to her wedding.

60
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,991
Today was that woman's--

61
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,079
You went there looking like that?
Why did you go there?

62
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:27,585
Did you feel restless because she was
about to have your ex-lover for good?

63
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,050
I thought I was over him.

64
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,927
But I was wrong.

65
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,058
You're driving me nuts.

66
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,902
Answer it. It's your husband.
If you don't…

67
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,615
Hui-ju.

68
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,576
Come on!

69
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,582
Hyeon-seong. It's me, Dong-mi.

70
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,087
Well, I called Hui-ju over
because I wasn't feeling well.

71
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,047
But she got into an accident on her way.

72
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,258
No. It was a minor collision.

73
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,053
Yes. But…

74
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,849
She must have been shocked.
She fell asleep here.

75
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,935
I don't know what to do.

76
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,729
Should I wake her up?

77
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,068
Okay. Then I'll let her sleep some more.

78
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,780
I'll go pick her up. Okay.

79
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,827
-Was that Mom?
-Yes.

80
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,744
Where is she?

81
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,955
She's at Dong-mi's.

82
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,541
Her car is broken.
I'm going to pick her up.

83
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,214
It's nothing serious.
Don't worry. Go to bed.

84
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,882
Is she really at Dong-mi's?

85
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,510
Of course. I'm heading there
to pick her up now.

86
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,306
Li-sa, you probably had
a light meal to lose weight.

87
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,227
Drink it.

88
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,563
You must be
in good shape for your audition.

89
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,570
What is it?

90
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,870
-Sir, I brought some glasses.
-Put them right here.

91
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,955
Right here? All right.

92
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,169
You should keep drinking. Go on.

93
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,962
-Keep drinking.
-Okay.

94
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,383
You can come in.

95
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,511
The bar seems a bit different today.

96
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,054
It's fine. Please come in.

97
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,934
Why don't you smile?

98
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,604
Were you forced to
have the wedding or something?

99
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,024
Hey. Do you even know
that I'm your mother-in-law?

100
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,235
-Goodness. Why don't you smile?
-Hae-won.

101
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,572
-Thank you.
-Why are you so handsome?

102
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,158
No freaking way.

103
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,829
Even so. I don't trust you.

104
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,248
I don't trust

105
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,585
especially handsome men like you.

106
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,921
Those who have a history of leaving

107
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,049
will leave again and again.

108
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,550
I know that.

109
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,847
You. I'm watching you. Okay?

110
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,267
I have my eyes on you! That's right!

111
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,647
Dad. Gosh.

112
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,484
You look like you came
to object to their marriage.

113
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,367
Gosh, no way.
I'm just worried, that's all.

114
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,244
They are starting over.

115
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,663
Wish them luck instead of worrying.

116
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,375
You're right. Thank you.

117
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,508
Drink up, Dad.

118
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,470
Come on, Dad!

119
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,932
Isn't this great? You're so lucky.

RICE & BAR

121
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:19,108
Your call could not be made.
After the tone, you will be forwarded…

122
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,044
You should go back in.

123
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,257
It doesn't look nice
if the groom is away for too long.

124
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,513
Didn't you tell me

125
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,642
to trust only my feelings
when I'm confused?

126
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,271
How do you feel right now?

127
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,235
I don't feel like this is my place.

128
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,322
Something like that.

129
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,036
Even with Ms. Gu?

130
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,789
I still don't understand why Hae-won…

131
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,043
rushed this whole thing.

132
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,717
She needed to be sure.

133
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,640
That you would keep
the promise you made to her.

134
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,520
It's not love if only one party makes
all the sacrifices and helps the other.

135
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,527
You should go back inside.

136
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,864
If you avoid this now,
you're being a coward.

137
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,827
You two kissed?

MISSED CALLS
SEO WOO-JAE

139
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,292
Why? How did that happen?

140
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,296
Out of the blue. It just happened.

141
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,131
You've got to be kidding me.

142
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,051
There must have been something
that led to the kiss.

143
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,055
I went there. And he saw me.

144
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,098
That's all.

145
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,725
You guys are full of crap.

146
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,771
Whatever. A minor collision.
That's what it is.

147
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,106
Pretend it never happened.

148
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,152
Hui-ju, is your husband
really cheating on you?

149
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,530
So you did it in the heat of the moment?

150
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,282
No. That would've been better, actually.

151
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,159
What's worse than an affair?

152
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,708
That my husband

153
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,919
might know

154
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,506
what I did back then.

155
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,341
You're nuts.

156
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,593
Hey, there's no way.

157
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,513
He still cares about you
knowing what you did?

158
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,766
Men cannot simply do that.

159
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,101
I hope I'm wrong too.

160
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,062
You're wrong. If he had known,
he couldn't have stayed with you.

161
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,399
No. If he'd really known,

162
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,277
that's really crazy then.

163
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,362
But your husband…

164
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,198
Not a chance.

165
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,410
Not unless that bitch told him.

166
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:20,497
If she did, just deny it. Back then,
your mother-in-law ridiculed you.

167
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,583
And you missed Li-sa who was in England.

168
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,376
Your husband was awful too.

169
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,671
He neglected you as he started
to work for the school foundation.

170
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,173
A lonely, married woman.

171
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,634
It was easy for Woo-jae
to take advantage of you.

172
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,344
You made a mistake, that's all.

173
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,221
He played you. Just say that.

174
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:40,893
Come on.

175
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,062
Answer me.

176
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,445
Hui-ju, everyone is jealous of your life.

177
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,405
Wake up.

178
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,658
-I know.
-You know?

179
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,952
And you still do that?

180
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,664
He might be confused as he lost
his memories, but how could you…

181
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,709
You said you didn't want it.
You said it was hell.

182
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,921
Why are you making the same mistake?

183
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,931
Your husband is coming to pick you up.
Try not to look like that.

184
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,683
You… Just pretend nothing happened.

185
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,977
I will

186
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,438
because I need to believe it.

187
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,734
The lie…

188
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,905
that it's not the absolute worst yet
and I'll be okay.

189
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,123
-Hey. What is with this table?
-She's having mood swings.

190
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,874
What's wrong with this?

191
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,086
The food here is great.

192
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,922
-It's super tasty. That's why I come here.
-It's tasty.

193
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,300
Right? Don't you think
the food here is amazing?

194
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,385
Hey…

195
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,224
You're the best.

196
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,073
Where are you going?
We're leaving soon. Let's leave together.

197
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,617
Don't do that.
You should stay and have more fun.

198
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,077
Sleep over tonight.

199
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,329
I have a house.
Why would I sleep at yours?

200
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,874
I have plenty of time until the bus comes.

201
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,667
My God, you're so stubborn.

202
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,629
And you take that from me.

203
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,675
You're doing everything
you want to do. Right?

204
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,095
Yes. Almost.

205
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,847
What else is left?

206
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,558
We're going on our honeymoon
to the Cliffs of Moher.

207
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,186
Where's that?

208
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,315
The cliffs are so high that no one
could find you if you fell from them.

209
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,942
Gosh. Why would you go there?
That sounds dangerous.

210
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,031
-Hey. My daddy is leaving.
-Goodness.

211
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,407
Hey…

212
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,162
Oh, my. When will she grow up?

213
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,955
She's the one having the most fun.

214
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,541
-That hurts.
-Okay.

215
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,543
That hurts.

216
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,296
Go take care of that, instead of me.

217
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,424
-Mom.
-All right.

218
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,551
Thanks.

219
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,680
-Hey, pour me a drink.
-No, I'll bring you water.

220
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,142
Sounds great!
But it'll be better if it's alcohol!

221
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,771
It hurts.

222
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,297
I remember you getting hurt.

223
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,467
What?

224
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,387
That your fingers were
severed from the straw cutter.

225
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,598
So Hae-won stayed with you
for a few weeks.

226
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,767
She did.

227
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,187
I told her to go back,
but she didn't listen.

228
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,357
She even fed me.

229
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,735
You know, my granddaughter

230
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,905
is such a kind soul.

231
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,032
That's when it was.

232
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,330
When that happened,
Hae-won asked me to do something for her.

233
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,041
So,

234
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,753
I took over her lessons.

235
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,937
I'm so tired.

236
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,523
I kept it as simple as possible, but…

237
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,651
I guess people stay together
for all the work they did.

238
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,241
When you were saying your vows,

239
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,328
you sounded like you were
at the confessional, not a wedding.

240
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,419
Take off your coat.

241
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,010
Why couldn't you say it?

242
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,265
You couldn't say the last line.

243
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,105
"I vow to spend
the rest of my life with you."

244
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,112
The word "vow"

245
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,490
was too heavy for me.

246
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,662
If you'd given me a bit more time,
I could have--

247
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,208
Well, you don't have to say it
for it to be a vow.

248
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,505
What we showed in front of the people
is also a promise.

249
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,638
I will keep my vows.

250
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:16,311
Even if the path is bumpy
and is nothing but a torturous hell,

251
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,897
I will keep my promise that I will spend

252
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,983
the rest of my life with you.

253
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,428
Okay.

254
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,973
My wife needs a car right away.

255
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,183
When can we get the replacement vehicle?

256
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,313
We'd like a vehicle
similar to the one she was driving.

257
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,482
Please have it ready this morning.

258
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,152
Okay. Thank you.

259
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,867
I made an appointment at the hospital.

260
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,201
I said I was fine.

261
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,371
I'm not fine. Look at you.
You couldn't get any sleep.

262
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,706
You might develop symptoms.

263
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,918
The VIP service center…

264
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,756
Are you listening?

265
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,220
Yes.

266
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,056
Honey,

267
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,394
did you visit Hwain Gallery yesterday?

268
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,148
The gallery? No.

269
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,235
I thought it was closed yesterday.
Why do you ask?

270
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,867
Li-sa must have left.

271
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,286
You should go.
Don't let her leave by herself.

272
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,370
Okay.

273
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,948
Unlike others,

274
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,910
Chinese lacquer tree branches
become thin and wither away.

275
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,871
Perhaps it's best for them

276
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,749
to meet their fate
before they turn out that way.

277
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,517
X-RAY IMAGING ROOM
MRI IMAGING ROOM

278
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,229
Get physical therapy too.
Your neck and shoulders must be tense.

279
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,107
I was distracted
and crashed into a guardrail.

280
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,358
It wasn't serious.

281
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,318
Gosh. Hyeon-seong told me you'd say that

282
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,446
and asked me
to make sure you got your treatment

283
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,739
and keep an eye on you.

284
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,369
I got my treatment.
We're all good now, right?

285
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,787
Get back to work.

286
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,122
Right, Hui-ju.

287
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,917
Did you come
to Ms. Gu's wedding yesterday?

288
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,795
Why do you ask?

289
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:33,216
I saw Li-sa. I just thought
you might have been there too.

290
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,761
Li-sa?

291
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,351
-I'm so sleepy.
-No way.

292
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,395
-Did you do the homework?
-No. I'm doomed.

293
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,857
Give me your phone.

294
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,525
Why? What for?

295
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,740
…a torturous hell,

296
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,330
I vow to spend
the rest of my life with you.

297
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,498
That's all.

298
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,261
Why are you crying?

299
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,253
He fell in love
with someone else for a while.

300
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,911
Why did you invite Li-sa?
What's your angle?

301
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,293
And what are you

302
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,004
plotting with my husband?

303
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,509
What is it that you know?

304
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,096
Now you're interested?

305
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,597
Why?

306
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,476
Are you going through
a hard time these days?

307
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,646
People who are happy
aren't interested in others.

308
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,857
Your life must be ruined

309
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,235
to wonder why life is so unfair,
how other people are doing,

310
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,530
and if you're the only one suffering.

311
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,243
I meant it when I wished you happiness.

312
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,829
And I still hope you live a good life.

313
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,751
That way, you will stop
taking an interest in my life.

314
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,800
I didn't invite Li-sa.

315
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,805
I realized something
during my brief time as a teacher.

316
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,059
Surprisingly,
parents are often the ones who cause

317
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,728
the most pain to their children.

318
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,317
Children are supposed to love
and trust their parents the most.

319
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,694
But kids feel immensely betrayed

320
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,072
by their misspoken words
and wrongful behavior.

321
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,036
Because you know that,

322
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,497
you came to me
instead of going straight to Li-sa.

323
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,919
Because you're afraid to find out
what she might know.

324
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,176
And as for what I know,

325
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,846
you can ask your husband, Mr. An.

326
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,849
That is if you have the courage.

327
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,273
You don't have to wrap them up.
I'm throwing them out.

328
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,025
All of them?

329
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,486
Yes. They are old photos.
I'll take new ones.

330
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,154
I'll pay the disposal fee.

331
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,483
It's me, Seo Woo-jae!

332
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,758
Ms. Jeong.

333
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,229
It looks like
Ms. Gu is preparing to file a lawsuit

334
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,566
on the infringement of property rights
against Taerim Academy.

335
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,568
As for this matter, Hyeon-seong…

336
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,864
Mr. An should take care of this.

337
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,159
But the tenants already agreed
to our compensation deal.

338
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,286
So it won't be a problem.

339
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,915
She already got fired.
Why is she getting in our way?

340
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,417
Something about that doesn't seem right.

341
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,588
Mr. An made the personal decision
of giving her a letter of recommendation.

342
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,715
Hardly a disciplinary action.

343
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,553
A letter of recommendation?
Where does she work now?

344
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,430
She works at Hwain Gallery.

345
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,017
Her husband is a sculptor
named Seo Woo-jae.

346
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,728
He works with the same gallery.

347
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,229
Seo Woo-jae?

348
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,067
Should I look into
Mr. An and Ms. Gu's relationship?

349
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,151
No.

350
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,697
Look into that guy named Seo Woo-jae
and Hui-ju.

351
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,033
May I ask why?

352
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,495
-She would never do such--
-Hey.

353
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:39,207
In this world, people who would
never do such a thing end up doing so.

354
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,043
You're a lawyer.
How could you trust people?

355
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,341
Find out what those two are caught up in.

356
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,888
TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

357
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,691
If this is about Ju-yeong's father,
I have nothing to say to you.

358
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,401
Okay.

359
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,362
I feel more comfortable
talking to Mr. Lee about that.

360
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,157
Then why did you want to meet?
And here of all places?

361
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,619
Did you know that
there had been a fire in the building?

362
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,620
Three times at that.

363
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,583
At first, they were busy
trying to put out the fire.

364
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,669
And the second time around,

365
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,630
they probably started to wonder
what caused another fire.

366
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,549
But the third time?

367
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,261
It just means that
there is a problem with this building.

368
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,512
What's your point?

369
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:39,475
You can try to be careful all you want,
but there can always be another fire.

370
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,271
I'll be even more careful then.

371
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:49,986
My wife asked me
if I had been at your wedding.

372
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,156
You should also be careful,
so there isn't any misunderstanding.

373
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,409
I knew it.
So she came to my wedding after all.

374
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,415
Too bad. It could have been interesting.

375
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,376
What's so interesting?

376
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,630
The groom running off with another woman.

377
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:15,595
Then I could have acted like the most
heartbroken bride in front of everyone.

378
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,560
Back then, we just tried
to go abroad to study.

379
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,605
Our marriage was a formality,
so no one knew about it.

380
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,399
But since it's official,
I can say things like,

381
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,486
"Thief! Catch that groom-thief!"

382
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,529
I can make accusations now.

383
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,950
I guess

384
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,454
he wouldn't be able to run away from me
on a whim like that anymore.

385
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,708
We're now responsible
to do our duties as a married couple.

386
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,128
Even if he wants to break up, he must
go through a process called divorce.

387
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,130
Sorry to interrupt.

388
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,803
I don't have time
to listen to your petty delusions.

389
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,888
Hui-ju

390
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,183
is curious about what I know.

391
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,024
I guess Hui-ju doesn't know

392
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,236
about Woo-jae's accident
and the relationship

393
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,655
between you and Woo-jae.

394
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,414
Didn't I tell you?

395
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,585
What happened to Mr. Seo
was just an accident.

396
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,340
He was drunk and walking on the road,
so he was more at fault.

397
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,592
I reported the accident
and got him treated.

398
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,012
I just couldn't find any documents
to identify who he was.

399
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,931
When I asked you about this before,

400
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,600
that was the same answer you gave me.
To the word exactly.

401
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,769
Like a well-memorized line.

402
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,608
Well, that's the truth.

403
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,026
How much of it is true?

404
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:59,115
Omitting some parts to the story
is the same as lying.

405
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,500
TO THE WORLD WITH YOUR DREAMS FROM TAERIM

406
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,049
Your wife wants to see me.

407
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,219
Now?

408
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,638
Yes. How should I handle this?

409
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,558
Go meet her.

410
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,435
Whatever she asks,

411
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,356
just tell her the truth
as far as you know.

412
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,741
It was an accident?

413
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,912
So you two got into the accident
during the business trip?

414
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,207
It was a narrow two-lane road
without street lamps or sidewalks.

415
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,791
And we weren't speeding.

416
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,128
The blood-alcohol level
of the victim was very high.

417
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,505
As he was an undocumented alien
without any ID,

418
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,799
Mr. An paid for the medical bills.

419
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,927
until family showed up to discharge him,

420
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,180
And his family was…

421
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,849
On paper, it was Ms. Gu Hae-won.

422
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,935
But her travel logs didn't add up.

423
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:13,689
A clueless international student was paid
to pretend to be his family.

424
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,025
Legally speaking,

425
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,569
it won't be a problem
to Mr. An or the foundation.

426
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,530
Of course not.

427
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,659
Car accidents can happen anywhere.

428
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,247
It only makes sense to believe that.

429
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,763
AGREEMENT

430
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,897
Mr. Lee Il-seong was transferred
to a detention facility yesterday.

431
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,152
As it's a special assault case,
he can't get out unless we settle.

432
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,239
If he gets lucky,
he might get off with a fine.

433
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,033
But he might just serve time
instead of paying the fine.

434
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,661
Then Ju-yeong will end up in foster care.

435
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,247
Why must an innocent kid suffer?

436
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,749
I think it's better for him

437
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,253
to at least fight
than to get out with nothing.

438
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,337
Ms. Gu.

439
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,341
Wait, no. You're not
even a teacher at the school.

440
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,513
They are practically strangers.
Why are you going this far to help them?

441
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,683
You made them hold out this long.
Is it your sense of responsibility?

442
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,102
Have you heard of good deeds?

443
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,398
Let's be honest.

444
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,609
You're only calling it that
when this is about you being greedy.

445
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,031
So you're turning this into
a class-action suit. What are you after?

446
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,325
Screwing Taerim over?

447
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,410
Can't I?

448
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,124
We're already collecting memoranda
from the tenants that they won't sue us.

449
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,546
Then I can claim
that they only signed the papers

450
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,549
as they were afraid
they wouldn't be compensated.

451
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:08,054
And the judge will evaluate if
the memoranda are legally binding or not.

452
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,185
Anyway, I'll pass this along to Mr. Lee.

453
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,604
Sligo General Hospital.

454
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,025
Mr. Seo was hospitalized there. Right?

455
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,490
Ms. Gu. It looks like you and Mr. An
have been involved here and there.

456
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,204
That's funny. I talked about that
with Mr. An before I met you.

457
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,460
What? You didn't know?

458
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:45,633
I guess he hasn't accepted you as family
whom he can trust and rely on fully.

459
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:55,226
Perhaps you and I
have similar goals in mind.

460
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,562
See you around.

461
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,678
DIRECTOR LEE JEONG-EUN

462
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,556
Hello, Ms. Lee.

463
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,515
Mr. Seo.

464
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,685
Are you available tomorrow
for a meeting regarding Mr. Woo's project?

465
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,065
Ms. Jeong is coming, right?

466
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,150
Yes.

467
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,153
Okay.

468
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,574
DIRECTOR LEE JEONG-EUN

469
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:58,122
CALLS
JEONG HUI-JU

470
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:02,311
SEO WOO-JAE

471
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,069
Yes?

472
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,323
Where are you now?

473
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,333
Could we meet for a bit?

474
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,171
Yes. I would like to see you.

475
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,757
Where are you?

476
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,009
I'm in front of your studio.

477
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,136
What?

478
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,999
So we're having
meetings starting tomorrow.

479
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:11,880
I thought it would be more uncomfortable
if we didn't clear the air.

480
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,011
I think I've told you this once before.

481
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,017
What happened yesterday…

482
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,606
It's understandable.

483
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,817
Weddings make people do crazy things.

484
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,487
I understand the feeling
of wanting to break free.

485
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,659
So what happened yesterday
was a mistake and a mere accident.

486
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,120
A mistake. An accident.

487
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,667
Are you sure that's all it was?

488
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,962
It must be.

489
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,549
You've met my husband.

490
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,343
That question is quite insulting.

491
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,138
No. The person who should be more insulted

492
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,557
must be Hae-won, not me.

493
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,896
Yes. I know that.

494
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,733
I know that I'm being irresponsible

495
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,819
for having these emotions…

496
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,200
and behaving this way.

497
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,327
It's not like we were having an affair.

498
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,622
You don't have to tell Hae-won about it.

499
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,458
Sometimes, the truth can be more painful.

500
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,212
So keep it a secret?

501
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,759
Why must I?

502
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,429
Because you already
abandoned Hae-won once before.

503
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,561
And I know how much
Hae-won has changed because of that.

504
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,567
If you turn away from her again,
Hae-won will die.

505
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,738
So she cannot find out.

506
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,033
Pretend it never happened to the end.

507
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,373
Please…

508
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,544
live your own lives.

509
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,690
I needed to believe.

510
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,861
I needed to believe
that you wouldn't let me get hurt.

511
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,895
I definitely saw
the bandages somewhere here.

512
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,400
Forget it. We can buy one outside.

513
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,568
I'm sure I had it here.

514
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,366
Isn't it scary sleeping here alone?

515
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,035
Why? Will you sleep here with me?

516
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,331
I'm comfortable here. It's home.

517
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,876
Did your mom really have an affair?

518
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,794
Your dad could have lied to you.

519
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,964
She probably did. She's not coming back.

520
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,510
My dad gets drunk and fights all the time,
but he still comes home.

521
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,472
But Mom didn't after abandoning me.
So that proves it.

522
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,225
I'm hungry. Let's eat ramyeon.

523
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,115
So you met with Mr. Choi today.

524
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,327
Yes. It turns out the accident happened

525
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,373
when I went back to Ireland
to attend the View Art Fair.

526
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:17,626
I also booked a business trip there,
so I could go with you then.

527
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,421
Right. You did.

528
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,424
Then why did you say that
at my exhibition?

529
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,801
Say what?

530
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,303
During the opening reception
of my solo exhibition,

531
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,806
you asked me this after seeing Mr. Seo.

532
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:34,059
Her husband seemed a bit strange.

533
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,311
I heard he had an accident.

534
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,188
Have you heard the details?

535
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,649
Did I say that?

536
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,529
I never thought we'd meet again,

537
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,823
so I must not have thought to tell you.

538
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,204
If you'd told me about this sooner,

539
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,333
I wouldn't have accepted this project
no matter how great

540
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,002
this opportunity may be for me.

541
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,296
I didn't think it through. I'm sorry.

542
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,007
It's all good now that I know.

543
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,635
Once this project is over,
we really don't have to see them again.

544
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,345
Thank you for trusting me.

545
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,308
Of course. And I ought to.

546
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,772
Do you remember when your mother
adamantly disapproved of our marriage?

547
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,357
That's random.

548
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,735
I thought you would give up.

549
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,155
I told you that was
the only time I didn't listen to her

550
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,948
and the best thing I did.

551
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,411
You took the pregnancy test stick from me

552
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,913
and ran to her like
it was some kind of weapon.

553
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,082
I did.

554
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,544
Li-sa was my weapon.

555
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,886
I'm distracting you.
I should let you work.

556
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,929
Just hurry up and finish it.

557
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,641
Thank you for telling me the truth.

558
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,146
Omitting some parts to the story

559
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,398
is the same as lying.

560
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,748
When did you get here?

561
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,127
Where's Mom?

562
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,797
In her studio.

563
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,550
She's worried. Go say hello.
You didn't even see her in the morning.

564
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,012
You've been weird since yesterday.

565
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,099
Do you need to talk to me?

566
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,066
Li-sa, if there's
anything going on at school--

567
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,901
Nothing's going on. I'm hungry.

568
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,590
Woo-jae, you really changed.

569
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,300
Like a different person.

570
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,143
Look at these.

571
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,646
The weather over there isn't good now.

572
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,025
So there's no guarantee
that we'll be able to visit the cliffs.

573
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,110
We should go after your project is over.

574
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:55,946
Hae-won.

575
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:58,824
Yes?

576
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,371
Was it a good thing…

577
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,166
for me to come back?

578
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,550
We'll see.

579
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:22,055
And to be precise, you didn't come back.

580
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,267
I found you.

581
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,650
When will your memories come back?

582
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,116
Who did this to you?

583
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,329
Who did this to you?

584
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,124
Was it Ju-yeong?

585
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,335
Or was it her again? Gu--

586
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,587
I did it. It was an accident.

587
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,504
Get out.

588
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,561
WARNING
THIS BUILDING WILL BE DEMOLISHED

589
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,314
Ju-yeong.

590
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,823
It wasn't here yesterday.

591
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,159
I saw it when I came out
to go to school today.

592
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,162
When will my dad come back?

593
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,331
Actually, I'm on my way to see him now.

594
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,668
Go to school.
Call me when classes are over.

595
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,838
It's dangerous here.
So don't stay here by yourself. Okay?

596
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,049
Okay.

597
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:32,519
Mr. Lee. We will continue the lawsuit
for infringement of property rights.

598
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,771
But you must get out of there first.

599
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,565
You can't let Ju-yeong be all alone.

600
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,739
Here's the agreement.

601
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,577
AGREEMENT

602
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,759
This is the most money
you will get for compensation.

603
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,221
We could've kicked you out
without giving you anything.

604
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,433
But I feel bad for Ms. Gu
who is trying so hard to help you.

605
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,229
And I'm a father too.

606
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,287
Since Mr. Woo's building
is the main piece,

607
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,247
let's try to make the space stand out.

608
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,584
You can bring out the vivid impression
when the building is in use.

609
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,170
You can convey
the before-demolition energy.

610
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,090
Yes. This would look great too.

611
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:50,138
I think Hae-won sent you
photos of everything in my studio.

612
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,514
But they are very raw.

613
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,224
I can't present them to people.

614
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,394
I'm sorry I'm late.

615
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,067
You heard, right?
Ms. Gu will be assisting you two.

616
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,944
Depending on how they are installed,

617
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,280
people could have
completely new interpretations.

618
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,908
Since Mr. Seo rarely uses
any colors in his pieces,

619
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,452
should we choose your pieces
that will suit his tone?

620
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:15,830
Trying to add colors to his pieces
would be a nice challenge.

621
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,667
What do you think, Mr. Seo?

622
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:24,547
I was trying to express
only one type of emotion in this series.

623
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,884
If I were to use colors,
I'd like to use only one color.

624
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:32,680
What kind of emotion? How did you feel
when you were planning your piece?

625
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,895
Did you have a specific model
for this piece?

626
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:40,688
That's--

627
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,525
He looked in the mirror
and posed for himself.

628
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,487
I can see that. It's tall and flat.

629
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,405
This is totally you.

630
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,992
You're good at executing the curves.
You could do one with a woman.

631
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,453
You have a nice model.

632
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:01,000
He doesn't work with models.
Especially female models.

633
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,261
Why are you drawing me?

634
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,638
Because while I draw you,

635
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,558
I get to look at you as much as I want
no matter how long.

636
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,371
You need to see sculptures in person
to get a feel of the size and texture.

637
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,540
We should go to Mr. Seo's studio together.

638
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,918
Ms. Jeong, you haven't been
to his studio yet. Right?

639
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,592
How about a meal before we go?

640
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,302
There's a new bistro nearby.

641
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,221
I'm sorry. My housekeeper
is leaving early today.

642
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,390
I must go
and prepare dinner for my children.

643
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,978
I just realized that you are
the only one with kids here, Ms. Jeong.

644
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,231
What about you two?

645
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,068
Gosh. What's wrong with me?

646
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,654
I'm getting old too.
I keep asking personal questions.

647
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:12,697
It's okay.

648
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,242
Woo-jae loves kids.
So it's sad we don't have a kid yet.

649
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:18,620
Really?

650
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,164
No. We don't want any kids yet.

651
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,168
I'll get going now.

652
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,756
You'll have to see the space again to
get an idea on how to interpret it. Right?

653
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,967
Mr. Woo will talk
to the building management.

654
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,594
Go and see it whenever you need.

655
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,262
Okay. Thank you.

656
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,401
I need to sort out my thoughts
from this meeting today.

657
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,487
Let's take a rain check.

658
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,239
I'll be in the studio.

659
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,573
Okay.

660
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,341
Hello.

661
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,301
Did you eat?

662
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,388
No. I didn't yet.

663
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,434
All right.

664
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,112
This calls for soju.

665
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,199
I can't leave the car here
since it's the gallery's.

666
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,576
Can you be my chauffeur?

667
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:45,373
I don't drive.

668
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,209
That was a very harsh no.

669
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:56,259
Sorry about that.
Someone doesn't like it when I drive.

670
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,804
Who? And why?

671
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,932
Even if I were to ask you,
you wouldn't tell me.

672
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:08,146
By the way, why were you at the hospital?

673
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,233
My daily bread.

674
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,114
INTERNAL MEDICINE

675
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:23,161
If you take benzodiazepine with steroids,
it's worse for your health.

676
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,788
That's not for me.

677
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,167
I give that to Woo-jae.

678
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,503
He developed a tolerance for other drugs.

679
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,673
So he can only sleep well with it.

680
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,888
You told me that I seemed high-strung.

681
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,223
You were right.

682
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,935
I'm nervous that
Woo-jae might run away while I'm asleep.

683
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,902
I didn't pester you for an answer.
So don't look at me like that.

684
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,780
Okay.

685
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,376
The neighborhood is great here.

686
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,379
When you buy land, you must consider
the future projects there.

687
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,923
-Right.
-I already bought 500 pyeong of land.

688
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,549
Want to see my contract?

689
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:22,220
Gosh. I'll show it to you.
You can take a look.

690
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,806
Right here. Gu Jeong-yeon. 500 pyeong.

691
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:25,807
-It's true.
-It is.

692
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,433
If it's not developed in a decade,

693
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,477
I'll buy it back. Okay?

694
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,940
Real estate is about reading
the flow of the market and timing.

695
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,526
If you miss your window,
say bye-bye for good.

696
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,861
-Excuse me.
-Goodness.

697
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,947
Ladies, have some food.

698
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,950
The food here is one of the best
in this neighborhood.

699
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,035
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

700
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,121
-Dig in.
-Okay.

701
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,831
All right. Let's try some food.

702
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,749
The location is pretty good.

703
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:55,378
I'm going to make you ladies super-rich.

704
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,130
I should ask my husband first.

705
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:00,883
-Come on, girl. What do men know?
-I guess they don't?

706
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,510
Leave it to us women…

707
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,142
Ms. Gu.

708
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,394
I need the measurement list for Choi.

709
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,437
Okay.

710
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,611
Your home address.

711
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,113
Excuse me.

712
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,616
They are making a fuss.

713
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,454
I felt a bit dizzy,
so I asked them for some medicine.

714
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:33,833
They are forcing me to go to a university
hospital and take a brain scan.

715
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:37,879
That must mean it's something serious.
And this is not the first time--

716
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,964
For people my age,

717
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:43,092
being in perfect health is even weirder.

718
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,344
Give me your address.

719
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,972
I'll drop off some stuff since I'm here.

720
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,057
They are heavy. Why did you…

721
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,310
Just use the courier service.

722
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:55,062
I don't know
when they will deliver this to your house.

723
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,939
I want you to eat it right away.

724
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,651
Just wait for me at the bus terminal.

725
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,820
You have a daughter and a granddaughter.

726
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,615
Anyway, just wait. I'll be there.

727
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,036
Ms. Gu.

728
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,377
Hello.

729
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,883
Thank you.

730
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,160
The image on this page looks too cold.

731
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,663
So, increase the intensity
of magenta by 30 percent.

732
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:54,956
Another color revision?

733
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,543
Yes. The artist specifically
asked to get this done.

734
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,754
And can you increase
the font by five points?

735
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,673
We must finish everything in two days.

736
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:07,760
We cannot make all these revisions
and meet our delivery date.

737
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,221
Please help us this once.
This is very important.

738
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:14,058
Listen. If it is,
why don't you give us more time then?

739
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:18,813
KUMHYO EXPRESS

740
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,235
Woo-jae will go instead of me.

741
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:27,029
Woo-jae will be there.

742
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,364
Wait there, Grandpa.

743
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,451
Hello. Woo-jae.

744
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,329
Where are you now?

745
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,499
I'm at the building to sketch it.

746
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,586
I'm stuck at work right now.
But my grandpa…

747
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,129
Hello?

748
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,673
My grandpa is waiting at the bus terminal.

749
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,592
Can you go and pick him up for me?

750
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,635
Hae-won, I can't hear you well.

751
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,262
Can you text me?

752
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:04,418
Maybe I should've told you
that I was going to be here today.

753
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,968
I'm done looking around.
You can take your time here.

754
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:15,221
You lied to me, didn't you?

755
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,708
The call could not be made.
After the tone…

756
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,751
WOO-JAE

757
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,296
MY GRANDPA

758
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,301
Mom!

759
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:16,073
MY PUPPY

760
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:45,686
You told me that I used to hate you.

761
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,023
It was a lie, right?

762
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,279
I didn't hate you.

763
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,449
I liked you.

764
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:46,163
Did you also have feelings for me?

765
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,540
Do you want to turn back time?

766
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,458
I'll wait for you.

767
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,418
Where were you then?

768
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,879
Where in the world were you?

769
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,047
It's driving me nuts!

770
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,049
I keep seeing someone else in her.

771
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,592
You crazy bastard.

772
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,970
No matter how much
you pine for each other,

773
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,139
it's nothing but a filthy affair
that no one recognizes.

774
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:06,976
Are you also here for my birthday party?

775
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:10,396
I don't think I was invited yet.
Will you invite me?

776
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,731
Hae-won! Where are you?

777
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,608
Wherever you are,

778
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:21,699
I will follow you tirelessly.

779
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:27,621
