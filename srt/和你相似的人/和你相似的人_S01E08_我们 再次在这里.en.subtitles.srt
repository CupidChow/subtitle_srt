00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,024
KOREAN YOUTH DANCE COMPETITION

2
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,572
ONE DAY AGO

3
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,294
Li-sa.

4
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,767
Was there anyone
Li-sa was close with while practicing?

5
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,479
Anyone who might know where she went?

6
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,941
Yes. There was a girl
who'd film all of her rehearsals.

7
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,734
-Her name was--
-Lee Ju-yeong?

8
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,194
Yes, I think so.

9
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,864
Did she come here today?

10
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,993
I think I saw her a while ago,
but I don't know where she went.

11
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,753
I see. Thanks.

12
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,010
Honey.

13
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,312
I'll go look around more.

14
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,732
You draw someone because you love them.

15
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,570
And I think I saw him there.

16
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,048
HYEON-SEONG

17
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,386
I got a hold of Ju-yeong.
They're together.

18
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,428
Don't worry.

19
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,806
Are you there?

20
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,768
Hui-ju. Where are you right now?

21
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,322
Hey! Wait up!

22
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,282
My goodness.

23
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,705
Wait up! Walk slowly!

24
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,290
Okay.

25
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,187
I thought I ran away best I could,

26
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,522
but I'm back to square one.

27
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:06,157
EPISODE 8
US, HERE AGAIN

28
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,434
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

29
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,603
I'll make some radish soup.
It won't take long.

30
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,146
Where's Woo-jae?

31
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,442
He said he was busy
and left early in the morning.

32
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,404
Without even telling me?

33
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,658
You were sound asleep,
so he didn't want to wake you.

34
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,159
He wanted you to sleep in.

35
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,705
Then I'll sleep a bit more.

36
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,856
FAVORITES
WOO-JAE

37
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,026
WOO-JAE

38
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,118
Ju-yeong, did you go to school?

39
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,620
I have a favor to ask.

40
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,628
I told you
that place was private property.

41
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,422
Why did you go up there again?

42
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,091
To die?

43
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,760
Maybe I shouldn't have grabbed you.

44
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,138
-That's not why.
-Then

45
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,017
did Hae-won tell you to keep an eye on me?

46
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,185
Of course not.

47
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,813
I had no idea you'd be there.

48
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,609
So it's just another coincidence?

49
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,493
Or maybe not.

50
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,498
I did think that maybe

51
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,541
I would run into you there.

52
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,806
If it was because
of what I said yesterday…

53
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,226
I hope you will be happy this time.

54
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,102
You want us to be happy this time?

55
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,688
Then were we unhappy before?

56
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,817
Don't take it to heart.

57
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,989
To be frank,
I don't care much how you two live.

58
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,199
Even now.

59
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,953
I'm more worried about myself
than my daughter who didn't come home.

60
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,416
We'll be running into each other often
because of the project,

61
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,085
but I hope not like this.

62
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,096
Let's do a good job, Mr. Seo.

63
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,040
It was just a mistake.
It's not a big deal.

64
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,793
It is a big deal.

65
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,587
I keep making the same mistake.

66
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,464
And that makes me anxious,
so I keep falling.

67
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,886
Li-sa.

68
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,515
Don't let it get to you.

69
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,476
It means you'll get better
if you work on it.

70
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,398
But you should be sorry
for running away and worrying us.

71
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,445
Your mom couldn't sleep
and left early in the morning to find you.

72
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,282
-She did?
-Yes.

73
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,454
She went to Ju-yeong's house.
Didn't you see her?

74
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,598
Li-sa.

75
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,524
To me, no one is
more precious than you are.

76
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,819
That's all you need to know.

77
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,864
Let me go. You're drenched.

78
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,823
It may have seemed useless,

79
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,033
but look at how much they've grown.

80
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,829
I should make your mom
some hangover soup with this.

81
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,123
I'll add a bunch of garlic.

82
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,337
When will she grow up?

83
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:07,435
You just can't give up on him, can you?

84
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,486
Fine. Do as you wish.

85
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,742
It's not like
I can stop you from loving him.

86
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,333
LEE JU-YEONG SENT A PHOTO

87
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,029
Hae-won! Gu Hae-won!

88
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,221
DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

89
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:12,226
RESTRICTED NUMBER

90
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,917
Your phone was vibrating,
but I couldn't find it.

91
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,586
Did you leave it here?

92
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,337
Right.

93
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,888
You have two phones? Why?

94
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,099
This is my work phone.
I use this for work-related matters.

95
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,312
Did you get some sleep?

96
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,733
Yes. But I still feel under the weather.
I should go.

97
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,695
Make sure you pick up Li-sa
from her dance studio.

98
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,613
Okay.

99
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,490
-Bye.
-Bye.

100
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,627
He's definitely cheating on you
if he has two phones.

101
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,589
Could your ex

102
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:27,885
get me my husband's call records?
I want to see if it's really for work.

103
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,388
I can ask him,
but are you sure about this?

104
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:34,892
It's better to be certain
than to torment myself with doubts.

105
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,561
What if he's really cheating?

106
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,813
What do you think? I'll turn a blind eye.

107
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,941
Then why bother looking into it?

108
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,237
Being uncertain and turning a blind eye
are very different things.

109
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,284
I guess looking the other way
lets it end as a fling.

110
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,706
You must protect
your marriage until you grow old.

111
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,125
You have too much to lose
if you get a divorce.

112
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,380
It can't be her, right?

113
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,425
The woman who came here last time.
She seemed feisty.

114
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,427
Maybe she's taking revenge on you.

115
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,929
Right before her wedding?

116
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,765
What? Isn't she already married?

117
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,350
They didn't have a wedding yet.

118
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,227
Why would she have it now?

119
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,437
Maybe she's warning you.

120
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,691
"He's mine,
so don't you dare touch him again."

121
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,984
Something like that.

122
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,073
That's so pointless.
Why would I go through that hell again?

123
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,607
Hey.

124
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,069
Don't leave without telling me.

125
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,281
I didn't want to wake you.

126
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,119
I thought you ran away again.

127
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,415
I'm sorry.

128
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,419
Get some rest.

129
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,932
There's no point in holding onto him.

130
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,812
Doing that won't do you any good.

131
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,483
Abandon him and live your life.

132
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,946
But I can't abandon him.

133
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,120
Because I am…

134
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,290
the abandoned one here.

135
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,353
Ho-su, let's go home.

136
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,854
Thank you, Mother.

137
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,566
Sure. Massage my legs before you go
if you're thankful.

138
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,069
My legs are swollen.

139
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,744
Where's Li-sa?

140
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,330
Hyeon-seong just picked her up
from her dance studio.

141
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,917
How dare she run away from home?

142
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,672
She didn't. She told him
she'd be sleeping over at her friend's.

143
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:56,093
How can you control her
when you didn't receive proper discipline?

144
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,221
If you can't handle her,
we'll just hire an expert.

145
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,976
The entrance exam is just around
the corner, so she's sensitive.

146
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,062
All the more reason why
you should hire an expert.

147
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:13,026
Only those who have no money
argue that kids need their mother's touch.

148
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,782
That feels nice.

149
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,786
You sure are dexterous.

150
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:27,624
I'd rather have you massage me
than call a masseuse.

151
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:36,216
We need to do what we're good at.

152
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,453
JEONG HUI-JU

153
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,290
Sir, be careful with that.

154
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,462
Have all these paintings been--

155
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,006
They were purchased
at the beginning of the exhibition.

156
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,927
Some of the buyers wanted them sooner,
so we already sent out a few yesterday.

157
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,059
Who bought that painting?

158
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,647
That's one of my favorites,

159
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,565
so I'm just curious.

160
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,701
What's with this awkwardness?

161
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,958
Let me.

162
00:20:56,004 --> 00:21:00,550
Congratulations on the success
of your exhibition.

163
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,055
It was unfortunate that I was in a rush.

164
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,849
But it went smoothly all thanks to you.

165
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,643
You know that your works will be hung

166
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,645
at Yangjin Group's new headquarters,
right?

167
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,565
I'll make sure
they're displayed in the best spots.

168
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,692
Thank you.

169
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,319
Maybe we can talk about this in private.

170
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,738
Silly me.

171
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,870
I wanted you to see some
of Mr. Woo's works before meeting him.

172
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,710
Let me thank you again for
accepting this offer for Mr. Seo's sake.

173
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:37,963
Thank you.

174
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,608
What's wrong?

175
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,654
I can't understand a thing he's saying.

176
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,159
You don't have to understand language
to understand art.

177
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,581
It was selfish of me to steal
your opportunity and pursue this.

178
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,124
I can wait.

179
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,793
I'm still young.

180
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,519
Ho-su.

181
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,237
Go to sleep.

182
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,673
I've always been a fan of Mr. Woo's work.

183
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,676
I'm not doing this for anyone
or doing you a favor.

184
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,554
Mr. Woo will be meeting us there,

185
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,347
so let's all take my car.

186
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,057
I'll drop you off here again.

187
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,725
Okay.

188
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,398
This is Mr. Woo Jeong-hyo.

189
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,692
This is Ms. Jeong Hui-ju.

190
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,402
-And this is
-Hello.

191
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,778
Mr. Seo Woo-jae.

192
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,155
Thank you for coming.

193
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,448
Shall we go inside?

194
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,533
-Okay.
-Okay.

195
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,705
What do you think?

196
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,834
It's a pity that this place
will be demolished after the exhibition.

197
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,629
That's the downside of architectural art.

198
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,631
It's different from other art.

199
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,717
Since they're built for use,

200
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,971
they're bound to wear down and disappear.

201
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,641
Besides, this place
has been abandoned for too long.

202
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:21,811
To keep something for a long time,
effort and sacrifice are needed.

203
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,480
You're right.

204
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,942
Now that I've grown older,
I finally realize how hard it is

205
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,611
to protect what's already mine.

206
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,614
You're still very young though.

207
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,951
-Let's go.
-Okay.

208
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,110
She's getting her car.

209
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,216
Ms. Lee left first to drive Mr. Woo.

210
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,719
I'll drop you off at the gallery.

211
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,599
TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

212
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,019
FINAL NOTICE OF DEMOLITION

213
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,398
Gosh, it's so messy.

214
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,275
-Let's put one here.
-Sure.

215
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,570
-Up here?
-Over there.

216
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,488
My gosh!

217
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,781
Don't touch my property.

218
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,367
-Sir! Please calm down!
-Leave.

219
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,244
-Sir!
-Get away from here, you bastards!

220
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,038
-You're going to hurt someone!
-Leave!

221
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,956
That's enough! Sir!

222
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,302
We've given you more than enough time.

223
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,472
You're the one
who rejected all our offers.

224
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,640
You mean that chump change?

225
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,643
This area is pretty much dead.

226
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,855
Holding out here
won't bring it back to life, will it?

227
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,038
Think of your daughter.

228
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,998
She's very talented.

229
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,335
Shouldn't you help her attend
the school of her dreams?

230
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:54,172
That's exactly why I can't leave.
If I leave, we'll die.

231
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,007
We'll all die!

232
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,016
Hold out here, and you'll also die.

233
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,398
TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

234
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,545
We'll all die. We'll just all die.

235
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,588
Die!

236
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,714
Die!

237
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,743
If it feels stuffy,
I'll turn off the heater.

238
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,413
You were dry coughing. It's cold out.

239
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,048
LEE JU-YEONG

240
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,302
Hey, Ju-yeong.
I'm driving right now. What is it?

241
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,637
Ms. Gu, what should I do?

242
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,943
How did you know I was here?

243
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,112
Does that even matter right now?

244
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,947
What happened?

245
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,491
It's nothing.

246
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,577
How could you say that
when you cut your forehead?

247
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,581
The CT scan came out fine.

248
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,249
He just needs to treat his wound.

249
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,711
Let's ask another doctor
to treat me, not my sister.

250
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,463
I already did.

251
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,633
You need to be admitted
for us to be at an advantage.

252
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,843
I should do that.

253
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:07,639
I won't settle with him
until he accepts the compensation.

254
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,642
Rather, you should demand
compensation from him.

255
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,852
He's at a disadvantage.

256
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,897
This is a special assault case
since he hit you with a cue stick.

257
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,525
I'm fine. You can relax.

258
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,610
It's just a work-related matter,

259
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,111
and it's going well.

260
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,657
Honey, did you…

261
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,244
get hit on purpose?

262
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,331
I wasn't going to actually hit him.

263
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,125
I was just swinging it around,

264
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,086
but he approached me and got hit.

265
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,047
That still doesn't change the fact
that you assaulted him.

266
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,134
But how could I sit still
and watch them post those notices?

267
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,636
How could I?

268
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,888
Remember what you told me?

269
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,808
You said not to give up
and that we had enough time.

270
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,185
So what is this
sudden notice of demolition?

271
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,814
Does this make any sense to you?
Of course not.

272
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,723
Take her to our house.
She shouldn't be alone.

273
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,525
-What about you?
-I can stay at the studio.

274
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,443
Go on.

275
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,503
Your call could not be made.
After the tone…

276
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,348
Yes?

277
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,350
Ma'am, you have a visitor.

278
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,769
At this hour?

279
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,896
He's here to give you your bag.

280
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,115
Where's my bag?

281
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,158
He wants to give it to you himself.

282
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,464
You weren't picking up, so…

283
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,219
Ms. Lee gave me your address.

284
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,431
Here's your bag.

285
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,851
Thank you. Goodbye, then.

286
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,810
Wait.

287
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,439
I wasn't meaning to look, but…

288
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:53,114
Are these my sketches?

289
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,950
What?

290
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,828
They are, aren't they?

291
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,289
Of course not.

292
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,251
If that was the case,
why would I have them?

293
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,295
Goodbye.

294
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,145
SECURITY

295
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,534
There was a visitor.

296
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,620
VISITOR NOTICE

297
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,323
What are you doing here without the girl?

298
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,742
She must've been tired. She's asleep.

299
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,661
Where have you been?

300
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,080
I went to give back Ms. Jeong's bag.

301
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,627
She had left it in the car,
and you had a lot on your mind.

302
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,550
-At this hour?
-I left it there.

303
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,428
At the maintenance office.

304
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,143
She had brought it with her to the site,
so I thought she'd need it.

305
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,109
You seem to be quite concerned about her.

306
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,612
She provided me with a great opportunity.

307
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:42,366
And since we'll be working together,
we'll have to…

308
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,880
You just need to fill this in.
I'll take care of the rest.

309
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,932
MARRIAGE VOW

310
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,268
There will be no officiant.

311
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,395
They just read their vows nowadays.

312
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,073
What is it? Do you not want to?

313
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,700
No.

314
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,204
It's just all very sudden for me.

315
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,957
Can you give me some time?

316
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,627
I've waited way far too long.

317
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,422
You should yield to me this time.

318
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,277
TAERIM HOSPITAL

319
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,420
You know that Mr. Lee had no intention

320
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,630
of harming you.

321
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,466
Please settle and let him out.

322
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,136
He's Ju-yeong's sole guardian.

323
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:29,473
Didn't I already tell you
that this was a losing game?

324
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,767
You shouldn't have given him false hope.

325
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,520
And you're responsible for turning him

326
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,440
into a fighter when he should've
just taken the compensation.

327
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,192
You're the one who rushed the process.

328
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,195
Not everyone in the building
consented to this.

329
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,240
Also, the tenants deserve some time
even if the lessor consented--

330
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,241
Ms. Gu.

331
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,620
Make up your mind.

332
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,081
Either protect your family

333
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,417
or put up a useless fight for justice.

334
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,590
I shouldn't laugh.

335
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,635
But I can empathize with you.

336
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,099
You're willing to wreak havoc
to protect something.

337
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,436
I know how that feels.

338
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,397
But sir,

339
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,276
don't corner those
who have nowhere else to go.

340
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,530
My grandfather once told me this.

341
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,826
"Since trees are deeply rooted
and can't flee,

342
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,539
they emit reeking smells or poison

343
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,417
to scare their enemies away."

344
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,008
Hey.

345
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,601
Did you not hear me?

346
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,980
Fine. What is it?

347
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,150
Look at you.

348
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,570
Not only are you a homewrecker,
but you're brazen as well.

349
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,824
You should tell that to someone else.

350
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,742
We were just discussing school matters.

351
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,161
You should've discussed that at school.

352
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,581
You even came to his house, didn't you?

353
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,208
How shameless of you.

354
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,086
I've never done anything shameful.

355
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,463
How dare you talk back to me?

356
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:29,427
Hey. Did you grow up
without any parents? Did you?

357
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,763
Yes. I never had
impudent parents like you.

358
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,766
-Ms. Gu.
-You're a lost cause, aren't you?

359
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,811
-You should go.
-A lost cause?

360
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,354
You should watch what you say.

361
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,315
You should never be quick
to judge someone like that.

362
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,484
Never. Got that?

363
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,694
How dare you talk back?

364
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,197
I'm not the lost cause here. It's--

365
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,285
What do you think you're doing?

366
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,038
Was pestering me not enough?

367
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,167
Mother, go inside. People are watching.

368
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,378
Why do you want her to leave?
Scared of what I'll say?

369
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,921
No, it's a waste of time.

370
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,175
No matter what you do,
nothing will change.

371
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,193
I'm sorry.

372
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,738
I'm sorry.

373
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,867
Don't apologize!

374
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,535
Don't apologize!

375
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,454
-Let me go!
-Mother, let's go.

376
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,039
Please, Hae-won.

377
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,587
Let me go!

378
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,176
This is exactly why
I told you to change hospitals.

379
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,201
-Why did you apologize?
-Hae-won.

380
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,827
You should've defended me.

381
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,623
Just because I acted like a crazy bitch
doesn't mean I was wrong.

382
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,501
Did you not think
that maybe I was the victim?

383
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,628
Then you should've said so
instead of yelling.

384
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,213
I couldn't get through to them!

385
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,885
They couldn't understand me
when I was being nice.

386
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,935
You weren't like this before.

387
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,564
Really?

388
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,818
I don't remember the person I used to be.

389
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,822
So tell me.

390
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,616
What was I like?

391
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,795
He's right, Mother.

392
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,047
She wanted him to settle
yesterday's incident.

393
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,383
It's not what you think it is.

394
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,969
If that was the case,
I would've caught on.

395
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,806
All men are bound to be seduced
if a woman sets her mind to it.

396
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,226
I'm only saying this
because of her attitude towards you.

397
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,644
You better be careful.

398
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,814
I'm absolutely sick and tired of affairs.

399
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:43,829
Your husband mainly used that phone
to make international calls.

400
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,539
Really?

401
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,666
That's all that we know.

402
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,502
I'll text the call records to you,
so check later.

403
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,339
Okay. Thanks.

404
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,853
MEAL AND DRINKS

405
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:10,397
RICE MEAL
LUNCH SPECIALS

406
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,109
Hello.

407
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,408
What's wrong?

408
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,869
Did someone hit you?

409
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,998
-Does it show?
-Who was it?

410
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,668
That guy you're seeing again?

411
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,878
No.

412
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,423
I wouldn't have waited for him
if he were that kind of man.

413
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,931
Then was it…

414
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,851
that woman from before?

415
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,610
She's the one who hit me,

416
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,530
but I'm more upset with Woo-jae.

417
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,658
We tend to be more upset
with those we are close with.

418
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,994
They say when a couple gets back together,

419
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,374
there's a higher chance
that they'll break up again.

420
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,210
Come on. Statistics don't matter.

421
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,005
Those who are bound to break up
are destined to do so.

422
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,341
Then there are those

423
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,136
who become more cautious
and never break up again.

424
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,514
I wonder which one it'll be.

425
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,143
Aren't you seeing him again

426
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,812
so you can work things out?

427
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,522
No.

428
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,150
I'm talking about them, not me.

429
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,818
What?

430
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,612
When Woo-jae left me,

431
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,032
this is what I heard most about me.

432
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,788
"It was just a guy."

433
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,252
"She's a fool…

434
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,216
for letting a guy ruin her entire life."

435
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,888
"She must've done something wrong."

436
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,604
Those who don't know the story

437
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,106
gossip the most.

438
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,442
If they did, they could never do that.

439
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,359
You're right.

440
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,113
He may have just been "a guy" to them,

441
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,867
but to me, he was a friend, lover,

442
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,370
the world, and the universe.

443
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,875
I was the victim,

444
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,836
but they criticized me for being a fool.

445
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,674
That's so harsh.

446
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,182
So I hope

447
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,644
they'll go through what I've been through.

448
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,072
-Is it true?
-What?

449
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,823
Did Ju-yeong's dad really do that?

450
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:12,621
Li-sa. I'm sorry, but you should stop
hanging out with her for the time being.

451
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:13,997
Will he go to jail?

452
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,832
Nothing is certain yet.

453
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,334
What will happen to Ju-yeong?

454
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:23,715
She'll be staying with Ms. Gu,
so don't worry about her.

455
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,259
I need to rest.

456
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,010
Dad.

457
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,432
What happened? Tell me.

458
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,642
Why won't you tell me?

459
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,311
I'm fine. Have you eaten dinner yet?

460
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,730
What? Don't change the subject.

461
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:42,109
AN HYEON-SEONG'S CALL RECORDS

462
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:54,955
INTERNATIONAL CALLS

463
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,443
Couples often fight
while planning their wedding.

464
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:27,863
Exactly. They fight
over the most trivial things.

465
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,781
Do you really have to have a wedding?

466
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,200
Not like you've had one before.

467
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:37,289
Anyway, men aren't attracted
to clingy women.

468
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:40,542
They find independent ones more alluring.

469
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,503
Do you remember
how you felt on your wedding day?

470
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,423
I was exhausted, and it was a hassle.

471
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,886
But you should try it out
to realize that it's nothing special.

472
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,472
See? He has experience
and says it's nothing special.

473
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,682
I'm just saying,

474
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,810
married life isn't all about
some magnificent love or happiness.

475
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:04,650
It's about sticking with each other
through thick and thin.

476
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,651
That's what I mean.

477
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,864
Fine, you're all better than me.

478
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,618
Like I know anything.

479
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:19,164
You'll be a part of it.
I can't do it alone.

480
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,124
First, get a nice outfit.

481
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,168
No. I hate hanbok.

482
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,004
The stiff shoulders
make my neck look short.

483
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,465
Then you can wear a dress too.

484
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,300
A dress?

485
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,220
It won't be formal,
so wear whatever you want.

486
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:39,101
Gosh, are you serious?
Can I really do that?

487
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,521
I'd love that.

488
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,618
I heard there was a ruckus
at the hospital.

489
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:01,748
My father only cheated once. Just once.

490
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,127
And you know what my mother did, right?

491
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,213
He lived like her slave for decades.

492
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:11,508
When he retired, he said
he'd done enough and asked for a divorce.

493
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,512
I empathized with him.
He really did enough.

494
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:21,143
But she didn't budge an inch.

495
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:24,229
He lived like a prisoner
until his last breath.

496
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,150
I guess the wound of betrayal
lasts a lifetime.

497
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,153
Why are you bringing that up here?

498
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,031
My mom will never condone cheating

499
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,659
even if it's her own son, so don't worry.

500
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:41,121
I don't. I trust Hyeon-seong.

501
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,706
Don't be so sure, though.

502
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,752
After all, we even lie in our diaries.

503
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,590
I'm sorry. Your measurements changed,
so I had to adjust them.

504
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,509
I'm fine.

505
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:58,847
Goodness.

506
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:02,601
Look at the quality of these clothes.
For heaven's sake.

507
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,730
Oh, my. It's that crazy bitch from before.

508
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,366
Hello, Dr. An.
What a surprise running into you here.

509
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,911
It is. What brings you here?

510
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,456
I heard Ms. Jeong
gets her dresses fitted here.

511
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,334
I loved the outfit
she wore for her exhibition.

512
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,795
So I came to get a dress here
for a special occasion.

513
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,259
Can I have a cup of tea, please?

514
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,057
What kind of special--

515
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,309
Take out all the pins.

516
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,019
I'm sorry.

517
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:13,922
After yesterday's commotion,
you still want my blessing?

518
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,051
Please don't take to heart
what happened that day.

519
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,428
I can forgive you for slapping my face.

520
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,223
But not for stabbing me in the back.

521
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,811
I want to be like you, Hui-ju.

522
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,272
What?

523
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,191
I wondered how you could pretend…

524
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:37,153
No, live as if nothing ever happened.

525
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,322
I gave it some thought.

526
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,119
You just have to let go of the guilt.

527
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:50,208
Once you let go of that guilt
and become unapologetic,

528
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,668
you become shameless.

529
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,587
Just like you.

530
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,631
Please come.

531
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,344
In Ireland?

532
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,390
His foundation has
an overseas business department,

533
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,267
and all the numbers were from there.

534
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,144
What if he has a mistress in Ireland?

535
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,146
International lovers do exist.

536
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,106
Call the number and check for yourself.

537
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,859
You came all the way here to tell me that?

538
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,485
That and something else.

539
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,742
What's her deal?
We barely know each other.

540
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,538
She gave this to me in person,

541
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,917
and I couldn't help but wonder
why she was going that far.

542
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,544
She gave one to me too.

543
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,839
What a lunatic. Are you going?

544
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,425
What if she invited

545
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,886
your friends instead of hers
out of vengeance?

546
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:46,848
She dreamed of this wedding,
so I doubt she'd want to ruin it.

547
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,891
That's true.

548
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,977
Still, you should be on your toes

549
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,481
if you want to keep all of this.

550
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:01,363
COMPLAINT LETTER
PLAINTIFF: LEE IL-SEONG

551
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,989
We're going to argue

552
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,284
that his billiard hall
isn't included on the school site.

553
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,996
Then you'll have to measure
the area once again.

554
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,581
Ms. Gu.

555
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,583
Hae-won.

556
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,003
Strictly speaking,
it's not even a part of the school.

557
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,547
It'll be a part of the gallery.

558
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,720
Why waste your energy on this?

559
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,764
If we lose, we'll appeal.

560
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,601
At least that'll help us buy some time.

561
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,980
Fine. If the compensation
is the problem, we can renegotiate--

562
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:35,981
Let him out first.

563
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,984
He may be a mess,

564
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,903
but Ju-yeong still needs a guardian.

565
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,867
Please.

566
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:54,916
And please tell Hui-ju I said thanks.

567
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,335
I'm truly grateful

568
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:01,923
that she decided
to work with Woo-jae on the project.

569
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,393
Ms. Lee proposed the offer
to your wife first.

570
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:18,857
It was Mr. Woo's third collaboration
with Hwain Gallery.

571
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,568
She was also the one
who recommended Mr. Seo.

572
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,824
I'm sure your wife
was pressured into accepting the offer.

573
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,827
Will he be here soon?

574
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,162
Yes, sir.

575
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,873
Among the critics
who disapprove of Ms. Lee's success,

576
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,875
he's the most influential one.

577
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,177
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

578
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:54,601
The gallery sugarcoats rookie artists
and help them gain fame?

579
00:55:55,226 --> 00:56:00,023
I'm sure that can't always be
in the artists' best interest.

580
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,151
You can just state the facts.

581
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,403
That'll be enough.

582
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,990
"FABRICATED" ROOKIE ARTISTS
IN THE ART COMMUNITY

583
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:13,620
Didn't you say Mr. Seo was
well-received among the critics?

584
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,665
How could they bash a project
that has yet to be launched?

585
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,000
This is a problem.

586
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:22,921
Park Jae-gwan is
the operation director of Korea Art Week

587
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,756
and the editor of ARTicle,

588
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,342
the most influential journal
among art collectors.

589
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:30,887
For such a powerful journal
to dedicate an entire page

590
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:36,059
to criticize a rookie artist must mean
that they're very much interested in him.

591
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,269
"An exhibition
by one of the top art galleries

592
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,356
alongside a popular artist…"

593
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,024
This must be me.

594
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:48,613
"And an architect who received
an outstanding award."

595
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,241
They're just envious.

596
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,036
They're just criticizing us
because they're jealous.

597
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,081
They can only be so quick to judge

598
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,917
because they've never
created art themselves.

599
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,968
Am I late?

600
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,263
Not at all. We just came early.
Have a seat, Mr. Seo.

601
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,059
Here.

602
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,566
What terrible weather.

603
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,444
You're right. It's still very windy.

604
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,778
Please excuse me.

605
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:11,905
It was an accident.

606
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,741
There's nothing we can do
about natural disasters.

607
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:18,411
That's okay. It's not like
accidents happen with a warning.

608
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,685
I planted that tree.

609
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,899
This used to be my father's studio.

610
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,527
It's my only inheritance.

611
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:57,116
There used to be
a very old tree in its place.

612
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,371
But when I was young,
it was struck by lightning.

613
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,669
That was the first time
I'd seen my father cry.

614
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,215
But why are you smiling?

615
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,846
I was happy to know

616
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,015
that he could cry too.

617
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,604
That's why I planted
a new tree in the same spot.

618
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,608
But I can't believe it died as well.

619
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,279
Maybe you picked the wrong tree.

620
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:37,323
Sorry?

621
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,909
That's a Chinese lacquer tree.

622
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:47,667
Unlike others, Chinese lacquer trees
don't become magnificent as they age.

623
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,253
The branches become thin,

624
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,880
and they wither away.

625
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,927
Perhaps it's best for them

626
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,639
to meet their fate
before they turn out that way.

627
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:11,482
But their sap leaves behind
beautiful works of art.

628
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,651
They're quite fascinating.

629
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:24,662
What is it?

630
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,042
So this is how you sound

631
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,628
when you're not upset.

632
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,259
You have a lovely voice.

633
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,610
Why are you staring at me?

634
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,528
Because you're fascinating.

635
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,784
Do you know you frown instead of
scratching them when your eyes are itchy?

636
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,287
You touch your ears
if you're not happy with your work.

637
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,873
And your lips swell when you're tired.

638
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,460
Stop teasing me. Last time…

639
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,338
When I said you were beautiful?

640
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,341
I meant it.

641
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,218
Don't you know I'm married?

642
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,804
So?

643
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,847
Being married or having kids

644
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,184
doesn't affect your beauty.

645
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,189
It all disappears with age.
It becomes useless.

646
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,192
Beauty doesn't disappear.

647
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,069
It just changes.

648
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,210
I should get going.

649
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,632
Wait.

650
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,428
Thank you for what you said back there.

651
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,806
I was going to
just ignore what critics say.

652
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,268
But it wasn't that easy.

653
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,397
Your words were comforting.

654
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,358
It felt like you were defending me.

655
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,154
INCOMING, OUTGOING CALLS

656
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,539
CUSTOMER NAME: AN HYEON-SEONG

657
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,417
This is the Ireland Korean Association.

658
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,503
Thankfully, he wasn't having an affair.

659
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,255
However…

660
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:44,190
"A long river was flowing
below the cliff."

661
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:48,527
"The rushing river pierced
through the farmland."

662
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,197
"It glistened underneath the sunlight."

663
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,909
"The mountains in the sky…"

664
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,703
Though alive,
I think of the world as hell.

665
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,374
To me, hell is…

666
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,420
not being able to trust the person
that I should the most.

667
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,944
CLOSED ON MONDAYS

668
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,668
This has to be photoshopped.

669
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:31,130
Where in the world are they?

670
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,425
-Hey.
-You're so pretty.

671
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:38,179
I thought it was ridiculous
to have the wedding now.

672
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,724
But it sure makes me happy
to see you in a wedding dress.

673
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:46,562
This must be why people have weddings.

674
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:49,356
We should

675
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:53,402
hold a party when we go back.

676
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,821
Goodness. Dad.

677
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,574
You shouldn't cry
on such a happy day. Don't be silly.

678
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,952
Why are you dressed so immaturely?

679
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,371
It's not your wedding.

680
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,125
Don't I still look pretty?

681
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,722
MARRIAGE VOW

682
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,447
You should get changed now.

683
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,462
You must not be interested in what I know.

684
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:47,284
I, GU HAE-WON, TAKE THEE, SEO WOO-JAE,
TO BE MY WEDDED HUSBAND…

685
01:10:56,877 --> 01:11:00,631
I wanted to display my misfortune.

686
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:03,884
I wanted everyone to know

687
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:06,512
what I lost

688
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,223
and to whom.

689
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,872
So you came to my wedding after all.

690
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:17,082
I ran away because
I thought I would cause trouble.

691
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:20,711
Find out what those two are caught up in.

692
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:24,298
What did you talk about with my husband?

693
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:26,050
Now you're interested?

694
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:27,509
Give me your phone.

695
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:32,431
Too bad. It could have been interesting.

696
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:35,601
Was it a good thing for me to come back?

697
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,186
I want to see you.

698
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:39,521
We don't have to hide
like this over there.

699
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,773
Why do we have to hide?

700
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,025
You lied to me.

701
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:45,444
Do you

702
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:47,071
remember?

703
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:53,619
