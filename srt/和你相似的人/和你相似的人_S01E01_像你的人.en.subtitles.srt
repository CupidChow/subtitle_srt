1
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,638
I think about hell.

2
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,105
Though alive,
I think of the world as hell.

3
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,088
To me, hell is…

4
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,847
watching my loved one die for me.

5
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,565
So I'm not in hell yet.

6
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,681
What I need now is faith.

7
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,778
Believing a lie

8
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,116
that it's not the absolute worst yet
and that I'll be okay.

THE STORY OF THE ISLAND AND THE LAKE
BY JEONG HUI-JU

12
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,416
Hey, Li-sa. Shouldn't you be in class…

13
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,439
Li-sa.

14
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,486
Li-sa. What happened?

15
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,072
Li-sa. Let me look at you.

16
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,532
What happened here?

17
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,495
Li-sa. Let me see your face.

18
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,664
I need to take the patient for a CT scan.

19
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,582
What?

20
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,795
Li-sa.

21
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,882
Li-sa.

22
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,051
What…

23
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,776
-What just happened?
-Oh, no. Has she gone mad?

24
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,528
-What's going on?
-She can't do that.

25
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,155
-What the heck is this?
-Are they fighting?

26
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,074
-What?
-What's going on?

27
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,368
-Hey!
-Oh, no!

28
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,995
-Hey, this is bad.
-Shouldn't we stop them?

29
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,581
-Is she crazy?
-What's wrong with her?

30
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,918
-How can a teacher push a student?
-What's going on?

31
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,545
-What should we do?
-Hey.

32
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,132
-Did she go nuts?
-Why did she slap her?

33
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,509
-What's wrong with her?
-Shouldn't we report this?

34
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,511
-This is messed up.
-How can she do this?

35
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,054
-Is she mad?
-She's nuts.

36
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,851
What is this?

37
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,186
I'm sorry, ma'am. This is my fault.

38
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,897
I didn't know she took the video.

39
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,317
How did she have a phone during class?

40
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,739
We always take
their cell phones right before class.

41
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,701
But this student, Ju-yeong,
had another cell phone.

42
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,036
-Not that.
-Sorry?

43
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,956
Who the hell is this woman?

44
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,169
Our art teacher is on maternity leave.
So she's a substitute.

45
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,838
I don't care
if she's a full-time teacher or a sub.

46
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,882
How could a teacher hit Li-sa, a student?

47
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,595
Li-sa was studying
another subject during her class.

48
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,889
That's what I heard.

49
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,309
And we don't think Li-sa deserves
to be slapped like this for what she did.

50
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,771
Are you saying it's okay to beat students
like this if they deserve it?

51
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,815
Goodness.

52
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,444
What's the point of discussing that here?
It already happened.

53
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,196
Mother.

54
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,865
Why did it happen
when Li-sa's father is away?

55
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,034
When does his seminar end?

56
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,745
His schedule says
he'll come back to Korea in three days.

57
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,583
Yes.

58
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,670
This probably happened
because she didn't know who Li-sa was.

59
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,838
Look.

60
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,634
It would've been a problem
if she did this to another student here.

61
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,138
They're done running tests on Li-sa.
You should go.

62
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,265
You stay.

63
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,021
You're not going?

64
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,610
Are you going to leave her alone?

65
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,956
-What are you doing?
-I'm leaving.

66
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,793
Your doctor wants
to keep you here for one more day.

67
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,838
What happened?

68
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,131
What do you mean?

69
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,136
If you don't tell me what happened,
I'll think of the worst.

70
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,138
Where's the car?

71
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,724
I'm sure there was a reason.

72
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,688
I'm not trying to blame you.
I'm sure she--

73
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,605
That bitch.

74
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,191
She's a bitch.

75
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,455
Take down the video
since it shows our students' faces.

76
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,000
Li-sa's dad… As soon as Mr. An comes back,

77
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,919
-I want to have a disciplinary meeting.
-Yes, ma'am.

78
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,715
Report it to the Office of Education
first. We should handle it by the book.

79
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,343
The whole school… No.

80
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,015
Message everyone including
the parents that this won't happen again.

81
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,226
You've got to do it properly
when you apologize.

82
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,148
How dare she hit a student

83
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,027
in this day and age?
That stupid, lowlife wench.

84
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,276
SLIGO, IRELAND

85
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,031
How's Li-sa?

86
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,034
She was drowsy from the meds
and went straight to bed.

87
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,328
-What about you?
-She won't tell me anything.

88
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,955
Not even a peep
when it'll take three weeks to recover.

89
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,751
Even her eardrums ruptured from getting
slapped, but all she does is sleep.

90
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,419
I mean, are you okay?

91
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,340
I mean, how could she…
No matter what she did wrong,

92
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,759
-how could a teacher hit--
-Honey.

93
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,053
Hui-ju, I'll fly out tomorrow.

94
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,430
Are you there?

95
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,141
It's because you haven't seen the video.

96
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,979
She looked clueless when she was slapped.
She didn't even try to protect herself.

97
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,524
Our Li-sa didn't even budge.

98
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,942
Focus on her treatment.

99
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,779
Wounds will heal. But what about
that humiliation? How will we fix that?

100
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,865
She must have been so shocked.

101
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,120
She didn't even cry.
She's just sleeping it off.

102
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,373
It scares me
she acts like nothing happened.

103
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,334
I don't know how
I'm going to face that teacher tomorrow.

104
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,589
She said she'd apologize. If she does,

105
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,716
do we have to accept it?
But I don't want to!

106
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,302
Don't if you don't want to.

107
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,013
You don't have to do it alone.
I'll handle it when I go back.

108
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,016
What about your work?
The rest of your schedule?

109
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,601
It'll be fine.

110
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,194
I took care of all the important matters.

111
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,988
Okay. Get some sleep.

112
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,224
We terminated
Ms. Gu's contract right away.

113
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,768
The Office of Education
can suspend her on their own.

114
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,980
But as she's a substitute teacher,
all we can do is terminate…

115
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,401
Anyway, Ms. Gu wants
to apologize in person. So could you…

116
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,906
Ma'am?

117
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,039
What's her name?

118
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,832
It's Gu Hae-won.

119
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,336
Gu Hae-won?

120
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,509
Let's go in.

121
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,441
Ms. Gu.

122
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,995
Ms. Gu. You should apologize.

123
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,623
Right.

124
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,001
I'm sorry.

125
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,589
-Shouldn't we stop them?
-What should we do?

126
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,133
-Oh, no.
-Shouldn't we film this?

127
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,803
-She's a total psychopath.
-Hey, she can't do that.

128
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,930
-What's she doing?
-Why is she slapping her?

129
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,224
-Did she go nuts?
-Why did she slap her?

130
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,810
-How could a teacher do that?
-What should we do?

131
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,650
You can't watch it
till the end either, can you?

132
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,901
It's not that.

133
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,280
I did it, so I don't need to watch it.

134
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,660
Then you must be well aware

135
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,706
of how your violence
must've scarred Li-sa as well.

136
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,917
Punishment.

137
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,421
It wasn't violence.

138
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,549
It was punishment.

139
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,675
Ms. Gu!

140
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,347
Punishment?

141
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,516
Li-sa brought it upon herself.

142
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:58,022
But if my punishment was too extreme,
I'll face the penalty for it.

143
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,982
This so-called punishment

144
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,527
looks like a one-sided assault.

145
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,572
What did Li-sa do to deserve it?

146
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,533
You should ask Li-sa, not me.

147
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,495
When kids misbehave,
you should talk to them.

148
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,290
Li-sa is under strain,
preparing to enter high school.

149
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,292
That doesn't mean I should gloss over it.

150
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,503
She did something wrong,
so she should've apologized first.

151
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,088
I could not condone her attitude

152
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,133
of giving me excuses
without admitting what she did was wrong.

153
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,011
Teaching her
that kind of behavior was wrong--

154
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,353
Like this?

155
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,822
Ma'am.

156
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,576
Is this how you teach your students
when they make mistakes?

157
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,954
Ma'am, you can't do this here.

158
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,081
I know that
violence has no place in schools.

159
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,416
And so should she.

160
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,630
And I also know that's not the attitude
of someone who wants to apologize.

161
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,853
Ma'am.

162
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,354
Give me everything in her file.

163
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,940
Her application, résumé,
performance review, all of it.

164
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,319
Ma'am. We are obligated by law
to record every interaction that goes on

165
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,946
in the counseling room.

166
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,364
And what you did earlier was…

167
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,164
Give me her file.

174
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,419
-How about coin karaoke? Your treat.
-I'm in.

175
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,171
You said you would get me next time.

176
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,973
They just took my phone from me.

177
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,683
I'm sorry about that.

178
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,977
Well, it's not your fault.

179
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,483
Your nails are beautiful.
Did you do them yourself?

180
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,069
Yes. I change the colors every day.

181
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,076
What? You deleted the video?

182
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,703
I didn't delete anything else.
I didn't snoop either.

183
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,248
-That's fine then.
-Wait.

184
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,086
Can you tell me why the teacher hit Li-sa

185
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,462
that day?

186
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,507
Mimi has always been crazy.

187
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,092
"Mimi"?

188
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,803
We called her Mimi.
It's short for crazy art teacher.

189
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,097
But after the incident, we call her Mitto.

190
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,723
It's short for crazy psycho.

191
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,184
Why do you call her that?

192
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,436
Because she's done
something like this before?

193
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,814
No, Li-sa's the first to be hit.

194
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,942
But remember when there was
a huge scandal in schools?

195
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,194
The school told her not to make us draw

196
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,822
or study anything nude
because it might become a problem.

197
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,949
Mimi went berserk then.

198
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,913
Ms. Gu. What's wrong with you?

199
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,584
I said no to this. Come on.

200
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,544
Remember, everyone.

201
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,379
-We cannot blame
-Gosh.

202
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,381
-this beautiful artwork
-What is this?

203
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,634
or the artist who put
their heart and soul into it.

204
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:42,055
We must be suspicious and wary of people
like him who see art with a dirty mind.

205
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,558
-What?
-Your critical thinking shows…

206
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,437
I guess you take a lot of these videos.

207
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,814
I'm just recording my day.
Like a documentary.

208
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,234
In other words,
I film anything that seems worthwhile.

209
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,404
Then why was this teacher,
Mimi, so angry with Li-sa?

210
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,490
I have no idea. Li-sa didn't tell you?

211
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,994
Mimi whispered something
in Li-sa's ear at the end.

212
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,664
She whispered something?

213
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,211
So only she could hear it?

214
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,671
Yes.

215
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,674
I really have to go now.

216
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,193
EMERGENCY ROOM

217
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,910
Let me take a look.

218
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,834
Keep going.

219
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,544
That was great.

220
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,380
You've gotten much stronger now.

221
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,967
Now, the other way around.
Imagine you're kicking a ball. Go ahead.

222
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,551
Excellent.

223
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,595
The other way around now.

224
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,311
You hit her?

225
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,314
You hit the teacher,
and it was caught on camera?

226
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,944
Hitting the teacher was wrong.

227
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,362
I know.

228
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,033
But don't beat yourself up too much.

229
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,036
"He shouldn't be a teacher.
The school failed to manage him."

230
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,707
You don't have to be the one
finding faults in this incident.

231
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,167
What does it matter
when it's about your kid?

232
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,503
"If you lay a finger on my kid,
you're done for."

233
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,673
"Mommy is here for you.
I'll do anything for you."

234
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,967
That's what Li-sa needs.

235
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,474
Why don't you date anyone?

236
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,644
What? That's so random.

237
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,732
You can make some girl very happy.
Why are you leading such a lonely life?

238
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,610
I've been on plenty of dates.
Don't worry about my love life.

239
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,697
So how is Li-sa?

240
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,283
They're checking the infection
after the eardrum repair.

241
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,493
Gosh. It'll take a month to recover.

242
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,912
Who the heck is this jerk…

243
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,416
How could he slap her to the point
that her eardrum ruptured?

244
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,753
-It was a she.
-What?

245
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,299
What? Why did she do it?

246
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,967
That's what I want to know too.

247
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,220
She said she had a good reason,
but I just can't understand her.

248
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,972
Imagine how Li-sa must feel then.

249
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,058
Nothing can justify violence.

250
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,185
She just lost her temper and slapped…

251
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,103
Right.

252
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,523
Look at my hand. It's still shaking.

253
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,276
But she made it sound like it was nothing.

254
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,969
THE STORY OF THE ISLAND AND THE LAKE
BY JEONG HUI-JU

255
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,310
Ho-su, have some more vegetables.
They'll get rid of the itching.

256
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:18,480
It's fine. If you don't want to eat it,
you don't have to.

257
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,110
What about Li-sa?
She can't even hold down some food?

258
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,780
Her doctor said she'd feel nauseous
for a few days after the eardrum repair.

259
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,240
She wants to rest in her room.

260
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,826
Focus on helping her recover.
Stop causing trouble.

261
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,079
We had a million ways to handle her.
Why did you hit her?

262
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,956
So did that make you feel better?

263
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:37,916
No.

264
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,794
You think I didn't want
to slap her myself?

265
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,463
Thanks to your temper,
we can't do anything about her now.

266
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,591
I'm sorry.

267
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,677
Don't be sorry.

268
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,846
I'm back.

269
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,017
-I already ate. Sit.
-Okay.

270
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,228
Have you heard?

271
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,063
She went back to her old ways.

272
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,983
I told them to erase the footage.

273
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,568
You can take care of the rest.

274
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,945
We won't erase it.

275
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,157
She's done nothing wrong.

276
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,411
If we do, the missing footage
of that day will be a problem.

277
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,664
I watched the footage.

278
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,126
Her attitude made me furious too.

279
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,754
If I hit her, people would say
I went on a power trip. But not with you.

280
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,964
You're her mother.

281
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,012
I'll go and wash my hands.

282
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:36,433
Ho-su, it's been a few days.
Aren't you glad to see Daddy?

283
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,240
Ho-su, have some more vegetables.

284
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,872
Should I feed it to you?

285
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,999
There.

286
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,251
Open your mouth.

287
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,379
Good boy. What a big eater you are.

288
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,089
Look at you eat.

289
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,717
All right. Let's have one more spoonful.

290
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,348
No! I'm going to sleep with Grandma!

291
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,059
-I don't want to go!
-Gosh.

292
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,646
He can sense it too.
He won't be able to relax at home.

293
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,190
But we live very close. This is too often.

294
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,107
Ho-su.

295
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,073
Then go to your dad and ask him if you can
stay here with your grandma tonight.

296
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,201
Or you're coming home with me.

297
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,702
I'll sleep here tonight!

298
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,287
Ho-su.

299
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,251
Take my son with you.
Your son will stay here with me.

300
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:45,961
Go.

301
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,523
The teacher said
she punished Li-sa for what she did.

302
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,483
But Li-sa wouldn't tell me what happened.

303
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,988
The fact that she won't talk
means there's a problem.

304
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,698
Right.

305
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,701
If Li-sa did something wrong--

306
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:21,037
Even so. She can't hit
a student that senselessly.

307
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,789
Right?

308
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,375
What's her deal? You must know.

309
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,921
She's a temporary substitute,
so I wasn't in the hiring process.

310
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,556
What is it?

311
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,102
She reminds me of her.

312
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,146
Of whom?

313
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,064
That woman.

314
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,651
She resembles a student
who taught me how to draw.

315
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,321
Ms. Gu taught you how to draw?

316
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:59,451
No. She resembles the student,
so I was surprised. That's all.

317
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,038
Her name is different.
And I checked her résumé.

318
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,957
She's from a different school too.

319
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,418
Why does that bother you then?

320
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,839
I don't know.
I can't seem to forget about it.

321
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,926
Is it because
she teaches art of all subjects?

322
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,350
Never mind.

323
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,228
Why am I thinking about her
when I'll never see her again?

324
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:34,444
Don't worry. I'll take it from here.
Just focus on your exhibition.

325
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,696
You said this one was important.

326
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,449
I hope I can meet the deadline.

327
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,620
I know you'll do a great job.

328
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,040
Thanks.

329
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,917
For what?

330
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,796
You sided with me earlier
in front of your mother.

331
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,466
Don't thank me. That's what husbands do.

332
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,769
They are still so lovey-dovey.

333
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,604
How gross.

334
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,816
Right?

335
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,487
My boy.

336
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,845
Was she…

337
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,391
waiting for me to hit her?

338
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,781
SHUT DOWN HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS
EDUCATION ISN'T BUSINESS!

339
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,365
It'll be an art school now.

340
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,327
-Come on. Keep them parallel.
-Really?

341
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,622
-Hello.
-Hi, girls.

342
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,249
That was sudden.
It'll be a high school of arts now?

343
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,710
Assault?

344
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,421
Didn't Hyeon-seong tell you?

345
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,631
No, he didn't.

346
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,216
She sued you.

347
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,846
She's probably trying to keep her teaching
license, but you'll do nothing.

348
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,140
Let's make sure
no one will write articles--

349
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,099
Let them.

350
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,686
I was talking to our lawyer, not you.

351
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,396
No, Mother.

352
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,524
Hyeong-gi. You're listening, right?

353
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:21,486
Her actions shouldn't be covered up
because of what I did.

354
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,196
Even if I have to face punishment,

355
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,908
I can't watch her calling the shots.
She's the one who caused the whole thing.

356
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,622
She's just trying to get attention.
Don't let her have her way.

357
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,415
But if we let this slide,

358
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,794
she won't know what she did wrong.
She'll be more brazen next time.

359
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,879
Then what about Li-sa?

360
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,465
Does she deserve to get beaten?

361
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,635
If you knew the consequences,
why did you hit her? You caused this.

362
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,719
Whatever! I'm done!

363
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,350
She should just listen,
not talk back to me.

364
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,935
I'm afraid she's right.

365
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,689
That's what I hate.
Everything she said was right.

366
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,149
How annoying.

367
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,527
What should we do?

368
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,155
Why are you asking me that?

369
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:09,868
I made you the legal advisor
to handle matters like this.

370
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,250
Seriously. She was doing fine in the UK.
Why drag her here?

371
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,878
There are a lot of good boarding schools.

372
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,631
They'll inherit everything I have anyway.

373
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,509
Why study their asses off
to become doctors and lawyers?

374
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,888
They can just hire
smart doctors and lawyers.

375
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,727
So tell me about this crazy teacher.
You met her, right?

376
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,396
She's a substitute teacher.

377
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,399
But she knew a lot
about the management of our school.

378
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,325
She dared to submit a medical record
she got from our hospital.

379
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,534
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE

380
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,661
If she wanted attention, she sure got it.

381
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,165
TAERIM HOSPITAL

382
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,131
Hello.

383
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,513
Let me take that off for a moment.

384
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,978
Please sit up straight.

385
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,775
I'm going to raise the bed.

386
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,196
Let me see.

387
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,699
Can you make a fist and loosen it?

388
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,784
Like this.

389
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,287
Try to clench your hand again.
And loosen it.

390
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,041
Your wrist sprain is pretty severe.

391
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,169
What about here? Doesn't it hurt?

392
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,379
It hurts.

393
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,923
It looks like you had this for a while.

394
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,384
You shouldn't endure it.

395
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,596
You're not supposed
to endure pain. Hold on.

396
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,943
The gel is pretty cold.

397
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,904
Will this take long?

398
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,280
Yes.

399
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,825
-Then I'll do it next--
-Let me just finish it.

400
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,369
Your body is telling you
that it's exhausted.

401
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,332
Becoming sensitive over small sounds
and getting upset over nothing…

402
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,584
Ignoring the symptoms
will make things worse.

403
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,881
Do you use your hands a lot for your job?

404
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,343
-Why do you ask?
-So I can pay extra attention to them.

405
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,683
You should be careful.

406
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,894
Why? Is the gel too cold?

407
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,314
It's not that.
Everyone who comes here is in pain.

408
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,984
They might take
your kindness the wrong way.

409
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,569
Gosh.

410
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,366
Excuse me.

411
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,415
Hey, sis.

412
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,084
It's okay.

413
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,047
Li-sa said she wanted
to have lunch with you.

414
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,007
Yes.

415
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,759
-Guys.
-When?

416
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,093
She didn't take the meds.

417
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,178
-I'll wait.
-So focus.

418
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,722
Okay.

419
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,644
Go ahead.

420
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,729
Okay.

421
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,445
Li-sa was the one who got assaulted,
and you're sued?

422
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,365
You thought I wouldn't find out
if you kept quiet?

423
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,369
My husband was called in early
because of what you did.

424
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,370
I'm sorry.

425
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,331
JEONG-HWAN'S PRIVATE TUTOR

426
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,210
It's the teacher who tutors Jeong-hwan
when he comes back on breaks.

427
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,338
Qualifications are important,
but kids can be picky.

428
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,839
The tutor has a good review.

429
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,258
I see. I'll talk to my husband first.

430
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,053
Just set up an appointment first.

431
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,596
You can discuss it later.

432
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,351
-But not now.
-Do you think it was my idea?

433
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:07,271
My husband brought it up first.
And I don't want to be petty over it.

434
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,398
Min-seo.

435
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,404
Hello. This is…

436
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,323
Yes.

437
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,828
I'm waiting in the car
at the main entrance.

438
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,287
Take your time.

439
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:31,838
ASSAULT

440
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,008
I'm on my way now.

441
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,362
What's wrong?

442
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,452
Let's go.

443
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,668
Mom.

444
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,837
Yes. Let's go.

445
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,714
What did the doctor say?

446
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,301
Nothing I haven't heard before.
He wants me to rest up.

447
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,367
That crazy bitch sued my mom.

448
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,623
You haven't heard? My mom hit her.

449
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,458
Li-sa, you shouldn't curse.

450
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,834
How did my mom hit her?

451
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,961
You want to know that?

452
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,465
It's a shame I missed it.
I should have been there to watch it.

453
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,344
Lucky you.

454
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,972
I envy you
for having my sister as your mom.

455
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,515
You have a mom too.

456
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,727
My mom only sides with me occasionally.

457
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,271
But she sides with you every time.

458
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,357
Does she?

459
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,193
Even if I kill someone?

460
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,738
You…

461
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,865
Don't ever do that.

462
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,325
So what will happen to my mom?

463
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,035
I think she'll be fine.

464
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,704
Your teacher crossed the line first.

465
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,040
What? So you think
I got beaten because I did too?

466
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,877
Gosh, no. That's not what I meant.

467
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,296
-Did you cross any line with her?
-No.

468
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,339
Then what happened?

469
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,510
Thank you.

470
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,931
-Hey, Hui-ju.
-Let's go.

471
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,128
RICE MEAL

472
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,397
One rice meal, please.

473
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,536
Never mind. I'm sorry.

474
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,579
I also serve food.

475
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,001
I serve food too.

476
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,837
But this looks like a bar.

477
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,798
I didn't change the sign yet.
I guess I'll serve food too.

478
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,051
The door was open,
so I thought you were open.

479
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,012
And I am. You don't
have to wait until night to drink.

480
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,015
-Do you want a drink too?
-No.

481
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,311
Whisky isn't that popular
in this neighborhood.

482
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,271
Popular or not, I'll be happy either way.

483
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,691
If no one wants it,
there'll be more for me then.

484
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,984
Please sit down.

485
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:49,220
A MOMENT PASSES BY INSTANTLY, BUT WHILE
DRAWING THE MOMENT, YOU GET TO RELIVE IT

486
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,415
This is a bar, after all.
I must serve a drink to my first customer.

487
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,628
I appreciate the gesture,
but I don't really drink.

488
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,840
You can start now.
That way, you'll be my regular customer.

489
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,633
I don't like free things.

490
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,926
It's not free.

491
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,396
This is free.

492
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,314
This is a bar, you know.

493
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,238
I hope you enjoy.

494
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,642
Your tutor will come starting tomorrow

495
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,853
to help you catch up with the schoolwork.

496
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,771
I don't need a tutor.

497
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:26,150
You keep saying that,
and it makes me more worried.

498
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,027
Just until you fully recover.

499
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,070
We'll readjust once you go back to school.

500
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,363
What did Mimi say?

501
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,324
Mimi?

502
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:34,992
Oh, her.

503
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,369
What did she say?

504
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,664
Of course, she apologized
and asked if you were okay.

505
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,166
I see.

506
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,754
You won't have to see her
at school ever again.

507
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,631
-So don't worry.
-Okay.

508
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,139
Give me that and go inside.

509
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,849
Isn't it for Ho-su?

510
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,227
Yes, it is. I'll take it. Give me that.

511
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,747
Li-sa wanted some pasta,
so we went to Fresca.

512
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,917
And I know that
Hyeong-gi likes their gnocchi.

513
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,546
He had a hectic morning because of me, so…

514
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,218
And thank you
for introducing me to the tutor.

515
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,179
The tutor will come starting tomorrow.
Thank you so much.

516
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,724
Okay. That's great.

517
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:48,023
Well, I feel awful. We already ate dinner.

518
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,567
I see.

519
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,320
-Ho-su can eat it then.
-Then bye.

520
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,904
Did Hyeong-gi say anything yesterday?

521
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,157
Don't worry. That's his job.

522
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,579
Is something wrong between
him and Min-seo? Do you know anything?

523
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,415
My sister is difficult with everyone.

524
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,293
Tell me about Li-sa's tutor.

525
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,295
Min-seo introduced me to the tutor.

526
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,173
She must be good seeing how
she also teaches Jeong-hwan.

527
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,801
She helps kids with their schoolwork
and mental well-being.

528
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,596
Today is her first day.
Do you have time to meet her?

529
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,723
I have a meeting this morning.

530
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,808
Let's have dinner some other time.

531
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,061
Then can you drop off
Ho-su at kindergarten?

532
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,979
I'll wake Li-sa up and get her ready.

533
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,189
-Sure.
-Thanks.

534
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,293
Li-sa. Wake up.

535
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,922
Your tutor will be here soon,
so let's get ready.

536
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,309
Your friends must be all waiting for you.
Do the Superman pose.

537
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,269
All right. Your head. Oh, no.

538
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,355
I'll drop you off like Superman.

539
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,440
Let's go. We're off now.

540
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,567
Okay. Have a good day, honey.

541
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,403
See you, Ho-su.

542
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,532
Li-sa. It's time to wake up now.

543
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,207
Don't lock the door. That worries me.

544
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:11,959
Go wash up.

545
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,647
I'm so sorry.

546
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,956
Outsiders like you
shouldn't be in the complex.

547
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,500
Get out before I call security.

548
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,086
Hui-ju.

549
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,178
Things were crazy that day,
so I didn't recognize you.

550
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,478
Do you…

551
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,690
recognize me?

552
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,231
I'm sorry

553
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,442
I hurt Li-sa.

554
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,944
I'm truly sorry.

555
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,697
Get up.

556
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,783
Li-sa's home.

557
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:36,580
I don't think she's ready to see you yet.

558
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,082
Get up.

559
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,174
Hui-ju.

560
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,429
It's really been a long time.

561
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,731
It has.

562
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,944
It has, but it's awkward
to see you again like this.

563
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,074
Hui-ju, you don't have to be so formal.

564
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,953
If I'd recognized you,
I wouldn't have sued you like a fool.

565
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,039
I'm really sorry.

566
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,835
My husband will take care of that.

567
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,254
No. I'll drop the charges right away.

568
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,881
That's only fair.

569
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,888
I did hear that Li-sa's mom was a painter.

570
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,141
Don't flatter me.

571
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:42,479
I saw you in the magazine, but I thought
that it was someone who resembles you.

572
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,024
Because I never

573
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,653
imagined you'd become a painter.

574
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,273
I know it's slow progress,
but focus on the basics.

575
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,109
If you learn it the wrong way now,
it'll be hard to fix that.

576
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,236
Your body will remember it.

577
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,740
Fixing a bad habit
is the hardest task of all.

578
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:40,495
I don't know how I didn't recognize you.

579
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,267
It's understandable
since I did get pretty old.

580
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,730
No. You look younger now. I mean it.

581
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,940
Maybe that must be why.

582
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,319
I guess I'm the only one who aged.

583
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:18,492
When I saw you the other day,
I was reminded of you too.

584
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,788
I looked at your résumé
because of the incident with Li-sa.

585
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,624
But your name was different,
and your school…

586
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,129
Didn't you go to
the school near Namsan Mountain?

587
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,631
Unless my memory is wrong.

588
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,883
I couldn't graduate from that school.

589
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,512
I was expelled while I stayed with
my family. So I went to another school.

590
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,891
And Gu Hae-won is my real name.

591
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,771
Back then, I used a German name
I was going to use to study abroad.

592
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,397
Hannah.

593
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,234
Yes.

594
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,778
You remember.

595
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,826
I believed I could do anything
I wanted to do then. I miss those days.

596
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,870
Please, Hui-ju. Don't be formal with me.

597
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,163
Sure.

598
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:07,958
Fine.

599
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,084
Hui-ju.

600
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,962
I'm really sorry.

601
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,840
-Please forgive me.
-Gosh. Stop it.

602
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:25,892
I'm busy trying to make ends meet,
so I've lost my passion for art.

603
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,732
If I haven't, I would have met you sooner.

604
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,905
I regret it.

605
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,379
Hey.

606
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,804
Some woman was on her knees
in front of your house.

607
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,932
I guess you didn't know.

608
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,936
Hui-ju will tell me
if I should know about it.

609
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,982
So the establishment
of the school was approved?

610
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:14,983
Yes.

611
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,193
You must be worried.

612
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,488
I heard that many approvals
are withdrawn before the permit.

613
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,574
Li-sa's incident caused a disturbance.

614
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,993
Min-seo.

615
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:29,331
That's my job to worry about.
Just stop fighting with your husband.

616
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,709
Seeing him squirm
in front of Mom breaks my heart.

617
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,252
You should be nice to him.

618
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,382
The doors are opening.

619
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:48,892
Aren't you getting off?

620
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,147
The doors are closing.

621
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,964
Is he your son?

622
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,052
I didn't know you had a son.

623
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,517
How old is he?

624
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,732
Li-sa was pretty
when she was little as well.

625
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,069
I remember how sweet you were with Li-sa.

626
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,616
And I hurt your precious daughter.

627
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,494
You must've been heartbroken.

628
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,707
I'm really sorry.
I shouldn't have done it.

629
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,500
My life is so hard

630
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,420
that I keep losing my temper.

631
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,881
I'm apologizing
from the bottom of my heart.

632
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,093
So please forgive me.

633
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,264
That's enough.

634
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,268
-Hui-ju.
-I can't accept your apology yet.

635
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:18,064
Thinking about the pain you inflicted
on Li-sa makes this meeting unpleasant.

636
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,986
At school, you refused to apologize
because it wasn't your fault.

637
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,906
I don't know why you barge
into my home and are apologizing now.

638
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:31,828
This incident has nothing to do
with our past relationship.

639
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,079
You're right.

640
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,125
It has nothing to do with that incident.

641
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,087
I'm sorry about

642
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,339
this incident.

643
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,481
You should be apologizing to Li-sa,
not me.

644
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:03,818
And Li-sa isn't ready
to accept your apology yet.

645
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,113
Given our past relationship,

646
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,699
I should really stay out of it now.

647
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,494
My husband will pick up from here.

648
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,412
You should go.

649
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:18,041
Li-sa's tutor will be here soon.

650
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,395
I'm sorry, Hui-ju.

651
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,357
I mean it.

652
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,567
I'm so sorry.

653
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,633
This is Unit D.

654
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,844
The woman that's leaving now…

655
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,346
Yes. The one in a green coat.

656
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,515
I don't know how she got in.

657
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,393
But don't let her in
unless she has permission to enter.

658
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,311
Okay.

659
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,862
Gone?

660
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,990
How can an unconscious man disappear?

661
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:35,660
The nurse said a woman named Hannah
came with papers and requested

662
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,579
the hospital to discharge him.

663
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,415
Hannah?

664
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,210
Hello, ma'am. I'm Li-sa's tutor.

665
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,510
Hello.

666
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,317
You remember.

667
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,404
Hannah.

668
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,663
This incident has nothing to do

669
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,623
with our past relationship.

670
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,502
You're right.

671
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,672
It has nothing to do with that incident.

672
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,146
She didn't…

673
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,026
come here to apologize.

674
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,832
I found you.

675
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,461
She didn't come here to apologize.

676
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:55,628
Hui-ju.

677
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:59,549
What were you still doing there
in front of my house

678
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,426
after leaving my studio?

679
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:03,678
How do you know her?

680
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,638
Why are you curious about that?

681
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,058
It's all right.
There's nothing for you to worry about.

682
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,561
Does she know
what kind of person her husband is?

683
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,690
-I can't hear.
-Li-sa, look at me.

684
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,568
-Can't you hear me?
-I can't hear a thing!

685
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,570
What?

686
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,155
Why did you look for me?

687
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,950
You must not be interested in what I know.

688
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:31,789
