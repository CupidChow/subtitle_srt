00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,073
Every story has a beginning.

2
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,451
My story begins…

3
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,600
No.

4
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,859
What do you mean?

5
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,821
What makes you think that?

6
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,492
My story begins

7
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,537
with you.

00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,641
EPISODE 3
MY PERSONAL STORY

9
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,103
GOETHE-INSTITUT

10
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,813
Where are you from?

11
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,648
Where are you from?

12
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,193
I'm from Korea.

13
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,613
I'm from Korea.

14
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,740
Where are you from?

15
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,743
I'm from Korea.

16
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,289
Good. Now, find a partner

17
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,915
and practice together.

18
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,262
"…is too big."

19
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,101
This is my third time taking this class.

20
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,853
I see.

21
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,609
You're just not used to German.
It just takes time to get used to it.

22
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,735
Right.

23
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,529
Why are you learning German?

24
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,160
Because I don't think
my in-laws can speak German.

25
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,412
I see.

26
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,751
But what's the point? I can't understand
a word of German either.

27
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,377
This is embarrassing.

28
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,212
That's how you learn.

29
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,299
If you think you know everything,
you'll never learn.

30
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,141
It's mine. Isn't it?

31
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,935
Why is it so complicated?

32
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,853
Because Father is still the president.

33
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,565
So even if you own it, you must
still provide your management history.

34
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,234
Whoever inherits it

35
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,737
must be able to manage Taerim for a decade
and get the board's approval--

36
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,698
I'm sure the board
will just side with Dad.

37
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,077
The hospital director should be a doctor,
not someone who just manages--

38
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,247
How much longer do you think
your dying father will have a say in it?

39
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,666
We should set up a school foundation.

40
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,502
Is that your idea?

41
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,385
Is there a school for that?

42
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,263
There's Gyeongseon Academy
near the hospital--

43
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,681
I want you to answer.

44
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,353
It's family run, but the founder's
grandson doesn't want to run it anymore.

45
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,982
They'll give us the chairman position
if we make a financial contribution.

46
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,068
Then will our foundation
be taking it over?

47
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,820
Not our medical foundation.

48
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,406
But we can turn it into a subsidiary

49
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,117
if we change the corporate name
of the school to Taerim.

50
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,451
What about the students?

51
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,580
Last year, a 2,000-unit apartment
complex was built around the school.

52
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,250
So the number of students
will be maintained.

53
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,003
Buying a school isn't
some children's game.

54
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,422
I'm planning to donate

55
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,134
12 billion won's worth
of our hospital shares to the school.

56
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,303
To reduce taxes,
I think this is the best--

57
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,721
Reduce taxes?

58
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,098
Those thieves.

59
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,642
What has this country done for me?

60
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,645
I worked my butt off.
Why are they taking my money?

61
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,189
How do they expect me to live
after taking everything?

62
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,109
Gosh.

63
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,362
This is so infuriating.

64
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,198
Where's the housekeeper?

65
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,577
-I let her go.
-Why?

66
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,039
Li-sa isn't in Korea anymore. Why hire
a housekeeper when we have a loafer?

67
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,236
-Hi, Li-sa. My princess.
-Hi.

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,530
So what time is it there?

69
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,408
Did you eat, Li-sa?

70
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:10,953
Okay.

71
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,837
Li-sa.

72
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,685
Okay, Li-sa. Make sure to eat well.

73
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,271
I'll call you a bit later tomorrow…

74
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,542
St. Christina's? England?

75
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,335
Gosh. So your daughter goes there?

76
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,587
Yes. Do you know the school?

77
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,588
No.

78
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,967
But I can tell by the name that
it must be expensive and good. Right?

79
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,011
I'm not sure.
My mother-in-law chose that school.

80
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,182
THE PAINTER IS PAINTING A PICTURE

81
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,646
You are beautiful.

82
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,231
Sorry?

83
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,234
You're giving it your all.
I envy you for it.

84
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:27,113
Gosh. Why would you envy me for it?
Everything is more fun when it's a hobby.

85
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,034
You're an art major, right?

86
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,953
Yes. My college is near Mt. Namsan.

87
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,456
I see. That's so cool.

88
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,002
I also liked drawing
when I was a little kid.

89
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,839
I used to draw in my journal at night
with a flashlight on.

90
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,760
Do you have a photo of your daughter?

91
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,095
Yes.

92
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,152
If you like drawing,
just draw whenever you want.

93
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,784
-Thanks for the drink.
-Sure.

94
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,752
What about Mother's dinner?

95
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,008
Here.

96
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,095
What is it?

97
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,850
You remember all the other occasions,
but never our wedding anniversary.

98
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,436
Right. I'm sorry.

99
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,834
Do you not like it?
Should I get something else you need?

100
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:11,008
I don't think mere words
would be enough to thank you.

101
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,555
-What's wrong?
-I must be losing it.

102
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,308
I really like it. I mean it.

103
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,435
I'm so happy right now.

104
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,525
But you'll get busier and busier,

105
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,694
and since Li-sa is at boarding school,

106
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,280
I just feel useless.

107
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,241
Don't be silly.

108
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,786
Right. I guess I have
too much time on my hands.

109
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,124
-Then you should think about that.
-What?

110
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,877
About what you want to do
in your spare time.

111
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,639
Hey.

112
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,434
People do use contés and charcoals a lot.

113
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,436
But pencils are the best for beginners.

114
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,315
Here. 4B pencils.

115
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,610
-You've seen them in art classes, right?
-Yes.

116
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,988
They are good for drawing,
adding details, and adjusting accents,

117
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,824
but not so good when sketching
because they smudge easily.

118
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,536
So for sketching, 2B pencils are better.

119
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,957
These are harder, so they are better
when drawing thick lines.

120
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,168
And…

121
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,505
unless you're very experienced,
drawing with 6B pencils will be tough.

122
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,760
Just remember
pencils also have their own colors.

123
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,306
I was hesitant to learn
how to draw because of my age.

124
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,391
But I'm glad I decided to.

125
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,395
Even if you started late,
you can do it for a long time.

126
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,106
There's no point starting early
if you end up quitting.

127
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,400
I'll do it then.

128
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,323
-Gosh. This is so nice.
-Right?

129
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,997
Don't be so formal with me.

130
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,749
In due time.

131
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,586
I quit my job at the academy today.

132
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,505
Thank you so much.

133
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,052
Preparing students
for the exam is so hard.

134
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,388
I have to only focus
on the technical aspects.

135
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,347
Technical aspects?

136
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,558
Some choose art because of their grades,
and some lack direction.

137
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,645
But if we train them for a few years,
they can draw pretty well.

138
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,025
And some of them get quite good.
Then I feel really bad for them.

139
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,821
Why? If they improve,
doesn't it mean you've done your job?

140
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,574
Let's say they drew for years
and got pretty good.

141
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,577
Then they'd have no choice
but to continue drawing.

142
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,997
But in the end, it's a waste of time
because they can't beat talent.

143
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,292
I see. You can only say that

144
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,670
because you are the talented one.

145
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,923
Well, I'm different. My grandpa
worked all his life to support me,

146
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,508
so I could pursue my dream.

147
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,969
Failing was never an option for me.

148
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,264
I love your confidence.

149
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,474
I know it's tough.

150
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,853
I don't really feel that way.
This is fun for me.

151
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,730
I'm simple. When I like something,
I get lost in it.

152
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,747
HANNAH

153
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,501
-Hey.
-I'm sorry, Hui-ju.

154
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,546
What's wrong? Did something happen?

155
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,382
My grandfather is hurt.
About today's lesson--

156
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,551
We can reschedule our lesson.

157
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,678
Is he hurt badly?

158
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,181
Well, I'm not sure.

159
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,891
I'll know once I get there.

160
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,851
Where are you? Let me--

161
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,563
No, Hui-ju. A close friend of mine
from school will fill in for me today.

162
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,148
What?

163
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,066
My friend will teach you instead.

164
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,778
No. We can just reschedule it…

165
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,407
That must be my friend.

166
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,160
Hui-ju, I just need a few days.
I'll call you again.

167
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,662
Hannah…

168
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,551
So you're the one who brought all this

169
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,929
upon yourself.

170
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,064
I don't want anything from you, Hui-ju.

171
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,280
How can I believe you?

172
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,492
You gave up a full-time position,
came to the school where my husband works,

173
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,202
and assaulted my daughter.

174
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,163
I didn't know. I'm telling the truth.

175
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,500
After I found out, I wanted to apologize.

176
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,335
Your apology makes me uncomfortable.

177
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,548
You barge in here as you please
just to give me your sorry excuses.

178
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,470
I'm sorry if I made you feel that way.

179
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,847
Hearing that you're sorry…

180
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,981
The person you should apologize to
is Li-sa, not me.

181
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,734
As I told you the other day,
she's not ready to see you.

182
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,153
So what you're doing
to my family is abuse.

183
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,826
I heard last year that Taerim High School
would turn into a high school of arts.

184
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,162
I heard working at Taerim
would increase my chance

185
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,289
at getting a job at an arts high school.

186
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,958
So I gave up on the full-time position
and came to Taerim.

187
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,210
I had no ulterior motive.

188
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,047
So

189
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,674
you want me to believe you?

190
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,888
What should I do to make you believe me?
Should I lie?

191
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,726
Ma'am.

192
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,397
-Hello.
-Hello.

193
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,399
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

194
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,943
My teacher said I did well!

195
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,363
Get in the car.

196
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,041
You can keep denying all you want,

197
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,127
but I think you're deliberately
hanging around my family.

198
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,298
I hope I'm worried for nothing.

199
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,905
Ho-su.

200
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,289
Ho-su, I told you
not to be friendly with strangers.

201
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,250
She's not a stranger.

202
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,712
What do you mean?

203
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,047
Ho-su, it's time for your snack.

204
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,595
Ho-su.

205
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,933
Were you home?

206
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,020
When did you come home?

207
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,188
A while ago. I was tired.

208
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,432
Did you talk to your ex? What did he say?

209
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,427
May I help you?

210
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,931
I'm here to pick up my stuff.

211
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,225
I had to wait until the students left.

212
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,859
Teachers mediate when kids fight.

213
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,404
-Pardon?
-You told Ju-yeong

214
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,366
not to put up with Li-sa.

215
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,575
Oh, that?

216
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,494
I did.

217
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,957
Since they weren't foolish enough
to fight in front of me,

218
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,750
I never got the chance to stop them.

219
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,502
So you didn't even see them fight,

220
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,671
but you made that decision
after talking to Ju-yeong?

221
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,299
What you see isn't everything.

222
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,096
Don't be fooled, Mr. An.

223
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,936
If you underestimate kids,

224
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,273
you might find yourself
in trouble beyond your imagination.

225
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,154
You make it sound like
Li-sa did something wrong.

226
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,364
What is it that you know?

227
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,786
Li-sa and Ju-yeong
didn't tell me anything alarming.

228
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,289
Of course not.

229
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,125
Girls at that age don't trust their dads.

230
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,589
Right.

231
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,383
Ju-yeong told me

232
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,679
that you seemed like a great guy.

233
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,892
But I don't trust people who give off

234
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,102
such an impression.

235
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,022
Because people like that usually

236
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,482
come with disgusting caveats.

237
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,327
NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION

238
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,208
TAERIM GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL,
TEACHER GU HAE-WON

239
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,419
THE TEACHER IS TO BE DISMISSED
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, AN HYEON-SEONG

240
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,714
It hasn't been finalized yet.
How did you get this?

241
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,009
Right? Someone who was
worried about the school

242
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,054
gave me a heads-up
about the possible mishap.

243
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,805
Who?

244
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,768
That's not the point.
Don't you think this is a cowardly move?

245
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,728
Ms. Gu. Watch your tongue.

246
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:34,024
I will face the punishment
for what I did to Li-sa.

247
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,735
But I will not let you violate

248
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,613
my rights as a teacher
and diminish the quality of my class.

249
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,948
And what if you won't?

250
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,536
Have you ever tried avoiding a dog?

251
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,624
If you run, it chases after you even more.

252
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,419
I hope you will make a wise decision.

253
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,483
His wife showed up
after several years and took him?

254
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,030
And Ms. Gu's immigration records?

255
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,866
She was in Korea when his wife showed up.

256
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,869
So this piece of paper was all it took?

257
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,125
The hospital didn't even check up on it?

258
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,049
DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

259
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,808
We must find him then.

260
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,892
Yes, sir.

261
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,355
Look everywhere we can
around Gu Hae-won first.

262
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:58,942
Find him.

263
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,612
JEONG HUI-JU'S SOLO INVITATIONAL EXHIBIT

264
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,239
REVISED: FANTASY I
COMPLETED: LI-SA I, LI-SA II

265
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,798
I'm sorry to call you this late.

266
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,218
But you left behind a painting.

267
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,459
I feel like I'm dreaming.

268
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,087
You are.

269
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,341
I don't care if it's just a dream.

270
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,885
I just don't want to wake up from it.

271
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,767
A nightmare is over

272
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,103
once I wake up.

273
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,084
Li-sa.

274
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm off to my lesson.

275
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,006
Already? Do you think you'll be okay?

276
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,008
The competition is around the corner.

277
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,759
I already wasted enough time.

278
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,886
Yesterday…

279
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,762
What about yesterday?

280
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,856
Who comes unannounced that early?
You should've called.

281
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,316
Sleep some more.

282
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,986
I came because
I heard you were worried about me.

283
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,573
If that was the case,
you could have just called me.

284
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,494
Since you're here,
have some food before you go.

285
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:42,249
When the weather is cold,
radishes are good for your health.

286
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,336
I'll braise them with anchovies.

287
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,129
Keep chopping them.

288
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,006
What?

289
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,719
I like listening to the sound
of you chopping radishes.

290
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,722
What a silly thing to like.

291
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,978
I like it. It makes me feel safe.

292
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,729
I like it.

293
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,694
Come visit me whenever things get tough.

294
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,990
I can chop up
all the radishes in the world for you.

295
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:33,717
Since when did my hospital
have a partner in Ireland?

296
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,096
Where's Ireland, by the way?

297
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,311
Did you approve this?

298
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,187
Yes.

299
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,149
How many years has it been?

300
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,860
Why invest in this, instead of the school?

301
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,194
It won't be a waste.

302
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,073
Even if the school has leftover endowments
after the expenditure,

303
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,868
you know that
we can't use that money to reinvest.

304
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,412
And I don't want to buy land
like the other schools.

305
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,414
And?

306
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,499
The general hospital coming into Sejong

307
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,669
will start a joint curriculum
with Trinity University in Ireland.

308
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,757
And Korean pharmaceuticals started
to manufacture their products in Ireland.

309
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,384
Taerim doesn't have a partner abroad yet,

310
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,595
so I thought
this would be favorable for us.

311
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,598
Is he telling the truth?

312
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,684
Among English-speaking countries,

313
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,562
it's the only hospital
without a partner in Korea.

314
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,733
Why didn't you tell me
if this was a good deal?

315
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,276
I was going to tell you

316
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,653
once we started making profit.

317
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,989
How and when did you set this up?

318
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,459
It's been a while.

319
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,213
I postponed a meeting for you.

320
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,173
I'll get going now.

321
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,477
I doubt that he came up with this alone.

322
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,230
I bet Hui-ju had something to do with it.

323
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,150
Check everything from A to Z.

324
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,821
A recommendation
from another artist will go here.

325
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,448
We'll list your past exhibitions here.

326
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,660
You can write the explanations
for your pieces yourself,

327
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:27,122
or we can invite a critic
to write something for your pieces.

328
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,796
That exhibition seems to have
the director's attention.

329
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,172
Right.

330
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,508
Our slots were
already filled for the year.

331
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,052
But she invited the artist
for a pop-up exhibition.

332
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,221
We just do what she tells us to do.

333
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,351
-As for the price range…
-Yes.

334
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,603
This is the number
we have in mind per piece.

335
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,112
EXHIBITION UNDER PREPARATION

336
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,854
She looks like you.

337
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,566
Hello.

338
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,946
It really does give off
the impression of you.

339
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,990
I'm still torn.

340
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,201
This piece doesn't suit the overall theme

341
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,371
or show the artist's style,
but I'm drawn to it.

342
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,415
Of all the works,
this is the only portrait.

343
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,877
It must be someone they liked.

344
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:42,382
Maybe it's the angle, but it's like
the artist is secretly peeking at her.

345
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,884
I can feel the love from the artist.

346
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,056
Who's the artist?
I heard that you handpicked them.

347
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,561
You wouldn't know even if I told you.
At least not yet.

348
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,646
Right. Why don't you come?

349
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,857
I'll introduce you during the reception.

350
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,651
Sure. Thank you.

351
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,803
Thank you, Hui-ju.

352
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,682
Without a car, I even thought
about borrowing a cart to the post office.

353
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,478
You've been drawing here the whole time?

354
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,189
Can you even focus here?

355
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,483
It's my friend's studio.

356
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,111
This place is really good
compared to the one at school.

357
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,405
The school studio stinks and is dusty.

358
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,325
Some even pee there because
walking to the toilet is a hassle.

359
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,833
I got it. It's mine, so I should do it.

360
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,147
They look so lonely.

361
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,943
-Pardon?
-I mean, why didn't you draw faces?

362
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,446
Oh, those? Those are my friend's works.

363
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,114
He doesn't draw faces.

364
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,574
Why not?

365
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,701
He only draws what he considers real,

366
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,745
but he doesn't feel that way
towards people.

367
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,121
Really?

368
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,379
Don't erase it. Start from here again.

369
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,007
It'll be yours even if it's bad.

370
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:35,138
But how much longer
do I have to draw the same thing?

371
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,891
Until you can draw
the same object differently.

372
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,274
I'm not doing this to pass some exam.
I've been doing the same thing for days.

373
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,495
Can't we wrap up here today?

374
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,093
You left this behind last time.

375
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,305
Okay. You can start now.

376
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,005
Goodness.

377
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,967
Sorry.

378
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,053
I was thirsty, so…

379
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,684
Your left side is prettier.

380
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:51,894
Pardon?

381
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,647
I mean, your face.

382
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:59,110
And the curve from your forehead,
cheekbone, and chin.

383
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,407
You say that as if it was nothing.

384
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,663
That's not true.
I had to muster up the courage to say it.

385
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:04,902
We meet again.

386
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,617
The confessional is closed for the day.

387
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,081
I thought about giving it a try today.

388
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,707
Did you do something wrong?

389
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,293
I was just curious

390
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,215
if God would forgive me for the sins
I would commit in the future.

391
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,346
That won't be possible, will it?

392
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,516
Then you can just not do it.

393
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,228
What are you planning to do?

394
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,857
That's a secret.

395
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,589
What are you doing here at this hour?

396
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,674
Are you here to pray?

397
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,427
I was waiting for you.

398
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,054
In case you showed up.

399
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,599
Me?

400
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,893
Yes.

401
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,938
Well…

402
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,441
Li-sa…

403
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,195
She's my niece.

404
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,657
I see.

405
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,159
I have a question.

406
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,913
From what I've seen,

407
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,082
you're not the type to get emotional
and hit a student for no reason.

408
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:48,881
If I say you're right,
it'll only paint Li-sa in a bad light.

409
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,552
And if I say you're wrong,
it will make me look really awful.

410
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,639
But I was awful.

411
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,433
Whatever the reason was,

412
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,728
I did get emotional when I hit Li-sa.

413
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,067
So I'm in the process of apologizing.

414
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,569
And I will keep trying.

415
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,698
I'm not sure if she'll forgive me though.

416
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,786
You should.

417
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,081
Apologize to her when you have the chance.

418
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,669
Not being able to apologize

419
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,631
is harder than not being forgiven.

420
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,639
It's been shaking the whole time.

421
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,852
I think it's a muscle spasm
due to anxiety. Come in for treatment.

422
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,824
You know what today is, right?

423
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,035
-Yes.
-Let's go.

424
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,800
I'd like those pears. How much is it?

425
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:15,926
It's 10,000 won.

426
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,184
You have to live

427
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,313
a good life for Jeong-seop's sake.

428
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,399
Okay?

429
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,498
While I was going through the closet,

430
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,543
I found a shirt I bought
for him to wear when he woke up.

431
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,213
I want you to wear it instead.

432
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:38,092
You guys used to share clothes.
Your size hasn't changed, right?

433
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,971
Thank you.

434
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,145
Have some more rice.

435
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,955
Right.

436
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,125
I know how Hui-ju feels.

437
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,378
She can't gloss over it
after what happened to Li-sa.

438
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,464
The disciplinary committee
will make a decision

439
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,050
by the end of today.

440
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,269
Was I too loud?

441
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:34,648
No. It's just that I have
a lot to go over today.

442
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,904
Don't just sit at the desk all day.
Get some exercise.

443
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,281
Exercise.

444
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:47,786
And I told you multiple times
we should use honorifics with each other.

445
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,707
That's cringey. It's not like
we have a big age gap.

446
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,545
I insist.

447
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,716
If we're loose with our words,

448
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,552
our actions will soon follow.

449
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,324
Open up your chest.

450
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,576
That's it.

451
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,223
Okay. Keep looking forward.

452
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,267
You have more muscles than me.
You're flexible too.

453
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,103
I don't want to do it,
but I'm forcing myself.

454
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,314
You can lower it.

455
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,732
Slowly.

456
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,110
You can get up now.

457
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:07,574
I mean, I'm exercising to survive.
That's all.

458
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,869
The final products of art are beautiful.

459
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:14,206
But the process of getting there
is like doing manual labor.

460
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,124
Sounds similar to exercising.

461
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,835
-Let's take a break.
-Okay.

462
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,391
MOTHER

463
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,487
Why did you invite her?
She rarely wears these kind of clothes.

464
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,323
Then you should lose weight.

465
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,578
She's a nice trophy to drag around
when we go shopping.

466
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:01,211
She makes good clothes,
but she gossips too much.

467
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,006
-We're done.
-Thank you.

468
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,217
This way, please.

469
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,978
Keep the measurements tight.

470
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,064
She didn't use to be such a wreck.
She's been gaining weight lately.

471
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,237
Did you check what I sent you?
The school looks good, right?

472
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,242
Yes, it does.
But Ho-su is still very young.

473
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,703
So he won't know what a privilege that is.

474
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,040
He should to go
a normal school just like--

475
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,374
What are you saying?

476
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:44,129
Hey, how could you be so naive
in this day and age?

477
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,966
A normal school?
Do you think everyone is equal?

478
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,719
He was born into a different class.
Why throw that away?

479
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,391
If he wants to go there,
I'll think about it.

480
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,562
Jeong-hwan said
he wanted to go abroad first.

481
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:05,525
He must be educated properly
to be able to recognize good values.

482
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,654
The quality of their lives
will depend on their upbringings.

483
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,322
Look at Li-sa.

484
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,741
She could've stayed in England.
But you brought her back--

485
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,701
I heard Li-sa changed her major again.

486
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,411
How dare you cut me off.

487
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,832
Turning the school into a school of arts
just for Li-sa is too much.

488
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,171
It was already decided
before Li-sa came back to Korea.

489
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,923
You know that.

490
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:31,885
Right. I know that you have
Hyeon-seong wrapped around your finger.

491
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,931
Even so, she should still study.
People might look down on her.

492
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:40,435
I don't think studying is for everyone.
Not everyone can get--

493
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,562
She should study for her own good.

494
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,064
That's enough.

495
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,858
Getting good grades
doesn't guarantee success.

496
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,611
The best a doctor's son
can be is a doctor.

497
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,655
I already have a hospital full of them.

498
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,991
Look at her. She's a high school graduate.

499
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,162
But she can talk back to me
because she married my son.

500
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,374
Ma'am.

501
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:06,086
You are the first client
I'm showing our new line.

502
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,713
-Good.
-Feel the fabric.

503
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:31,820
Are you all right?

504
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,489
Delete that.

505
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,327
Delete it.

506
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,543
Are you okay, Li-sa?

507
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,798
Gosh.

508
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,552
You're Ju-yeong, right?

509
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,095
Where do you live?

510
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:06,271
Does your leg hurt a lot?
Should I ask your uncle to take a look?

511
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,190
I'm fine.

512
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,484
The competition is next month.

513
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,277
I'll do something else if I can't.

514
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,613
You already changed it three times.

515
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,615
You should try the best you can.

516
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,450
Li-sa is good at drawing too.

517
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,247
I heard you were
aspiring to be a director.

518
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,708
Yes. I'll apply
to Taerim High School of Arts too.

519
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,251
For photography and video.

520
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,505
I'm filming Li-sa preparing
for her performance test for my portfolio.

521
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,590
You won't get extra points for filming me.

522
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,592
Other kids' portfolios will be so boring.

523
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,678
I'll film someone people want to watch.
And that's you.

524
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,349
You must be happy
to have found your passion early on.

525
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,060
I didn't know
what I wanted to do up until last year.

526
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,394
But Mimi helped me.

527
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,648
She said people like me
should eliminate my options first

528
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,233
before finding my passion.

529
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,735
Eliminate your options?

530
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,653
Yes.

531
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,990
I eliminated the things
I couldn't do even if I wanted to.

532
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,036
And then I eliminated
the things I could do but didn't want to.

533
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,581
And I ended up with only this.

534
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,583
I tried it but as Ms. Gu said--

535
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,502
Are you nuts? Do you have a death wish?

536
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,508
Li-sa!

537
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,152
I'll buy you the same phone.

538
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,779
This model's been discontinued.

539
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:42,993
Any model on the market will do.
They're all better than this.

540
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:46,288
Okay. I'll call you as soon
as I find a decent one.

541
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,081
Thank you.

542
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,916
I'm sorry. Wait.

543
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,379
I think Li-sa is being sensitive
because she hurt her leg.

544
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,505
Please take a cab.

545
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,217
I'm okay. It's because
I brought up Mimi first.

546
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,846
To me, she was a really good teacher.

547
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,906
You're grounded unless it's for lessons.

548
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,742
-Why?
-Do you have to ask?

549
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,285
We didn't fight.

550
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,330
She'll come crawling back to me tomorrow
because she needs me.

551
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,664
Even so, she's your friend.

552
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,791
I can be mean to her. It's okay.

553
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,293
How can you say that?

554
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,378
No one deserves to be treated like that.

555
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,089
-She does! She doesn't have a mom!
-Li-sa!

556
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:55,941
Because your wife assaulted the teacher,

557
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,902
we can't suspend her
on the grounds of violence.

558
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:02,697
With this cause, the disciplinary action
will be in her record for ten years.

559
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,908
So she won't be able to teach anywhere.

560
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,161
Of course, dismissing her
would damage her career the most.

561
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,829
But if we take it that far,

562
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,707
Ms. Gu might file an appeal
to review the case.

563
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,126
If she does, it'll be a huge scandal.

564
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:20,507
That's not the point.
Don't you think this is a cowardly move?

565
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,135
Someone who was worried about the school

566
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,806
gave me a heads-up
about the possible mishap.

567
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,935
THE TEACHER IS TO BE DISMISSED

568
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,980
I understand. You can all go now.

569
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,898
We should take care of this right away

570
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:40,819
so we can file for approval next month
and won't be held responsible.

571
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,489
Since people might
misunderstand it as retaliation,

572
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,950
it won't hurt to be careful.

573
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,998
I'm sure Mr. An will review it thoroughly.

574
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,547
Well, all right then.

575
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,401
Did you come here alone?

576
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,198
People come here to fish.
So you can't take home what you catch.

577
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,534
And you can only cook food
at the snack bar.

578
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,287
Put your trash here. And leave the bag.

579
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,206
You need to pay 30,000 won upfront.
10,000 won is the deposit.

580
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,506
First-timer?

581
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,552
Yes. I heard fishing is good
for clearing your head.

582
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:50,096
That's why a lot of people
come here alone.

583
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,682
And more young people are starting
to fish these days.

584
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,559
It must be those TV shows, right?

585
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,811
It might be you, the kind owner.

586
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:02,192
First-timers usually don't know
that I'm the owner here.

587
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,694
They always look for
a husband that I don't even have.

588
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,820
I see.

589
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,492
This place is huge.

590
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,620
It must be hard
to maintain this place alone.

591
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,704
I guess.

592
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,541
I'll let you have
your peace and quiet now.

593
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,502
Let me know if you need anything.

594
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,202
Hello, Ms. Jeong.

595
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:57,539
Ho-su's grandmother came
and picked him up just now.

596
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:08,883
Thank you, Hui-ju. Thanks to you,
the incident at school will be sorted out.

597
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:13,138
I'll be more careful,
so I don't make the same mistake again.

598
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,597
Thank you so much.

599
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,195
You've arrived at your destination.

600
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,088
I didn't know you called.

601
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,632
My phone died
right after I sent you the text message.

602
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:54,179
I was by the river today,
so I still feel a little chilly.

603
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,851
Are you sure you don't want any?
The food here is really good.

604
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,816
Thank you again, Hui-ju.

605
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,903
-Thanks to you--
-It wasn't me.

606
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,407
Whatever the school decided,
I had nothing to do with it.

607
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,829
You might be a good teacher
to some students.

608
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,749
But Li-sa and I feel
uncomfortable around you.

609
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,377
-I--
-So…

610
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,714
don't thank me.

611
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:34,636
This will be the last time we meet.
So I wanted to tell you this in person,

612
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,222
not over the phone.

613
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:43,645
So that you won't get the wrong idea.

614
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,739
I also had something
to tell you in person.

615
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,752
It's about Woo-jae.

616
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:16,302
He sends his regards to you.

617
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,835
What are you doing?

618
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,380
Why are you packing?

619
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,426
-That's enough!
-Stop it.

620
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,885
Stop it!

621
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,220
Gosh.

622
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,359
Are you out of your mind? Are you nuts?

623
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,320
Stop acting like a fool.

624
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,156
Am I the only fool here?

625
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,284
No.

626
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,494
No.

627
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,788
So let's stop fighting.

628
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:27,999
Give him to me.

629
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,878
If you want to leave, leave on your own.
You can't take Ho-su.

630
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,505
Seo Woo-jae!

631
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,760
Woo-jae…

632
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,680
really misses you.

633
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,938
Whenever I think of the good times
I've had with Woo-jae,

634
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,859
you were always there too.

635
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,195
We should get together some time.

636
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,030
Bullshit.

637
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,450
I didn't know you were married.

638
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,201
Is that a problem?

639
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,579
We're on the same side after all.

640
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,292
-Where is she?
-Who?

641
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,669
Where the hell is she?

642
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,798
I'm going to forgive him.

643
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,301
Because Woo-jae…

644
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,762
came back.

645
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,431
I'm late, aren't I?

646
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:53,519
