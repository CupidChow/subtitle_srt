1
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,530
Did you go somewhere this late at night?

2
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,370
What is going on?

3
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,335
What have you done to him?

4
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,421
I comforted him.

5
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,298
What?

6
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,384
Mr. An seemed
to be having such a tough time

7
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,012
to the point where
watching him suffer felt awful.

8
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,309
Why did you do it?

9
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,478
You two had a happy marriage

10
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,647
and he really cherished you.

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,608
What was the problem?

12
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,485
Your mother-in-law?

13
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,697
You said you could put up with her
as long as he was on your side

14
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,574
no matter how scary she was.

15
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,702
So why?

16
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,541
Shut up and leave.

17
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,961
You were the problem after all.
Your greed.

18
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,132
You wanted to maintain
stability in your life

19
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,968
and satisfy your desires at the same time.

20
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:19,389
Had you been willing to risk everything,
I wouldn't have hated you as much.

21
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,018
If you were going to steal him,
you should've kept him.

22
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,479
Was he a toy you could toss away
once you were done?

23
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,486
You must have been so happy
when you found out he'd lost his memories.

24
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,031
Blame me for what I did to you.
Just stick to what concerns you!

25
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,909
You don't get to blame me

26
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,996
for what I did to Woo-jae.
That's his business.

27
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,750
And everything between my husband and me,
that's none of your business, so butt out.

28
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,796
Don't use someone else's pain
against them. Got it?

29
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,099
Do you know why betrayal is so cruel?

30
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,228
Because betrayal makes you

31
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,648
endlessly doubt
the person you love the most.

32
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,322
You ruined everyone.

33
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,826
Me, Woo-jae,

34
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,704
and even your husband.

35
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,186
Honey--

36
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,986
He's a man, after all.

37
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,779
You don't think he can't cheat too?

38
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,674
Damn it.

39
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:16,649
EPISODE 15
BREAKUPS ARE HARDER THAN BEING IN LOVE

40
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,291
Thanks.

41
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,394
Do you remember?

42
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,147
What?

43
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,192
Who brought you home?

44
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,116
Yes.

45
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,786
What happened?

46
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,582
Why did Gu Hae-won bring you home?

47
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,751
Well…

48
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,339
Hyeong-gi…

49
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,925
I went to the building

50
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,345
where Mr. Lee's accident took place.

51
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,972
And I ran into Seo Woo-jae there.

52
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,104
You see, we still have lingering feelings.

53
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,235
I remember that look on your face.

54
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,153
You looked just like this

55
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,073
when you came to the pub looking for her.

56
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,285
You were worried that Hui-ju might come
back to me, but you pretended not to be

57
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,329
and that you were fine.

58
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm going to split it with Gu Hae-won.

59
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,169
I'm willing to give up everything I have.

60
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,590
Can you still say that
this is just infatuation and lust?

61
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,262
You must be more worried than before

62
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,597
because Hui-ju…

63
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,893
doesn't need the stability
from you anymore.

64
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,064
Who are you kidding?

65
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,403
You knew that Hui-ju
would abandon you in the end.

66
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,780
That's why you didn't end things with me.

67
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,533
You were a selfish coward.

68
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,785
Stop pretending you're some romantic.

69
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,454
What's going on between you two?

70
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,746
I'm not like you.

71
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,583
I came here to see Mr. Lee.

72
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,420
Where is he? He said he was
meeting you here the last time we talked.

73
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,005
Mr. Lee is severely injured.

74
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,050
-What happened?
-I heard it was an accident.

75
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,473
It was an accident.

76
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,894
And it must stay that way.

77
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,702
We can only find out what happened
if Mr. Lee gains consciousness.

78
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,787
There are no security cameras
in that area.

79
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,750
So for now, Seo Woo-jae's statement
as the witness is everything we have.

80
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,086
You don't believe him, do you?

81
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,259
I doubt that Woo-jae hurt Mr. Lee.

82
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,430
He has no reason
to turn down Mr. Lee's help.

83
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,935
But seeing how he still won't talk…

84
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,187
Hui-ju might have something to do with it.

85
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,689
Is that your point?

86
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,904
We'll know once Mr. Lee wakes up.

87
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,408
I…

88
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,124
I'm not sure if that's what I want…

89
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,505
If I really want to find it out…

90
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,011
I'm not sure.

91
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,266
I don't know.

92
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,310
They say forgiving someone

93
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,689
is like letting go of a prisoner

94
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,276
and then realizing
that the prisoner was actually yourself.

95
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,070
But look at us.

96
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,614
It looks like

97
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,785
you and I are still locked up in prison.

98
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,001
That means
you still haven't forgiven Hui-ju yet.

99
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,385
I was exhausted and desperate for a drink.

100
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,355
Is that all?

101
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,732
Should there be more?

102
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,360
But you didn't have to drink with--

103
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,613
Don't assume
that I'd cheat because you did.

104
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,539
Yes.

105
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,631
His surgery is over.

106
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,477
His post-op condition
is better than expected.

107
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,647
As you all know,
Ms. An is an excellent surgeon.

108
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,024
But it is possible that
he may have a disability

109
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,776
due to the damaged nervous system.

110
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,818
What disability?

111
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,155
There's a loss of sensation and movement
on the right side of his body.

112
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,076
As for his left leg,
some of the nerves are still working.

113
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,119
So we'll see after physical therapy.

114
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,332
But regaining his speech
is a more serious problem.

115
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,595
He can't talk?

116
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,348
What good will a mute lawyer be?

117
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,768
I've finally taught him to be useful.

118
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,062
What will you do?

119
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,857
What do you mean?

120
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,235
I'll help him recover as much--

121
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,195
And look after him
for the rest of your life?

122
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,699
Are you laughing?

123
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,412
How can you laugh right now?

124
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:52,169
I just remembered why I married him.

125
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,258
He wasn't like you.

126
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,850
But it turned out I was fooled
and tamed by his kind and sweet words

127
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,855
Growing up, you were never nice to me.

128
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,898
So I focused on my studies,

129
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,068
thinking you'd compliment me
if I became a doctor.

130
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,528
What are you talking about?

131
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,574
Why are you bringing that up now?

132
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,495
"You. I didn't give birth to you because
I wanted to, so don't get in my way."

133
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,251
"How can you survive in this world
if you can't even befriend those losers?"

134
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,045
"Aren't you on a diet?"

135
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,965
"You're such a pig."

136
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,050
"How can you even be eating after that?"

137
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,051
Hey.

138
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,930
When I said I didn't want
to marry the man you chose,

139
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,183
what was it you said?

140
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,978
"You'll come to your senses

141
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:55,149
once you marry an awful man
who beats you for the rest of your life."

142
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,904
Should I continue?

143
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,282
Hey. Why do you still remember those--

144
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,659
Don't "hey" me from now on.

145
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,579
Because you treat me so badly, he also…

146
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,547
I…

147
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,467
forgot I even said those.

148
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,553
She remembers them verbatim.

149
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,768
I think it's been really hard for Min-seo.

150
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,104
What?

151
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,985
The person who was hurt
remembers things much more clearly.

152
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,291
TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS

153
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,549
Mr. Lee is in pretty bad shape.

154
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,802
I need your help
with the foundation for now.

155
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,886
Yes, sir.

156
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,930
And regarding Mr. Seo…

157
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,766
He's appearing in print ads.

158
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:15,271
And he's accepting all the interviews
from the press and production studios.

159
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,149
He'll also be walking on the runway
for a charity at Fashion Week.

160
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,986
A documentary about his father
will be put together too.

161
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,490
Was it Park Jae-gwan?
The critic we met before.

162
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,201
Why don't we use him again?

163
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,788
He can only critique his art,
not his personal life.

164
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:37,001
It seems Ms. Lee of Hwain Gallery
has already talked to him.

165
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,213
Ms. Lee is serious
about supporting Mr. Seo.

166
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,308
I haven't seen this before.

167
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,561
I'm trying out something new.

168
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,105
Don't you think it's better

169
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,774
to stick to your style
than to try something new for now?

170
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,527
I'm sick of hearing
how my work resembles my father's.

171
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,490
You're his son. What's wrong with that?

172
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,077
Besides, your father was
definitely an artistic genius.

173
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,538
But no one recognized him.

174
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,916
Because he wasn't flexible like you.

175
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,668
You're different. You will be successful.

176
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,587
I guarantee it.

177
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:31,722
Come to think of it,
Ms. Jeong knew you better than I did.

178
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,727
At your exhibition, she said…

179
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,521
But even if he wasn't
a good father to Mr. Seo,

180
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,317
I'm sure he was the best father
to the artist within Mr. Seo.

181
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,612
Not only did he pass down his talent,

182
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,199
but also a sense of hunger
that couldn't be satiated.

183
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,536
I'm sure Mr. Seo will prove his worth.

184
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,447
Min-seo.
There's something I must tell you.

185
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,619
Can we talk outside?

186
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,787
Let's talk here.

187
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,872
He can't…

188
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,834
hear us anyway.

189
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,426
What? What is it?

190
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,679
When your husband had an accident,

191
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,473
I was there with him.

192
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,360
That flower comes up a lot
in a novel called Wuthering Heights.

193
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,319
Give it a read.

194
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,746
WUTHERING HEIGHTS

195
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,933
Let me get this straight.

196
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,854
He suspected you cheated,
so he called you there to threaten you,

197
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,439
but he tragically fell?

198
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,526
In other words, my husband is a bastard?

199
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:56,658
Do you expect me to say that to people?

200
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,454
I could've grabbed his hand
before he fell.

201
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,420
What if you did?

202
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,009
Both of you could have fallen
if you tried to save him.

203
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,181
I can't be responsible for you too.

204
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,061
He told me the building
needed a safety inspection

205
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,604
which was bad for construction.

206
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,359
As long as I'm concerned,
he fell when he went to check up on that.

207
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,485
But…

208
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,322
If that's all, leave.
I'm done listening to you now.

209
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,289
What brings you here at this hour?

210
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,334
I came out for some business,
so I stopped by to see you.

211
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,256
-What business?
-I sold the fishing spot.

212
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,300
Already?

213
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,511
The association wanted to hold out
to raise the compensation.

214
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,805
But it seemed unnecessary.

215
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,768
This is for the better. I should sell it
when I can and get out of there.

216
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,146
When?

217
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,024
Cooking is already
prohibited there at night.

218
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,569
I'll keep it open during the day
for my regulars and start wrapping it up.

219
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,824
Do you think you can stay there
at night all by yourself?

220
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,203
Didn't I tell you? People scare me more.

221
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,125
By the way, what are you doing here?

222
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,461
I wanted to see your kids
if you were at home.

223
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,761
What is it?

224
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,475
Why the long face?
What happened this time?

225
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,101
Gosh. I don't know.

226
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,899
I don't know
what's wrong with me these days.

227
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,367
What is it?

228
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,663
Why can't you ever catch a break?

229
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,045
Thanks.

230
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,220
Once I'm as old as him,

231
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,765
do you think I can let go of everything
and live peacefully?

232
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,144
Do you think he's living peacefully?

233
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,692
His wife's dementia is pretty bad,
so she's in a nursing home.

234
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,904
And his only daughter got a brain lesion
from a car accident as a kid,

235
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,198
so he's been taking care of her.

236
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,121
A caretaker comes
to bathe and look after her for two hours.

237
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,375
For those two hours,
he dresses up and indulges himself here.

238
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,876
The only luxury he has in life.

239
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,173
He's still living because
he can't leave behind his daughter alone.

240
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,510
This is his last place of rest.

241
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,557
Getting old doesn't bring peace.

242
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,643
You do whatever it takes
to find a way to cope.

243
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,565
So if there are things
you can let go, you should do it now.

244
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,319
If you push them to the cliff,

245
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,530
you will fall with them.

246
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,930
I couldn't stop thinking all day.

247
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,060
Where you and Hae-won were yesterday

248
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,812
and what you did

249
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,440
and talked about together.

250
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,650
Hui-ju.

251
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,570
I told you it was nothing--

252
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,364
I'm not saying I'm doubting you.

253
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,825
That's what I did.

254
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,330
So things must have been
really difficult for you.

255
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,000
How could you have been okay?

256
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,259
I wanted to turn a blind eye
when I knew you were suffering.

257
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,848
I was being selfish. I'm sorry.

258
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,650
I will withdraw
from the project with Hwain Gallery.

259
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,861
My family means more to me than my career.

260
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,033
I don't ever want to
make you feel insecure again.

261
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,165
Just let me smooth things out
with the gallery.

262
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,711
I don't want to
cause trouble for the project.

263
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,756
I'd be grateful.

264
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,890
Thank you for being patient.

265
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,481
Go to bed first. I'll be in the studio.

266
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,625
If you find what I have done so far

267
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,336
helpful to the project,

268
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,089
feel free to use my work

269
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,799
without any conditions.

270
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,511
May I ask why you want to drop out
all of a sudden?

271
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,638
It wasn't sudden.

272
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,308
I'm sure you sensed it too.

273
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,059
But still. This isn't right.

274
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,354
If this is about Ms. Gu, I already…

275
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,825
You don't love me. Wake up!

276
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,619
Who are you to judge my feelings?

277
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,330
This isn't love!

278
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,626
This is why I cannot continue
to work with him on this project.

279
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,543
Please stop!

280
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,754
-Giving up
-This is wrong, Woo-jae!

281
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:11,218
being part of Mr. Woo's last masterpiece
was a huge decision for me.

282
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:19,893
I don't want to involve the police
or make this public.

283
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,147
As I've been
in the public eye more than him,

284
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,901
a lot more people would criticize me.

285
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,447
Is Mr. Seo aware of this?

286
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,448
No.

287
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,328
You're the only one
who watched this footage.

288
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,582
What do you want me to do?

289
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,797
I know very well how much you care

290
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:53,051
about this project and how hard
you've been working for it.

291
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,764
I don't want to ruin this project either.

292
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,894
I'm indebted to Mr. Seo for something.

293
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,772
So I will let this incident slide.

294
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:12,737
But please make sure
he never does anything

295
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,864
like this again in the future.

296
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:20,036
Can you guarantee that
you will never bring this up again?

297
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:37,971
Get in.

298
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,682
Weren't you following me?

299
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,149
Yes, ma'am. So are you saying Li-sa has--

300
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,442
The wounds.

301
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,571
She has a lot of wounds on her thighs.
Did you know about them?

302
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:05,373
I know that she's gotten hurt often lately

303
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,335
because she's careless and clumsy.

304
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,377
No.

305
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,799
I think they are self-inflicted wounds.

306
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,762
I think you should check up on her.

307
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:24,851
Then where's… Where is Li-sa now?

308
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,646
She called in sick and hasn't come
for a few days. Didn't you know?

309
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,204
DIVORCE AGREEMENT
HUSBAND: SEO WOO-JAE

310
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,914
Are you divorcing Ms. Gu?

311
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,958
Yes. Did you follow me
to find out about that?

312
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,337
Why'd you tell me about that book?

313
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,465
Did you even read it?

314
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,510
It was very long and boring.
I didn't understand it at all.

315
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,638
Love is hard to understand.

316
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,599
That's not love.
They keep saying they're miserable.

317
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:06,976
So you did read it.

318
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,273
Two nights ago,

319
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,235
you were at my house, right?

320
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,197
You met my mom, didn't you?

321
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,075
Why?

322
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,455
Do you seriously not know?
Or are you trying to see if you're right?

323
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,085
You read the book.

324
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,755
You really don't know
why two people would meet?

325
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,516
Where are you?

326
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,075
Get in the car.

327
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,702
-He--
-Stop talking. Get in.

328
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,673
Why were you with Li-sa?

329
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,633
What are you plotting?

330
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,220
I never intended to meet her.
She came to me.

331
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,056
Cut her some slack.

332
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,976
It was something like a book club meeting.

333
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,269
Why are you here?

334
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,730
I moved here.

335
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,025
I told you. I'm divorcing Hae-won.

336
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,735
But why here of all places?

337
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:42,197
The unit was available, and I want
to remember more of our good days.

338
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,243
It's the same passcode.
Come anytime you want.

339
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:55,001
The police couldn't find
Mr. Lee's cell phone.

340
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,879
He said he needed to tell me
something about your husband.

341
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,965
Did you take his cell phone?

342
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,259
No.

343
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,971
There might be something in the phone
that other people shouldn't see.

344
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,515
I don't know where it is.

345
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,600
And I don't want to.

346
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,367
Gosh.

347
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,621
Did you do this to yourself?

348
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,332
Why? What's the problem?

349
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,709
We give you everything
you want and ask for.

350
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,337
You have everything.
Why are you doing this?

351
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,672
It's all because of you!

352
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,466
Everything that happened

353
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,010
with Mimi, Ju-yeong,
and Ho-su is all your fault!

354
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,475
I saw everything.

355
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,352
I saw it that day.

356
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,855
You left Dad and me there.

357
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,691
And I saw you with that man!

358
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:04,279
You didn't see anything. I told you.
You're mistaken. Why won't you believe--

359
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,116
Yes! That's why I pretended
I didn't know anything about you two!

360
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,869
Then you should be careful!
Why do you keep seeing him?

361
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,329
What if Dad finds out?

362
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,880
Do you like that man more than me or Dad?

363
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,217
Li-sa.

364
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,201
Please book me an appointment
with Dr. Jeong for next week.

365
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,119
One moment.

366
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,710
Dr. Jeong will be leaving
the hospital next week.

367
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,087
I'll make you an appointment
with another doctor.

368
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,302
What are you talking about?

369
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,471
Are you running away?

370
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,724
You didn't ask me for permission.
I didn't sign off on it.

371
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,311
How dare you try to run away
from me behind my back?

372
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,981
That's not true. Right?

373
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,485
It's not, right?
Tell me it's not true! It can't be.

374
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,778
Tell me you're staying!

375
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,697
If you cared even a bit about Jeong-seop,
how could I…

376
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,367
No. How could you leave?

377
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,494
You can't run away

378
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,622
to live your own life.
You just can't, you bastard.

379
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,167
You bastard!

380
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:43,795
Please stop.

381
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,756
Why do you keep butting in?
You don't know anything.

382
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,302
Do you know what he did to Jeong-seop? He…

383
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,140
Yes. Your son

384
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,352
was Dr. Jeong's friend.

385
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,938
Yes. They were friends.

386
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:06,401
They were friends. But why…

387
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,613
Why did only my son die?
Why did only my Jeong-seop have to die?

388
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,866
I'm sorry.

389
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,785
How could you do this if you're sorry?

390
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,745
Jeong-seop would think it's so unfair

391
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,165
seeing you enjoying your life
when he's dead!

392
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,458
You bastard.

393
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,129
Is that how he would think?

394
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,880
What?

395
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:32,969
Do you think he would want his friend
to live a life of suffering forever?

396
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,181
Was that the kind of person he was?

397
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,814
Stop it.

398
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,483
She's right.

399
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,528
Ma'am.

400
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,787
Did you send her off safely?

401
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,413
Yes.

402
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,043
But if this ever happens again,

403
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,755
just let it go because
she has the right to do that.

404
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,799
How do you endure it?

405
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,344
I'm not enduring it,

406
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,764
I'm just waiting
for her anger to die down.

407
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,184
-For how long?
-I don't know.

408
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:09,273
I can only imagine
how deep her pain must be.

409
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,401
What was that about going to America?

410
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,739
An internship.

411
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,702
An opportunity to study more
on physical therapy came up,

412
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,792
But I don't know if I should go.

413
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,044
You should go.

414
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,508
I also had an opportunity once,
but I lost it.

415
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:41,139
I pitied myself for losing the chance
and regretted it a lot.

416
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,436
So, don't regret it and go.

417
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,611
You also…

418
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,575
You also have regrets,
so you should start over.

419
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,329
It's already too late for me.

420
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,680
Mr. Lee's surgery went well.

421
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,560
Once he regains consciousness,

422
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:32,398
he will tell the police what happened.
Is that okay with you?

423
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,406
Hui-ju was there that day too.

424
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,369
Does that change anything?

425
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:51,125
He fell because he wasn't careful.
That's a fact.

426
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,755
I sent over the paper again.

427
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,424
Let's end this quickly.
You'll be better off that way.

428
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,759
Better?

429
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,554
Who are you to judge what I want?

430
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,389
Then what is it that you want?

431
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,309
What do you gain from this?

432
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,147
If you're holding onto me
out of fear and loneliness, stop.

433
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,276
You always had a lot of people
who cared about you. And you still do.

434
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,946
Don't act like I ruined your life.

435
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,156
If you do, you're disrespecting them.

436
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,540
If you don't let go of me,

437
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,044
we will only keep
hurting each other like this.

438
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,505
It's better to be lonely alone

439
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,882
than be miserable together.

440
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,557
Remember what I told you?

441
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,477
For us, a divorce means

442
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,272
either your death…

443
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,566
or mine.

444
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,948
Do you still want that?

445
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,986
Ho-su and Li-sa are staying
with my mom today.

446
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,696
What on earth happened?

447
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,576
Li-sa didn't tell you anything?

448
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,910
Tell me what?

449
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,163
She stopped talking to me a long time ago.

450
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,588
What's going on?

451
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,772
Li-sa is harming herself.

452
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,774
What do you mean?

453
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,484
I had no idea.

454
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,948
I'm her mother, but I was so blind.
I found out when her teacher told me.

455
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,539
I knew that Li-sa was acting strange.

456
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,295
But why didn't I
try harder to look into it?

457
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,801
What did her teacher say?
There must be a reason behind it.

458
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,303
I have no idea.

459
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,472
I don't know what to do.

460
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,058
I don't know
how I'm going to face Li-sa now.

461
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,435
I just don't know, honey.

462
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,190
You will have to face her.
She's our daughter.

463
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,485
We must take good care of her,
so things don't get worse.

464
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,332
Ms. Gu!

465
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,209
There's someone inside,
but she's not answering.

466
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,002
Please open the door.

467
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,805
Ms. Gu.

468
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,015
Ms. Gu!

469
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,438
SLEEPING PILLS

470
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:43,899
Ms. Gu!

471
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,829
Seeing how you're here,

472
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,666
I guess Hae-won is fine. I was worried.

473
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,543
Worried?

474
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,129
If you were worried,
you should've gone right away.

475
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,256
Why did you call me?

476
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,011
Were you just going to let her die
if you couldn't reach me? Were you?

477
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,472
Then I would've gone to her myself.

478
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,974
She wouldn't want me to, though.

479
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:21,145
That doesn't matter.
Even if you're going to divorce her…

480
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,441
shouldn't you have gone to her

481
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,943
once you knew her life was in danger?

482
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,282
You went there in my place.

483
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,423
At least,
I realized something from all of this.

484
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,510
Now I know how useless

485
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,679
and harmful you are to Ms. Gu.

486
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,311
And one more thing.

487
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,564
That I shouldn't let

488
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,817
someone like you come close to my sister.

489
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,118
At one point in your life,
these amazing two women both loved you.

490
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,665
How did you turn into such a loser?

491
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,346
Ms. Jeong is withdrawing?

492
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,723
Artists from other fields

493
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,352
will be participating
to take up where Ms. Jeong left off.

494
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,188
No. Let me go and see Ms. Jeong.

495
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,857
No. That is the gallery's job.

496
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,236
You should only focus on your work.

497
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,155
This project will proceed
as planned without her.

498
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,657
And I'll make it successful.

499
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,327
Mr. Woo is the pillar
of Korean architects. I can easily

500
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,788
find artists who want to join
his last exhibition.

501
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,081
Exactly.

502
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,502
I'm asking why Ms. Jeong
wants to drop out of this great project.

503
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,170
You want to be successful. Right?

504
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,173
Then distance yourself from her.

505
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,845
She wants you to succeed.

506
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:18,929
I'm certain of that.

507
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,308
So stop causing trouble.

508
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,934
And only focus on your work.

509
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,770
Why did you

510
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,690
-call me here to tell me--
-Because…

511
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,529
I'm the CEO of Hwain Gallery
in charge of protecting you.

512
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,742
Ms. Jeong has
many powerful people around her.

513
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,621
I don't want to cause trouble with her.

514
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,273
I'll take him inside. You can go home.

515
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,316
Ho-su.

516
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,152
Are you okay?

517
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,780
I want to play.

518
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,790
What the hell are you doing?

519
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,291
I just played with him.

520
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,296
I'm glad that Ho-su still remembers me.

521
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,633
Dad!

522
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,684
I cut his umbilical cord,

523
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,354
comforted him when he cried at night…

524
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,857
fed him baby formula,

525
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,152
and watched him take his first step.

526
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,281
What were you doing in the meantime?

527
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,534
You crazy bastard.

528
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,994
Do you want the paper
that says he's not your son?

529
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,914
A piece of paper
doesn't mean anything to me.

530
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,084
It doesn't change the fact that

531
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,087
I was the one who raised him
before you took him away from me.

532
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,056
Ho-su, let's go inside.

533
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,477
Ho-su.

534
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,555
What happened? Why am I here?

535
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,557
Why? Did you ask me why?

536
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,105
Why didn't you tell me?
When did you break up with that jerk?

537
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,274
You guys had just gotten back together!

538
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:22,112
I told you he'd do it again.
Only the first time is hard.

539
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,450
If you know that,
why do you live like this?

540
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,411
So learn from my mistakes!
This is so frustrating!

541
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,787
I didn't ask you for much.

542
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,624
I only asked you to outlive me.
That's all I want!

543
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,376
Gosh. Stop yelling at me.
You're hurting my ears.

544
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,296
And you're totally wrong.
I'm not going to die.

545
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,009
I couldn't sleep, so I took
some sleeping pills. Why the fuss?

546
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:44,968
Fuss?

547
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:48,263
You ended up in the ER
and scared the crap out of me.

548
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,223
I'm making a fuss?

549
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,561
Sorry.

550
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,648
I shouldn't have taken them with alcohol.

551
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,692
I won't do that again.

552
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,992
Who's that guy?

553
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,119
Guy?

554
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,746
The guy who carried you to the ER.

555
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:13,997
What guy?

556
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,542
Didn't you bring me here?

557
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,628
Look at you.
The drugs haven't worn off yet.

558
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,130
I rushed there
after getting a call from him.

559
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,862
You were totally out of it.
And I couldn't find your husband.

560
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,406
And I was losing it too.

561
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,450
If it weren't for him,
I would've been admitted too.

562
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,831
He seemed boring and pale,

563
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,334
but he was such a sweet guy.

564
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,337
And he's nice and tall.

565
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,675
A girl has to meet someone like him.

566
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,386
Look at your asshole husband.

567
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,681
I forgave him because he was good-looking.
See? Look what he did.

568
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,185
Since this happened,
you should divorce him right away

569
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,104
and date this guy. Okay?

570
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,693
No.

571
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,155
I can't. So don't bring it up again.

572
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,489
Ms. Gu.

573
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:32,993
Right.

574
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:37,289
I was on my way out to buy abalones
to cook porridge. My goodness.

575
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,499
Hey, your teacher is not well.

576
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,877
She must stay home to recover.
Keep an eye on her.

577
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,961
You're in charge.

578
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,255
Gosh.

579
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,758
You're not well? What's wrong?

580
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,260
I'm okay. I feel refreshed
after getting some sleep.

581
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,764
Are you done with your exams?
Did you do well?

582
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,390
I aced them.

583
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,685
And I got this.

584
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,485
SEOUL FAMILY COURT
NOTICE FOR HEARING

585
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,528
PETITIONER: GU HAE-WON
MINOR: LEE JU-YEONG

586
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,031
THE DATE OF THE RULING
HAS BEEN SET AS FOLLOWING

587
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,291
Give me ten big abalones.

588
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,459
Sure.

589
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,877
Give me big ones.

590
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,000
Going up.

591
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,798
The flowers are beautiful.

592
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,552
I like roses too.

593
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:18,306
I heard that flowers

594
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,727
in subtle, pastel colors
are popular these days.

595
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,440
But I still think
bright, colorful flowers are better.

596
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,609
Colorful like those.

597
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,948
Who are they for? Your wife?

598
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,702
She must be so happy.

599
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,372
The doors are opening.

600
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,053
NAME: KIM SO-YEON

601
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,853
So-yeon.

602
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,982
I'm here.

603
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,905
I'm sorry that I took so long.

604
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,327
I just heard what happened--

605
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,335
I'm sorry.

606
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,088
I'm really…

607
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:43,016
My wife spent
all my retirement pay, savings,

608
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:45,393
and money from our home equity loan

609
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,563
on a patch of land without telling me.

610
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,525
She was scammed.

611
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,654
After keeping it from me
for a while, she fell ill.

612
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,739
There was nothing we could do.

613
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,033
However,

614
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,037
I was too busy chasing
after those frauds to mourn for her.

615
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,263
Excuse me.

616
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,225
You need to take your abalones!

617
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,935
Jeong-yeon!

618
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,230
Jeong-yeon!

619
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,861
Was it not her?

620
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,415
Ho-su.

621
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,421
What did you do with that man earlier?

622
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,133
He's really good at building sandcastles.

623
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,011
He built everything I asked for.

624
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,265
You're still here.

625
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:11,062
You left work early because
your wife is sick. Why are you still here?

626
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,236
You told Mr. Choi to prepare

627
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,406
his admission documents
for a school in England.

628
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,825
Should I have asked
your unconscious brother-in-law?

629
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,410
That's not what I mean.

630
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,786
Then what do you mean?

631
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,122
Jeong-hwan only wants
to study just like his mom.

632
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,960
Ho-su will get everything
including the hospital.

633
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,296
I'll give everything to you, Ho-su.

634
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,758
Mom.

635
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,347
I don't expect anything
from any of you now.

636
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,474
I raised you wrong.

637
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,645
Everything you have all came from me.
You and your sister are so ungrateful.

638
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,652
All right.

639
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,571
Ho-su, why don't you have one of these?

640
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:02,989
There.

641
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:04,950
Open wide.

642
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:11,414
There you go. Good boy.

643
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,250
You'll get only the best stuff from me.

644
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,795
Eat a lot, so you can be a healthy boy.

645
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,298
Ho-su won't turn out like you.

646
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,550
The hospital is running smoothly now.

647
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,887
So I'll take care of him from A to Z
and raise him right.

648
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:31,434
When will you stop being so greedy?

649
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,520
Let this go and make peace--

650
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,730
Change too suddenly and you die.

651
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,899
Are you praying for my death?

652
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,275
Mom.

653
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,029
You weren't even sure if he was your son.

654
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,865
Your wife might've been sleeping
with some guy for years.

655
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,993
How can I trust you to raise my grandson?

656
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,786
Can't you just drop it?

657
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,374
Drop what?

658
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,671
Li-sa, when did you--

659
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,799
I called her over. Your wife is not well.

660
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,467
I doubt that she'll feed the kids.

661
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:07,595
Let's go.

662
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,029
Come on. Not you too.

663
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,157
Ho-su still needs us.

664
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,703
Your mother can look after him.
But he still needs his parents.

665
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,998
She keeps coddling him,

666
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,292
so he won't even come to his mom.

667
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,838
I'm not against him going
abroad to study. Let him finish--

668
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,256
Seo Woo-jae was here.

669
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:49,971
He was with Ho-su
at the playground in front of the house.

670
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,476
I can't be there every time
to see if he's here or not.

671
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:58,021
And it's not a bad idea
to learn their culture early on

672
00:55:58,813 --> 00:55:59,731
like my mom said.

673
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,029
It'll be okay if we visit him there often.
We've done that for Li-sa,

674
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,866
so we won't make mistakes this time.

675
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,847
I'll get going then.

676
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,641
Take care.

677
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,102
I'll be back soon. Don't worry about me.

678
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,854
-Bye. Good luck.
-Bye.

679
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,484
-Take care.
-Go back inside.

680
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,666
IN FRONT OF TAERIM HOSPITAL

681
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,547
You won't be working at the hospital now?

682
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,177
I've been meaning to call you, actually.

683
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:16,141
I heard what you did.
Thank you for taking me to the ER.

684
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,853
Are you okay now?

685
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,272
Totally.

686
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,692
It was nothing.
I had a hard time falling asleep.

687
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,363
I mean it.

688
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,700
If I was miserable to death,

689
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,162
I'd kill the people who made me
miserable. Why would I die?

690
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,005
I wasn't scared of death.

691
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,842
Seeing how much pain life brought me,

692
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,929
I wondered if the afterlife
would be better than living.

693
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,390
That's what I thought.

694
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,521
But when I saw you unconscious…

695
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,650
I didn't care about that anymore.

696
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:13,823
I kept praying.
"Please don't let her die."

697
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,160
I ran to the ER like a madman.

698
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,334
Gosh. It was really scary.

699
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,880
Don't ever do that again.

700

call me instead.

I know you're uncomfortable around me.

702
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:46,731
But I'm not asking you
to do anything with me right now.

703
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,608
Just…

704
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,904
Just let me help you.

705
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:57,659
Let me do that little by little.

706
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,453
I don't feel uncomfortable.

707
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:46,708
I feel comfortable around you.
And that's the problem.

FROM PUPIL TO RESPECTABLE ARTIST

712
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:47,977
So you're accusing me of paying off
these reporters to write these articles?

713
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,228
Didn't you?

714
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,693
That's too bad. Unfortunately, I did not.

715
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,867
I wouldn't buy off this many people
just to bring you down.

716
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,994
I'm not that interested in you.

717

And I have no time for it.

718
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:13,044
Would your pride have been hurt less
if I was behind these articles?

719
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,008
You seem disappointed.

720
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,052
I knew it.

721
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,806
You should have known your place.

722
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,602
No matter how hard
Ms. Lee tries to help you,

723
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,063
you see, one's character…

724
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:37,360
is bound to surface eventually.

725
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:48,705
Stop whining like a baby here,
and go focus on your art more.

726
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,250
Come in.

727
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,046
He's just leaving.

728
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:58,840

along with the rights
regarding childrearing will be restricted.

732
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:21,237
The court designates the petitioner
as the guardian of the minor.

733
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:26,576
And the guardian will be responsible
for the following obligations.

734
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:31,080
This is absurd!
That school director was right about you.

735
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,041
You set me up!
So you could take the money!

736
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,377
You talked Ju-yeong into this!

737
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,671
You did that to steal all of my money!

738
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,506
How could you do this to me?

739
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,759
How could you?

740
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,857
I didn't expect to see you here.
I'm glad you are here.

741
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,818
How dare you show up here?

742
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,279
I was curious about his recovery.

743
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,907
I want him to gain consciousness

744
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,243
more than anyone.

745
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,579
And I have the right to be here

746
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,833
because after all,
I'm a witness to the accident.

747
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,212
Once he wakes up, the lies you told--

748
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,881
At least your husband
will believe it was an accident.

749
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:08,511
No. He will have to
because what he did was worse than this.

750
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:14,100
It was unfair that
you wasted three years of your life.

751
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,645
And I have new evidence
regarding your accident in Ireland.

752
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,606
Why do you want to help me?

753
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,819
Because helping you will help me.

754
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,367
He made me lie in bed
unconscious for three years.

755
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,955
That's the kind of man your husband is.

756
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:41,002
Hui-ju, you are living with a monster.

757
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,629
He'll be here soon. You should go.

758
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,172
I have no reason to avoid him.

759
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,800
Discussing how
he'll compensate me for the years I lost

760
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,469
sounds good too.

761
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:54,599
Then let's talk about this outside.

762
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,601
You said that back then too.

763
01:04:56,684 --> 01:05:00,146
You told me to leave Ho-su
and get out for a while that day.

764
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:05,902
If I knew I would lose you and him,
I wouldn't have done as you said.

765
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,029
I should've held out.

766
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,780
You didn't lose anyone.

767
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,034
I decided to leave you.

768
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,493
Then come back to me.

769
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,953
Come back to me with Ho-su.

770
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,497
The three of us can start over.

771
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,626
Bring Li-sa too if you want.

772
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,044
I'm different now.

773
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,712
I'll support you.

774
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,298
I'll be successful.

775
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,426
More successful than your husband.

776
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,978
Where's Mr. Lee's cell phone?

777
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:46,067
I know you took it.
There's something in it, isn't there?

778
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:49,570
That's why you remembered
to take it even when he…

780
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,999
Get out. Let's talk outside.

781
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,918
Let's talk outside. Please?

782
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,884
I'm on my way up.
Are you still in the room?

783
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,472
Please.

784
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,231
Why are you out here?
Why didn't you go in?

785
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,441
I didn't want to go in by myself.

786
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,570
It's bad. He's still unconscious.

787
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,531
Is Li-sa's therapy over?

788
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:37,076
Oh, my. She should be done soon.
I'll go check on her.

789
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,037
I'll go too.
We should work on this together.

790
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,414
She's our daughter.

791
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,639
You won't do it without Ms. Jeong?
Come on, don't do this again.

792
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,933
This is an important time for you.

793
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,102
This is a great chance
to fix their prejudice.

794
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,855
Exactly. That's why
I must do it with Ms. Jeong.

795
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,441
This was a joint project.

796
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,943
If she drops out,
what will people say about that?

797
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,820
How many more times must I tell you?

798
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:16,615
You must distance yourself
from Ms. Jeong to protect yourself.

799
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,368
Exactly. I asked you several times
why that's the case.

800
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:33,841
You don't love me. Wake up!

801
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:36,218
If you approach her again,

802
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,220
I won't be able to stop her.

803
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,766
If this video reaches the public,
your career is over before it even starts.

804
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:43,809
This isn't what it looks like.

805
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,519
Of course you'd say that.

806
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:46,687
It's not!

807
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:49,231
Right. I don't know
what happened between you two.

808
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:52,610
What's important is that people will
only believe what they want to.

809
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:54,862
And people will believe
Ms. Jeong over you.

810
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,989
This is a lie!

811
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:02,745
That's not true! It's a lie!

812
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,418
It's not true.

813
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,966
That's a lie.

814
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,643
I lived here only briefly,
but I still have a lot of stuff to pack.

815
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:30,106
It was so easy to start.

816
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,774
But breaking up is difficult.

817
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,570
Why do we always make the same mistake?

818
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,241
What brings you here anyway?

819
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,956
I know I don't deserve it,
but I'm here to ask you for a favor.

820
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:49,959
Please stop Woo-jae.

821
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:52,753
He will listen to you.

822
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:56,090
Remember what you told me?

823
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:59,343
That I would destroy myself

824
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,596
because of my victim mentality.

825
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,559
You were right, as you can see.

826
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:11,730
And I can now understand
that you will not crumble

827
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,899
no matter how hard I try.

828
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,779
It was impossible to achieve something

829
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:22,408
only out of hatred and resentment.

830
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,539
But Woo-jae isn't like me.

831
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:32,209
His feelings for you,
whatever they may be…

832
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:36,088
He firmly believes that it's love.

833
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:40,301

01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,891
you would never break down like me. Right?

837
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:52,938
I will be watching you to see

838
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,275

Why'd you come?

01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:41,862
Ms. Lee called me.

01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,073
She's worried about you.

A proud woman like her asked me for help.

01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,159
Why?

875
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,205
But I don't want to go.

876
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:39,873
Are you going too?

877
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,000
Dad, you too?

878
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:45,796
-What about Mom?
-Don't send him abroad.

879
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,176
He's going to school.
You studied there too.

880
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,970
Ho-su doesn't want to go.

881
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,264
Why did you let Grandma decide?

882
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,145
-We can discuss it later.
-Is it because of Mom again?

883
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:36,305
Woo-jae. Hold on.

884
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:43,395
Woo-jae, don't do anything rash.

885
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:47,983
Wait.

886
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,321
Woo-jae!

887
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,775
I can't let you go like this.

888
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:44,873
Hui-ju…

889
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,096
If I can't have you,

890
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,890
nobody can have you.

891
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:28,518
