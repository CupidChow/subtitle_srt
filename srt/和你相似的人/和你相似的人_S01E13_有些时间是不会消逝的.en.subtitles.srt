1
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,157
Standing way up there…

2
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,494
who would you think of?

3
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,041
Jeong…

4
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,135
Gosh, it's cold.

5
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,255
There.

6
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,985
Okay.

7
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,395
I'll call you.
Can you stay somewhere else for a while?

8
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,563
Please?

9
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,485
Why must I do that?

10
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,029
He's at the airport right now.

11
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,198
He's coming to see the baby.
What could I do?

12
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,702
Come on, now.

13
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,081
Why? Why must I leave my son here
and go somewhere else?

14
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,959
He's my son, not yours.

15
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,294
No. He's my son.

16
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,921
I raised him.

17
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,132
Ho-su is my son.

18
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,341
Woo-jae.

19
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,262
Please, Woo-jae.

20
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,517
Hui-ju.

21
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,873
Jeong Hui-ju!

22
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,045
Hui-ju!

23
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:15,323
EPISODE 13
SOME TIMES DO NOT DISAPPEAR

24
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,036
TAERIM HOSPITAL

25
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,444
I'm not the lost cause here. It's--

26
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,239
Was pestering me not enough?

27
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,909
Why do you want her to leave?
Scared of what I'll say?

28
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,319
This is the document Mr. Lee got
from Sligo General Hospital.

29
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,295
Explain this to me.

30
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:02,847
Explain why this man
is the guardian on this birth certificate.

31
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,153
All the students from Korea were
quite close since we were far from home.

32
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,990
Naturally, we helped
each other out when needed.

33
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,208
My contractions began
earlier than my due date.

34
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,005
And I'm sure you remember
how busy Hyeon-seong was

35
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,549
with setting up
the foundation for Taerim Academy.

36
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,010
I couldn't drive myself.

37
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,847
So Mr. Seo drove me to the hospital.

38
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:54,023
He must have signed it
because the hospital staff asked him.

39
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,694
And that's it.

40
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,156
I understand this looks suspicious to you,

41
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,949
but you have the wrong idea.

42
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,625
Did you practice this?
That was very smooth.

43
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,713
Yes, he's your son
because you gave birth to him.

44
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,133
But how could I believe you
after seeing this?

45
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,143
Does Hyeon-seong know

46
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,646
what you're doing right now?

47
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,606
I will tell him once I get the results.

48
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,359
Why didn't you just call him here today?

49
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,614
It's been 20 years
since we've been married.

50
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,575
It's our marriage, so we'll handle it.

51
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,494
This isn't your place to intervene.

52
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,620
You…

53
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,420
I couldn't care less about your marriage.

54
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,715
I'm checking all the boxes to make sure

55
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,177
my grandchild is indeed mine
before he inherits my assets.

56
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,683
We'll know for sure tomorrow
if I'm wasting my time or not.

57
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,194
"There was a girl."

58
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,702
"Her mind was full of questions
about the world,

59
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,623
full of thoughts
about the stars in the night sky,

60
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,088
and full of amazement about the ocean."

61
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,219
"Whenever she found something new,
she was elated."

62
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,181
"But that was only until…

63
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,020
she saw the empty chair
her grandpa used to sit in."

64
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,067
What? Are you crying?

65
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,112
Why?

66
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,531
Well, it's sad.

67
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,575
Which part?

68
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,495
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

69
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,997
I'll know if you tell me.

70
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,377
Sadness is something you feel.
It can't be understood through words.

71
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,383
Then I think I feel it too.

72
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,472
-What?
-Because I don't feel good either.

73
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,728
I'm sorry, Ho-su.

74
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,105
I'm really sorry.

75
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,607
It's okay.

76
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,861
Ma'am, you don't have to
apologize for being sad.

77
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:58,624
"The scared girl decided to put her heart
in a bottle just for a little while."

78
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,836
Why did she put her heart in a bottle?

79
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,088
Well…

80
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,467
Maybe keeping her heart
was too painful for her.

81
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,219
Why was it painful?

82
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,014
It happens when you lose
something precious to you.

83
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,725
What does "precious" mean?

84
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,144
Something is precious
when there's only one of that.

85
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,230
The only one in the world.

86
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,406
But you have to be careful.

87
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,741
If you put your heart
in the bottle for too long,

88
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,618
you'll forget other feelings too.

89
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,144
Ho-su…

90
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,563
Ho-su…

91
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,531
I told you to stay away.

92
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,617
I'm not here to see Hui-ju.

93
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,664
And I made myself very clear as well.
I never forgave her.

94
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,208
-Ms. Gu.
-You said you love her.

95
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,795
You couldn't have forgiven her that easily
if you truly loved her.

96
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,177
Or it's, "Since I forgave you,

97
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,804
I'm a better person than you."

98
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,640
"I'm the most ethical man."

99
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,727
Is that your way of comforting yourself?

100
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,400
Seeing you try
to keep your dignity to the end

101
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,195
makes you look pathetic, not respectable.

102
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,616
It's natural to break down
and get jealous when you've been betrayed.

103
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,285
But you don't want
to show people that you are weak?

104
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,373
How about you?
You think you're doing well?

105
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,803
You say you're getting revenge,
but you seem more distressed.

106
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,264
No matter how distressed I am,
it is easier than being forgiving.

107
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,143
You two can try whatever you want,
but I'm not going to leave my wife.

108
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,062
And my wife feels the same too.

109
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,981
So let me tell you this one last time.

110
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,653
You should stop here.
I mean this. I really do.

111
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,282
I don't want to hurt you.

112
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,337
Ho-su.

113
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,719
I hope you don't blame me.

114
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,515
I'm not as experienced as you.

115
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,685
So I can't say no to our mother-in-law.

116
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,863
Mom, I can't breathe.

117
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,699
Right. I'm sorry.

118
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,872
You know how much I love you, right?

119
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,460
You know how precious
you are to me. Right?

120
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,629
Yes, I know.

121
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,507
Because you only have one Ho-su.

122
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,135
The one and only in the world.

123
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,727
What are you doing here, honey?

124
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,154
It's all right, Hui-ju.

125
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,166
Go home with Ho-su.

126
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,460
Don't worry.

127
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,128
Why? What are you going to do?

128
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,173
Whatever it is,
there's nothing to gain from avoiding it.

129
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,134
Don't go. Your mother--

130
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,888
What is it? Are there more things
we should be worried about?

131
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,685
No.

132
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,189
Then trust me.
I'm your husband and Ho-su's father.

133
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,298
How did you find out?

134
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,300
Did she call you already?

135
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:02,886
What's this?

136
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,475
What do you think you're doing?

137
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,102
Ho-su is my son.

138
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,940
I'm sure you want to believe that,
so let's check to make sure.

139
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,111
We don't need this test.

140
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,241
Did you already get the test done?

141
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,121
Do you think
I let you marry her for your sake?

142
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,750
When you told me
she was pregnant and the only one for you,

143
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,294
I had already given up on you.

144
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,963
I let you two get married

145
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,383
so that I could raise an heir
to take your place since you were useless.

146
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,927
I put up with you
because I needed a grandson!

147
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,012
Mom, please!

148
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,347
You must've gotten the test for a reason.

149
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,063
Your reactions prove my suspicion right.

150
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,816
I can tell you're hiding something nasty.

151
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,944
I don't care what the results say.
Divorce her!

152
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,700
I'm turning 50 soon.

153
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,580
I don't think I can start over at my age.

154
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,915
If she leaves, I leave too.

155
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,251
-Hey!
-You did the same thing!

156
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,338
Even until his very last breath,

157
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,675
-you didn't let go of Father.
-I hated what he did.

158
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,262
I helped him build everything he had.

159
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,433
That self-pitying man prided himself
on his smarts and was never grateful.

160
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,686
Lowlifes always act like that.

161
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,689
They delude themselves
into thinking they earned it.

162
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,525
You think she's any different?

163
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,737
She's different. I know her.

164
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,614
Don't be so sure.

165
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,741
I thought I knew your father too.

166
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,204
But I was wrong.

167
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,666
I lived with him for 30 years,
but I still didn't know who he was.

168
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,251
I knew nothing about him!

169
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,548
Because of him,
he tarnished my entire life!

170
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,845
Your father made me feel insignificant!

171
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,644
Are you sure…

172
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,023
you won't end up like me?

173
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:58,937
"The scared girl decided to put her heart
in a bottle just for a little while…

174
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,898
because her heart might get hurt."

175
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,819
"When she did, her heart stopped hurting."

176
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:10,323
"But her thoughts about the stars

177
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,326
and her interest
in the ocean disappeared."

178
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,871
"Soon enough,

179
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,624
the girl lost her love and curiosity

180
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,960
for the world."

181
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:17,224
Then trust me.
I'm your husband and Ho-su's father.

182
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:33,031
Be careful of the overhead bins
as the contents may fall out.

183
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,942
I don't think there's any need
to try to remember what's already past.

184
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,487
If you don't remember it,
then it's never happened.

185
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,548
Mr. Lee.

186
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,429
I'll stay here and talk.

187
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:43,393
A line is there for a reason.
Don't cross the line.

188
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,063
I don't follow.

189
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,607
Don't think
I haven't said anything about you

190
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,944
and my sister because I don't know.

191
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,033
She and I might not be that close,

192
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,162
but she'll choose me over you
because if your marriage goes south,

193
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,289
you will practically be a stranger to her.

194
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,501
If you're upset about
what happened to Hui-ju, your mother--

195
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,295
I know. I do.

196
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,592
But that's my business.

197
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,887
So stop meddling in my affairs.

198
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,599
You can go.

199
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,286
Instead of arranging the pieces
at eye level like before,

200
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,374
what do you think about
placing it slightly lower?

201
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,251
I see. That's an original approach.

202
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,754
It's worth trying it out.

203
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:57,550
And I want ample space between the pieces

204
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:02,055
for the visitors to have more time
to appreciate the pieces.

205
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,516
To get a better understanding…

206
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,402
Do you have the results?

207
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,072
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY: 99.999%
AN HYEON-SEONG, FATHER

208
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,907
AN HO-SU, SON

209
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,873
Don't think this makes everything go away.

210
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,376
I saw how you reacted yesterday.

211
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,255
There must be some history
between you and him.

212
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,800
How could anyone

213
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,719
not get flustered
after being accused like that?

214
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:46,975
It seemed Hyeon-seong had already known,
but he just wouldn't talk about it.

215
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:56,443
I wonder what on earth you did
to have him wrapped around your finger.

216
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,656
I won't let this go
just because you two seem okay with it.

217
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,117
Now get out.

218
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,999
DNA PATERNITY TEST RESULTS

219
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,445
I didn't have time for lunch.
So I'm having this instead.

220
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,324
You and Jeong-hwan
will stay here this summer.

221
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,701
Summer is a critical time for Jeong-hwan.

222
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,204
A three-week summer program
will increase his options.

223
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,499
It's just college.
Like your mother said, it's not important.

224
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:56,336
He takes after you and me.
There's no doubt that he's a smart kid.

225
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,255
Studying is not
what Jeong-hwan needs right now.

226
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,008
It's your mother's attention.

227
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,929
But still, he has an interest
he wants to pursue. Why don't we--

228
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,972
Why study how dolphins communicate?

229
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,183
How will that help him
inherit the foundation?

230
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:16,272
You know that my mother loves sons.

231
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,236
She has Hyeon-seong.
She wouldn't consider me.

232
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,697
I'll never see eye to eye with her.

233
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,247
The higher hopes she has for him,
the more betrayed she'll feel.

234
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,916
This is the time to win her over.

235
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,169
We may have to do
whatever she tells us to do,

236
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,631
but shouldn't we, as his parents,
help our son hold the reins?

237
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,262
Have Jeong-hwan
attend med school in Korea.

238
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,348
He has a chance to be a doctor

239
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,726
and the head of a hospital
just like you wanted.

240
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,897
How much longer
will you lose out to your brother?

241
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,900
Who do you think is running this hospital?

242
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,868
Mr. Seo moved up
his return flight to Korea.

243
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,703
He'll be arriving today.

244
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,539
Right before leaving Ireland,

245
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,292
he stopped by Sligo General Hospital.

246
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,010
There's your mom.

247
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,137
-Mom!
-Ho-su.

248
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,930
This is for you, Mom.

249
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,603
This is for me? I wonder what it is.

250
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,147
Is this a vase?

251
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,734
You can put your heart
in the bottle when it hurts, okay?

252
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,739
How did you come up
with such a sweet thought?

253
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,407
That lady read me a book.

254
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,785
"Lady"?

255
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,204
I see. The doctor?

256
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,541
No. The lady who brought me
home on my birthday.

257
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,635
When did she read this book to you?

258
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,553
Yesterday, when I was waiting for you.

259
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,974
Was that lady…

260
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,687
at the hospital yesterday?

261
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,273
Yes. She was with Uncle.

262
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,456
Is it clear to you now
who Ho-su's father is?

263
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,919
You must've had it easy in Ireland.

264
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,090
Using Woo-jae as your nanny
when he had nothing to do with you.

265
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,181
You wanted me to see
how it felt to lose someone precious.

266
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,308
I felt it.

267
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,311
Deeply to my bones.

268
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,815
But that wasn't enough for you.

269
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,651
How dare you drag my son into this again?

270
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,279
Don't even try to make excuses.

271
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,073
Your greed is driving

272
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,409
your crazy, immature actions.

273
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,287
Isn't it exhausting
to deceive people around you?

274
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,288
Not at all.

275
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:24,794
I will choose to lie to protect them
instead of digging the truth to ruin them.

276
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,423
Do you trust your husband?

277
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,759
You think he'll always be this forgiving?

278
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,096
He's a man, after all.

279
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,683
You don't think he can't cheat too?

280
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:45,398
He's way richer and has
more opportunities to cheat than you.

281
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,276
Do you want my husband to leave me now?

282
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,028
Will that make things even?

283
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,780
Why don't you seduce him then?

284
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,784
Even if he does,
I will not give up on my life.

285
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,539
Like you said, my husband has it all.

286
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,876
So he wouldn't be attracted
to a twisted girl like you.

287
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,635
Did you have to do that?

288
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,679
I thought of you as my sister.

289
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,016
I thought you were obsessed with me
because you were lonely as a kid.

290
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,519
Wasn't approaching my kids enough?
How could you approach my husband now?

291
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,396
You must stop.

292
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,609
Goodness. Oh, no. Ms. Jeong.

293
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,360
Get the car ready now.

294
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,904
-Okay.
-Let's go to the hospital.

295
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,917
Last time, I let it slide.
But I can't let this keep happening.

296
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,878
I'm sure you had your reasons.

297
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,215
But only the artists
are allowed to be eccentric here.

298
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,758
However their behavior,

299
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:57,845
we can pass it off
as long as they make good art.

300
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,432
But as their supporters,
we cannot behave the same.

301
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,646
I need you to leave.

302
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,942
I rashly hired you
without knowing your history with her.

303
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,427
If you're here to see me,
please don't from now on.

304
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,470
I got fired.

305
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,013
What?

306
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,724
She might be a good sister to you.

307
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,351
But to me, she's just a bitch.

308
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,565
What? Are you upset
that I called her a bitch?

309
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,290
I knew.

310
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,379
I knew that you were her brother

311
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,381
when I went to you.

312
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,873
Thank you for telling me. And I'm sorry.

313
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,886
I killed a friend.

314
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,533
Hey, if you buy the complete set,
you'll get a free massage.

315
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,910
Please call me.

316
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,414
If you buy the complete set,
you'll get a free massage.

317
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,255
BEAUTY MARY MAKEUP
WE DELIVER NATIONWIDE

318
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,590
Hey.

319
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,677
What took you so long to call me back?

320
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,847
Gosh, no. It wasn't a lot of work.

321
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:51,310
By the way,
I worked really hard this time.

322
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,231
When will I get to see you?

323
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,151
Really? You're coming that day?

324
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,486
Really?

325
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,240
Gosh. I'm not doubting you.

326
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:09,745
Then I should go there
with my clients this time.

327
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,185
When I get old,
I want to be at peace like him.

328
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,107
Your mother hasn't been coming by lately.

329
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,901
She's well, right?

330
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,530
Probably. She's with
one of my old students.

331
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,784
I don't know
who's taking care of whom, though.

332
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,334
Simple and old drinks are the best.

333
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,836
The perfect drink of sweet and bitter.

334
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,342
Yesterday…

335
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,057
he waited a long while for you here.

336
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,058
PHYSICAL THERAPIST JEONG SEON-U

337
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,067
You still haven't made up

338
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,486
with your husband?

339
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,572
I'm still angry at him.

340
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,700
I know marriage is
solely between two people.

341
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,453
But seeing how you're angry,
you must still have feelings.

342
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,830
Not getting angry is more worrisome.

343
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,248
I'm not sure…

344
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,087
if I'm really angry…

345
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,507
or obsessing over him

346
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,968
because I know I'll be pathetic and lonely

347
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,388
if he leaves me.

348
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,271
It's sweet.

349
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,941
Wait. No, It's bitter.

350
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,071
It really is bittersweet.

351
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,543
What happened?

352
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,421
I got a small injury.

353
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,464
How did that happen?

354
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,259
I'm okay. It's just a small cut.

355
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,885
And I needed it.

356
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,307
I saw your mother this afternoon.
She told you, right?

357
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,436
I told you not to worry.
She can be so stubborn.

358
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,564
I'm a bit hungry.

359
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,942
But why…

360
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,735
Yes?

361
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,906
I don't ask why he didn't suspect

362
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,576
Ho-su might not be his.

363
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,330
Want some ramyeon? It's been a while.

364
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,624
Ramyeon?

365
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:03,919
Sounds good.

366
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,609
When did you get back?

367
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,882
You…

368
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,760
remember.

369
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,808
Do you remember calling me?

370
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,727
Hae-won.

371
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,104
I'll tell you everything
once I get there.

372
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,900
I will tell you everything
and apologize to you properly.

373
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,072
It's late.

374
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,116
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

375
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,664
You even went to Ireland.

376
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,000
Don't you have anything to tell me?

377
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,712
I'm going to remember

378
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,298
how I wronged you.

379
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,426
And I'll ask
for your forgiveness until you finally do.

380
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:38,764
It pains me that I can't even remember
what I need to apologize for.

381
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,521
Watching you break down because of me…

382
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,400
is torturous.

383
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,278
You have nothing to say to me?

384
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,428
Several companies showed
interest in your idea, Mr. Seo.

385
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:22,182
And our gallery put this together.

386
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,104
I know it is a commercial ad,
but this will be a great opportunity

387
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,689
to show people your art--

388
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,815
Let's do it.

389
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,277
I will do everything I can.

390
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,487
Great. Shall we then?

391
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,906
Yes.

392
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,505
All right. Look over here. Here we go.

393
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,134
Can you turn your head a bit?

394
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,219
Great. All right. One more time.

395
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,721
Great.

396
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,223
You two look great.

397
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,059
MODEL: SEO WOO-JAE

398
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,143
SIGNING CEREMONY WITH SEO WOO-JAE

399
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,193
Hey, this is starting
to scare me a little.

400
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,529
It's awful your mother-in-law
took his DNA in front of you.

401
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,033
But your husband must've
gotten the test done before that.

402
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,161
But I'm the worst of all.

403
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,997
Even I wasn't sure.

404
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,794
I'm the one who was most relieved
to see the results.

405
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,504
Then

406
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,715
it turned out better.
Now you know for sure.

407
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,178
Anyway, don't trust your husband too much.

408
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,139
He might've been able to let this one go.

409
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,976
But it'll only take a moment
for him to lose his shit.

410
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,145
And people who do that are the scariest.

411
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,107
Hey, I'm getting a call.
I'll call you back later.

412
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,650
Sure.

413
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,362
SEO WOO-JAE

414
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,416
Let's meet.

415
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:26,265
Gosh. How do you take such good care
of yourself? Your figure is perfect.

416
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,561
She works out for over four hours a day.

417
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,937
And massages on top of that.

418
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,696
I heard Mom got something on you.

419
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,868
That's too bad. Once she writes
anyone off, she never changes her mind.

420
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,996
She's never really accepted me anyway.

421
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,541
Nothing will change.

422
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,129
How about you?

423
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,214
Are you all right?

424
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,219
I told you not to be so nosy.

425
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:10,225
That's strange. I definitely measured her
last time she was fitted…

426
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:17,065
Why do you think we make multiple trips
to come here for just one outfit?

427
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:18,817
Pardon?

428
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,529
We're paying you to make the clothes fit,
not the other way around.

429
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:26,241
So keep your mouth shut
and just do your job. Okay?

430
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,995
I'm sorry, ma'am.

431
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,582
We use your service
because we respect you.

432
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,543
Then you should also show us respect.

433
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:40,714
Of course, ma'am.
It's because she's still learning.

434
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,050
Let me apologize on her behalf.
I'm so sorry.

435
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,560
You've been getting calls the whole time.
Who is it? Why not answer it?

436
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,229
I can call back later.

437
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,983
MOM

438
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,618
What is it?

439
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,079
Can you check if it's straight?

440
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,957
-Okay. A bit more.
-Raise it higher.

441
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,792
Can you make it nice and taut?

442
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,335
WELCOME TO TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS

443
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,176
INTENSIVE CLASS FOR INCOMING FIRST YEARS

444
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,974
Coming here after graduating is lame.

445
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,017
Why did you want to see me?

446
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,689
Apologize again.
Your first apology only offended me.

447
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,527
Apologize again!

448
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,322
Did you think you could boss me around?

449
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:52,035
You must've thought I'd let you walk
all over me because of what my dad did.

450
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,039
But I don't care about that.

451
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,584
I'm going to a different school.
I won't see you again.

452
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,962
What if I tell everyone?

453
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,591
Wherever you go,
whoever you become friends with,

454
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,926
I'll tell everyone who you really are

455
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,261
and what your dad did.

456
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,346
Then I'll say why my dad did that.

457
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,474
That your chairman dad
kicked us out of our house

458
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,311
and you always got away
with bullying me thanks to your dad.

459
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,980
Who will they criticize?

460
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,611
Everyone around you is nice to you
because your family is rich.

461
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,239
They like what you have, not who you are.

462
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,285
That was you.
You mooched off me like a leech.

463
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,581
-Think whatever you want.
-Where are you going?

464
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,376
Hey! That hurts!

465
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,714
TAERIM HIGH SCHOOL OF ARTS

466
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,013
Hold on, Ho-su.

467
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:38,767
Right here.

468
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:45,023
Let's take a selfie to remember this day.
How should I do this?

469
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,904
Yes, please…

470
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,324
Here.

471
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,954
Ho-su, he's going to take a photo of us.

472
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,247
Good boy.

473
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,165
Look over there.

474
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,334
Okay. Here.

475
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,054
Your son is beautiful.

476
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:18,014
You're Korean.

477
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,016
Thank you.

478
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,688
Ho-su, let's take a photo.

479
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,356
Look over there.

480
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,151
One, two, three.

481
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:33,155
Thank you. Say, "Thank you."

482
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,160
"Thank you." Right?

483
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,120
All right.

484
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,375
-Mommy is back.
-What were you doing?

485
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,002
-Come to Mommy.
-Here.

486
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,796
There you go. We took a photo.

487
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,553
That's true.

488
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,682
Our lawyer requested
that our foundation help you.

489
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,102
But I was the one who received

490
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:08,482
your status reports when I visited Ireland
to handle some business matters.

491
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,151
Is there a problem?

492
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,695
No. I'm grateful.

493
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,031
I am.

494
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,326
But I'm curious how you found me
and transported me to the hospital.

495
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,621
I couldn't find any incident report.

496
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,045
I heard you're back in Ireland.

497
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,463
I'll wait for you.

498
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,737
Where's Hui-ju?

499
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,322
Hey.

500
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,159
It's nice to see you here.

501
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,247
She and I used to come here often.

502
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,456
Did you know?

503
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,086
She and I are married.
And I only believe what I see myself.

504
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:15,340
You are here alone,
and she's where she belongs.

505
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,512
How can you be sure she belongs with you?

506
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,266
You tied her down with your stupid money.

507
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,519
Neglecting her to fade away in a cage
is what she deserves?

508
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,897
You have no idea

509
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,067
how passionate Hui-ju can be.

510
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,954
You're the one
who has no idea what she's like.

511
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,415
And you don't have to.
So don't talk about her.

512
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,253
There's no way
she fell for someone weak like you.

513
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,130
It was my mistake for coming here.

514
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,051
I was never interested in Hui-ju at first.

515
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,346
But Hae-won wouldn't stop
talking about her.

516
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,018
So it piqued my curiosity.
That's how it started.

517
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:12,355
But it turned out she was nothing
more than just a lonely married woman.

518
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,524
She was easy.

519
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,944
She easily fell for me
after I made some advances.

520
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,322
There was no fun in it.

521
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,995
Were you always such a pathetic loser?

522
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:30,624
Yes. She easily fell for a loser like me.

523
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,710
You think
she'll be faithful to you forever?

524
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,438
Since you're here,
why don't you pay for my drink?

525
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:59,611
I've been enjoying my stay in Ireland
thanks to the money you've been sending.

526
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,442
This isn't…

527
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,808
HUI-JU

528
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,525
Hey.

529
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,611
I've been calling you. Where are you?

530
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,073
I had…

531
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,576
some work left to do.

532
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,996
I was worried.
You disappeared after we checked in.

533
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:00,917
Sorry.

534
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,881
I'll be there soon.

535
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,937
It is my understanding that
my lawyer gave you the incident report.

536
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,608
Yes, I got it.

537
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,736
But it's written in so much detail

538
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,657
that I have the feeling
the most important part was buried.

539
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,619
Buried?

540
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:39,789
Nonsense.

541
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,084
What would we need to bury
about your incident?

542
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,216
Let's set a date.

543
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,220
I'm sure my wife would
like to hear about your trip to Ireland.

544
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,098
Why don't the three of us meet up soon?

545
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,017
Actually, I already called her today.

546
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,853
I'll see you next time.

547
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,244
CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE

548
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,664
What are you doing here?

549
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,417
I needed to ask your dad something.

550
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,961
Ask what? What did you ask him?

551
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,421
Do you read books?

552
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,633
The flower you asked me
about before. The heath.

553
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:35,178
That flower comes up a lot
in a novel called Wuthering Heights.

554
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,471
Give it a read.

555
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,557
What? What is that book about?

556
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,451
Your call could not be connected.
After the tone…

DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

560
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,217
Hello.

561
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,761
Let's try that again.

562
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,054
-Okay.
-Okay.

563
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:24,227
Do you want us to die because
you are afraid of future criticism?

564
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:28,356
What you're talking about right now
requires billions…

565
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:32,151
I did hear that you're a fan of theatre
and even fund them

566
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,070
when I was working at the school.

567
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,364
I guess you really love them.

568
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,910
We should suspend the contract.

569
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,912
The gallery is just a start.

570
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,915
Once I expand the gallery
into an art center…

571
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,627
I plan to set up a theater there too.

572
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,546
Thanks to my wife,

573
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,175
I have a chance
to fulfill my dream at my age.

574
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,219
Any other questions?

575
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:05,143
I remember
when you took the entire faculty

576
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,729
to the opera.

577
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,984
What was it called?

578
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,280
It was about a clown

579
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,283
who had to entertain the audience
while his wife had an affair.

580
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,329
It was your story.

581
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,332
I saw that day

582
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,293
how much pain you were in.

583
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,550
If your limbs were broken or something,

584
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,846
people would have tried
to understand your pain even for a moment.

585
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:48,144
It's very hard to be understood
about pain no one else can see.

586
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,942
Did Mr. Seo…

587
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,323
get his memories back?

588
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,079
You must've met him.

589
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,874
I wanted him to get his memories back.

590
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,503
But his reaction is totally unexpected.

591
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:21,636
It must be even more flustering
for those who have something to hide.

592
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,313
You're really going to sell it?

593
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:33,356
Yes.

594
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,901
I told you.
An ecological park will be built here.

595
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:40,238
They wanted to rid of the cause
of pollution and improve water quality.

596
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:44,367
So they are going to demolish
everything in this area

597
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,285
including fishing spots and docks.

598
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,914
But you know what I did?
I upped the compensation money.

599
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,381
-Who is it?
-My mom.

600
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,092
It must be her superpower.

601
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:05,430
She always calls me
when I'm going through a hard time.

602
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,056
What is it this time?

603
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,851
Exactly. What does she want this time?

604
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,978
I'm not even curious.

605
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:17,024
I'm just worried if I don't answer,
she might call my husband,

606
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,819
and that my mother-in-law

607
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,654
might find out.

608
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,410
I think that must've been why.

609
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,245
What? What do you mean?

610
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:34,208
With Woo-jae, I didn't have
a mother-in-law I had to impress.

611
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:38,671
And I didn't have to
be this good wife or mother.

612
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:44,010
When I was with him, I could be myself,
forget about everything else,

613
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,763
and just do what I wanted to do.

614
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,120
I think I've given you enough time.

615
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,706
So tell me.

616
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,378
Let's break up.

617
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,508
I should have done it a long time ago.

618
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:25,885
But I was a coward.

619
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:27,929
I'm sorry.

620
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,306
You're sorry?

621
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,433
Yes.

622
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:38,439
So your memories really came back.
You haven't changed at all.

623
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,526
You're not sorry at all.

624
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,444
You already forgave yourself.

625
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,988
That's why you're shamelessly telling me

626
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,950
you want to break up
before apologizing to me.

627
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,159
Break up with me.

628
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,996
If you don't, I'll abandon you again.

629
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:57,041
Again?

630
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:01,462
What? Do you think you have a shot
with Hui-ju if you break up with me?

631
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,672
I'll make it so.

632
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,675
I'll be the man she deserves

633
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,969
and make her come back to me.

634
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:11,264
You're sick, Woo-jae. You're an addict.

635
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,058
Alcohol and drugs
aren't the only addictions.

636
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,601
You get addicted to people too.

637
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,771
You know that you're
hurting others and ruining your life,

638
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,482
but you can't let go or escape.

639
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,068
That's an addiction.

640
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,653
Are you any different?

641
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:30,324
Can't you see how messed up you've become?

642
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,121
Right.

643
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,457
I became addicted
to Hui-ju along with you.

644
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:43,713
That's why you and I can
never escape each other.

645
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,143
Who is it? Why don't you answer?

646
01:04:57,226 --> 01:05:00,187
It's my mom.
She's been calling me all day.

647
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,772
Her restaurant opens this week.

648
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,691
Is it about the restaurant?

649
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:06,277
No, it's nothing.
I already talked to her once earlier.

650
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,280
-You should still answer it.
-Don't.

651
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:13,743
She must be feeling what I felt waiting
for her to call when she left home.

Don't. Don't leave.

662
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,121
I told you.

663
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,331
I forgive you. Don't leave me.

664
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,334
I…

665
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,254
I told you.

666
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:52,133
I told you I love you.

667
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:20,870
That's so sudden.

668
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,414
Actually, it's not so sudden.

669
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:28,419
Mr. Woo is quite old.
His illness must have worsened.

670
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:32,048
And I think he always knew how bad it was.

671
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,550
He probably thought
this would be his last project,

672
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,969
so he was especially
attached to this project.

673
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,639
Then we should make it special for him.

674
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:44,351
So I was wondering if it would be okay

675
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:48,230
to display his old pieces
at this exhibition.

676
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,901
They're a part
of Korean architectural history.

677
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,944
Designs are also artwork.

678
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,072
The models are amazing too.

679
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,617
Instead of simply exhibiting his work,

680
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,495
can we do something special with them?

681
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:06,290
I will have to see them
in person to get inspired.

682
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:10,336
Mr. Woo already donated them to us,
so I already brought them here.

683
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,217
Goodness. I told them to organize these.

684
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,054
-Excuse me for a moment.
-Okay.

685
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:24,517
Yes. Actually, I was going to call you.

686
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,143
Thank you for calling me first.

688

Don't avoid me.

689
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:52,336
I don't care if you're married.

690
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,757
I never cared about that then,
and I still don't.

691
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:00,052
You're good at it.

692
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:03,472
You can have a marriage with him

693
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,183
and be in love with me.

694
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,399
You…

695
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:20,656
Ms. Jeong?

696
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,748
Goodness, Mr. Seo. You came really early.

697
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,417
I wanted to see the artwork beforehand.

698
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:35,254
Where's Ms. Jeong?

699
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,590
You didn't see her? She was just here.

700
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,427
Ms. Jeong?

701
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:03,032
Answer me. You didn't give me your answer.

702
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,493
What answer?

703
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:08,495
Go out with me.

704
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:09,538
Why would I?

705
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:11,999
Have you gone mad?

706
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:16,462
Then why did you see me back then?

707
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,089
Out of loneliness?

708
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,928
Out of boredom? For fun?

709
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:28,557
Yes! And I don't want this now.

710
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:35,481
What brings you here?
Why didn't you call me you were coming?

711
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,193
I thought you wouldn't answer it.

712
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:42,696
-What are you talking--
-Let's go. We'll talk on the way.

713
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:46,283
I'll call you again, Ms. Jeong.

714
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,078
Sure.

715
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,560
SEATS AVAILABLE UPSTAIRS
OPEN 24 HOURS

716
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,906
My son-in-law is the chairman of a school.

717
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,324
-Gosh.
-The chairman.

718
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:28,701
-Gosh.
-You must be so happy.

719
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,828
-Please enjoy.
-Sure.

720
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:33,080
-Come often. She's my mother-in-law.
-Thank you.

721
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,334
It's only once or twice a year. I'm fine.

722
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,921
I called her because
I was concerned. I did.

723
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:44,008
She doesn't appreciate your efforts.

724
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,343
Don't be nice to my mom.

725
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,098
But you're good to my mom.

726
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,392
That's different.

727
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:55,227
How is it different?

728
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:03,819
Earlier today,

729
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:07,990
we had a last-minute meeting

730
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:11,201
because the architect on our project
had suddenly fallen ill.

731
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,203
Don't get the wrong idea.

732
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,332
I won't.

733
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:22,129
The look on your face told me
that you were uncomfortable around him.

734
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:27,509
Your mother put
a lot of effort into this restaurant.

735
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:31,305
She handpicked all the dishes on the menu.
And she's taking care of everything.

736
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,266
She's working really hard.

737
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,019
It's nice to support her when she is.

738
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,647
I hope it works out.

739
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,901
This act of kindness isn't for her.

740
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,616
Can you please play with me?

741
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,034
How should I play with you?

742
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,953
Ho-su, it's time to go to bed now.

743
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:57,414
You have a lot of work. Go.

744
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,541
-I'll tuck him in.
-Thank you.

745
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,211
What do you say? Should I tuck you in?

746
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,215
He is…

747
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:08,926
showing me

748
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:13,555
my weaknesses one by one.

749
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,231
I don't care if you're married.

750
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:25,025
I never cared about that then,
and I still don't.

751
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,985
You're good at it.

752
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:30,531
You can have a marriage with him

753
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:33,409
and be in love with me.

754
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:53,637
SEO WOO-JAE

755
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:11,405
Did you call me here,
so I can watch you throw a fit?

756
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,325
I don't know what people want.

757
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,457
I must do it even if I have to fake it.

758
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,543
But this is…

759
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:32,509
Don't go.

760
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,636
I'm trying.

761
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,889
Can't you just put up with me…

762
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:40,350
even if I throw a fit?

763
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:47,107
Mr. Seo. Listen carefully.

764
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,652
I came here to give you my answer
because I didn't want

765
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,779
the lack of my answer to mislead you.

766
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,159
Once this project is over,

767
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:59,536
you and I are colleagues
who will never meet again.

768
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:01,872
That's all.

769
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:08,253
You have

770
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,006
my answer now. All right?

771
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,817
This was a present from you.

772
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,655
You took everything, but not this.

773
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:43,413
You shouldn't have left without giving me
a chance to make it work.

774
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,228
I'll do better this time.

775
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:10,023
Give me a chance.

776
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:23,954
Do you remember what you told me?

777
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,457
You said

778
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:32,212
a broken marriage wasn't something
you could piece back together.

779
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,051
Come back

780
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,137
to me.

781
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:45,684
Love me like you did back then.

782
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,770
You can throw me away again.

783
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,398
That's my burden to bear.

784
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,526
I'll endure the broken heart.

785
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:00,157
So just love me now.

786
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,137
I won't let you run off this time.

787
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,015
I'm going to get back everything

788
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:27,851
that I lost.

789
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,023
When will you stop clinging to the past?

790
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:16,566
Don't long for it.

791
01:18:18,276 --> 01:18:20,028
Who are you to judge my feelings?

792
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,072
I haven't even started yet.

793
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:25,742
Take good care of her.
She seems to be struggling lately.

794
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,035
I'm not her husband anymore.

795
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,080
So what makes you so different?

796
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:32,124
You enjoyed it while knowing his feelings.

797
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:33,709
You're just a cheater.

798
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,377
Hui-ju doesn't want you back.

799
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,213
What have you done to him?

800
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:39,798
He's a man, after all.

801
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,092
Then choose.

802
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:45,470
Is it your family or that bastard?

803
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,430
Let me go!

804
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:49,307
I will kill anyone

805
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:52,477
who dares to harm you.

806
01:18:55,564 --> 01:19:00,569
