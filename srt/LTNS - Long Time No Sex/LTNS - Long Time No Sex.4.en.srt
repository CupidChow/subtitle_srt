181
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,650
You better get yourself together.

182
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,540
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,160
Should we just leave?

184
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,470
She'll break all our bones
if we mess with her the wrong way.

185
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,590
Don't worry. She's not the one we'll mess with.

186
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,070
What if she comes for revenge?

187
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,020
How can I help you?

188
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,700
Are you trying to apply?

189
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,060
We're still deciding.

190
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,500
Would I be able to do that, too?

191
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,950
Aigoo, of course. Come inside and talk.

192
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,120
Yes, we'll give it some more thought.

193
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,300
This church is a parking lot for expensive cars.

194
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,400
- I'll go ahead. Park and come inside.
- O-Okay.

195
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,260
He wants us to start anew.

196
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,420
Every end is a new beginning.

197
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,270
Some people are clumsy in putting an end, and

198
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,510
some people are clumsy on starting anew.

199
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,650
If you can't do it, you need to learn.

200
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,580
Where can you learn it, though?

201
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,200
God's people like us must find
the answer in the Bible.

202
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,990
Who is our God?

203
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,450
He's the alpha and the omega,
the beginning and the end.

204
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:08,240
You can put an end to things
and start anew when God is with you.

205
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,880
We're sure to face more hardships in the future.

206
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,700
However, we must have faith
that God is always by our side.

207
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,330
Don't give up your hope,
for God will be by our side.

208
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,400
God clearly made a promise to Jacob.

209
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,380
"For I am with you."

210
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,990
When God is with you, you find joy in hardship,
regardless of what happens to you.

211
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,230
She should've gone before coming in.

212
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,840
It means our lives are pieces of work that God is working on.

213
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,230
Turn your lives into the most beautiful things for God to see...

214
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,590
- Hey, come outside.
- as we strive for holiness...

215
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,560
This is stalking. You know that, right?

216
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,120
I came to pray.

217
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,020
Why did you come all the way here?

218
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,130
Didn't you miss me?

219
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,640
I didn't know I'd end up like this again because of you.

220
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,280
I should've just ignored it when you contacted me.

221
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,280
You should've.

222
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,150
I guess I shouldn't have met you again.

223
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,080
I think my illness came back these days.

224
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,060
I can't focus on work,

225
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,020
I can't sleep at night,

226
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,010
and I can't really eat.

227
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,550
I thought I would fall apart and die at this rate.

228
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,580
That's why I came.

229
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,140
Me, too.

230
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,790
I also can't really eat these days.

231
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,920
I want to kiss you.

232
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,190
We're in church.

233
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,870
Can I hug you, then?

234
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,480
Don't leave me again. I'll do better.

235
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,990
What? What is it?

236
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,940
You can't really see them from outside.

237
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,700
Did you record their voice?

238
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,330
I did, but you can't really hear them.

239
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,860
Gosh, this couple's really hard.

240
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,730
- We can't secure evidence.
- Okay.

241
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,550
Let's go outside and wait, okay?

242
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay.

243
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,320
Let's go.

244
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,550
Oh, they came out.

245
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,920
- You want a bite?
- Hey, hey.

246
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,830
Mother-in-Law.

247
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,540
Father-in-Law.

248
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,960
Husband.

249
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,910
- Peace be with you.
- How harmonious.

250
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,890
A harmonious family.

251
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,850
They're getting in the car. Follow me!

252
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,350
Looks like she lives with her parents-in-law.

253
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,970
No way.

254
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,840
It must be tough.

255
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,150
Let's go, let's go, come on!

256
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,410
No, no, no!

257
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,950
Gosh, it closed.

258
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,880
What do we do? Huh?

259
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,220
- I'll take it from here.
- Wait.

260
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,700
Hey!

261
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,660
Will you be okay?

262
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,450
Aigoo, good job.

263
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,770
Aigoo, let's go inside.

264
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,110
- Aren't you hungry?
- What are you doing? Let's go.

265
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,490
There was so much traffic.

266
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,110
Let's go eat lunch.

267
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,430
Yes.

268
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,670
- You can press it.
- Going up.

269
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,230
34th, 38th floor.

270
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,860
39th floor.

271
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,450
We'll just have dinner at home.

272
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,620
Sure.

273
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,940
Just don't regret you missed out on something delicious.

274
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,530
34th floor.

275
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,830
The doors are opening.

276
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,160
- Bye now.
- Please take care.

277
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,510
Yes, good job today.

278
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,320
Oh, right. Darling.

279
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,640
- You know the thing on Saturday, right?
- Yes.

280
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,800
- Don't forget it.
- Yes.

281
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,390
The doors are closing.

282
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,030
38th floor.

283
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,200
The doors are opening.

284
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,500
The doors are open.

285
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,940
The doors are closing.

[Congratulations on the union of two families]

287
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,540
Why does she run a workshop when they're rich?

288
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,940
Wouldn't it be a hobby?

289
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,910
That's one expensive hobby.

290
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,920
How much would the maintenance cost?

291
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,090
They might own the building.

292
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,070
We're a couple this time.

293
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,460
Sure thing.

294
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,230
Get closer.

295
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,130
Come here.

296
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,570
Babe.

297
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,630
[Faith cuts through different neighborhoods]

298
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:57,220
Mom, Mom. He's here.

299
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,660
Yeah?

300
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,670
Aigoo.

301
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,210
My goodness.

302
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,010
Not all luxuries are the same, right?

303
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,570
I could really see the effort behind each one.

304
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,300
But didn't we agree to make it simple?

305
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,060
This is too much pressure on us.

306
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,770
This is the simplest I can make.

307
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,050
I barely stopped them from wanting to give more.

308
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,570
I'm thankful, but...

309
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,930
Hey, Sweetheart.

310
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,910
Aigoo, your mother must've had a tough time preparing all this.

311
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,310
My mother loves making these things.

312
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,160
It's not much, but it's to show our sincerity.

313
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,030
Take them and give them out to your elders and friends, please.

314
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,600
Whoa, they look really classy.

315
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,320
They're handmade soaps my daughter-in-law made.

316
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,160
She only uses the most premium ingredients.

317
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,580
We can't use store-bought soaps anymore.

318
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,410
Whoa, you're really talented, Sister-in-Law.

319
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,370
Thank you.

320
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,920
Does she want to bring it on or something?

321
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,860
After sending over all that, she'll try to control
you, telling you to have a baby and whatnot.

322
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,450
Like you did, Mom?

323
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,480
Listen to you.

324
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Your oppa is a doctor.

325
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,560
It's set by law to marry off a doctor only in exchange for three keys.*
(Keys to house, car, clinic as dowry, and not literally a law but expected)

326
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm more modern, so I only received 300 million won.

327
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,980
300 million won? Whoa.

328
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,590
We're going to send 100 million won this time, right?

329
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,960
Well, you have a PhD, and he's a nurse.

330
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,610
A doctor and a nurse aren't even a match.

331
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,240
Still, they wouldn't do what you did since
I'd be a daughter-in-law with a doctorate.

332
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,850
Oh, my, do you hear what you're saying?

333
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,060
Korea's in-laws have no problem ordering around,
even those with doctorates from New York.

334
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,390
What do I do, then?

335
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,260
One second.

336
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,440
Here.

337
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,690
- This will do.
- What's that?

338
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,820
Is this gold?

339
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,470
Why do you have gold in your fridge?

340
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,370
Even if a thief breaks in,
would they think to check the fridge?

341
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,330
That's true. You're really something else, Mom.

342
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,710
Where'd you get this gold?

343
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,860
It's the wedding favor from your sister-in-law's
family when your oppa got married.

344
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,010
You want to rob Peter to pay Paul?

345
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,530
That's what everyone does these days.

346
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,520
Hey.

347
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,920
Look at their butts, see?

348
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,080
They're all plump and cute, right?

349
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,560
This is 375g of gold.

350
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,090
375g? How much is 375g?

351
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,810
It's enough for a domestic midsized sedan.

352
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,520
Whoa.

353
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,080
Mom, you really robbed the heck out of Sister-in-Law, huh?

354
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,840
Do you even know how much
it costs to raise a child these days?

355
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,420
It even costs more to raise one into a doctor.

How is it? Is it hitting?

381
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,980
I can't tell.

382

385
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,750
None of your business.

386
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,860
I went through so much to get it to make you happy.

387
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,530

That's why I hit you up.

What the hell? Did you miss me?

534
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,590
What's this?

535
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,170
You don't know?

536
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,500
This is a picture of us.

537
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,940
What the f*** is this?

538
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,360
[At 11 p.m. on Friday, September 8th, leave 40 million won in cash in the motorcycle without a license plate in front of your lover's home.]

539
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,730
Hey, don't worry. I'll find and kill these f***ers.

540
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,000
- Anyone come to mind?
- There is.

541
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,340
I do.

542
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,850
You.

543
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,160
Me?

544
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,600
- You're kidding, right?
- I came to check whether it was you.

545
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,000
Man, that's too much.

546
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,800
- How can you even think that?
- It's a reasonable suspicion.

547
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,400
I've done quite a number on you all this time.
And you need money, too.

548
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,710
You gave me that that day to f*** me over, right?

549
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,530
How can you say that?

550
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,750
True, like you'd say you did it even if you're the one.

551
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,740
F***, how can you suspect me even if you're in shock?

552
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,270
Of all people, you?

553
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,130
Whether it's you or not, let's call it quits with this.

554
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,810
Gosh, I said it's not me!

555
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,580
I'll catch these f***ers and prove it.

556
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,250
Whether we break up or not,
I'm about to f***ing lose it from the absurdity.

557
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,730
Get out.

558
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,170
Hey, I'm going to catch them and prove it.

559
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,090
You better wait.

560
00:39:53,500 --> 00:40:00,880
♫ To the millions that are lying in darkness ♫

561
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,430
♫ Carry the bright gospel ray ♫

562
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,250
♫ Heralds of light, speed away ♫

563
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,760
♫ Carry the bright gospel ray ♫

564
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,530
♫ Dark the night of sin, let the sunlight in ♫

565
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,980
♫ Heralds of light, speed away ♫

566
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,890
♫ As you labor for the Lord He is with you ♫

567
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,030
♫ Walks by your side day by day ♫

568
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,500

♫ Dark the night of sin, let the sunlight in ♫

00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:49,240
♫ Heralds of light, speed away ♫

574
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,430
I got it!

575
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,870
- Go!
- Okay. Go.

576
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,290
- Samuel!
- Yeah?

577
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,510
I think we got it this time! It's heavy!

578
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,620
- It's heavy?
- Yes, it's quite the haul!

579
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,320
Let's go and check!

580
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,890
Whoa, this really worked again!

581
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,070
Woo Jin, I'm feeling great!

582
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,750
Huh? What's this?

583
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,670
We're f***ed. Cho Won is after us.

584
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,040
What?

585
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,080
Why's she here?

586
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,750
Hold on tight!

587
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,390
What are you going to do?

588
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,010
Lose her!

589
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,750
She's still onto us!

590
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,260
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

591
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,850
You're not hurt, right?

592
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,270
Get in for now. Come on!

593
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,360
- Where? Go in where?
- Whoa!

594
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,960
Hello.

595
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:13,770
- Lean back, lean back.
- Lean back?

596
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,660
Wait, lean back? W-Who are you?

597
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,510
Hello, sir.

598
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,990
Who are you two?

599
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,170
Are you self-harming insurance frauds or something?

600
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,560
No, we didn't get hurt. We're fine.

601
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,750
- You didn't get hurt?
- No.

602
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,380
Aigoo, I'm glad.

603
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,580
We're not hurt, but your car's a bit damaged, sir.

604
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,080
S-So I was wondering if we could talk.

605
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,850
That's bad. That can't happen.

606
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,650
- She's coming.
- Should we get off and look?

607
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,200
- A-Ahjussi, wait-
- Should we talk at a bodyshop?

608
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,300
It was only a small scratch.

609
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,400
I'm not the owner of this car.

610
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,300
This car is my CEO's car.

611
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,030
- Who's this now?
- Sir, do you have a business card?

612
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,650
If you give me your business card, I'll fix it like it's new.

613
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,360
I don't have a business card yet.

614
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,350
Isn't it too narrowminded to think
everyone in this world has a business card?

615
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,540
- My bad.
- Do you have a pen?

616
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,870
On my hand.

617
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:07,940
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

618
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,310
- Thank you.
- I see you.

619
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,480
I'll open the door, so let's run together.

620
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,990
- Take care.
- Thank you, sir.

621
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,720
Hey!

622
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,130
Huh?

623
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:20,740
- Yoo-hoo!
- Hey! Shit!

624
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,850
These motherf***ers!

625
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,180
Huh?

626
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,180
Engine, start! Hurry!

627
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,540
Hurry!

628
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,500
Geez. Where did these f***ing rats go?

629
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,000
You're f***ing dead!

630
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,300
Hey!

631
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,660
Stop there!

632
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,670
- Don't come!
- Pull over!

633
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,120
F***!

634
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,220
Hey.

635
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,940
Don't come, don't come!

636
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,590
Hey, look in front of you!

637
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,590
Gosh, I told him to look ahead. What a f***ing idiot.

638
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,170
Shit...

639
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,780
What's this? Why the f*** is it empty?

640
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,280
Damn it!

641
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,900
Shit!

642
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,640
You're dead, you f***ing bitch.

643
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,020
Excuse me.

644
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,410
Are you okay?

645
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,920
Hello.

646
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,680
Hello.

647
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,810
I'm okay, sir.

648
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:31,230
- Y-You're...
- Let's go.

649
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,540
the one from earlier, right?

650
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,950
The bag.

651
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:39,110
Are you injured or what?

652
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,550
I'm sorry, sir.

653
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:49,860
Don't you need to go to the hospital?

654
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,400
Where is he?

655
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,150
The customer is not answering the phone.

656
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:15,400
After the beep, you'll be connected to the voicemail-

657
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,870
F***!

658
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:39,700
What the f*** are you going to do, huh?

659
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,300
- I'll beat you up.
- What?

660
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,470
Hey, you f***ing nutcase.

661
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,420
How the f*** are you this strong?

662
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,250
- It's only the beginning. Clench your teeth.
- F***-

663
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,600
F***-

664
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,740
Hold on.

665
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,120
One second.

666
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,080
Gosh, hold on for what?

667
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,210
Wait, hold on!

668
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,920
I'm really sorry-

669
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,780
Hold on-

670
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,630
One second, please-

671
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,200
It hurts too much.

672
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,830
It hurts? You need to be hurt.

673
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:31,700
Could you stop hitting me and talk this out?

674
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,890
- Talk?
- It hurts too much.

675
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,170
You want me to talk to you?

676
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,890
I'm really sorry.

677
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,880
I'll give back everything.

678
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,180
Please stop hitting me.

679
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,130
Okay, give it back.

680
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:49,420
Here.

681
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,450
It hurts.

682
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:12,010
Gosh, this cheeky little... shit...

683
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:21,170
Soo Ji, I caught the f***ers who blackmailed you.

684
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,730
I told you it wasn't me.

685
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,750
I got the geese back, too.

686
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,330
Don't worry now.

687
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,130
Just let those people go.

688
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,980
And let them keep the bag, too.

689
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,610
No, I'm going to kill these f***ers.

690
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,820
Do you know what's inside the bag?

691
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,430
It's 375g of gold right there.

692
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,700
It's what my dad gave my in-laws when I got married.

693
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,220
But they...

694
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,840
almost ended up at a funny place.

695
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,320
So, I just gave them to those people.

696
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,180
So, why would you give these people such a valuable thing?

697
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,490
I paid for my wrongdoing for having an affair.

698
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:06,200
And my in-laws also need to pay for their wrongdoing.

699
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,060
Just consider we're all paying for the consequences.

700
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,790
What are you saying?

701
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,700
I'm sorry for suspecting you.

702
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,140
I'm also sorry for giving you a hard time.

703
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,530
No, I can't...

704
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,750
I can't break up with you.

705
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,360
Cho Won.

706
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,160
Let's start dating for real now.

707
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,260
What?

708
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,360
If this is a bad thing to do,

709
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,100

He lost a lot of blood, so we were worried.

But his CT scan came back normal.

Welcome.

my eyes are the scale. I can tell this is 375g.

375g?

746
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,020
375g of gold would be...

747
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,700
about 28 million won...

748
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,760
in the current market price.

- No.

If I add the bag...

753
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,920
it'd be at least 40 million won.
