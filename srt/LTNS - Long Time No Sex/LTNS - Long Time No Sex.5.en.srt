00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:44,857
Well...

184
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,827
I'm asking because I'm curious,

185
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:51,167
but may I ask why you keep asking about the horsepower?

186
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:53,627
Well, can't I?

187
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:55,857
Aren't cars about horsepower?

188
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,187
Well, yes, cars are about horsepower, but

189
00:18:58,187 --> 00:19:03,667
people usually don't ask about horsepower
at a rental car company.

190
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,527
It looks like it has plenty of power.

191
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,697
You can outrace almost any car with this, right?

192
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:11,927
Yes, ma'am. Well, pretty much all cars.
It's quite powerful.

193
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:14,267
You have a good eye for cars.

194
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,887
I'll change to this car.

195
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:44,757
[Seoul - Vacant]

196
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,487
What do you mean, no?

197
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:12,287
You see.

198
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:13,357
It is nice.

199
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:15,657
Am I unappealing if I don't have that? Let's go for it.

200
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:18,987
- No, don't you ever buy an imported car.
- Am I unappealing if I don't?

201
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,277
I said no!

202
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:24,327
Gosh, it's fun.

203
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:29,477
Should I buy a car?

204
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:30,597
A car.

205
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,857
It's nice if you have a car.

206
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,367
I...

207
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:40,647
thought about buying a car if I got a girlfriend.

208
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:43,177
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

209
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:45,567
Do you think you will need a car soon?

210
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:51,317
I don't know. I'm not sure yet. Well...

211
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:54,677
Should I buy one or not?

212
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:58,397
That's up to you. You do what you want.

213
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:11,987
Woo Jin, what was your ex-boyfriend like?

214
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:17,167
He was just an ordinary guy who cheated on me often.

215
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:23,687
Woo Jin, I sincerely...

216
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:26,357
want to help you heal

217
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:29,977
from all your past wounds.

218
00:21:30,727 --> 00:21:32,437
I mean it.

219
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:37,227
Can I really trust you?

220
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:38,477
Yeah.

221
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:40,577
You can.

222
00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:42,937
Think about it carefully before you answer me.

223
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:45,327
I actually tend to get hurt quite easily.

224
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:48,347
I am answering you after thinking about it carefully.

225
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:55,257
Can I trust you, too?

226
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:58,437
Yeah.

227
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:02,357
Then from now, let's be honest with each other.

228
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:04,887
- If our feelings have changed, let's just say so.
- Okay.

229
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:08,327
Then, as long as those words aren't spoken,

230
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,277
we can both be at ease.

231
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,697
Sounds good. I'll tell you everything!
All of it, whatever it may be.

232
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:16,427
I'm going to buy a car, then.

233
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:18,717
Nice.

234
00:22:20,397 --> 00:22:23,117
- Let's get in the taxi.
- Oh, it came?

235
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:24,857
I'll get in first.

236
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:55,527
Could you take off your jacket for me? It's cold.

237
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:57,047
You're cold?

238
00:23:06,227 --> 00:23:08,207
Cover yourself so you're warm.

239
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:09,787
Let's use it together.

240
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:11,287
Together?

241
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:29,787
Customer, customer.

242
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:32,587
We're here. Please get up. We're here.

243
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:39,837
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

244
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:33,027
Yeah?

245
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:34,207
Are you busy?

246
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,897
What?

247
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:37,647
I'm working.

248
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:38,967
How late are you going to work?

249
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,287
Well...

250
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:42,887
I'll work for another two hours.

251
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:46,587
Don't pick up annoying customers.

252
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,657
That's not something I can control.

253
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:51,347
Make sure to eat something.

254
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:54,347
Okay. Are you at the hotel right now?

255
00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:56,087
Yeah, it's a bit busy.

256
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,917
We're both working hard, I see.

257
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:00,427
Good luck.

258
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:23,387
Ma'am.

259
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:24,947
Ma'am?

260
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:27,707
I'm Officer Park Hyung Jin of Songpa Police.

261
00:26:27,707 --> 00:26:30,477
You can't park here. Please move your vehicle.

262
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,917
Can I move it a bit later? I have an urgent emergency.

263
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:37,037
You can't. Please move your vehicle.

264
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:41,067
I'll move it in 10 minutes, so just give me a ticket.

265
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:44,157
I was going to let you off with a warning,
but if that is what you want...

266
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:45,847
Yeah, just give me the ticket.

267
00:26:46,497 --> 00:26:49,837
I will penalize you for illegal parking
on September 27th at 21:10.

268
00:26:49,837 --> 00:26:51,547
Do you agree to this?

269
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:53,307
Yes, I agree.

270
00:26:54,017 --> 00:26:55,627
Ma'am, you have to move your car right away.

271
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:58,707
Okay. Have a nice day.

272
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:08,167
Wow, it's been a long time since I heard this song.

273
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,587
We will continue after listening to a requested song.

274
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,627
[1 year ago]

275
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:07,377
Excuse me...

276
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:09,827
Excuse me.

277
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:11,977
Sorry?

278
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:14,047
Yes?

279
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:21,107
The thing is, I'm all out of wheel cleaner.

280
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:26,517
I'm really sorry, but could I just pay you
a small fee and borrow it for a moment?

281
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:28,817
Oh, yes, I do have a wheel cleaner.

282
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:32,717
How much should I pay you to borrow it?

283
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:35,557
Gosh, no. Just use it and return it to me when you leave.

284
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:38,957
Oh, no, no. Then I'd feel too bad.

285
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:43,747
It's okay. I totally understand how this
can happen as someone washing their car.

286
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:47,877
You're so generous.

287
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:51,567
All right.

288
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,577
I'll help you.

289
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:09,087
Oh, no, no. It's all right.

290
00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:10,327
Let's go.

291
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:14,627
Well, gosh, it's really all right...

292
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:18,577
Oh, thank you.

293
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:29,297
Joon Ho started crying and said he would quit.

294
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:31,937
- Yeah.
- He doesn't know how valuable his job is.

295
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,637
I know, right?

296
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:36,277
In any case, I gave him a scolding.

297
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,817
Oh, hello.

298
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:17,847
I was just grateful for letting me borrow this last time.

299
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:18,957
You didn't have to...

300
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:21,287
It was a two-for-one sale.

301
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:24,317
Please take it. I should repay you for your kindness.

302
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:27,967
Thank you, I'll use it well.

303
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:32,777
- Hello.
- Hello.

304
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:35,067
By chance, do you like beer?

305
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,427
Pardon?

306
00:30:38,777 --> 00:30:40,367
Hello!

307
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:42,893
- I brought this for you.
- Again?

308
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:44,697
It's nothing.

309
00:30:44,697 --> 00:30:47,017
Just sharing things as neighbors.

310
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:52,437
It would be rude to keep saying no when you
keep offering. So I'll gratefully accept it.

311
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:56,547
Gosh, I should give you something, too...

312
00:30:57,827 --> 00:31:01,097
If it's okay with you, would you like to come inside for a moment?

313
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:03,207
Will that be all right?

314
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:23,367
Wow, how do you cut watermelon like this?

315
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:24,867
You're so good.

316
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:28,867
Aigoo, I just tried to copy what a blogger did.

317
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:33,247
My husband only eats fruit when it's cut for him.

318
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:36,227
My wife only eats fruit when it's cut for her, too.

319
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,417
Please eat.

320
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,217
I really like watermelon,

321
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:48,117
but I'm home by myself mostly
because we are a weekend couple.

322
00:31:48,117 --> 00:31:50,027
So, a whole watermelon is too much for me.

323
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:52,317
Oh, you're a weekend couple, I see.

324
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:55,017
I really like watermelon, too,
but since it's just the two of us,

325
00:31:55,017 --> 00:31:57,407
we don't really buy a watermelon.

326
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:59,527
I get to eat it, thanks to you.

327
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:04,332
What is your name? We're neighbors, after all.

328
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:07,857
Oh, me? I am...

329
00:32:07,857 --> 00:32:08,896
Min Soo.

330
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:11,721
Oh, it's Min Soo, I see. I am Samuel.

331
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,121
- Muel, I see.
- Yes.

332
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:27,567
There's no bad smell in your house, Muel.

333
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:29,867
It's so strange. You live right next door.

334
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:33,087
It drives me crazy because a foul odor
comes up from the drain in my house.

335
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:38,787
I did a lot of research because our building is old and has a foul odor.

336
00:32:38,787 --> 00:32:40,837
So, I think I found a solution.

337
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:42,507
Oh, really?

338
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:43,647
How?

339
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:45,067
Gosh, this is...

340
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:48,307
it's a bit hard to explain with words.

341
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:53,307
Should I go and fix it for you?
It'll only take a moment.

342
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:57,647
I think it's because the odor prevention cap is loose on the hose.

343
00:32:57,647 --> 00:33:00,607
If you tighten this...

344
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:02,787
tighten it well...

345
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:05,517
there should be less odor.

346
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:12,617
By the way, your house is so clean.

347
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:18,207
I noticed that your bathroom was really clean, too.
Do you have a cleaning tip?

348
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,167
Oh, right...

349
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:22,447
What if...

350
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:26,977
we help each other with cleaning?

351
00:33:26,977 --> 00:33:29,777
We can share tips and information

352
00:33:29,777 --> 00:33:32,807
and go to your house one week, and my house another week.

353
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:38,387
If we take turns like this to help each other,
it would be less of a burden for both of us.

354
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:44,597
Cleaning mates...

355
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:48,207
With this concept?

356
00:35:36,797 --> 00:35:38,847
Honey!

357
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:41,197
What? You want me to help you change?

358
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:45,657
The blankets are so crisp!

359
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:47,037
Really?

360
00:35:49,377 --> 00:35:51,397
It's so nice.

361
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:58,587
Wow, the bookcases are set up like a library.

362
00:35:58,587 --> 00:36:00,967
It's amazing.

363
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:03,417
Are you a cleaning genius or something?

364
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,037
Amazing as usual.

365
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:24,157
What are you doing here on a weekday?

366
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,407
Look! Surprise!

367
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:30,967
What are you doing right now?

368
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:33,757
Oh, you really were surprised.

369
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:36,887
I came because I missed you.

370
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,447
Is it wrong to come to my own house?

371
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:40,787
- W-Wait.
- What?

372
00:37:40,787 --> 00:37:43,887
Your bag. Give me your bag.

373
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,697
Gosh, it's so hot.

374
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:49,147
- W-Wait! Y-Your socks, your socks are...
- What about my socks?

375
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:51,077
Well, it looks like there is a hole in it.

376
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:53,417
- Let me see your foot.
- I bought these yesterday, though.

377
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,457
It was just the design.

378
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:59,147
Just take these socks off.

379
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:05,137
But really. What brings you here?

380
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:08,127
You're nearing the end of your fertile window.

381
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:09,787
So I thought...

382
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,987
I needed to put in more effort.

383
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:14,607
I took a half-day today to come.

384
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:16,287
All right.

385
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:23,287
Aigoo.

386
00:38:32,347 --> 00:38:34,177
Then...

387
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:37,067
are you going back today?

388
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:40,647
Yeah. I gathered my sperm for the past several days.

389
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:45,967
What are you, an inseminating machine?

390
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:47,677
Why are you so cold like that?

391
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:51,647
I should see your face and talk if I want to
get to the inseminating point. It's all good.

392
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:55,667
Okay. Then, should I prepare your medicine?

393
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,857
Should we try doing it without taking medicine today?

394
00:38:57,857 --> 00:38:59,807
With this tiger energy?

395
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:03,157
G-Gosh, no, then it will be too tiring for me.

396
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:05,887
I still haven't finished my work for today.

397
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:08,317
Okay.

398
00:39:29,857 --> 00:39:32,077
I must've left my phone by the washing machine.

399
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:34,227
You were about to do laundry?

400
00:39:34,227 --> 00:39:35,447
Yeah.

401
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:38,997
Gosh, you use the washing machine so often.

402

By chance...

403
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:54,637
are you a machine that
uses the washing machine?

404
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:58,837
- That was funny, right?
- Oh, yeah.

405
00:40:03,397 --> 00:40:06,587
- Then I'll bring the medicine.
- Okay.

406

Your body is also relaxed.

407
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:16,767
You breathe in and breathe out comfortably.

Muel, are you okay?

412
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:20,077
I'm sorry.

413
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,147
You were stunned, right?

414
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:31,007
Things could have gone really bad just now.

415
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:33,027
But...

416
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:35,307
nothing happened.

Yes...

I couldn't have you see
something you shouldn't, Muel.

420
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,707
We should stop this now, our cleaning.

What am I supposed to know?

424
00:42:06,897 --> 00:42:10,207
Were we doing anything wrong?

425
00:42:10,207 --> 00:42:14,097
All we did was clean together.

426
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:16,267
I had to hide!

427
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:21,057
And you even fed your husband a sleeping pill...

428
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:25,447
I don't think this is right.

429
00:43:20,707 --> 00:43:24,547
We are receiving lots of stories from people struggling.

430

The person who just sent us their story seems to be struggling a lot, too.

431

There's nothing more difficult than to forget someone.

432
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:35,707
I'll put on your song request, so please forget it all.

I'm sure the other person will understand as well.

I'm sorry, but can I stay here for just 10 more minutes?

00:45:27,187 --> 00:45:29,387
I think you said that earlier.

Please move your vehicle.
