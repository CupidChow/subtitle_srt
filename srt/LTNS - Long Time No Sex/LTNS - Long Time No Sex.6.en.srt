Why would you ask for such a thing?

16

Because you might feel uncomfortable.

By the way, how are you so good
at saying those things so naturally?

Why? Do you dislike it?

23
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,570
No, I like it. I asked because
I can't really say those things.

Have you always been so bashful, Samuel?

Oh, I'm not bashful.

180
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,100
We've got money.

181
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,210
A whole f***ing lot of money, too.

182
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,140
There's money inside? Shit!

183
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,100
There must be a good reason for the money to be in there.

184
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,720
What did you say to blackmail her for her to give you money?

185
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,560
What else?

186
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,330
I copied and pasted the blackmail message we used every time!

187
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,040
You're...

188
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,970
a demon.

189
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,390
Do you know?

190
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,480
I know.

191
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,090
I earned this money. Don't touch it.

192
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,140
F***!

193
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,620
Shit!

194
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,220
You want to take it all the way, huh?
Fine, let's do it.

195
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,290
Can we go any further from here, huh?

196
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,840
Woo Jin, what right do you have to treat me like this?

197
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,500
How come you're so shameless?

198
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,890
What are you saying? You should be begging-

199
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,460
I saw everything that day!

200
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,400
Two years ago...

201
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,960
the day you ran away from home.

202
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,460
You don't see me as a woman now, do you?


203
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,080
Wouldn't I be more frustrated than you?


204
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,980
You think you're the only one frustrated?


205
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,210
- Can't you be patient and wait for me?
- How long am I supposed to wait?

206
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,800
Just get a divorce instead!


207
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,680
You like being alone, right?

208
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,750
Be alone all you want.


209
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,200
The customer is not answering the phone. After the beep...

210
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,320
[Ms. Woo Jeong Ah]

211
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,980
[07 Kim Sae Ro Mi]

212
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,080
[Mr. Jeon on the Run!]

213
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,480
[Lee Yool Do]

214
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,290
[Dog]

215
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,000
[Dog]

216
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,800
Crazy bitch.

217
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,930
[Dog]

218
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,520
[Dog]

219
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,950
Hey, hey, long time no see.

220
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,320
Hey, are you watching me right now?

221
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,800
Cut the bullshit.

222
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,380
How did you know this oppa came to Seoul, then?

223
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,140
F*** you.

224
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,080
I pressed it by mistake.

225
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,690
Oh, hey, I want to f***.

226
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,040
Come to Grand Suite Room 1069.

227
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,330
Let's have a chat since it's been forever.

228
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,820
The night view is crazy here.

229
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,560
You're still the same, you f***er.

230
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,700
Why would I go there?

231
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,670
Wake up.

232
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,280
Hey, Dom Perignon happens to be here, too.

233
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,860
No matter how crazy I am, I'm not going there.

234
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,260
Because you're a f***ing scum.

235
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,810
I saw the night view, so I'm leaving.

236
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,800
It's going to rain soon.

237
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,430
Stay a bit longer.

238
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,190
I'm going to leave before it rains.

239
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,060
The night view's even better here when it rains.

240
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,680
You know it, too.

241
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,710
What are you looking at?

242
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,700
Aigoo, don't be pretty if you don't like this, you crazy bitch.

243
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,890
I'm ugly right now. I've got no makeup on.

244
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,900
You really don't know yourself.

245
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,610
Your bare face is what kills, bitch.

246
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,060
Don't curse, you crazy asshole.

247
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,410
You're happy to hear my cursing in a long time, right?

248
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,740
Give me a f***ing break.

249
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,890
Get lost, motherf***er.

250
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,510
Gosh, you're so sexy.

251
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,120
There's no girl who can swear flavorfully like you do.

252
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,380
- Moron.
- Yes, I missed your cursing, too.

253
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,250
I know you missed me a lot, too.

254
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,720
You didn't?

255
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,800
As if. A skunk can't quit farting, you know.

256
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,730
I'm a married woman.

257
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,180
Don't even think about touching me.

258
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,940
Yes, you're married, and I'm married, too.

259
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,870
- Fair play.
- I'm different from a f***ing scum like you.

260
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,080
Bullshit.

261
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,170
You're totally the same kind as me.

262
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,150
You can't even lie and just act tough. You're so cute.

263
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,730
My gosh!

264
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:05,340
Hey, you're honestly crazy sad the world doesn't know how cute you are after you got married, right?

265
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,920
Wait, why are you crying?

266
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,960
Is your marriage life hard?

267
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,250
Hey, marriage life is f***ing hard, to begin with.

268
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,920
Do you now understand what a hard life I'm living now?

269
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,240
You're just a f***ing scum.

270
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,770
Okay, hey, I'm the SOB. Don't cry.

271
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,110
- Okay?
- Don't do it.

272
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,730
Okay, I'm the SOB.

273
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,130
But people easily find solace and cry on SOB's shoulders.

274
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,710
You can also lean on me and cry. It's okay.

275
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,280
Forget it.

276
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,730
- Don't do it.
- No, hold on a minute.

277
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,440
You know I'm really honest, right?

278
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,370
I'm hard right now.

279
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,870
You f***ing lunatic.

280
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,500
- You can get hard in this situation?
- Yes.

281
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,720
- You still want to sleep with me?
- Yes.

282
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,880
Oh, hey, take a look.

283
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
- Feel it.
- What's your problem?

284
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,530
Come on, feel it! Right?

285
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,070
F***! Is sex the only thing on your mind?

286
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,240
You horny motherf***er!

287
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,290
You can stop being sexy, then.

288
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,450
Why are you only giving me shit?

289
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,600
Don't misunderstand.

290
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,780
I've got no feelings for you.

291
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,660
F*** me all you want and go,
you terrible bitch.

292
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,890
Yes, I'm a terrible bitch.

293
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,260
And you're a horny f***er.

294
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,530
Yes, I'm the SOB.

295
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,380
I saw everything that day.

296
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,140
I followed you that day because I was worried.

297
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,160
You went into a nice hotel.

298
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,230
In front of that hotel,

299
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,220
I had all kinds of thoughts alone!

300
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,330
"Should I follow her inside?

301
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,810
Wouldn't it be better if I
just pretended not to know?"

302
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,580
You should've just followed in.

303
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,530
You came out after about an hour.

304
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,300
That day,

305
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,110
who were you there with?

306
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,690
I was just there to meet a friend.

307
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,650
You go to a hotel to meet just a friend?

308
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,550
Did you sleep with that friend?

309
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,130
If I tell you honestly, will you do the same?

310
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,600
Sure.

311
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,850
It was just once.

312
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,580
You slept with that friend of yours, huh?

313
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,600
Who was it?

314
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,990
Jung Gi Seok.

315
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,300
Your ex-boyfriend?

316
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,330
But I swear it was just once,
and no feelings were involved.

317
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,030
How can you do it when you don't have any feelings?

318
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,250
How is that possible? Are you a beast?

319
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,740
It was my fault, through and through.

320
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,850
I'm regretting it. I won't give any excuses.

321
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,690
Just give excuses! Why won't you give excuses?

322
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,570
You can give excuses all night,
and it won't be enough!

323
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,570
I'm sorry. It was my bad.

324
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,770
Do you know what you did?

325
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,290
It's your turn now.

326
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,870
You tell me honestly, too.

327
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,520
There's really nothing to tell.

328
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,645
Be honest! I was honest, too!

329
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:19,945
What do you want to know?
Whether I slept with her or not?

330
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,030
I didn't sleep with her.

331
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,250
That makes no sense.

332
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,300
You went into her house together, but nothing happened?

333
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,570
Yes, nothing happened.

334
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,140
We're...

335
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,200
We?

336
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,920
Oh, it's a "we"?

337
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,410
We're cleaning mates.

338
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,820
We just cleaned together.

339
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,290
Cleaning?

340
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:49,120
We were both serious about cleaning,
so we helped each other with cleaning. That was it!

341
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,200
We didn't do anything.

342
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,130
Was she in our house, too?

343
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,630
Yes.

344
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,670
You're a total f***ing nutcase!

345
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,440
That woman must've seen my cosmetics,
clothes, and underwear, too, huh?

346
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,230
Did that woman touch my bed?

347
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,830
Tell me.

348
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,040
Since we were helping each other clean...

349
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,380
You're backstabbing me right in the liver.

350
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,740
I didn't tell you intentionally because you'd think like this unnecessarily!

351
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,980
But the only thing we did was cleaning. I swear!

352
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Why did she pay such big money
when all you did was clean?

353
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,490
Are you going to be petty and hide until the end?

354
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,290
What am I hiding? I'm telling you all the facts.

355
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,890
What did you do next door for 30 minutes back then?

356
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,620
Were you doing a midnight clean together?

357
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,300
She said she wasn't feeling well that day,

358
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,710
so I gave her medicine and came out
after she fell asleep. That's all!

359
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,540
Can't I do that much? It's not like we're total strangers.

360
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,910
It's not like we're total strangers.

361
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,840
Who brings medicine and puts the woman next door to sleep?

362
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,770
You loved that woman, huh?

363
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,500
Answer me!

364
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,420
Did you love her?

365
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,220
Yes, I liked her.

366
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,570
Honestly, I needed someone to talk to.

367
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,130
You don't listen to what I say.

368
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,610
But that person had a conversation with me.

369
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:39,310
After seeing her, I realized how lonely of a person I have been.

370
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,220
Thanks to Min Soo.

371
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,870
You were lonely?

372
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,210
How can you be lonely with all the debt we had?

373
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,630
While you were moping around in depression after
resigning irresponsibly to start a business you failed,

374
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,130
I worked without a break to protect this family.

375
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,160
So, I had no time to be lonely!

376
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,560
Yes, you did all the work to protect this family, right?

377
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,880
And I did f***ing nothing, right?

378
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,150
Do you know how uncomfortable you make a person feel?

379
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,630
Why do you think my dick didn't get hard? Huh?

380
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,650
Try to think a little!

381
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:14,140
Who'd ever get hard with someone like you who
habitually tries to trample on other people?

382
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,000
Yes, that's why I did it with Jung Gi Seok, too.

383
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,120
No matter how much I shit on him and cursed at him,
Jung Gi Seok still got horny for me.

384
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,180
Yeah, I got horny seeing Min Soo, too.

385
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,210
You're finally telling the truth.

386
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,270
You got horny?

387
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,110
Yes, I got horny.

388
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,110
To adjust to your mood swing
that changes every 10 minutes,

389
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,940
I was always so anxious and nervous.

390
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,110
Whoa, it felt like I was going to get angina with you!

391
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,830
Whoa, but after meeting someone
who's considerate and cares for my feelings,

392
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,220
I got so relaxed that I got horny!

393
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,440
But I still didn't play dirty like you.

394
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,990
Yeah? You were f***ing clean, huh?

395
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,370
Did you ever masturbate thinking about that woman or not?

396
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,560
You must have since you can't answer.

397
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,260
Look how f***ing clean you are.

398
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,000
And how many times did you go
when you did it with Jung Gi Seok?

399
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,150
- Did he even use a condom?
- Enough is enough.

400
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:18,500
I didn't f***ing pretend to be a tragic protagonist,
soaked in his own f***ing emotions, like you.

401
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,470
You couldn't even f***ing ask me
about it for two years. And now what?

402
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,160
Did he use a condom?

403
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,700
He didn't use a condom!
What the f*** will you do about it?

404
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,780
- That's filthy.
- You're filthier than I am.

405
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,390
You act all nice on the outside but
jerk off imagining someone else's wife.

406
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,600
Your mind must've been over there,
though your body was with me.

407
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,300
- That's deception.
- Deception?

408
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,710
Looks like you don't know what deception means.

409
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:48,120
Deception is doing it with just anyone
whenever you get horny like you!

410
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,830
You should've just done it once.

411
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,580
I think that'd make more sense for me.

412
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,220
Oh, you didn't get hard next door, either, huh?

413
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,710
That must be why you couldn't do it.

414
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,910
You would've done it a long time ago
if you were able to get hard!

415
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,510
What are you doing?

416
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,750
What is this?

417
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,930
My dick doesn't get hard?

418
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,440
I'll show you. Watch.

419
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,630
- Have you gone mad?
- Yes, I've gone mad.

420
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,600
Gosh, talking to a beast turns you into one.

421
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,030
Going mad was a good thing, huh? Shit.

422
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,550
- Look-
- Are you showing off your dick?

423
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,890
Let go.

424
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,300
Look, I'll make sure to show you my dick getting hard.

425
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,670
You love dicks! Watch-

426
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,040
- Stop it!
- It got hard, didn't it?

427
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,680
- Don't touch me. Don't f***ing touch my body.
- Stop it-

428
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Hey, happy now? Look!

429
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,090
It got hard! Look!

430
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,400
It's f***ing hard. Can I touch it?

431
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,300
It got hard in front of you, too!
I'm a beast now, too!

432
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,080
What's that?

433
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,210
A rock?

434
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,700
Hey, someone threw a rock!

435
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,940
You're showing your worst side.
How can you take this in the midst of all this?

436
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,890
I'm trying to take care of the trouble you caused!

437
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,140
I earned this money! Don't touch it!

438
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,270
This isn't your money! This is Min Soo's money!

439
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,960
It was an adulterous bitch's money, so it's mine!

440
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,710
She didn't cheat, so you need to give it back!

441
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,780
Whose side are you on?

442
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,940
- Let go!
- Let go!

443
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,210
- Let go!
- Let go!

444
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,890
Let go!

445
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,140
Shit!

446
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,070
Don't do it, don't do it.

447
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,980
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!

448
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,770
Don't do it, don't do it!

449
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:38,510
Hey, do you think I don't get angry
because I don't have anger?

450
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,730
Why are you making a good person get angry?

451
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,250
You're great at doing laundry!

452
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,850
You dry them again and fold them!

453
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,100
Am I your dog or something?

454
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,560
You fold them, you fold them!

455
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,980
Do you even know how to fold laundry?

456
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,370
Hit me.

457
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,160
Hit me. Hit me.

458
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,890
Don't do it.

459
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,160
- Hit me.
- Don't do it.

460
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,840
Don't do it!

461
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,610
Don't do it. Hey, hey!

462
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,730
- Let go!
- Stop it!

463
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,910
- Let go.
- Don't come!

464
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,870
Shit!

465
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,510
Shit!

466
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,430
That son of a bitch!

467
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,950
Hey, where are you going?

468
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,800
Turn on the emergency lights and pull over right now!

469
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,250
I always listened to what you said.

470
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,480
I'm not going to listen to you starting today! F***!

471
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,210
It's so great not to listen!

472
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,050
You better pull over.

473
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,160
Nope, I'm not pulling over.

474
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,350
You'll regret it!

475
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,000
I won't.

476
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,900
Shit.

477
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,170
Move out of the way!

478
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,360
F***!

479
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,340
I'm coming.

480
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,910
Open it.

481
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,100
What?

482
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,340
What?

483
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,850
What?

484
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,800
I opened it, stop! Stop now!

485
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,450
This is mad.

486
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,140
Hey!

487
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,170
Give it.

488
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,690
Shit!

489
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,030
Let go. I'll kick you.

490
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,060
Let go. I'll kick you!

491
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:33,690
You're mad.

492
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,890
This is money.

493
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,390
It's money, your favorite thing. Come to your senses!

494
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,120
It's so nice to be mad, as you said!

495
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,110
You were already mad! You can't get more mad!

496
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,720
- Let go.
- Please stop!

497
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,780
- Let go.
- Stop!

498
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,570
Stop!

499
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,550
If I can't have it,

500
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,250
no one can have it!

501
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:06,400
No one can f***ing have it!

502
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,010
[7 Months Later]

503
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,160
It's cleaner than expected for an old house, right?

504
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,000
It's cleaner than I thought, but it's old, as you said.

505
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,460
Well, you can renovate it all over.

506
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,730
I can hook you up with a nice and affordable company.

507
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,260
How were the people who lived here before?

508
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,800
The owners lived here. A newlywed-

509
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,210
A newlywed! A newlywed...

510
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:55,760
They were such a loving couple, and things
worked out well for them, and they moved.

511
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,570
Maybe this place's energy is great.

512
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:03,700
Everyone who lived here did very well and moved out.

513
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,620
We'll sign the contract.

514
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,060
Will you, really?

515
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,413
Oh, my, its owner finally showed up.

516
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:17,823
I'll contact the owners and set up the date right away, then.

517
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,420
Your fate with this house-

518
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,910
You made a really good decision!

519
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,910
Aigoo, my goodness.

520
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,210
Excuse me, did people who used to live here move out?

521
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,910
Must be so!

522
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,000
Because these folks are planning to move in.

523
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,400
- May I ask who you are?
- Don't.

524
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,340
I'm the deliveryman.

525
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,120
- Oh, my...
- Aigoo...

526
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,360
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

527
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,450
The deliveryman! Yes, the delivery.

00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,440
You don't anymore.

708
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:43,620
The strawberries are good.

709
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,000
Yes, it was a good harvest this year.

710
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,310
And your family? Are they all doing well?

711
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,740
Yes, they're all doing well.

712
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,370
Your unni's doing well, too, right?

713
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:52,680
Yes.

714
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,980
You want some wine?

715
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,850
No, I'm fine.

716
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,290
There's also beer in the fridge.

717
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,340
No, I brought my car.

718
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,200
Okay.

719
00:56:09,248 --> 00:56:11,040
Forget it, let's drink. I'll drink.

720
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,890
I'll drink. Let's have some.

721
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,480
When you were living alone a long time ago,

722
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,750
you had invited me to a studio like this one.

723
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,440
Do you remember?

724
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,130
I remember now.

725
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:34,070
You were almost like a roommate at my studio back then.

726
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:35,850
I was.

727
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,260
We were really cute back then.

728
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,740
Yes.

729
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:53,300
Has anyone come to this place yet?

730
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,780
Why on Earth are you curious about those things?

731
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,550
Well, of course, I'm curious.

732
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,800
You used to be my wife.

733
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:05,510
You want to know?

734
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,010
I mean, well- Someone did come, huh?

735
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,900
No one's been here.

736
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,120
You should go out and meet people.

737
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,710
Oh, right. You remember the prosecutor we gave up on catching?

738
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:26,840
- Prosecutor?
- The one with the mold.

739
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,010
Shui Jing Fang* at a Chinese restaurant?
(A Chinese liquor)

740
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,020
- Yes.
- Yes.

741
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:32,090
He came by earlier with a different woman to have an affair.

742
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,300
I was reminded of you a little.

743
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:42,230
Gosh, that prosecutor bastard.

744
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,580
Go ahead.

745
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:44,720
What's with you? Are you drunk?

746
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:48,590
Right, sorry.

747
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:36,020
We're divorced.

748
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,680
But we can still have sex.

749
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,610
That's true.
