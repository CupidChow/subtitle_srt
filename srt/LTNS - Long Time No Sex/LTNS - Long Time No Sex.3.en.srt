00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,160
you learn really quickly.

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,250
It's thanks to you.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,430
You're so talented,

6
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,390
but you've been wasting it until now.

7
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,170
This is what they call blowing the harmonica.

8
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,210
How is it?

9
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,300
Don't blow the harmonica.

10
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,230
I think it's going to explode- Gosh, this is mad.

12

I think...

13
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,150
my jaws are dislocated.

14
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,200
Your jaws are dislocated?

15
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,360
I'm sure mine's not that big.

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,890
I might've gone too hard suddenly.

17

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,300
I found out there are a lot of couples like us in Korea.

41
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,300
It's about one out of every three couples.

- We're not the weird ones.
- Yes, Ma'am!

43

Even so, we need to do our best, right?

44
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,810
Because we can't stay at average.

45
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,460
Yes, average is dangerous.

Is it that tight?

50
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,830
Yes, can I lower the zipper and eat?

51
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,830
Just while I'm eating the burger.

52
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,050
Gosh, you're really impatient, huh?

53
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,840
I also want to unbutton my skinny jeans.

54
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,940
Why do you think I'm flexing my abs and not unbuttoning it?

55
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,800
You should unbutton it and eat comfortably, then.

Did I say you're wrong or something?

61
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,230
You said you'd like me to wear a military uniform, so I wore one.

62
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,940

131
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,100
I was sleeping at the hotel and got this idea.

132
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,310
We should extort big money only from the rich from now on.

140

Once we reach that amount, we'll quit this crap.

141

How much do you want, then?

142
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,290

Also, why can't we save 150 million won when we work so hard?

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,800
All right.

178
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,860
You should have some, too, Honey.

179
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,210
Try eating these forever.

180
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,760
A shot* will do the job.
(Referring to botox shots)

181
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,740
Why don't you make a report about providing stones for Daeyang Corporation?

182
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,290
- Oh, that's-
- If you've got time to make these wraps,

183
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,990
make sure to report promptly.

184
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,240
Bring all the receipts, too.

185
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,660
Yes.

186
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,730
Get closer to him! Get closer!

187
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,680
Stop rushing me. I'm already getting closer right now.

188
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,320
Give me your hand.

189
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,250
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

190
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,910
Her jaws are dislocated.

191
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,520
She's hiking when her jaws are dislocated.

192
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,870
Her stamina is crazy.

193
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,850
That's why they go around eating eels.

194
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,630
Anyhow, the bill for eels came out a lot.

195
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,950
Did I eat them because I wanted to?

196
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,920
They don't sell single portions, so I had to eat two portions.

197
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,500
They're looking over here.

198
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,000
- Act like we're a couple.
- We're originally a couple.

199
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,540
Rosy, Mommy's here.

200
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,300
What did you say?

201
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,760
She's asking...

202
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,040
why you didn't come for a while.

203
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,000
My jaws were dislocated, so I couldn't come.

204
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,170
My dear Rosy, I miss you.

205
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,340
I also miss you, Mommy.

206
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,060
Don't worry about me here and

207
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,430
take good care of your jaws.

208
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,420
That's what she said.

209
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,690
Rosy, Mommy will come more often now

210
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,390
with ahjussi.

211
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,950
Please be careful.

212
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,800
All right, hang in there now.

213
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,520
Hey, follow me.

214
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,360
Rosy, Rosy?

215
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,700
Is it a dog's name?

216
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,360
[R.I.P. Rosy,12/22/2009]
Rosy?

217
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,600
They must be going on the freeway.

218
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,850
Wait, I shouldn't be exiting here.

219
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,600
Shit.

220
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,700
How far are they going to go?

221
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,540
The ocean is too much.

222
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,920
- Be careful now.
- Yes.

223
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,630
Is that a guitar?

224
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,770
Okay!

225
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,190
- This is nuts.
- Hello.

226
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,430
They're on a boat.

227
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,410
Excuse me, where do the boats go from here?

228
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,010
Over there.

229
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,020
What's over there?

230
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,010
Oh, that place is a lodge.

231
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,570
A lodge?

232
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,750
A lodge?

233
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,240
Oh, those things floating on water are lodges?

234
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,960
That's right.

235
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,110
Hello!

236
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,070
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

237
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,640
Hello!

238
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,120
They ignored me...

239
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,610
What are those people doing?

240
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,750
Whoa! Hey.

241
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,950
Did you come to fish?

242
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,340
This is part of the job, okay?

243
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,800
I'm pretending to be fishing right now.

244
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,680
It's here! It's here again!

245
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,020
Whoa, is it a rockfish?

246
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,080
- Is it a rockfish?
- What a nutjob.

247
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,510
I can hear you, okay?

248
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,750
W-Whoa.

249
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,840
Whoa, it's so strong!

250
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,530
Whoa.

251
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,710
Gosh, it's so fun.

252
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,850
Wow, your skills are...

253
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,750
Noonim, what can't you do, seriously?

254
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,010
Here.

255
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,700
Here you go. Have a bite.

256
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,170
Here. You, too.

257
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,510
All right.

258
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,160
By the way, Noonim,

259
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,360
your jaws are taking a while to heal.

260
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,550
Gosh, when will I get a chance for another learning session?

261
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,090
I think it'll be possible.

262
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,060
My, you don't need to overextend yourself.

263
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,480
They've got a good vibe going.

264
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,500
I think they're going to do it tonight.

265
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,090
They came this far. They'll do it, right?

266
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,440
Please.

267
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,110
Get to it.

268
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,780
Hey, they're going inside.

269
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,990
- Going in.
- Go in.

270
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,160
- Go in, go in.
- Go!

271
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,650
They went in!

272
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,840
It's set.

273
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
I think we'll have to cross over, too.

274
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,130
How will we go there?

275
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,540
One of us will have to cross the water, right?

276
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,060
Go! Keep going!

277
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,850
Huh?

278
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,710
Baek Ho?

279
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,050
Yes, Noona.

280
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,860
Baek Ho.

281
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,960
Skip the honorifics.

282
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,300
Okay.

283
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,670
All right.

284
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,780
Try slapping my butt.

285
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,230
What?

286
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,200
You watched YouTube again, Noona.

287
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,980
One more time.

288
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,710
Noona, you like this?

289
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,390
- Whoa!
- Huh?

290
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,630
Why is the window open?

291
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,630
Go that way!

292
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,450
Hand...

293
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,240
The towel! Where's the towel?

294
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,190
The picture! I got the pictures!

295
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,460
Good job.

296
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,800
Are you okay?

297
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,720
You're going to catch a cold.

298
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,940
You're skipping honorifics, huh?

299
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,740
Is our partnership mode off?

300
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,250
Yes.

301
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,110
I'm sorry.

302
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,480
I was too vicious with you.

303
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,940
No, I'm sorry. I was being too...

304
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,690
petty with you.

305
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,980
You're cold, right?

306
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,730
I should've bought soju at the mart that ripped us off earlier.

307
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,370
We have soju.

308
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,490
How do we have soju?

309
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,940
Soju?

310
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,830
Right here.

311
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,010
I stole Baek Ho's at the other lodge over there.

312
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,100
Why are you so cool these days?

313
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,380
Soju is the best when you're cold.

314
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,230
Should we try what you wanted to do last time?

315
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,530
What?

316
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,120
Putting in effort.

317
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,100
Complimenting each other?

318
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,890
The one where we have sex with words.

319
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,840
Should we try it out?

320
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:24,300
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

321
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,870
How are you supposed to do it?

322
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:32,070
You just need to do it like you're doing phone sex.

323
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,950
We did it when we were dating.

324
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,790
We did.

325
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,460
Shall we try? Are you down?

326
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,350
Of course.

327
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,000
Let's go.

328
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,570
Ring, ring.

329
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,750
Ring, ring.

330
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,870
Hello?

331
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,690
Oh, hello.

332
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,440
Hello.

333
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,130
Hi, could you tell me your name and where you live?

334
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,580
My name is Jin, and I'm on water.

335
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,920
Ms. Jin who is on water, nice to meet you.

336
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,310
A-Are you alone right now?

337
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes, I'm alone in the room right now.

338
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,360
Oh, you're alone in the room. I'm alone, too.

339
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,130
I'm alone in a freight truck right now.

340
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,220
You're alone, too.

341
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,190
Do you mind telling me what you're wearing right now?

342
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,100
Shorts and a tank top.

343
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,580
Shorts and a tank top?

344
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,760
That's sexy.

345
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,630
Shorts and a tank top are sexy?

346
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,730
Yes.

347
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,700
You've got quite a taste.

348
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,290
Are you wet right now, by chance?

349
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,180
My entire body got wet today.

350
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,620
From my head to toe, it's all slippery.

351
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,480
I'm also moist.

352
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Where are you moist?

353
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,920
Why do you ask when you know?

354
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,240
You have such a nice voice that I started dripping as soon as I heard you.

355
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,730
Could you spread your legs, please?

356
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,300
My legs?

357
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,770
Yes.

358
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,430
I'll start sucking your ear now.

359
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,350
You made me spread my legs but sucking my ear?

360
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,110
O-Oh, I didn't explain this to you.

361
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,540
I like to start sucking from the top and move my way down.

362
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,710
Okay, you can start.

363
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,730
I'll start now, then.

364
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,580
Your ear.

365
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,740
Your neck.

366
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,070
Your breasts.

367
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,700
Lick, lick.

368
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,080
Going lower.

369
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,100
Going lower.

370
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Take off your pants, please.

371
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,700
- Suddenly?
- I want to suck, too.

372
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,690
I only like the lower half.

373
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,220
But I'm not wearing pants today. I'm actually...

374
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,820
not wearing anything right now. I'm butt-naked.

375
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,590
You're quite the seductive man.

376
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,970
Oh, my. You're standing hard.

377
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,950
Since when was it hard like this?

378
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,490
When you said, "hello."

379
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,090
I see.

380
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,430
I'll suck now.

381
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,510
You were for real.

382
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,130
How do you kiss again?

383
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,340
Let's work at it.

384
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,790
We really did it.

385
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,890
Is it alcohol?

386
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,960
Can't say no completely.

387
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,720
It's not easy to make money.

388
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,370
Yes.

389
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,330
I think we spent 500,000 won on this business trip alone.

390
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,420
We spent a lot.

391
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,020
It's fine. We just need to make that much more.

392
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,980
We secured the evidence, too. Let's get to it now.

393
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,190
How much should I ask from each person?

394
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,820
How's 10 million won each, so 20 million won total?

395
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,110
When will we save 100 million won at that rate?

396
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,060
We have to make at least 50 million won per job from now on.

397
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,980
Fifty million- 50 million is too much, isn't it?

398
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,380
Not at all. It's not much if they split it.

399
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,020
But the woman didn't seem to have much money.

400
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,800
Then, to make it fair, Young Ae can pay 20 million won, and Baek Ho can pay 30 million won.

401
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,150
So a total of 50 million won. How is that?

402
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,740
Okay, okay.

403
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,640
Sounds good.

404
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,500
Gosh, I'm tired.

405
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,170
Let's sleep.

406
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,090
[Leave 20 million won by Rosy's grave at Mt. Moryong.]
Twenty million won for Young Ae.

407
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,720
[Leave 30 million won by Rosy's grave at Mt. Moryong.]
Thirty million won for Baek Ho.

408
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,840
We'll expose you.

409
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,960
We'll expose you, too.

410
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,710
Who should I send it to first?

411
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,060
Okay, Young Ae can come first to Rosy's grave.

412
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,700
- We're f***ed.
- Mr. Blackmailer, read this.

413
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,850
I don't know how you know me and followed me around.

414
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,770
But I can't help thinking your life is quite the sad one, too.

415
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,320
My gosh, they're having the time of their lives.

416
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,260
[Park's Pig Blood Sausage Stew]

417
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,960
Does it feel good to do it like that?

418
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,690
Do other people's mouths taste different from my own?

419
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,620
Who knows?

420
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,010
It's been too long for us to remember.

421
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,970
I've never kissed before.

422
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,100
What?

423
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,300
What are you saying?

424
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:55,850
Unni, how did you get two sons without even kissing?

425
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,160
Does that make sense?

426
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,940
Why can't you?

427
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,330
We skipped it, so I never got to try.

428
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,660
Aigoo, the more I learn about you, the more pitiful you are.

429
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,060
What do you say? Do you want me to give you a kiss?

430
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,890
Will you?

431
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,380
- Come over here.
- Excuse me!

432
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,350
- Aigoo, I was going to, but they're looking for me.
- One soup and rice, please!

433
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,280
Yes, coming!

434
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,280
You see,

435
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,910
I lived my entire life for men.

436
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,640
It's hot, so please be careful.

437
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,200
- Let me give you your rice first.
- Okay.

438
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,020
To provide for my husband and two sons,

439
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:44,010
I cooked in a restaurant full of only men for my entire life.

440
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,320
But to my husband and my sons,

441
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,740
I think I was nothing more than a rice cooker.

442
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,410
You're in the way.

443
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,660
A rice cooker they need to survive,

444
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,250
but they don't think to cherish it.

445
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,380
This isn't for you, Rosy.

446
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,490
My dog, Rosy, was the only one who paid attention to me.

447
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:38,900
Rosy was the only one who put her body close to mine.

448
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,220
Rosy.

449
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,560
Rosy-

450
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,830
Rosy.

451
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,440
And Rosy died not too long ago, and

452
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,390
my life completely fell apart.

453
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,050
I lived my life completely in vain.

454
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,260
What do I do?

455
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:20,130
My chest felt stifling and painful when I was awake,

456
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,780
so I climbed the mountain more and more.

457
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,020
Aigoo.

458
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,030
That was how...

459
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,330
I met him.

460
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,550
He appeared before me as if god sent him to me as a gift

461
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,410
for my hard life.

462
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,710
Aigoo, thank you.

463
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,560
I'm too embarrassed to raise my head, so I apologize.

464
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,700
I should look at you and thank you.

465
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:39,180
He is someone who taught me a man can be beautiful, too.

466
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:46,210
He taught me you can be happy by being together.

467
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:54,230
I would've died without ever having a kiss in my life,

468
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,910
but he gifted me with my first kiss.

469
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,790
I hope this moment will never end.

470
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:05,700
I waited 60 years to meet this man.

471
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,500
So don't interfere with us.

472
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,540
- I won't give you the money, either.
- I won't give you the money, either.

473
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,930
- Do whatever you want.
- Do whatever you want.

474
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,910
The end.

475
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,880
Woo Jin, I don't think it's right for us to keep blackmailing her.

476
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,830
Then, let's raise the stakes on the other one.

477
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,200
Change only the amount for Baek Ho's blackmail.

478

50 million- Hey.

480
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,380

An idiot who's got a lot to lose will.

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,440

[Let's meet.]

00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,960

00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,590
Ahjussi.

537
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,720

00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,230
You had to choose talc, the weakest stone, huh?

539
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,920
Stop hitting me, seriously!

540
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,440
It hurts too much, and I lost a tooth.

541
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,630
Surrender.

542
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,500
Okay, I surrender.

543
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:10,730
Ahjussi, I guess you think I do this work alone,

544
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,330
but one text from me, and your life is f***ed, okay?

545
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,440
W-Why did you hit me when I surrendered?

546
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,950
My fist is diamond, you scum!

547
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,110
Your life must also be pretty twisted to be doing something like this.

548
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,760
My wife didn't hire you?

549
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,730
No, she didn't.

550
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,110
Do you have a wife?

551
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,020
No.

552
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,060
I don't.

553
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,340
How old are you?

554
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:29,190
I don't think I can tell you because that's my private information.

555
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,880
Do you want one more shot?

556
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,350
Let me see that.

557
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,460
I'm a person who keeps promises.

558
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,690
I can give you the money you demanded.

559
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,870
Oh, really? T-Thank you.

560
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,440
However, as I told you before, the process will be a little complicated.

561
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,850
For me to give you the money you want, I have to use my company's funds.

562
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,140
So, sign a contract with me.

563
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,490
What contract-

564
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:13,470
There's no need to complicate this matter, but what else can we do?

565
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,130
This business was started with my father-in-law's money and

566
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:22,260
my wife still does all the bookkeeping herself.

567
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,070
That's why we need a contract.

568
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,420
So, w-what kind of a contract are you talking about?

569
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,130
I saw you were pretty good at taking pictures.

570
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,620
- I am?
- When I look at your pictures,

571
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,420
we're beautiful.

572
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,360
I was moved.

573
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,370
So, let's have you take some pictures of my stones.

574
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,090
I'll exhibit some of the pictures you'll take on my homepage.

575
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:51,560
I will also make a calendar to give out to my wife's church and clients.

576
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:57,300
S-Sir, thank you for the compliment, but for me to sign a contract,

577
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,830
I have to expose all of my personal information, don't I?

578
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,130
Do you still not trust me?

579
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,230
Well, I can trust you-

580
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,740
I'm also going to be emptied and kicked out if they find out I cheated.

581
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,870
I'd be penny-wise and pound-foolish.

582
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,940
It's good for you and me, so isn't this a good contract?

583
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,390
Well, that's true, but the record-

[Contract: Baek Ho Stones will pay 50 million won to ( ) to photograph stones for a calendar.]

All right, write your name and personal information, and sign.

586
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,390
I'll send the money to your account right after.

588

- Yes.

589
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,600
What? Whoa!

590
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,960
My man, even if photography is done at the asking price, 50 million won is too much!

591
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,400
N-No, I can't. You'll also be in trouble if I go back with that money.

592
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,660
My boss is a scary person.

593
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,950
How can you just drop 10 million won?

594
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,820
Make it 45 million won, then.

00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,300
Let's drop just 50 million won.

596
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,640

You're the third most famous photographer in Korea starting today.

601
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,740
You need to be prepared for this much if you want to make money.

603
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,940

604
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,450
Shit.

607
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,600
Look at this.

608
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,750
