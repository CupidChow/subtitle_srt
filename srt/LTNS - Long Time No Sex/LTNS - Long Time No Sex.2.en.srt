Yeah, it seems like you didn't know.

Of course. I should buy him a new computer.

00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,540
Are you asleep?

355
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,760
No.

356
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,620
Why did you ask for hourly booking earlier?

357
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,470
I said it out of habit.

358
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,970
We always booked by the hour when we went to motels.

359
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,890
That was ages ago, huh?

360
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,300
You liked suites, so we always booked suites.

361
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,390
You remember all that.

362
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,710
I have a good memory.

363
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,790
It's been a while since we slept under the same blanket, right?

364
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,180
What the heck?

365
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,770
It's been a while.

366
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,100
Gosh.

367
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,160
By any chance, is this...

368
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,360
What?

369
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,510
a signal?

370
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,910
A signal?

371
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,300
Sex?

372
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,080
I just hugged you because it's been a while since we hugged.

373
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,480
Oh, a free hug?

374
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,070
Do you want to do it now?

375
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,770
Not really.

376
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:55,340
But we're not doing our duty as a married couple,

377
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,270
so I feel like we should.

378
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,840
It's only sex if we do it when we want to.

379
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,150
Don't you think we'll never have sex again at this rate?

380
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,780
You think so?

381
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,480
Actually, I also think doing it with you will feel like doing it with my brother.

382
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,470
But shouldn't we still try our best?

383
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,410
We're a married couple, after all.

384
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,550
What does "trying" entail?

385
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,040
Should we close our eyes and have you penetrate me?

386
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,050
That's called mating. Animals do that.

387
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,340
Even cows don't do it like that these days.

388
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,400
I think they gather as a group and rut during mating season.

389
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,440
Can't people rut?

390
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,170
I heard somewhere that telling each other

391
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,270
what they like about each other...

392
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,170
can be helpful. Should we give it a try?

393
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,930
You think that's going to make us horny?

394
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,310
Well, we can just give it a try.

395
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,770
Giving an effort.

396
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,400
Fine.

397
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,480
Shall we start?

398
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,960
Yeah.

399
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,580
Me, first?

400
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,850
Oh, I like your fingers.

401
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,690
Your thick fingers.

402
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,010
Fingers like these are probably better than most penises.

403
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,760
Thank you.

404
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,070
I think...

405
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,310
you have exceptional leadership.

406
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:47,750
You have quick judgment, great determination, and willpower.

407
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,830
You're an admiral material. A natural.

408
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,810
- Thank you.
- Sure.

409
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,620
Oh, I like your double eyelids.

410
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,670
They're natural. Free.

411
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,900
They're completely free.

412
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,090
I think you're unexpectedly

413
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,080
on the loyal side.

414
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,120
You stay by my side when I have a hard time and cheer me on.

415
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,960
You unexpectedly have a good personality, but people just don't realize it.

416
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,680
Unexpectedly?

417
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,420
What else is there?

418
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,480
This is pretty great.

419
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,590
Right?

420
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,690
Yeah, I'm sleepy.

421
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,320
What do you call it?

422
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,670
It's like A.S.M.R.

423
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,040
Exactly.

424
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,120
Should we try something else next time? Something more stimulating.

425
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,070
Like having sex with words.

426
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,060
Having sex with words?

427
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,010
Should we try it?

428
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,180
Let's sleep.

429
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,710
We need to leave at 4 a.m. and stand by.

430
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,770
Let's sleep.

431
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,410
- I'm turning off the lights.
- Okay.

432
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,040
This job is great. We get to stick together.

433
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:39,630
It's been a long time since we've been together this long since we got married, hasn't it?

434
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,580
How nice.

435
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,220
By the way, about that asshole prosecutor.

436
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,410
I guess people like us can't touch the hair on the heads of people in high places like him.

437
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,470
He did seem pretty particular.

438
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:07,280
But we got both of these people's addresses and family photos in a day.

439
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,570
We can easily harass them if we set our minds to it.

440
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,900
Isn't that infuriating?

441
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,020
Now that you mention it, it is.

442
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,040
It's probably that easy to harass us if someone sets their mind to it, too.

443
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,130
Since we're easy pickings.

444
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,970
Probably.

445
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,110
The light turned on!

446
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,580
He must be awake.

447
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,470
He woke up early.

448
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,600
[NS Savings Bank]

449
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,250
We're prioritizing female clients.

450
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,460
Why would you prioritize females for a loan?

451
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,340
Since females don't serve in the military, there's less chance of them running away.

452
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,220
And statistically, their repayment rate is higher.

453
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,890
The interest rate may vary depending on your existing loans and credit score.

454
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,070
You can expect it to be up to 24% per year.

455
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,900
24%?

456
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,650
Isn't that too high?

457
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,340
Is it?

458
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,310
Shall we take a selfie?

459
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,680
Okay, that's enough.

460
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,380
Wow, the interest rate here is ruthless.

461
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,470
It's 24%.

462
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,940
The legal maximum interest rate.

463
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,810
Everyone here looks young.

464
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,250
They must not know how scary interest rates are.

465
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,780
You think they don't know?

466
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,380
They're all in the same situation as us.

467
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,520
They'll end up like us soon.

468
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,590
There must be a lot of office affairs.

469
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,320
Exactly. I took a photo of everyone just in case.

470
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,870
Good job.

471
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,790
What time is their lunchtime?

472
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,930
Probably at noon.

473
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,220
Yeah? Let's see what they do during lunch.

474
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,740
Okay.

475
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,200
Where did they disappear to?

476
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,480
This is where we parked after them.

477
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,420
Where did we park again?

478
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,010
- There?
- Over there?

479
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,610
Oh, this must be their hangout.

480
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,270
This is where I dropped off Ga Young last time, too.

481
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,120
Their car...

482
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,590
Our car.

483
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,320
Their car?

484
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,520
Let's go. Let's go.

485
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,590
- Did you see this?
- Yeah.

486
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,850
I was ravenous. I feel better now.

487
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,140
- Is it good?
- Both are f***ing great.

488
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,210
I'm going crazy, too.

489
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,060
Did you want to get eaten by me?

490
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,540
Yeah, if I could get eaten by you, I can do anything except get a divorce.

491
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,040
What? Huh?

492
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,950
Hurry up and come. We have 10 minutes left.

493
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,410
Okay.

494
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,190
I'll get on top.

495
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,320
Curse for me!

496
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,300
You motherf***er!

497
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,500
Oh, you son of a bitch!

498
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,760
More, more! Keep it going!

499
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,230
You horny son of a bitch!

500
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,400
Why do you live like that?

501
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,340
- What?
- You piece of shit!

502
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,990
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit!

503
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,890
- You son of a bitch!
- Yes, I'm a son of a bitch!

504
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,900
You motherf***er!

505
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,850
They stopped.

506
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,580
Why did they stop?

507
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
- Why are you back?
- He came.

508
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,100
The guy came.

509
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,410
- He came?
- I think they'll come out soon.

510
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,120
Really? Does that make sense?

511
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,120
How could they eat and come in under 20 minutes?

512
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,490
I mean, isn't that enough time?

513
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,000
What are you talking about?

514
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,180
I heard somewhere that...

515
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,450
it takes about seven minutes for an average man to come.

516
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,870
Seven minutes?

517
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,540
Yeah, that's what I heard.

518
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,470
All this trouble for just seven minutes?

519
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,690
I want to cry. Shit...

520
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,650
Oh, they came out.

521
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,590
We got something.

522
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,950
I think this pretty much covers it.

523
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,920
Okay. Car sex, check.

524
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,860
- Clear out.
- Clearing out.

525
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,270
Okay.

526
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,380
On Friday at 12:40 p.m.,

527
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:07,290
leave 20 million won in cash inside the fire hydrant

528
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,800
in the rooftop parking lot you use as your master bedroom

529
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,200
and disappear.

530
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,430
Or else, we'll expose your adulterous affair.

531
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:24,350
"Or else, we'll expose...

532
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,250
your adulterous affair."

533
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,950

Is 20 million too much?

535
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,900
Should we lower it to 10 million? They look poor.

536
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,340
Just set it at 20 million. That's being more than considerate.

538

They probably don't get loans from there.

Well, there's a matter of fairness,

547

00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,450
- Is that all to the letter?
- No, there's more.

709
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,260
"I sincerely beg of you.

710
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,840
I want to protect my family. Please help me.

711
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:13,910
Can you just think that someone with too much love
made a mistake because I couldn't contain it?"

712
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,580
Why did he get caught spreading that love?

713
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:22,500
"If you turn a blind eye this once,
I'll live quietly all my life in repentance.

714
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,880
I don't know who you are, but I didn't call the police.

715
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,000
I hope you can get this money

716
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,340
and relieve some of your anger.

717
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,710
I'm in your hands."

718
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,700
No, my anger can't be relieved.

719
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,620
We asked for 15 million won.

720
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,320
And that was being considerate.

721
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,410
In the end, this person loved his family only to that extent.

722
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,800
A love worth exactly seven million won.
What an irresponsible bastard.

723
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,600
A bastard like him should learn his lesson, huh?

724
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,820
That stings.

725
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,350
Oh, that stings.

726
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,800
Enough.

727
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,960
Father, I didn't want to ask you,

728
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,260
but where did you get your eyebrows done?

729
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,260
Why?

730
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,910
Do I look a little dumb?

731
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,690
- Not at all.
- No, you don't.

732
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,500
It really suits you. Right?

733
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,870
Father, did you get them done in Seoul for your 70th birthday?

734
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,780
Yeah, that's right.

735
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,550
These eyebrows are expensive.

736
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,740
Our Samuel did a good job.

737
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,320
Father's 70th birthday feast is quite luxurious.

738
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,960
Where's Woo Jin?

739
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,980
Long time no see!

740
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,270
Sorry, the youngest one is late.

741
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,530
- Shalom.
- Shalom!

742
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,840
It's been a while since meeting my sisters-in-law,
so I couldn't come empty-handed.

743
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,520
Some rice cakes for Father.

744
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,520
And I prepared some skincare products...

745
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,250
- You shouldn't have!
- to lavish my sister-in laws' skin.

746
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,740
You even prepared ours? Aigoo!

747
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,400
Whoa!

748
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,660
What in the world...

749
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:18,960
We couldn't do much for you all this time.

750
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,750
Let us catch up big time today.

751
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,960
For Father.

752
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,850
Give some to Father.

753
00:49:32,878 --> 00:49:34,340
This is delicious.

754
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:39,580
Father, this is called Shui Jing Fang.

755
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,720
It's high-quality alcohol.

756
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,800
What the? It's 399,000 won!

757
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,160
- Are you crazy?
- It's Father's 70th birthday.

758
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,160
Good job.

759
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,700
Shui Jung Fang?

760
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,890
I get to drink this after 20 years.

761
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,110
I think it was when my father-in-law was my age.

762
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:05,710
I decided to be generous and took him to travel to China.

763
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:12,460
The alcohol I bought my father-in-law was Shui Jing Fang.

764
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,770
But now...

765
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,690
he's gone.

766
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,190
And his daughter's gone, too.

767
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,070
Come on, it's a happy day today.

768
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,760
Yeah.

769
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,200
Gosh, that's nice...

770
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,830
Have some more.

771
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,990
- Sure.
- Easy, easy.

772
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:40,070
How did you know about this place?

773
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,850
You don't even have money.

774
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:46,420
Well, somehow.

775
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,080
Woo Jeong!

776
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,180
What the heck?

777
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,030
What's up?

778
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,110
What is this? Money?

779
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,480
What else? It's the money for our genius's lesson fee.

780
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,140
Hey, it's really money!

781
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,560
What the heck?

782
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,000
Let's teach Sung Ji, no matter what.

783
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,710
There wasn't a genius like her in our entire family.

784
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:39,000
We need to take responsibility and teach our genius.

785
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,910
You guys are penniless, too, though.

786
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:46,820
My daughter is important, but my sister is important, too.

787
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,050
Samuel found work again.

788
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:53,700
Really? That's great!

789
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,880
So just accept it.

790
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,370
I shouldn't take this,

791
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,360
but I will.

792
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,630
Sorry, Woo Jin.

793
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,790
I'll put it to good use!

794
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,240
Hey!

795
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,610
