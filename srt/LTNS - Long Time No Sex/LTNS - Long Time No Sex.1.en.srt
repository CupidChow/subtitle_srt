[Seven Years Later]
The International Monetary Fund has released

56
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,950
a report that's shocking for Korea's housing market.

57
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,310
It says Korea's home prices have risen too much so far,

58
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,360
so they'll drop gradually over a long period.

Why does it have to drop right after we buy when it was going up all this time?

64
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,950
It was to announce a rise in the interest rate.

It'll drop and go back up.

- Four hundred thousand won?
- Yes, 400,000 won.

177
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
Four of them.

178
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,480
I don't think 400,000 won is enough to go back and forth.

179
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,870
- Five hundred thousand won?
- Five hundred thousand won?

180
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,390
- Five hundred thousand won.
- Five hundred thousand won.

181
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,840
Five hundred thousand won is a deal.

182
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,760
Thank you.

183
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,520
I knew I had a great feeling today.

Gosh, Jeongseon is so far.

- Yes.

Yes, Team Leader Park.

Man, you're all working so hard.

189
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,440

I'll be there soon to fill in, so save me a spot. Yeah...

No, no!

How would you know if my magazine will fill up or empty out?

Keep up the good work, then.

195
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,110
Sir, can we stop by somewhere on the way?

196

- Where?
- Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do.

Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do? Right now?

198

Yes, right now.

Gosh, it's too late right now.

200
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,910
It's on the way, anyway. Could you just make a quick stop, please?

201
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,750
Quick stop! Yes, just a quick stop.

202
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,460
Even Karaokes gives you free minutes.

203
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,330
I can't, though.

204
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,800
Yes, right here.

205
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,700
- Right here?
- Yes, right here.

Right here, now.

Sir, I might take 10 to 40 minutes, so please give me a minute.

208
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,230
How long are you saying you'll take?

209
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,410
So, about 10, 20, or 30 to 40 minutes.

210
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,620
- Wait, you-
- J-Just a minute-

Okay, one, two.

214
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,120
Come on.

215
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,740
You have to come back in 30 minutes. Okay?

216
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,230
If it takes long, it might take 30, 40, or 50 to 60-

217
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,690
Fifty to 60 minutes is- Gosh.

218
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,950
It looks weird for the car to be here. Please park over there and wait for me, and I'll come over.

219
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,300
All right, then. I'll be waiting over there.

220
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,800
Jeongseon is still a distance to go, so you have to come out quickly.

Thank you, Ahjussi.

If my requested song is played on the radio, I think I'll feel a bit better.

My requested song is Blan Jericho's new song, which will console me in this rain.

Gosh, this is terrible. Is it urgent?

Yes, it's quite urgent.

Should we try lowering the price, then? How's 550 million won?

- Yeah.

That's why we can't order fried chicken, tiptoeing around our daughter.

- It's been forever since we had fried chicken.
- Yeah.

Why aren't you eating?

325
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,320
I think I've got indigestion.

330
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,630
No, I'm right. This is definitely whiskey.

349
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,480
Really?

350
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,520
How much do you make?

351
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,560
I don't have enough seed money to make a lot yet.

352
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,230
I think I make about one million won a month.

353
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,150
That much?

354
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,840
It's still far from enough.

355
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,960
Se Yeon, is something bothering you?

356
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,510
Why are you drinking so much?

357
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,840
Unni...

358
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,230
does you two shake the sheets these days?

359
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,110
I haven't heard that phrase in a while. "Shake the sheets."

360
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,750
I got so stressed because of that these days.

361
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,770
I became an alcoholic.

362
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,160
At night, I can't sleep without alcohol.

363
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,340
Do you see my hand shaking?

364
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,390
You do shake a bit.

365
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,830
Jeong Su always had a strong libido.

366
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,330
We always did it once a day.

367
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,800
That was the only joy in my life.

368
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,430
I didn't know Jeong Su was like that.

369
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,800
He's a good man.

370
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,610
He was a good man.

371
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,690
But about a year ago, he suddenly started turning bad.

372
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:39,980
The frequency of doing it decreased from once every three weeks to once every three months.

373
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,270
We don't do it at all anymore.

374
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,510
And this is what I'm most suspicious about.

375
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,920
I gave it a check recently.

376
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,700
Check what?

377
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,830
It wasn't the same as before.

378
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,740
What are you talking about? His size?

379
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,480
The length or the thickness?

380
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,570
The amount of semen.

381
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,660
Jeong Su.

382
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,350
Jeong Su, I'm a little embarrassed to say this to you, but...

383
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,990
What is it?

384
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,460
Gosh, where should I even start?

385
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,730
Gosh. Hey, can I tell you mine first?

386
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,110
Huh?

387
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,620
I think I'm in deep trouble.

388
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,070
His amount of semen isn't the same as before.

389
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,720
Before, when he came in my mouth, it would overflow.

390
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,150
But these days, it's about the same as a small gulp of saliva.

391
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,060
He really comes like a little rat.

392
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,660
Se Yeon, you were a good swallower, huh?

393
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,540
Right. You have to have a taste for it.

394
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,400
Yes, I'm a good swallower.

395
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,350
Maybe it's because I haven't swallowed these days.

396
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,340
I'm having all kinds of thoughts.

397
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,830
I even wondered if another woman could be swallowing them.

398
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,660
I think my girlfriend's cheating on me.

399
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
Girlfriend?

400
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,310
Are you talking about Se Yeon or what?

401
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,520
Se Yeon is my wife.

402
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,090
I'm talking about my girlfriend.

403
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,900
So, you have a wife and a girlfriend?

404
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,740
Yes, that's right.

405
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,100
But that's not the issue right now. The problem is she's cheating on me.

406
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,390
That's the problem? Can that even be an issue?

407
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,590
Hey.

408
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,080
I said my girlfriend is cheating on me!

409
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,820
That means you're also cheating.

410
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,710
Oh, you think I'm a crazy bastard right now.

411
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,650
Sure, that's possible.

412
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,850
However, you can love two people.

413
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,530
You wouldn't get what I'm saying right now.

414
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,810
But you're bound to understand once the time comes.

415
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,640
Mark my words.

416
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,500
You can only love up to two people.

417
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,760
It's not love starting with the third.

418
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,750
I also want to consume some protein.

419
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,720
I should've eaten a lot when I had the chance.

420
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,560
But it was so fishy for me.

421
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,920
Unni, are you serious?

422
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,250
How long has it been since your last time?

423
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,820
Me?

424
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,100
When was it again?

425
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,410
I don't even remember.

426
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,050
Unni, what do we do?

427
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,780
How can you live for years holding back?

428
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,230
I don't hold back.

429
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,900
I'm a grownup, so I take care of it alone.

430
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,210
Unni, please wake up!

431
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,930
That's called safety frigidity.

432
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,290
It's the same as saying

433
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:41,470
you won't be hit or die when there are missiles flying around in the East Sea right now!

434
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,480
When people starve, they start jumping over other house's walls.

435
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,120
You get what I'm saying, right?

436
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,570
I'm sure you're both starved right now.

437
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,510
Be careful.

438
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,190
Hey, you can tell me what you were embarrassed about. What is it?

439
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,800
Yeah.

440
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,960
Jeong Su.

441
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
- I've got a favor to ask of you.
- What is it?

442
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,230
-When it rained a lot last time-
- That's perfect.

443
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,300
I also have a favor to ask of you. Can I go first?

444
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,320
- What is it?
- Come with me to this place right now.

445
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,150
Right now? To where?

446
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,980
You'll have a good time, too.

447
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,380
I need to go with you to make a good alibi.

448
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,340
Where are we going?

449
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,320
L, love it! G, go for it!

450
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,500
L, love it! G, go for it!

451
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,950
L!

452
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,280
G!

453
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,420
Check your messages, Noona.

454
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,190
Whoa, how could we meet like this? What a coincidence!

455
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,250
How can you do this to me, Noona?

456
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,250
You said you like Kia.

457
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,370
L, love it! G, go for it!

458
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,860
Where are you going? Where-

459
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,950
Stay here just a moment!

460
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,620
I really came to watch baseball, and I saw you.

461
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,750
I was really surprised.

462
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,540
I should've hit you up and come with you. What an idiot.

463
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,350
What the heck...

464
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:47,300
I was really surprised because you were cheering for LG.

465
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:53,220
Jeong Su, I like both teams, Kia and LG.

466
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,030
If you're a real baseball fan, it's fine to support both teams.

467
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,860
How can you do that?

468
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,470
Why don't you just support and cheer for all teams if that's the case?

469
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,540
That's just a fickle and crappy fan.

470
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,860
Does that man like LG?

471
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm starting to get grossed out by you now. How can you follow me here?

472
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,400
Noona...

473
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,540
I came to watch baseball, too! See?

474
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,670
I'm so disappointed in you.

475
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,740
Are you going to keep throwing shitty balls at me like this?

476
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,270
You were throwing only strikes, but what happened?

477
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,250
You're in a serious crisis right now if this was baseball.

478
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,050
That was your third ball count, and all bases are filled.

479
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,570
It's a full count. What are you going to do?

480
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,310
Won't you pull yourself together? Do you want to be switched out?

481
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,830
Switched out? That's harsh!

482
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,500
- Will you go home right after watching baseball with that man-
- Jeong-

483
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,210
Su...

484
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,270
Yes, Noona.

485
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,660
Go. I'm going to have some fun and go home. So hurry on home.

486
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,740
You need to think about your wife at home, too.

487
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,480
You'll call me, right?

488
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,370
Okay, okay, I'll call you.

489
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,370
You have to go home today, okay?

490
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,290
I'll rest assured and go now.

491
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,860
- Don't follow me.
- Okay.

492
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,650
I'll watch it on the TV or on my phone.

493
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,110
Gosh, my gosh... Aigoo!

494
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,900
Noona, I'm sorry!

495
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,290
I'll throw only strikes from now on!

496
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,060
Go!

497
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,800
Thanks.

498
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,420
I don't think I could've come and seen this crap all alone.

499
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,700
Why do you think Noona keeps seeing me?

500
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,540
Because you drive a Porsche?

501
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,440
Hey, my noona isn't like that.

502
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,890
Her car's a Bentley, man.

503
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,300
Hey, what are you going to do if you get caught?

504
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,350
I'll never get caught.

505
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,010
That would be betraying my wife, you idiot.

506
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,830
I don't betray.

507
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,010
Gosh, the suspension is different on this.

508
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,660
Your car's so nice. When did you buy it?

509
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,570
- Oh, this?
- Yes.

510
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,250
It's my wife's car.

511
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,710
I bought it for her two months ago on our wedding anniversary.

512
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,140
How nice. You're good to your wife and

513
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,280
to your lover, too.

514
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,890
Samuel, it's about time you got back up now.

515
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,380
Of course, I want to get back up.

516
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,470
Jeong Su, so while we're on the topic-

517
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,500
We both worked so hard.

518
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,410
That's all that matters, man.

519
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,140
Hey, failing once with a startup isn't the end of the world.

520
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,260
Since you failed once, you just have to avoid doing the same.

521
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,240
You and I failed it together, but how are we so different?

522
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,570
You know, I have my in-laws.

523
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,920
Anyhow, I'll contact you again.

524
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,450
So, stop driving the taxi, and let's do something together.

525
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,520
Isn't your Seoul National University degree a waste?

526
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,830
Hey, are Seoul National University graduates not allowed to drive taxis?

527
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,210
Huh?

528
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,820
- Hey, what's the matter? We're friends.
- How could you say that...

529
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,360
You're scaring me. Don't do that.

530
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,440
I can't drive the taxi even if I wanted to.

531
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,370
While you were buying this Porsche, my taxi was flooded and died.

532
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,610
What are you saying?

533
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,310
I'm saying it was flooded and totaled.

534
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,670
My insurance won't even cover it.

535
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,560
Wait, didn't Jin take out a loan to buy it for you?

536
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,270
Jeong Su, that's why I need to ask you for a favor.

537
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,890
I know.

538
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,140
What?

539
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,540
You think I'm that dull?

540
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,490
You know?

541
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,830
Samuel.

542
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,150
Yes.

543
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,080
I consider you to be my only friend.

544
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,340
Thank you so much, Jeong Su.

545
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,640
That's why I don't want to lose you.

546
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,670
I don't think there should be any lending or paying back money between friends.

547
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,920
Honestly, I want to just buy you a taxi. It probably doesn't even cost much.

548
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,840
But what would happen to our relationship, then?

549
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,130
We'll just be uncomfortable as a lender and a borrower.

550
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,020
I'll be good so we don't become a lender and a borrower.

551
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,780
Can I borrow just 20 million won, Jeong Su?

552
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,490
I've been wanting to say this a while back, but you kept cutting me off.

553
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,000
- With that money, I can start again with a used car.
- No, no.

554
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,810
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

555
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,410
No, I can't.

556
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,500
No means no.

557
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,840
What's the matter?

558
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,070
I just took a shower.

559
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,620
I even shaved down there.

560
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,170
Don't you want to see my barren hill?

561
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,770
Good job. It must be hygienic.

562
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,270
Hey, Rim Park Samuel, wake up. It's not the time to sleep.

563
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,080
Why?

564
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,230
Are we what they call a sexless couple?

565
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,970
What's wrong? It's nothing new.

566
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,320
What are you doing right now?

567
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,790
It's natural to suddenly start like this.

568
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,830
This is too sudden. I'm not even ready.

569
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,550
Let's do the stuff other people do, too.

570
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,580
Try to focus here.

571
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,980
I don't like doing it out of the blue like this.

572
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,940
You're doing well, okay?

573
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,980
You're like a marshmallow, and you're getting there.

574
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,550
Gosh, hold on, hold on.

575
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,720
No, you're getting there.

576
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,020
Stop, stop. No more.

577
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,900
What's the matter with you now?

578
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,350
I don't like doing it out of duty like this. Are you doing this because you love me?

579
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,430
Why are you bringing in love now?

580
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,250
It's love when you're together for life.

581
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,010
And love can come while having sex, too!

582
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,940
Do you even know what I ate for dinner last night?

583
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,310
Are you saying I need to know all that to touch your stuff? That's petty!

584
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,930
Let's not do this. I'm really not in the mood for this, Woo Jin. Sorry.

585
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,410
I'm getting suspicious here right now.

586
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,120
Who knows if you're having affairs out there?

587
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,850
There's an old saying that goes, "When people starve, they start jumping over other house's walls."

588
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,120
How could I even fathom having an affair?

589
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,610
Affairs are for people who can afford it, like Jeong Su.

590
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,150
What did you say?

591
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,150
Is Jeong Su having an affair?

592
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,770
Is he?

593
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,310
Apparently so.

594
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,690
This better not be a way out of doing it.

595
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,210
It's not.

596
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,500
Gosh.

597
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,360
Here. Have some honey water.

598
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,860
I saw Jeong Su using two phones.

599
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,900
He has a separate phone he uses for his affair.

600
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,200
Greedy bastard.

601
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,100
Se Yeon was drinking herself to death because of him.

602
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,280
But he made another phone?

603
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,070
This is what Jeong Su said. What was it again?

604
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,710
He said you can...

605
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,040
love up to two people.

606
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,060
But it's not love starting with the third one. What a lunatic.

607
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,150
I think a man's phone is his dick.

608
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,460
Having two phones means having two dicks.

609
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,780
What about deliverymen?

610
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,450
Some have like five phones.

611
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,430
I was saying figuratively.

612
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,220
I was joking, too.

613
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,620
Anyhow, these bastards just become fearless once they make some money

614
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,110
and start having two dicks.

615
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,510
Once I've found out, I won't let it slide.

616
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,810
What are you going to do?

617
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,480
What else? Destroy one of your friend's dicks.

618
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,290
How will you do that? Don't.

619
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,390
I'll tell Se Yeon right away.

620
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,850
- What?
- She was already conflicted because of it.

621
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,910
This is their problem. Let's just look the other way.

622
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,920
I can't do that.

623
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,560
I'm off.

624
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,250
I'm f***ed.

625
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:45,860
[Song Se Yeon]

626
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,110
Hi, Unni. I was about to call you, too.

627
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,380
Se Yeon...

628
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,930
Why? What's wrong?

629
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,110
What? You're the one who's got a problem.

630
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,310
Are you okay, Unni?

631
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,760
What do you mean?

632
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,930
I heard his taxi was flooded.

633
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,220
But it can't even be covered by insurance.

634
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,520
How unfortunate.

635
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,700
Sorry?

636
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:25,010
Samuel asked Jeong Su for some money, but Jeong Su didn't lend him any.

637
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,920
I'm sure Samuel was hurt. What should we do?

638
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,490
I know...

639
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,360
Why?

640
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,140
Why did you come all the way to my house? What is it?

641
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,860
Hey, Jeong Su.

642
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,820
I was in the middle of a chess game for 100,000 won!

643
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,210
Jeong Su, this is bad.

644
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,260
What is it?

645
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,540
My wife found out about your affair.

646
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,920
What?

647
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,870
Get over here!

648
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,160
She said she'd tell Se Yeon.

649
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,090
You know how she is, right? She'll do it if she says so.

650
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,930
You crazy punk, why would you tell her?

651
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,400
I'm sorry. I didn't know my lips were so loose, either.

652
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,150
Have you gone mad?

653
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,360
Are you crazy?

654
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,030
What do we do?

655
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,400
Gosh, I'm f***ed. Totally f***ed. Seriously, f***!

656
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,300
This is nuts.

657
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,980
Gosh, you crazy bastard!

658
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,800
Will you take responsibility for destroying my family?

659
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,950
I came to tell you for your sake so you can prepare in advance.

660
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,780
Hey, this won't do. Where's Woo Jin right now?

661
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,110
Why? I need to meet Woo Jin right now.

662
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,290
- Wait here for a second.
- Hey.

663
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,620
Hey-

664
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,540
Jeong Su! Geez...

665
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,060
Damn it!

666
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,750
What are you doing, asshole? Hurry up and get in!

667
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,300
Should I get on my knees?

668
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,640
Please don't do that.

669
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,610
I'm really going to kneel.

670
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:42,010
- H-Hey-
- No, this is between Woo Jin and me.

671
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,200
Why are you doing this to me? I'm working here.

672
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,220
What a nuisance.

673
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,610
I did have an affair and...

674
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:55,300
my lover was also having an affair.

675
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,390
What you're thinking is true.

676
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,710
Good for you.

677
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,950
I believe Se Yeon needs to know about this as well.

678
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,670
If Se Yeon finds out, she'll be scarred for life.

679
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,410
Why would you make the issue larger?

680
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,640
Why did you do it when you know so well?

681
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,320
I can't look the other way because I have a close friendship with Se Yeon, though it's short.

682
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,610
It'd be violating my philosophy of life.

683
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,300
Philosophy of life?

684
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,760
Yes.

685
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,860
Take him.

686
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,420
Why?

687
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,930
- Hey!
- What's that idiot doing?

688
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,660
Is he going to run away?

689
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:48,540
He came on his own to kneel, and he's suddenly running away?

690
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,290
Hey, he's coming back.

691
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,590
I just went to get my phone.

692
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,430
- What?
- Why come back? You should've just left.

693
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,960
One second. Let me catch a breath before saying important stuff.

694
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,450
What's he doing right now?

695
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,220
What's gotten into you?

696
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:11,310
Could I please be punished for my sins in the form of a fine instead?

697
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,170
- What?
- Sorry?

698
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:18,260
Woo Jin, please make an exception to your life philosophy just this once.

699
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,640
Instead, I'll pay for the price.

700
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,950
I'm imploring you to protect my family right now.

701
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:29,200
Hey, don't cross the line, okay?

702
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,300
You're really something else.

703
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,200
- Money is everything, huh?
- No, I really don't think that.

704
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,450
This is just my last resort.

705
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,210
If I miss this, I'm dead right away.

706
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,810
Don't you see how desperate I am?

707
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,630
Please save me this once.

708
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:50,520
Can't you at least hear the amount I have in mind?

709
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,890
Let's hear you out, then.

710
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,400
How much will you pay me?

711
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,530
What are you doing right now?

712
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,220
Okay, okay.

713
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,320
- Three million won?
- No.

714
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,590
- Thirty million won.
- Thirty million won?

715
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:19,960
It's 30 million won.

716
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,320
This is big money for me, too.

717
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,350
Let me add this in case you misunderstand.

718
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:27,420
I'm absolutely not saying this is the price of your philosophy of life.

719
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:32,660
Thirty million won is just the maximum amount I can give you right now.

720
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:37,420
I need to give you this much at least to be assured.

721
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,050
I know it, too.

722
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:53,420
In your eyes, I'd be nothing more than

723
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,040
a cheater and...

724
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,450
a son of a bitch.

725
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,060
I know it...

726
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,870
but I really want to protect my family.

727
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,230
I know it doesn't make sense.

728
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:15,580
But I really love my wife with all my heart.

729
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,710
I can give both of my eyes to Se Yeon and

730
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:24,960
I can give her my heart, my liver, everything I have.

731
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,350
I see.

732
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,840
I really don't want to lose Se Yeon.

733
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,730
Also, my Young Guk-

734
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:45,800
How could I watch her grow up under divorced parents?

735
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:58,890
I can make the electronic transfer right away.

736
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,650
That's why I brought my phone.

737
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,900
This money really won't cause trouble

738
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,480
b-because it's clean money, Woo Jin.

739
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,220
Jeong Su, stop it. What are you doing? I can't bear to watch you!

740
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,640
Convince her, for my sake, please!

741
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,370
Aigoo.

742
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,630
Fine. Let's do that.

743
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,740
What's gotten into you now?

744
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,170
Aigoo, thank you so much!

745
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,650
Huh?

746
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,420
Jeong Su!

747
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,570
I'm sorry.

748
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:47,360
By chance,

749
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,590
did you do this to me on purpose?

750
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:55,300
Since I wouldn't lend you money, did you resort to threatening me for money?

751
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,760
It's not like that. But I've got nothing to say even if you think so.

752
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,610
Good job.

753
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,130
You're supposed to make money this way, dirty and sly.

754
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:11,630
Since you took my dirty money, you're the same as me.

755
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,250
Don't you go around acting all nice anymore!

756
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,630
Okay, I-I understand.

757
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,750
If you're done with me, get lost and

758
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,730
let's not ever meet again.

759
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,470
I'm really sorry, Jeong Su.

760
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,280
You've taught me a big lesson today.

761
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,790
I'm really not going to trust anyone from now on.

762
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,570
Thank you!

763
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,030
Did he leave?

764
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,650
Why did you do that? That wasn't like you.

765
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,790
We need to get you another taxi, don't we?

766
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,880
How did you find out?

767
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,130
Why did you keep it a secret?

768
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,170
I'm sorry.

769
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,140
Anyhow, there's no need to feel guilty.

770
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,940
He's not even a friend.

771
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,610
He wouldn't even care if you live or die.

772
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:17,030
If you die, he'd come to your funeral just to act kind and give the condolence money.

773
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,430
Look into a car.

774
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,830
We need to get you your job back.

775
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:34,500
We own all the cars here.

776
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,150
Many of the cars are in mint condition.

777
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:41,050
The one you saw on the internet is over there, sir.

778
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,300
But if you find one you like better while looking around...

779
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,450
- Which is totally natural for people, right?
- Right.

780
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,560
If you do, please feel free to let me know at any time.

781
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,250
I'll be more than happy to assist you.

782
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,330
Excuse me, what's the mileage on this car?

783
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:03,840
Oh, my! You know your cars, don't you, ma'am?

784
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,130
This car didn't get driven much. It's got 20,000 km.

785
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,890
Is 20,000 km a lot?

786
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:12,180
Well, 20,000 km is more or less a new car.

787
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,030
Really? How much is it?

788
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,350
Woo Jin, this is a Grandeur.

789
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:21,460
Well, this is a Grandeur, so the price is a bit high.

790
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,950
Honey, this is too much. Are you sure it's okay?

791
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,180
Should I continue your consultation with this car?

792
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,040
Whoa, one moment, please.

793
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,170
Yes, please do.

794
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:38,430
Whoa, you're really cool, ma'am.

795
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,030
Shall we go?

796
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,270
[Seoul]

797
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,460
Woo Jin.

798
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,880
This is a Grandeur.

799
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,620
It's different.

800
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:09,420
Raise the volume.

801
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:18,330
Wow, the speaker is killing it.

802
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,950
It's not easy to maintain this position.

803
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,270
The position where only my butthole is barely covered.

804
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:28,100
But things work out somehow since we live together, right?

805
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,550
- Samuel.
- Huh?

806
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:35,750
We lived diligently all this time, right?

807
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,290
We did. We worked so hard.

808
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:42,480
Whatever we make goes out as interest payment, so we can't even eat properly.

809
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,850
Right, we can't even buy coffee.

810
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:49,360
Isn't it unfair that this is what we get for living diligently and working hard?

811
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,330
Look at us now!

812
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,860
We've got no future, to be honest.

813
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:58,070
No matter how hard we work, this is probably it for us until we die.

814
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,240
What's that?

815
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,500
My blacklist.

816
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,330
Huh? Your blacklist?

817
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,790
I don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky, but I know many people like Jeong Su.

818
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:19,380
People who aren't satisfied with what they have and keep wanting more.

819
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,780
People who even go after what they shouldn't go after?

820
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,490
Let's...

821
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:28,720
not live like this anymore.
