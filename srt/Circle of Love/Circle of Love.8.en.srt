Don't worry.

00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,470
I will definitely keep it a secret for you.

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,470
This is our secret.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,430
Hope I'm not disturbing you.

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,470
Zichen,

12
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,000
I've kept

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,280
what Miss Zhou needs in mind.

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,240
OK.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,670
I thank you on her behalf.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,920
You are the adopted son of the commander.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,320
I never expected that you don't have a maid.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,390
You actually use my maid.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Mr. Xiao, you are really good at teaching maids.

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,920
Rumeng is clever and quick-witted.

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,680
I wonder if I can take her from you.

00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,280
Rumeng,

23
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,590
come out.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,790
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,590
I thought

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,590
that you heard us clearly.

27
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,640
Let me remind you.

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,430
You are just a maid.

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,640
Don't dream

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,070
to become a lady all day long.

31
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,480
Or you'd come to a bad end.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,920
It's my business.

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,230
Don't bother yourself.

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,360
It seems you have recovered.

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,070
You can walk back by yourself.

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,000
How about buying one?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,280
I want two catties.

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,310
Fine. See you.

Please help me.

42
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,200
- Nothing to give you.
- Let me take it.

43
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,590
Have mercy on me, please.

44
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,310
I have nothing to give you.

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,040
Sorry.

Thank you.

- Go away.
- Move aside.

Thank you.

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,800
I bought it at the store ahead.

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,710
Get on.

Sir, take a look at this.

It's pretty good.

57
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,030
Miss, a piece of newspaper?

58
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,590
Let's go.

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,630
Do you know how much I won that day?

60
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,630
Stop.

61
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,080
What are you doing?

62
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,240
I came to deliver food on orders from the governor.

63
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,520
Get inside.

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,840
It was particularly big that day.

65
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,630
Let me tell you.

66
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,680
This is good.

67
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,840
I'll be going home in two days.

68
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,190
This place is not fit for humans.

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
You can leave now.

70
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,680
Hurry up.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,630
It's you.

72
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,520
Your mother sent these pastries.

73

She said it's all your favorite food.

74

My mother is seriously ill.

75
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,190
I'm sorry

76
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,630
for letting her bear the pain of losing a son.

77
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,910
Miss, I know I am doomed.

78
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,150
Before that,

79
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,310
please pass a message to my mother.

80
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,590
Please go ahead.

81
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,400
Don't move.

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,960
What are you going to do?

83
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,680
The Governor's Mansion is heavily guarded.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,030
I use you as a human shield.

85
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,560
I…

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,190
Don't move.

87
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,910
Go.

88
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,750
Move aside.

89
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,870
Let go of me.

90
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,590
Don't move.

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,030
Move aside.

92
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,590
Let go of me.

93
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,400
Don't move.

94
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,040
Don't move.

95
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,120
Xiao Hongye, let me out.

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,630
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

97
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,040
Who are you?

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,720
He is the leader who assassinated Mr. Xiao

99
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,390
at the party.

100
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,190
They wanted to disguise themselves as refugees
and escape from Luo City.

101
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,870
Mr. Xiao had already made arrangements

102
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,190
and captured them all at the city gate.

103
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,870
Stand still. Stand still.

104
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,720
Don't move.

105
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,360
Get out of the way.

106
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,310
Don't move.

107
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,240
- Don't move.
- Stop.

108
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,480
Xiao Hongye, let me out quickly.

109
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,600
You think too highly of me.

110
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,310
I'm just a maid.

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,390
How could the governor

112
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,270
let a murderer go

113
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,600
because of me?

114
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,040
That's right.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,270
You back the wrong horse.

116
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,270
I advise you not to waste your efforts.

117
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,870
Since you're so unimportant,

118
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,120
then you go to hell.

119
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,120
Stop it.

120
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,390
Mr. Xiao,

121
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,510
he has tried to assassinate you several times.

122
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,270
There must be a bigger force behind him.

123
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,480
You can't let him go.

124
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,120
Let him go.

125
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,870
Go.

126
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,720
What's your plan
after leaving the Governor's Mansion?

127
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,070
Xiao Hongye,

128
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,480
prepare a car for me immediately.

129
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,240
Hurry up.

130
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,510
Go handle it.

131
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,480
By the way,

132
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,310
put twenty gold bars,

133
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,070
a gun with one hundred bullets in the car.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,070
Do as he says.

135
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,720
No.

136
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,070
Xiao Hongye,

137
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,070
you can't be so kind to me.

138
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,870
You're right.

139
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,390
I will never let you leave alive.

140
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,310
Rumeng, are you OK?

141
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,240
Xiao Hongye!

142
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,630
Go to hell!

143
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,510
How are you?

144
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,070
Nothing.

145
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,240
Mr. Cheng, you decoct the medicine first.

146
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,430
Leave it to me.

147
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,480
Yes.

148
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,430
Am I too heavy-handed

149
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,600
to tie it tightly?

150
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,600
You're weak as a cat.

151
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,190
It's no big deal.

152
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,120
Sorry.

153
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,310
I know that stealing your jade pendant

154
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,560
and getting close to the murderer make you mad.

155
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,560
So I apologize to you.

156
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,800
This time, I didn't distinguish right from wrong

157
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
and believed the murderer wrongly.

158
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,040
Fortunately, you told me before

159
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,360
I must follow your orders

160
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
in a critical moment.

161
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,270
Your memory is so good.

162
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,270
I also remember

163
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,270
that saving a life is not a life for a life

164
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,720
Don't you remember?

165
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,360
I am the governor.

166
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,270
You are the maid.

167
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,070
Just do as I say.

168
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,680
Never again.

169
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,120
Here. I return it to you.

170
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,920
My hand is injured.

171
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,160
Help me put it back.

172
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,750
It's hard to serve you.

173
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,800
You're saying bad things about me.

174
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,870
I dare not.

175
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,950
There's nothing you dare not do.

176
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,790
Mr. Xiao, the medicine is ready.

177
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,030
You're so fast.

178
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,200
Oh.

179
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,080
I remember

180
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,870
I still have things to do.

181
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,270
Well,

182
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,240
Rumeng.

183
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,150
Sorry to trouble you.

184
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,910
Drink it while it's hot.

185
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,390
I don't drink.

186
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,510
If you don't take good care of your injury,

187
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,200
be careful to end up with a disabled arm.

188
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,390
It's just a minor injury.

189
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,390
Nothing to be afraid of.

190
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,080
Xiao Hongye, you don't want to take medicine.

191
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,000
