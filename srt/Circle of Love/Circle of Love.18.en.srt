00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,560
I sleep on the ground tonight?

134
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480

141
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,070
and you were not afraid of me.

142
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,190
I'm not afraid of you.

143
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,870

I am lucky enough to be alive,

150
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,040
so I can expose you

151
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,070
and stop you from hurting more people.

152
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,270

Dong'er,

161
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,750
you're loyal.

162
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,040
But your loyalty is misplaced.

163
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,120
You will hurt Gu Meng this way.

164
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,120
You're the one who hurt Miss Zhou

165
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,720
and the Gu family.

167
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
that you blew up the Gu's house.

Somebody!

169
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,270
Do you mean

170
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,360
you saw me pull the trigger myself?

171
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,550
Correct.

172
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,670
I didn't see your face clearly.

173
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,000
But I saw you

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
in a bridegroom's suit.
