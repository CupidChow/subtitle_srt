From beginning to end,

193
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,670
Nothing happened

194
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,390
between me and Zhou Zichen.

195
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,750
I have a clear conscience.

196
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,600
Is it really my child?

197
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,960
I killed my own child.

198
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,030
Why didn't you tell me?

199
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240
Why didn't you tell me at that time?

200
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,270
Why didn't you tell me?

201
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,750
You killed my whole family, and my child.

202
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,510
You still wanted me to love you.

203
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,240
Xiao Hongye,

204
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,080
I know

205
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,360
I can't escape from you

206
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,790
no matter what.

207
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,750
I'm unable to kill you either.

208
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm tired.

209
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,790
This life,

210
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,510
let's leave it at that.

211
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,150
Next life,

212
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
don't meet each other again.

213
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:48,910
Rumeng!

214
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,200

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,510

00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,910
Why do you do this?

218
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,420
Meng!

219
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,150

because of the head injury.

227
