24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,030
She's in the small room at the end of the corridor.

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,870
She's waiting for you.

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,710

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,800
The killer must still be in the house.

Why isn't she here?

39

Didn't Dong'er go on a business trip
with your father?

She hasn't.

43
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,470
Why is there blood on the ground?

44
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,840
It's chicken blood.

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,870

Did you hide Dong'er

53
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,400

54

Miss Gu, you are here, too.

Let's go have chicken soup.

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,590
Mr. Xiao,

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,000
I sent our men to search the mansion thoroughly.

58
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,470
The killer hasn't been found yet.

59
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,400
However,

60
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,950
I have a wild guess.

61
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,950
Could that man be…

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,870
Zhou Zichen.

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,000
I remember now.

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,830
This ring is his.

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,920
He's been coveting your position as governor.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,240
And he knows the mansion well.

67
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,600
Now he not only killed Dong'er to silence her,

68
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,190
but wanted to frame you.

69
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,750
Pass on my orders.

70
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,160

71
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, sir.

80
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,310
No way. I have to find Dong'er.

81
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,720

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
You are back…

83
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,630
Mrs. Xiao, I'm Xiaotao.

84
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,920
Why do you all call me Dong'er?

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,040
Do I look like her?

86
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,430
Meng.

87
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,040
Mr. Xiao.

88
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,040
Why are you here with Xiaotao?

89
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,680
I thought it was Dong'er coming back.

90
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,870
They are somewhat alike.

91
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,870
She's always being mistaken for Dong'er.

92
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,390
That servant in the morning

93
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,920
should also mistake her.

94
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,120
You can go now.

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,950
Yes, sir.

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,000
Come here.

97
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,310
Look what I got today.

98

[To my daughter Gu Meng]

99
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a letter from my father.

100
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,270
What did my father-in-law say?

101
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,630
Nothing.

102
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,240
But I catch a glimpse of the task
assigned to me,

103
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,430
saying that before he comes back,

104
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,720
he wants to get the good news.

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,360
Didn't we agree that…

106
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,920

107
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,120

You come to see me tonight.

112
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,310
I'll tell you then.

113
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,430
Meng.

114
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,870
Once upon a time, there was a gardener.

115
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
He took great care of a flower in the garden.

116
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,430
He watered and weeded it every day.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,510
He watched her,

118
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,120
shaded her from the sun during the day

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,510
and accompanied her to watch the moon

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,390
in the evening.

121
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,870
When it thundered and rained,

122
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
he protected her and read poetry to her.

123
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,720
But the flower never bloomed.

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,630
He was very worried.

125
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,190
He bustled around

126
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,310
and looked for the best nourishment for the flower.

127
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,630
But actually his love

128
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,600
is the best nourishment for the flower.

129
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,390
And that flower has already fallen in love with him.
