The wedding is around the corner.

190
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
I have to get rouge and dresses

191
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
ready.

192
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,790
Zichen,

193
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,870
you are going to get married, aren't you?

194
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
When will she be my sister-in-law?

195
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,200
No kidding.

196
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,030
It's just a matter of time anyway.

197
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,000
Hongye, help me pick out the lipstick.

198
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:58,960
OK.

199
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,030
Let's take another look.

200
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,120
I'll take this one.

201
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,480
Look at this.

202
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,270
Take it easy.

203
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,320
You didn't even wipe your hands clean.

204
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,440
This looks good too.

205
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,200
Jiaojiao.

206
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,120
I think this lipstick is especially
suitable for you.

207
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,480
Come on. Let me help you.

208
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,510
Rumeng.

209
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,240
How does the lipstick

210
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,840
I apply for my fiancée look?
