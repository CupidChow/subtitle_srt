You feel better?

Yeah, I'm much better.

Mr. Xiao,

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,590
I didn't save you

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,200
because I wanted something from you.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,350
You saved me from that servant that day.

15
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,400
I remember your kindness.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,000
At the party, I was used as a target.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,400
You hit the apple with one shot and helped me out.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,790
So I thought

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,710
no matter how you treated me before,

20
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,760
I will repay your kindness.

21
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,640

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,590
That's right.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,000
You don't have to offend the commander

25

26
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,310
You heard everything.

00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,840
you can influence my decisions?

31
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,510
My current position

32
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,640
is not relying on a woman.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,520
Fine, I was overthinking.

Mr. Zhou, what are you doing here?

39
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,710
I come here to apologize to you
on behalf of Jiaojiao.

40
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,680
Jiaojiao has always been spoiled at home.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,840
If she caused trouble for you,

42
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,240
please forgive her.

43
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,960
Mr. Zhou,

44
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,400
you helped me.

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,840
I am very grateful to you.

46
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,630
But you are not her.

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,560
You are just her brother.

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,840
If she really thinks she is wrong,

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
let her apologize to me by herself.

50
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,630
You're right.

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,560
As her brother,

52
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,680
I also have the responsibility
for my sister's words and actions.

53
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,120
That's why I came to apologize.

you can find me at Renxin Pharmacy on West Street.

You don't need to decline.

To be honest,

since the last time I saw you,

65
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,520
I felt like old friends with you.

66
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,470
Do you not consider me

they will say Mr. Xiao bullies the weak

82
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,430

No matter what, you'd better advise her gently.

116

The commander saw Jiaojiao crying all night.

117
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,390
He was heartbroken

118
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,720

Are you not going to have a visit?

120

No need. I'm busy.

121
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,070
I know you attend to numerous affairs every day.

122

what right do you have to intervene?

126

Zichen?

150
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,630
You believe everything he says.

151
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,000
It's precisely because I don't believe,

152
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,510

He is so cruel.

191
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,000
My son must be behind the eight ball.

192
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,480
Madam,

193
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,790
the governor is a person
who rewards and punishes clearly.

194
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,630
You can rest assured that he won't…

195
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,240
You know nothing about him.

196
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,000
People of the whole village outside the city

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,910
were all killed by him.

198
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,630
My poor son.

199
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,120
I would rather go with you.

200
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,440
Don't worry, madam.

201
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,030
How can I not be anxious?

202
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,840
Miss,

203
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,080
can you save my son?

204
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,240
Well, I'm afraid not.

205
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,600
She's just a maid.

206
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,630
Madam, don't make it difficult for her.

207
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,790
Could you help my son

208
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,790
have a last meal that I cook

209
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,600
before he is killed?

210
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,720
Miss,

211
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,440
I beg you.

212
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,480
I beg you.

213
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,960
Just give him something to eat.

214
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,320
I beg you. I beg you on my knees.

215
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,390
Madam, please get up first.

216
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,440
Fine.

217
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,870
I'll help you deliver the food.

218
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,440
Great.

219
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,270
I'll bring it to you tonight.

220
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,200
Rumeng, you have a kind heart.

221
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,630
It's no bother.

222
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,720
As for something else,

223
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,120
I can't help her.

224
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,030
Don't worry.

225
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,840
I will definitely keep it a secret for you.

226
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,720
This is our secret.

227
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,790
Hope I'm not disturbing you.
