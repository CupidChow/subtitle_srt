00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,280
What are you doing?

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,790
We are taking a bath.

9
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,110
You are taking a bath?!

10
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,430
Hongye said

11
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,640
he likes me serving him like this.

12
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,560
I don't believe it.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,040
It must be you who seduced Hongye.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,400
You get me wrong.

15
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,840
Mr. Xiao just said

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,040
he wanted me.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,480
Miss Zhou,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,870
we are sisters in the future.

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,200
Hongye, is that true?

20
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,070
I won't allow this woman to marry into this Mansion.

21
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,790
My father wouldn't agree either.

22
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,790
Hongye, you can't keep her.

23
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,070
Drive her away quickly.

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,000
There is no chance for her to be married.

25
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,840
At most, she can be a concubine.

26
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,640
What?

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
Since that's the case,

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,870
Hongye,

30
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,520
let me teach Rumeng

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,240
the rules of being a concubine.

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,000
OK.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,870
I'm telling you.

34
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,680
Like you, the lowest maid,

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,800
don't expect to have any status.

36
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,710
Don't even think about having children.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,960
Well,

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,240
have you ever heard of this saying?

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,470
What?

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,310
A concubine is better than a wife.

41
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,590
An affair is better than a concubine.

42
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,630
I don't have any status now,

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
but in the future,

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,630
Mr. Xiao will be obsessed with me,

45
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,400
both physically and mentally.

46
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,240
Even if you will be the legal wife

47
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,870
and have many children,

48
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,710
he won't even give you a second glance in the end.

49
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,520
You're dreaming.

50
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
At the Governor's Mansion, I am always the hostess

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,910
and you are a maid.

52
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,630
I'm telling you.

53
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,030
As long as I stay in the Governor's Mansion
for a day,

54
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,430
sooner or later I will be a lawful wife.

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,710
Do you think you can stay here

56
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,630
as you wish?

57
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,630
You don't deserve it.

58
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,030
Whether I deserve it or not

59
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,870
depends on Mr. Xiao.

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,280
If you can make the decision,

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,710
how could I still stay here?

62
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,240
Probably,

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,190
you act according to Mr. Xiao's wishes.

64
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,120
You're talking nonsense.

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,470
Do you think I can't drive you away?

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,400
You only know how to talk big.

67
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,520
If you are capable,

68
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,190
kick me out.

69
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,240
OK.

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,800
I'll send you out of the mansion right now.

71
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,520
Somebody.

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,240
No need.

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,310
I'll go by myself.

74
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,280
What are you going to do?

75
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,030
I'll send you out of the Governor's Mansion.

76
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,030
You can never go back.

77
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,750
Beat her to death and throw her out.

78
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,360
Yes.

79
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,310
Stop it.

80
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Hongye,

81
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,960
well, I…

82
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,390
Mr. Xiao,

83
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,680
I'm afraid

84
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,000
my life is coming to an end.

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
It seems that you are seriously injured this time.

86
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,040
If I don't go to the hospital,

87
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,390
I'm afraid

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,510
I can't make it through tonight.

89
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you want me to prepare a car for you?

90
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,000
So you can escape

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,870
quickly

92
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,190
on the way to the hospital.

93
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,800
Isn't that what you wanted?

94
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,070
With your little tricks,

95
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,040
you still want to cheat me?

96
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,000
Xiao Hongye!

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,270
What do you want?

98
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,830
From waking up until now,

99
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,720
you can't escape, and you can't resist.

100
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,920
You

101
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,310
sowed discord,

102
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,560
irritated Miss Zhou

103
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,310
and tortured your own body.

104
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,600
You really haven't rested for a moment.

105
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,800
Since you already know all this,

106
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,920
why can't you let me go?

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,510
Because you are my maid.

108
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,480
So what?

109
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,190
So without my permission,

110
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,000
you can never escape in your life.

111
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,120
I advise you to give up on this idea.

112
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,000
Your life and death

113
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,000
is up to me.

114
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,000
Fine.

115
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,430
I give up.

116
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,480
I understand now.

117
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,680
You enjoy torturing me.

118
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,070
Since I can neither beat you

119
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,270
nor run away

120
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,600
and you've seen through all my moves,

121
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,430
I just give up.

122
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,680
It doesn't matter to be a maid or a concubine,

123
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,870
do whatever you want.

124
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Don't worry.

125
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,480
I'll think about carefully

126
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,800
how to enjoy it.

127
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,000
Clean it.

128
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,310
Rumeng, you must be anxious.

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,830
Save some energy.

130
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,120
You'll have plenty of time to scream later.
