188
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,960
as long as I destroy the face of Rumeng,

189
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,120
you will pay off my gambling debts?

190
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,870
And

191
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,000
you asked me to get someone last time

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,080
to defile Rumeng.

193
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,120
Please.

194
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,630
You can't leave me alone.

195
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,440
Or the governor will beat me to death.

196
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,080
Shut up!

197
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,480
Miss Zhou, you can't do this to me.

198
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,200
Mr. Xiao! Mr. Xiao! I was wrong.

199
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Mr. Xiao, I was wrong.

200
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
I was wrong, Mr. Xiao.

201
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,720
Go.

202
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,200
Mr. Xiao, she put me up to it.

203
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,150
Mr. Xiao, she did it.

204
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,960
She did it.

205
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,600
Mr. Xiao, I was wrong.

206
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,480
What do you have to say?

207
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,320
Yeah, that's right.

208
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,750
So what if I did it?

209
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,750
That girl is trying to seduce you.

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,630
I am just trying to teach her a lesson.

211
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,270
What right do you have to teach my maid?

212
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,960
Hongye, I am your fiancée.

213
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,360
In this house,

214
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,870
don't I have the right to make decisions?

215
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,510
This house?

216
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,390
Make decisions?

217
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,080
You're staying here too long.

218
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,790
You have the illusion of being a hostess, don't you?

219
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,440
What do you mean?

220
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
It's been many days.

221
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,840
You should go back.

222
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,790
Xiao Hongye,

223
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,670
my father is the commander.

224
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
How dare you kick me out?

225
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,080
Cheng Ming,

226
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,600
send her back.

227
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,630
Xiao Hongye,

228
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,510
you actually drive me away because of a maid.

229
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,120
I'm telling you, I won't let her go.

230
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,870
Miss Zhou, the car is ready.

231
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,000
Let me help you.

232
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,080
This is the ancestral medicine of my family.

233
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,390
It won't leave a scar.

234
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,550
Does it hurt?

235
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,510
No.

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,240
You are still trying to be brave at this time.

237
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,440
If I say it hurts,

238
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,440
