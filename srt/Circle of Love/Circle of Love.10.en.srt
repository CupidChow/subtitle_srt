00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,150
I didn't mean it.

8
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,790
I really didn't mean to.

9
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,520
Rumeng…

10
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,430
I didn't mean it.

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,470
Rumeng, don't be afraid.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,960
Rumeng…

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
I'm here. I'm here. Rumeng…

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,520
I really didn't…

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,030
I am here.

00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,200
Rumeng…

00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,150
I didn't…

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,350
You are the adopted son of the commander.

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
But you are not properly dressed now
just because of taking care of a patient.

20
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,230
Look at your dark circles.

21
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,230
Does the patient make you worried?

22
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,350
Or were you sleepless

23
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,840
because I was taking care of the patient?

24
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,150
It is none of your business.

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
You should go back, right?

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,150
Hongye,

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,470
Zichen was ordered by my father

28
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,030
to help us prepare for the wedding.

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,360
I'm going to fetch some water for Rumeng.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,080
Zichen,

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,800
when did you become so concerned about Rumeng?

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,430
Do you like her?

33
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,470
Or do you want to take her?

34
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,680
That's right.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,190
I do like Rumeng.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,310
I don't care if she is a maid.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,520
If Rumeng is willing,

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,120
of course, I want to marry her.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,190
I didn't expect you to be so affectionate.

40
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,840
Jiaojiao,

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
I also want to get some food for Rumeng.

42
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,470
OK.

43
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,190
Let me take you there.

44
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,800
Mr. Xiao,

45
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,960
why are you here?

46
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,120
You're disappointed

47
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,680
to see me.

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,750
Mr. Xiao,

49
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,680
it was my fault

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,310
yesterday.

51
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,120
I apologize to you.

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,750
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,150
But the dead cannot be brought back to life.

54
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,470
You have to look forward.

55
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,280
They certainly don't want to see

56
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,080
you've been in pain

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
and in grief.

58
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,470
It's all over.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,840
That's good.

60

64
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,120
and have many children.

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,190
You also want me to be happy

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,720
and have many children?

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Sure.

68
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,600
As a maid,

69
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,680
of course, I hope you can be happy.

70
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,800
I'm asking you.

71
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,040
Me?

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,070
Aren't you the one who wants to get married?

The water will be ready soon.

77
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,390
Finally, the fever is gone.

78
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,630
Mr. Xiao, Rumeng is weak now.

79
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,750
No matter what mistakes she made,

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
please don't blame her anymore.

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,390
Lie down.

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Don't catch a cold.

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,390
Mr. Zhou is very good at taking care of people.

84
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,120
You are a perfect match.

85
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,560
Take good care of yourself.

86
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,870
Don't let down

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,600
Hongye,

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,830
this is the snack I prepared for our wedding.

90
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,630

This is too sweet.

93
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,630
The shape is not very good.

94
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,240
Didn't I order a lot?

95
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,430
Get them all for me.

96
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,480
Rumeng,

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,920
you have just recovered.
Do not exhaust yourself.

98
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,630
How many plates are left? Let me help you.

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,560
I'm fine.

100
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,630
I can do it myself.

101
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,510
Taste this.

102
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,070
Look at you.

103
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,000
It's all over your mouth.

104
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,190
Hongye, I've made my choice.

105
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,160
This one and that one.

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,950
What do you think?

107
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,160
It's up to you.

108
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,510
I'm on it.

109
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,560

110
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,750
Don't you have to prepare for the wedding later?

111
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,070
Let Rumeng help you.

112
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,680

are prepared by Hongye for me.

The wedding only takes one night.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Do I need all this?

118
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,800
If there's too much for you,

119
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
you can get married more times.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,390
You…!

121
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,720
I know you're upset.

122
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,630
But you are just a maid.

123
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,830
You'll never be better than me.

124
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,190
What are you waiting for?

125
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,510
Comb my hair quickly.

126
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,070
This is not conspicuous enough.

127
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,560
This one.

128
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,630
A good woman

129
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,240
deserves better.

130
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,630
Do you understand, Rumeng?

131
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,510
Rumeng,

132
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,430
are you trying to kill me?

133
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
You even can't comb my hair well.

134
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,510
You moved.

135
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,270
How dare you!

136
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,240
It doesn't matter if you are clumsy.

137
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,720
But you are stubborn.

138
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,670
You are a maid.

139
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,030
How dare you ignore my words!

140
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,270
How dare you!

141
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,510
I'll skin you.

142
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,390
Zhou Jiaojiao!

143
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,150
How dare you call me by my name!

144
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,670
Stop it!

145
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,000
Rumeng,

146
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,720
are you hurt?

147
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,910
I'm fine.

148
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,200
Are you OK?

149
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,270
Hongye,

150
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,550
I asked her to comb my hair.

151
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,510
She almost pulled my hair out.

152
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,440
I gave her a scolding.

153
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,080
She lost her temper

154
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,390
and started fighting me.

155
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,670
Look what she did to my face.

156
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,910
You started it.

157
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,440
You…!

158
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,750
I don't care. Hongye.

159
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,840
Beat her up.

160
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
Beating a maid

161
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,030
will make my hands dirty.

162
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,240
Look, your hair is all messed up.

163
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,550
Go comb your hair.

164
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,720
No way.

165
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
I can't get over it.

166
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
Then how do you want to relieve your anger?

167
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,510
I want to scratch her face.

168
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,000
Mr. Xiao,

169
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,870
it's not that serious.

170
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,870
I haven't disciplined my maid.

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,030
What's your hurry?

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,150
You are not satisfied

173
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,480
with what Rumeng did

174
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
and you hate her.

175
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,390
keeping her around

176
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,960
only makes you angry.

177
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,150
Mr. Xiao,

178
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,200
how about giving her to me?

179
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,960
You want her?

180
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,030
Then you have to ask her

181
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,270
if she'd like to go with you.

182
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,320
Mr. Xiao,

183
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,390
I would like to go with Zichen.

OK.

Don't come back if you leave.
