Mr. Xiao, don't worry.

8
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,320
Today is Miss Gu's wedding day.

9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,000
All men are gathering in Gu's house.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,710
I have planted the bomb

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,790

12

When the time comes,

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,470
none of the Gu family can run away.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,430
By then,

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,710
your revenge can be taken.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,350
These years of hardship and suffering

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,390

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,790
go defuse the bomb.

20
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,840
It will explode in a few minutes.

No wonder the bomb detonated prematurely.

Someone used us on purpose.

What's more,

34
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,190
I suspect that Gu Meng

35
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,400
was taken in by that man

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,630
and trained to be a killer.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
A series of assassinations followed

38

41
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,280
Now only Dong'er has seen that man.

42
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,030
She's our only clue.

43
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,910
Leave it to me.

44
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,840
You can rest assured.

45
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,870
Find him as soon as possible.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,080

the man behind this harmed both you

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,000

Just like today,

61
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,400

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,750

65
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,630
Miss Gu depends on you a lot today.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,910
Looks like your injury

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,280

I'm helping you.

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,470
Although you bled badly,

73
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,190
you just has

74
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,750
a superficial injury.

75
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,520
In ancient times, the emperor teased soldiers

Are you not taking care of me anymore?

91
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,270

didn't you say I was your wife?

98
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,480
But you even scheme against your wife like this.

Hongye.

195
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,080
You are awake.
Why don't you sleep a little longer?

196
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,440
Because I found you wake up.

197
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,440
You haven't slept well recently.

198
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,270
I've sent someone

199
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,600
to prepare some ways to calm the nerves.

200
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,870

you will get black circles.

Mr. Xiao,

203
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,600
there is something that you have to deal with.

204
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,030
I'll be right back.

205
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,510
Drink it up and don't leave any behind.

based on Donger's confession.

208
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
His face can't be seen clearly.

209
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,030
But it looks like he's wearing a special ring.

210
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,600
This ring…

211
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
I seem to have seen it somewhere.
