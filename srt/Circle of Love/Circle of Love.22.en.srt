192
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,320
What does it have to do with me?

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,440
The commander was killed by you

194
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,790
in full view of the public.

195
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,630
Xiao Hongye, stop struggling!

196
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,480
I've got you surrounded.

197
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,630
You can't get away with this.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,080
Fold your hands for capture.

199
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,960
Mr. Xiao.

200
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,360
Cheng Ming,

201
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:37,870
what's going on?

202
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,870
We were attacked.

203
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,480
Let's go.

204
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,000
Come on.

205
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,910
Mr. Xiao, come on.

206
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,910
Go.

207
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,200
Meng.

208
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,790
Leave me alone.

209
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,320
Xiao Hongye,

210
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,200
I know you're around here.

211
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,510
Give me the military seal.

212
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,030
I'll let you go.

213
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,720
Otherwise,

214
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,000
don't blame me for being heartless.

215
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,120
Hongye,

216
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,870
don't come out.

217
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,510
Don't worry about me.

218
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,840
Mr. Xiao,

219
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,200
you can't go out.

220
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,390
Let go of me.

221
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,270
I have to save her.

222
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,670
Mr. Xiao,

223
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,390
going out won't help.

224
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,270
Gu Meng is in my hand.

225
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,440
I only count to three.

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,550
One,

227
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,510
two,

228
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,600
three.

229
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,000
