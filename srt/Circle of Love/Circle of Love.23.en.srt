Hongye…

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,600
I'll give you the seal.

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:45,640
Let her go.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,280
You are really sincere.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,150
Then I'll fulfill your wish

Hongye,

17
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,310
I can't be with you when I am alive.

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,790
Now I'm gonna die,

Mr. Xiao,

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,150
are you OK?

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,710
I'm fine.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,790
Didn't you say you were going to take me away?

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Why did you do that?

27
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,950
I'm doing all of this

28
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,040

29
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,400
You killed the commander

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,950
for me?

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,560
You tried to kill Xiao Hongye

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,680
and seize military power for me?

33
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,680
Gu Meng,

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,950
why don't you wake up?

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,920
I killed the commander

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,040
and framed Xiao Hongye,

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,840
so I could hold him back.

38
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,960

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,190
like this,

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,960
can you break away from his control.

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,150

who can do whatever he wants,

44
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,470
will he let you go easily?

46
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,870

Have you forgotten what you said

51
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,800
two years ago when I saved you

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
from the water?

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,000
You said you survived the explosion

54
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,280
and you would live well

55
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,800
to avenge your family.

56
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
During those two years,

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,120
with my special training,

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
you worked hard day and night.

59
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,910
You never had a day to slack off.

60
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,430
I was also with you day and night.

61
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Only I know how hard it was for you.

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,190
Then,

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,870
with a strong will

64
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,630
and the determination for revenge,

65
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,750
you succeeded in becoming an excellent killer.

66
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,240
Now

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,630
you've recalled everything.

68
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,240
You also have a chance to kill the enemy.

69
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,520
But being fooled by Xiao Hongye's love

70
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,470
that is full of lies and deceit,

71
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,910
you want to give up

72
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,150
and leave.

73
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,870

to your father who died tragically?

How do you explain it to all those

75
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,150
who were killed in your family?

76
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,240
How do you explain it to your aborted child?

77

we cannot have sympathy

for our enemy.

80
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,870
We can't let him get away with it.

81
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,840
Even if we have to search the whole city,

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,470
we must find him,

83
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,400
and kill him.

84
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,870
Well,

85
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,600
what do we do next?

86
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,160
I have an idea

87
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,920
to get him to come forward.

88
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,240
I just need you

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
to put on a good show with me.

90
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,800
Uncuff me.

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,510
Mr. Xiao,

92
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,830
please calm down.

93
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,680
We managed to get out of the secret passage.

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,160
Are you trying to defy me, Cheng Ming?

95
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,040
Uncuff me.

96
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,800
Mr. Xiao,

97
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,270
we need to take the long view.

98
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,720
You can't act on impulse.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,240
Mr. Xiao, if you go out now, you will die.

100
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,310
Even if I will die,

101
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,270
I can't leave her alone

102
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,390
in such a dangerous place.

103
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,950
Do you understand?

104
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,120
Mr. Xiao, although Miss Gu is arrested,

105
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,630
as long as she's useful,

106
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,000
there is room for maneuver.

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,190
But if you died,

108
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,070
for Miss Gu,

109
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,630
that would be a desperate situation.

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,160
Get away.

111
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,390
Extra! Extra!

112
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,070
Mutiny happened last night.

113
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,190
Xiao Hongye killed the commander

114
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,190
and fled.

115
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,120
The new commander will hold a grand wedding
tomorrow.

116
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,560
Mr. Xiao,

117
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,430
we already know that

118
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,870
the commander

119
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,160
was poisoned by Zhou Zichen secretly.

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
This wedding

121
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,560
is a trap to force you to show up.

122
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,870
I don't care that it would be a trap.

123
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,630
Even if it means going through fire and water

124
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,040
and risking my life,

125
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,800
I will save her.

126
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,000
In that case,

127
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,190
I'll go with you.

128
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,270
Cheng Ming,

129
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,510
you don't have to.

130
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,390
Since you gave me some food on the roadside

131
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,630
eight years ago,

132
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,800
my life has been yours.

133
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
Cheng Ming,

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,630
you don't owe me.

135
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,430
This is my own business.

136
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,630
I owe Meng.

137
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,870
Listen to me.

138
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,630
Have you finished checking it?

139
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,040
It's real.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,040
It's real. Please come in.

141

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,800
Do you take this beautiful lady

143
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,830
to be your wife?

144
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,160
Will you be loyal to her

145

149
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,070

150
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,720

151
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,750
to be your husband?

152
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,430

All the guests present,

158
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,430

159

about today's wedding?

If not,

161
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,240
I now pronounce…

162
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
I don't agree.

163
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,200
Isn't this Xiao Hongye?

165

I'll take you home.

By yourself?

167
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,030
Zhou Zichen,

168
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,790
your position as commander

169
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,840
is not justified.

170
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,080
How could you take it with peace of mind?

171
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,030
That's my business.

172
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,790
You don't have to worry about it.

173
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,630
I can give you the seal.

174
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,480
Oh?

175
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,200
This proposal

176
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,510
is tempting.

177
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,390
As long as you let me take Meng away,

178
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,840
I can give up anything.

179
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,840

will also be more stable.
