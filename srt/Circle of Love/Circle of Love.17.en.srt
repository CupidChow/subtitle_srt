OK.

192
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,750
Miss?

193
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,870
She's still alive.

194
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,910
Why does she stay together

195
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,240
with that murderer?

196
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
Sir, please.

197
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,200
Miss, please feel free to take a look.

198
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,200
These are the styles recommended by the owner.

199
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,510
Which one do you think is better for me?

200
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,670
Let me see.

201
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,200
I think these two suit you very well.

202
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,000
Do you want to try it?

203
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,120
OK.

204
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,120
Excuse me.

205
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,000
Come this way, please.

206
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,630
He has a good taste.

207
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,080
He picked the one I liked.

208
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,720
Miss, Miss, I'm Dong'er.

209
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,790
Why are you with Xiao Hongye?

210
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,240
He killed your whole family that year.
