00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,560
She's still alive.

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,280
It seems in the past two years

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,240
she has suffered a lot for revenge.

10
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,670
Who are you?

11
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,200
Memory loss?

12
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,760
The kindness to my enemy's daughter

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,790
is a trampling of the dignity of my family.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,640
Why am I here?

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,120
Why am I being handcuffed?

16
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,760
Oh.

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,870
You have amnesia.

18
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,590
What do you want?

19
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,120
Gu Meng.

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,120
I have to say

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,710
your acting is really wonderful.

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,430
Gu Meng?

23
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,310
Continue.

24
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,870
I want to see

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,230
how much you have learned in these two years.

26
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,430
I don't understand what you're saying.

27
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,120
I'm losing my patience.

28
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,070
If you keep doing this,

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,400
I'll have someone carry you out.

30
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,280
Since you think I'm acting,

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,230
is it useful for me to say more?

32
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,200
I warn you.

33
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,310
About your purpose,

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,760
I think you and I both know very well.

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,400
I advise you to tell me the truth.

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,000
Otherwise…

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,280
Kill me as you wish.

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,910
Mr. Xiao,

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
here's an urgent report from the commander.

40
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,630
Gu Meng?

41
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,630
You offended the governor.

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,030
How dare you escape?

43
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,400
Who are you?

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,150
Me?

45
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,030
I am Xiao Hongye's fiancée,

46
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,710
the future hostess of the Governor's Mansion.

47
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,800
Xiao Hongye?

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
The person who handcuffed me?

49
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,430
Stop it!

50
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,310
Why are you all standing here?

51
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,150
Go catch her.

52
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,630
Got it.

53
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,590
What are you going to do?

54
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,800
Miss…

55
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,240
Stop.

56
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,070
Let me go.

57
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,190
The game has just begun.

58
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,800
How can I let you go?

59
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
To tell you the truth.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,270
Whether you remember or not

61
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,680
is not important

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,720
to me.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,310
What on earth are you going to do?

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,190
You are my maid Rumeng.

65
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,270
Of course, I will do whatever I want.

66
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,830
Maid? Rumeng?

67
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,680
Didn't you say my name is Gu Meng?

68
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,560
It seems your ears

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,480
are as useless as your brain.

70
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,870
You…

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,270
Is this how you treat a maid?

72
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,120
You treat me like an enemy.

73
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,120
Go ahead.

74
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,830
From the moment I woke up,

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,600
you were threatening to hit and kill me.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,720
What else could I be if I'm not an enemy?

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,720
You've tried to climb into my bed several times.

78
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,120
How can I not hate you?

79
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,190
That's impossible.

80
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,070
You…

81
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,240
Let go of me.

82
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,480
Xiao Hongye, you might as well kill me.

83
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,240
Let me go.

84
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,630
You…

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,070
If you die,

86
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,120
I will have no maid.

87
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,560
Rumeng!

88
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,680
Rumeng!

89
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,190
Rumeng… Mr. Xiao needs you.

90
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,240
Don't move. Answer my questions directly.

91
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,680
Who am I?

92
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,390
You…

93
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,390
You are Rumeng.

94
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,240
How could I have amnesia?

95
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,830
You… You wish you could soar to great heights

96
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,680
and become the concubine of the governor.

97
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,430
After being rejected by Mr. Xiao,

98
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,800
you bred hatred from love

99
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
and wanted to assassinate him at the ball.

100
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,800
When Mr. Xiao caught you,

101
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,430
you bumped your head.

102
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,870
Tell me the truth.

103
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,390
Rumeng,

104
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,480
we are both maids.

105
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,190
Why would I lie to you?

106
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,510
Why do you have to make things difficult for me?

107
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,310
Please…

108
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,040
Hongye, look how ruthless she is.

109
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,680
My father has never beaten me like this before.

110
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,600
Why do you have to keep this maid in the mansion?

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,480
She is useful.

112
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,240
Could it be that you like her?

113
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,600
Anyway, drive her away quickly.

114
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,430
How about you go home first?

115
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,000
Hongye, we haven't set a date for our wedding yet.

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't explain to my father if I go back now.

117
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,070
Did I let you go?

118
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,870
What? Do I have to feed you?

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,950
You are just a lowly maid.
Don't you understand the rules?

120
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,870
How dare you speak to Hongye like that?

121
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,000
OK.

122
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,320
Mr. Xiao, do you have any other orders?

123
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
Pick up food for me.

124
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,790
Is this how I used to serve you?

125
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,720
You used to be more obedient.

126
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,600
I haven't heard

127
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,670
amnesia can also change a person's personality.

128
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm just curious

129
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,870
why a lowly and obedient maid

130
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,030
has such martial arts?

131
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,440
You have two faces.

132
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,080
You are greedy for vanity.

133
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,200
You have hidden evil intentions.

134
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,510
That's why you're a lowly maid.

135
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,030
Mr. Xiao, you have such a high opinion of me.

136
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,000
I appreciate it.

137
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,270
This drink is for you.

138
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,030
It would be a shame

139
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,790
to waste such good food.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,840
Let me go.

141
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,270
Eat.

142
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,440
Eat.

143
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,440
You're so eager to throw yourself at me.

144
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,390
In your dream, Xiao Hongye.

145
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,510
You… Let go of me.

146
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,440
Since it's your wish,

147
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,240
