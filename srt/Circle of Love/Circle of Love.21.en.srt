Xiao Hongye,

189
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,440
be sure to make me

190
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,910
the happiest woman in this world.

191
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,000
You killed my family.

192
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,240
Why did you do this?

193
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,270
Let her go.

194
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,600
So you betrayed me.

195
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,440
Get out of here.

196
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,840
Meng,

197
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
the fever's gone.

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Is there anything else wrong?

199
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm fine.

200
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,630
I'm glad you're OK.

201
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,030
I don't want to lose you again.
