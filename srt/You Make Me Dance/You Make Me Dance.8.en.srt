00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:04,260
are connected by a red thread between their little fingers.

158
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,250
That thread can't be untied even if one wants to,

159
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,880
nor can it be tied to someone else's finger.

160
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,050
Just like in the story of "The Red Thread of Fate," you and I met.

161
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,860
And that's how we became, "us."

162
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,610
I love you.

163
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,130
♫ Can you stay by my side, just for today? ♫

164
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,890
♫ Even if you don't love me anymore ♫

165
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,950
You make me dance.

166
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:20,650
You make me dance.
[You Make Me Dance]

167
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,550
♫ I didn't know what love was ♫

168
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,450
♫ But it came to me in one instant ♫

169
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:41,670
♫ Whenever I see you, my heart is aflutter all day.
How come I feel this way?  ♫

170
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,950
♫ We met too often for it to be a coincidence ♫

171
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,840
♫ Each time, I ended up figuring out ♫

172
00:17:51,840 --> 00:18:01,020
♫ That you are my love. I want to go to you now ♫

173
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,520
♫ I love you, want to be with you ♫

174
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,220
♫ My heart is pounding whenever I see you ♫

175
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,960
♫ For some reason, I feel happy when I look at you ♫

176
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,300
♫ And I smile immediately ♫

177
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,880
♫ I need you. If I could live ♫

178
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,690
♫ staying by your side only looking at you, it would be nice ♫

179
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:36,460
♫ Can you tell me that you love me now? ♫

180
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,220
♫ I want to be in your embrace ♫
