00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,950
What an interesting birthday I'm having.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,570
Mr. Jin Hong Seok?

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,220
I'm not Jin Hong Seok.

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,920
Is that so? That can't be, though. I'm sure you're Jin Hong Seok.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,110
M-My name is Song Shi On. I think you've got the wrong person.

10
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,030
Hello, Customer Song Shi On.

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,950
I'm Manager Jin Hong Seok, at Chachacha Capital.

12
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,900
What are you doing right now?

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,160
Customer management.

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,740
Don't you know that trust is everything between a debtor and his creditor?

15
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,420
Huh?

16
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,690
Just what are you doing? Hey, hey wait!

17
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,730
Let me down quickly!

18
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,400
You do know that what you're doing right now is illegal, right?

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,170
If you don't let me go, I'll report this to the police!

20
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,240
You not paying back money is what's illegal here, you punk!

21
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,360
Manager, we should stop wasting our energy and start wrapping things up.

22
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,230
All right. In that case, I can dirty one finger and get it done.

23
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,020
The railing is already pretty low, I can solve this with a little push of my finger. Come here.

♪ Hide well, or I might see your hair ♪

25
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,130
One month.

26
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,430
Please, give me just one month.

27
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,260
You see, I have a really big audition next month.

28
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,590
And if I get the lead role, I can pay back all the money in one go. Please.

29
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,900
- Please.
- Ah, this bastard, using an excuse again.

30
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,450
Hey! It's not like that audition is a winning lottery ticket.

31
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,240
Manager, let's just get this done with, shall we?

32
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,110
The lead role?

33
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,650
Do you have a way to guarantee that you'll get it?

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,490
Yes, dance.

35
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,350
My dance.

36
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,970
Every time I dance, my mom comes to my mind.

37
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,930
My muse.

38
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,510
What do you want to become when you grow up, Shi On?

39
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,400
I'm going to become a beautiful dancer, just like you, Mom.

40
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,380
Shi On, you like dancing, don't you?

41
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,000
Mom, congratulations on your wedding!

42
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,560
You're really pretty today.

43
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,330
Congrats on your twentieth birthday.

44
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,990
I'm an adult now, so you don't have to worry anymore.

45
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,860
I'm sorry, Shi On.

46
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,040
Even without me around, you'll do well. Right?

47
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,260
Now you are an adult, too.

48
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,160
Darling!

49
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,630
Shi On, wait for a bit. I'll be back soon.

50
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:13,980
Although my muse is gone, I still have my dance.

51
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:39,700
To me, dance is a longing that I cherish in my heart.

52
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,670
You cried, right?

53
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,970
No, I didn't. Why would I cry?

54
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,280
I just got some dust in my eye. Because you kept running all around the room.

55
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,780
Come on, you did cry.

56
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,890
I told you I didn't!

57
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,350
It's salty. So it really is a tear.

58
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,020
How many times do I have to tell you that I got dust in my eyes?

59
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,960
Ah, dust?

60
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,320
There isn't any. Anyway, you did cry,

61
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,790
so you're giving me a month.

62
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,020
Promise?

63
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,010
Star Family, you've heard that it will be snowing heavily tonight, haven't you?

64
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:49,900
My heart flutters and I'm so excited about it. Please send me all your stories full of such fluttering excitement.

65
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,270
And I will make sure to share all your stories with everyone.

66
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,750
It's my birthday today. I only got wishes from business companies.

67
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,230
Can you just wish me a Happy Birthday?

68
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,640
The worries of love. "Shh! Love Secret."

69
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,710
Don't you think the world's most heartwarming word is "us"?

70
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,600
Like when you and I become "us." Now, let me tell you a secret.

71
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,270
Did you know that the worse your first encounter with someone was, the higher the chances you have of falling in love with them?

72
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm Manager Jin Hong Seok, at Chachacha Capital.

73
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,710
It really was the worst!

74
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,760
She keeps saying useless things! She could wish me a happy birthday instead.

75
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,670
You extended the deadline without permission,

76
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,040
and you had no guarantor either.

77
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,140
What the hell are you trying to do?

78
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,400
You know I like you, right?

79
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,570
So don't keep disappointing me. Please?

80
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,260
Tell me about our policy regarding late payments, article 1, section 3.

81
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,090
It takes twice as long as the pay period for a debtor to repay the loan.

82
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:38,130
So, push it back by a month and it becomes two months, by two months and it becomes four months. And then a year.

83
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,900
If you keep going soft on the debtors like this, you will never leave this place.

84
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:50,320
How about just staying here with me for the rest of your life?

85
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,060
I will take responsibility for this, and resolve it by all means.

86
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,490
In that case,

87
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,040
go and get a guarantor's name immediately.

88
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,510
To SmileNagyeong, congratulations on your new job. And to Circle Mom, please be strong.

89
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,580
Congratulations to Aurora Chan Hee and Pink Mood!

90
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,690
Well, it's about time for me to finish. See you all again tomorrow!

91
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,200
Look at the stars and have a good night.

92
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,720
What? She's going to end it without even wishing me a happy birthday?

93
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,120
Hey. Hey! Oh! Oh!
