So, General Manager Jin has been living at a place like this?

6
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,160
It does hurt my pride to see this.

You're here already?

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,880
How did the shoot go? It wasn't too hard for you, was it?

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,960
And how is your physical condition?

10
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
Why?

11
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,030
Senior,

12
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,570
I'm going to practice now. Would you like to join me?

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,160
Director! How did this happen?

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,020
I did everything you asked me to.

15
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,450
But he's totally fine. In fact, he's doing even better.

16
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,640
He's certainly cut out to be a model.

17
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,960
He's a total catch.

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,330
I think I should sign with him before anyone does.

19
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,610
I'll send you his pictures, have a look. You'll be surprised.

Who is this?

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,090
How much did you say the deposit of this place was?

22
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,900
It's the same as the amount of money he has to pay back.

23
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,530
I'm relieved to hear that. At least we won't be losing any money.

Who's this guy?

28
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,450
I went out of my way to get you a job, and you hand it off to someone else without even asking me?

29
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,200
So what if I did?

30
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,470
What's your relationship with him?

31
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,670
Why do I need to tell you that?

32
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,120
He's someone who is important to me.

33
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,360
What? Someone who is important to you?

34
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,440
Also, now that I think about it,

35
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,330
it looks like you got me that job only so that I'd be too tired to practice.

36

Hello?

So what I'm saying is that, because of you, Mr. Jin is in big trouble.

44
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,600
He still doesn't know about it.

Yes.

47

Now, don't go tell him about any of this.

I couldn't come to visit you because I've been busy.

I've just come to realize that your taste is quite unique.

Did you really expect me to believe that?

58

Hand over what you're working on to Team Leader Kim, and work on another case.

Who has had more twists and turns in their lives at your age?

126

True. I am probably the only person in the world living with their debt collector.

It's my first time living with a debtor, too.

It felt good.

136

My self-esteem had hit rock bottom while working as a debt collector.
