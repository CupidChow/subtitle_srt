00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,230
♫ I didn't know what love was ♫

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,140
♫ But it came to me in one instant ♫

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,660
♫ Whenever I see you, my heart is aflutter all day  ♫

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,040
♫ How come I feel this way?  ♫

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,710
♫ We met too often for it to be a coincidence ♫

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,520
♫ Each time, I ended up figuring out ♫

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,410
♫ That you are my love ♫

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,640
Bro,

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,650
I want to dance.

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,530
♫ I love you. ♫

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,790
I just thought of a story.

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,680
But you hurt your leg.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,850
It'll be okay if I dance with you. Get up.

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,030
- Just sit down.
- Come on get up!

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,690
Straighten up. Bring your shoulders down, not your arms.

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,500
- Up?
- Raise your head.

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,500
- Looking not at you, but up?
- Exactly.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,160
One.

23
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,090
Hold and then raise your hand.

24
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,290
♫ It would be nice ♫

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,990
One.

26

One.

27
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,910
Two.

28
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,780
Bring your left hand and your left leg follows.

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,870
Stop.

30
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,120
Left arm, and stop.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,940
By the way, what are we?

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,320
What do you mean by that?

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,690
Just... What am I to you?

34
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,090
A debtor. A twenty-year-old debtor.

35
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,780
Then, what do you think of me?

36
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,960
You? Hm, a parasite that lives in my rooftop house.

37
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,120
Your words are harsh.

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,350
Calling me a centipede that lives in your rooftop house would've been better!

39
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,820
Sure, you can be a centipede then.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
- Bro.
- Yeah?

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,080
Can I go visit the office you live in?

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,530
We should've gone back home instead. Why did you want to come here?

43
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,280
I mean, you're always at my house tormenting me,

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,400
so I wanted to come to your home and be a nuisance, too.

45
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,200
Where do you sleep?

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,630
There.

47
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,650
Here?

48
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,030
It's more comfortable than I thought it would be.

49
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,630
I'm going to sleep here today.

50
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,550
You know the "Byeol, Star, Etoile" podcast, right?

51
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,030
How do you know about it?

52
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,420
That-That wasn't me.

53

Everything about love. Shh! Love Secret.

54
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,410
Let's talk about first kisses today.

55
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,470
Even just hearing the words "first kiss" makes my heart melt.

56
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,030
People often say that,

57
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,690
on your first kiss, you can hear bells ringing in your ears.

58
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,130
Maybe, that's the signal that confirms that your feelings are mutual.

59
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,010
A magical moment that confirms your love.

60
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,120
Your first kiss can tell you everything.

61
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,400
I like you.

62
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,030
Shi On, let's stop.

64
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,320
I made a mistake.

65
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,050
Don't do this again.

66
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,550
Why can't I?

67
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,340
I'm a creditor and you're a debtor.

68
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:17,170
Article 1, Section 2, of the debt collectors policy: "A creditor must never sympathize with the debtor."

69

To be honest, I sent Brother Hong Seok away because I didn't want to show him that our home had disappeared.

84
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,100
But our home was still here
