Hello, Star Family, how are you?

00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,810
I am Jae Min, the stargazer, keeper of the byeol (star), the star, l'étoile.

I've got a special story to tell you today.

00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,610
Do you, my Star Family, know about "The Red Thread of Fate?"

8

The story of the red thread.

9
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,500
They say people who are really meant to be together

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,150
are connected by a red thread between their little fingers.

11
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,070
That thread can't be untied even if one wants to,

12

nor can it be tied to someone else's finger.

That's quite interesting, isn't it?

14

There's probably a lot of people looking at their little fingers now.
