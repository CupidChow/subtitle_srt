[Episode 5]
You're going to come for the shoot today, right?

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,920
It's at 3:00 p.m. See you then.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,930
The audition is just around the corner. You need to get it together.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,940
Yes, got it.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,960
I heard you, so you should leave now. Thanks for today.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
Don't slack off.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,050
I said I got it.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,770
Just think of your audition.

12
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,830
What is it? Are you hurt?

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,600
I feel like my ears are going to start bleeding.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,550
You keep saying the same things, "The audition is around the corner." "You need to focus." "Do your best."

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,560
By the way, don't you have anything else to do besides keeping an eye on me?

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,920
No, I don't.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,940
So you can make a living by having just one debtor?

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,100
Once I get your money, I'm going to quit being a debt-collector.

19
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,960
Anyway, all you need to do is practice your dance.

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,240
Okay, okay. Hurry up and go.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,300
I better practice all day so I can eat this.

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,120
So don't come to pick me up today.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,200
- Okay.
- Bye.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,110
All you need to think of is winning first place.

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,600
First place. First place!

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,350
You'll need the money for the audition.

27
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,650
For the costume, hair, and makeup...That'll be of help.
[Studio Eric]
[Eric Koo]

28
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:07,510
I have your back. You remember what trust is to a debtor and his creditor?

29
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,470
Where are you headed to?

30
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,170
Why do you want to know?

31
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,700
Where are you going?

32
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,600
To my part-time job. Why?

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,090
You don't have the time to work right now. Don't you have to practice?

34
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,770
I've already promised to go there.

35
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,010
Looks like you still don't know how scary a debt can be.

36
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,080
You're right. I still don't know what that is. So I'll leave now.

37
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,800
Go back right now.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,030
Look here. I can't just go to the audition without money.

39
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,070
I need to pay for the costume and the participation fee.

40
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,910
So I need the money! I need to go do this job!

41
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,200
Is that so? Then I'll give you the money. How much do you need?

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,160
It's always this darn money, money, money, money!

43
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,140
I'm never going to borrow any money from you.

44
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,800
Do you even know how it feels to be chased by someone?

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,990
You keep treating me as if I don't have a care in the world,

46
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,760
but I’d actually like to just dance without caring about anything else.

47
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,780
Who are you to keep interfering with my life and make it so hard?

48
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,550
We're on the same team.

49
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,720
We need to work together if you want to pay back the money.

50
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,830
A creditor and a debtor on one team?

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,560
Then I'll go to that job instead of you. You go back and dance.

52
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,520
That should do it.

53
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,980
You make a living off people's credit. So that's perfect for you.

54
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,320
Okay, good!

55
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,820
Oh, sexy!

56
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,940
Good! Good!

57
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,990
That's great!

58
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,210
Let's go again.

59
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,440
Okay, that was great.

60
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,990
Good work, Jung Hoon.

61
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,500
You did really well.

62
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
- How's it going with the assistant models?
- They're getting ready.

63
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,230
- They're still getting ready?
- Yes.

64
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,550
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

65
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,960
Mr. Jung Hoon, about that guy coming today, Shi On,

66
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,090
is he your rival in the audition?

67
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,190
How good are you as compared to your classmates?

68
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,520
I'd say, maybe the second-best.

69
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,590
Who's the best then?

70
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,850
There's this senior of mine. Lee Jung Hoon.

71
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,690
Well, I wouldn't go as far as to call him my rival. Let's just say he's a little bothersome.

72
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,200
Okay, I get what you mean.

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,380
I'll make him work so hard today that he won't be moving around for the next couple of days.

74
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,620
Thank you. For dancing, the most important elements are mental state and body routine.

75
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,870
But if that gets messed up all of a sudden, it's quite difficult to get back up.

76
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,360
If you pass your audition, you have to do your profile picture and posters with me in return. You know that, right?

77
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,590
Don't you worry about that. Take care of this for me.

78
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,570
Sure.

79
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,720
Good. That was good.

80
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,750
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

81
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,350
Who are you?

82
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,860
Hello, Director, I'm Song Shi On.

83
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,750
So-Song Shi On?

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,690
By chance, did you happen to hear...

85
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,130
Sorry? Hear what?

86
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,050
Don't worry about it. No problem, no problem.

87
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,630
Your body proportion...

88
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,420
is art!

89
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,120
You've got a great figure, too. That's really great.

90
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Hey, guys! Let's get ready quickly!

91
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,350
- Hurry up!
- Yes!

92
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,220
Let's go.

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,590
Again. Oh, wait, wait.

94
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,700
Oh, what is that?

95
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,620
That's a bit too dry.

96
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,800
Omo, what is this?

97
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,010
Is this all you can do?

98
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,250
Shit.

99
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,690
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

100
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,140
It's too dry.

101
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,750
Shi On.

102
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,390
Shi On, are you going to continue to be half-hearted?

103
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,310
Your body has no soul. No soul, no soul.

104
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,910
If you keep working this way, no pay.

105
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,550
Do you understand?

106
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,800
Let's prepare the next one.

[Mr. Loan Shark]

108
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,430
I can't work with Song Shi On. He's not up to my standards.

109
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,310
If he keeps messing up, fire him.

110
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,280
Firm up your belly muscles.

111
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,650
For financiers like us, the details of our actions and expressions matter most.

112
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,150
Every gaze, every facial expression,

113
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,980
and even a single hand movement can make a debtor pay back the money more quickly.

114
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,410
Manager Jin Hong Seok, you can do well, can't you?

115
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,170
Put some glare into your eyes!

116
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,820
Fine, come at me.

117
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,540
I will let you have it.

118
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:08,440
Sometimes, we get angry for no reason at the person who treats us well, don't we?
[Byeol, Star, Etoile - Live Podcast]

119
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,640
The person who protects us even when we are stubborn and grumpy.

120
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,790
That person is the one who is really on your side.

121
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,540
A very precious person who is always on your side.

122
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,110
But you must never treat them carelessly just because they are on your side.

123
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,580
The more that person is on your side, the more warm and loving you should be to them.

124
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,710
That's not as easy to do as you think, you say?

125
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,290
The answer is already clear.

126
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,260
The answer is set.

127
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,350
So if I did hurt someone without meaning to,

128
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,360
how should I make up with that person?

129
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,760
Please answer my question.

130
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,080
This is so great.

131
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,740
Everyone, we're going to have to make this sexier.

132
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,620
Sexy. Let's get ready.

133
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,280
You weren't sleeping yet?

134
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,550
Come here.

135
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,870
Stay still, will you?

136
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,250
If you worked part-time for me, then this is my leg, isn't it?

137
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,420
Stop.

138
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,560
Must I actually say the words, "thank you?" Huh?

139
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,340
I told you to stop.

140
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,520
Never mind, I'll give you a massage.

141
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,400
You practiced dancing all day long, didn't you?

142
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,500
I massage myself well, you know.

143
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,220
You worked hard today, sleep here and be warm.

144
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,330
They say once you taste meat, you can't quit. It's nice to lie in a bed, isn't it?

145
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,430
No, I am uncomfortable.

146
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:28,680
The bar, that red thread, you did that, didn't you, Hyeong?
(T/N: term used for a close older male or brother)

147
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,900
I was worried that I wouldn't get the money if you fell because of it.

148
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,240
Then it better not unravel for the rest of my life.

149
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,100
You sure talk a lot. Hurry and sleep.

150
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,020
But what if it unravels, will you fix it for me?

151
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,220
Fine! I'll provide after-sales service for the rest of my life. Happy now?

152
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,190
Promise me.

153
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,430
I better sleep outside.

154
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,410
Don't go.

155
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,100
Then lie down properly.

156
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,890
Let's live together for the time being.

157
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,720
What?

158
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,360
You said that the creditor and debtor are on the same team.

159
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,470
