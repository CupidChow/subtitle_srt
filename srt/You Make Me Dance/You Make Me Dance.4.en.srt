00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,700
I have your back. You remember what trust is to a debtor and his creditor?

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,490
I don't.

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,390
Are your audition preparations going well?

8
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,680
- Not really.
- We need more practice.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,920
We should still do well.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,760
Of course.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,540
What's this?

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,060
You're here.

13
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,510
Shi On, wait a second.

14
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,110
You'll be the assistant model for the photoshoot I mentioned before, right?

15
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,220
You'll need the money for the audition.

16
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,220
For the costume, hair, and makeup...

17
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,790
I was afraid I'd hurt your pride if I just gave you the money. I'm being considerate this way.

We're going to practice now, actually.

- Guys, let's practice.
- Okay.

- Yes.

Hello?

Ah, yes. Hello... This is Director Eric, right?

- Yes, who is this?
- I am Song Shi On. Jeong Hun gave me your contact.

29
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,280
Oh, yes. Are you free on Wednesday?

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,570
Yes, of course.

31

- I'll be there on time.
- All right.

32

All right. Thank you.

33
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,980
Don't you have heating in here? Or have you switched it off on purpose?

34
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,590
It's broken.

35
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,590
Go back to your house quickly unless you want to freeze to death.

36
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,000
- That barre...
- I didn't do it.

You guys have been going through a lot these days due to the audition.

Sorry, I should have taken better care of you as your senior.

40
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,290
Okay, let's eat this and make sure to stay in shape.

- Yes.
- Thank you.

Thank you.

Oh? Looks like we're short of one.

46
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,770
But still, since you're the one treating us you should have it.

47
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,950
That's right.

48
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,280
No, it's okay. I eat this every day, so you can have this one, Shi On.

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,050
No, I'm fine.

50
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,590
I'm on a diet right now, so it's okay.

51
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,530
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

52

That's too bad.

- Thank you for the treat.

- How is it?
- It's delicious.

56
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,770
What are you up to?

57
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,400
I'm eating at the cafeteria.

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,200
Really? Wait for me there.

Eat up.

63
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,650
I'm fine. I just ate, so I'm full.

64

You should still eat.

65

I told you I'm full!

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,920
That is pretty cool but it's not hygienic...

67

You won't die from it.

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,650
Also, don't try to get along with those people from now on.

What?

71
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,860
Do you want to have people by your side that badly?

72
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,600
Don't talk as if you know everything about me.

73
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:51,130
But... why are you being so good to me?

74
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,040
You have such an annoying way of saying thank you.

75
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:05,300
My mom said that eating heartily was how to show gratitude.

It's quite good.

77
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,390
By the way, how do you dance?

78
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,730
What do you mean by that?

79
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,930
So, when you listen to the music, does the dance just come to you naturally?

80
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,860
I can dance even without the music.

81
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,560
As long as my heart beats.

82
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,600
End of the chitchat. Don't you have to practice?

83
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,860
There you go again, ordering me around.

84
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,950
Do you know how to play the piano?

85
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,450
Yeah, I used to... a long time ago.

86
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,330
Why don't you play it anymore?

87
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,300
Just because.

88
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,680
Mr. Debt-collector, you seem a little different right now.

89
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,300
Do you think I've always been a debt-collector?

90
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,800
I want to hear you play the piano.

91
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,380
This man, what is he really?

92
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,180
This odd feeling... is not unpleasant.

93
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,230
I... like him a little bit.
