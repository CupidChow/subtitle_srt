1
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,837
[I'm at the cafe in your neighborhood, do you want to have a meal together?]

2
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,736
[Nami: Sorry, I have an interview today too. I'll call you in a bit.]

3
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,912
[Yes ㅜㅜ]

4
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:35,721
Huh?

5
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,097
Jaemin!

6
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,933
Oh! Hello?

7
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,185
Wow, fancy meeting you here!

8
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,063
Did you come here to study?

9
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,026
Oh, I was supposed to meet a friend.

10
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,152
But the plan fell through.

11
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,737
Ah...

12
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,156
Where are you going, Jaemin?

13
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,201
Uh.. I'm just going to have a meal alone..

14
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,536
Huh?

15
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,872
I need to eat alone too.

16
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,541
Ah..

17
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,212
Do you want to eat together?

18
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,095
Uh..

19
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,847
Yes, sounds good.

20
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,979
But you are really amazing.

21
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,065
You got into two big companies.

22
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,775
Oh, it's not that amazing.

23
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,652
I'm being unfilial to my parents.

24
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:14,778
Why?

25
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,197
Because I quit good companies

26
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,324
That everyone wants to join.

27
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,701
They must think there's something wrong with me.

28
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,828
They must be really worried.

29
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,079
Hmm..

30
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,456
But why did you quit?

31
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,291
Hmm...

32
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,795
Because I want to live happily?

33
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,465
Hmm..

34
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:38,885
I thought...

35
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,512
If I got into a great place,

36
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,514
I'd become a great person.

37
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,268
But once I got in,

38
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,519
That wasn't the case.

39
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,484
I couldn't use my talents at all

40
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,611
And was just used like a cog in a machine.

41
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,116
I felt so insignificant.

42
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,703
Ah..

43
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,125
So I started looking for a company

44
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,335
Where I could feel more valuable

45
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,713
And that would suit me better.

46
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,465
Hmm..

47
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,343
What about you, Jaemin?

48
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,765
How do you want to live?

49
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:26,933
Hmm..

50
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,060
Just..

51
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,855
Simply and ordinarily.

52
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,108
Ordinary and simple..

53
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,485
That's really difficult, isn't it?

54
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,614
Right.

55
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,118
I don't want to achieve something great

56
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,538
Or get into a great company anymore.

57
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,125
I just...

58
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,132
Want to be a useful person.

59
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,143
Wow..

60
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,812
What perfume are you wearing?

61
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,236
Oh.. I don't use perfume.

62
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,864
Ah.. I knew it.

63
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,616
It was your natural scent.

64
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,747
I'm very sensitive to smells.

65
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,791
You have a nice scent.

66
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,875
From the first time we met.

67
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,297
I know almost every perfume.

68
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,592
But you smelled so nice, I wanted to ask.

69
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,392
Can I see your hand for a moment?

70
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,271
My hand?

71
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,534
Wow..

72
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,995
I've never met someone with such a nice natural scent.

73
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,886
I have a boyfriend.

74
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,849
Ah..

75
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,685
I don't mind.

76
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,442
I'm good at waiting.

77
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,850
No..

78
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,526
I know everything.

79
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,574
You want me, right?

80
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,843
I knew from the beginning.

81
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,098
That we would get along well.

82
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:01,898
No, I...
