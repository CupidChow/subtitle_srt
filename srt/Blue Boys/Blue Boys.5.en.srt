1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,261
Walking here from the station

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,638
I thought I was going to die from the heat

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,225
What? Ordering only for yourself

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,521
Oppa?

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:26,610
Oppa!

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,784
What's wrong, why are you so dazed?

7
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,202
Did you get heatstroke?

8
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,912
Uh, no..

9
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:39,790
Why did you want to meet?

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,127
Why are you being so hurtful again?

11
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,004
Do we need a reason to meet?

12
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,881
You've changed, oppa

13
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,927
How have I changed?

14
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,097
I heard you don't meet other girls these days?

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,058
The most sociable person in our department not meeting anyone means you've changed

16
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,608
What's with this lukewarm reaction

17
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,860
I'm going to order a coffee

18
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,914
I'll ask you one last time

19
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,792
If you let go of my hand now

20
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,503
We're really over

21
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,741
Hey, you..

22
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,576
What are you doing!

23
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,661
Did that wake you up?

24
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,457
Don't do things like this

25
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,751
That's why there are weird rumors

26
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,627
What rumors?

27
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,049
Ah..

28
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,759
Rumors that I'm meeting this guy and that guy

29
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,260
That I'm dating around?

30
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:16,762
Yes

31
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,222
Well, that's true, so what?

32
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,434
But..

33
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,563
Do you know I had a reason for all that?

34
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,483
Reason?

35
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,027
I..

36
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,781
I've liked a guy for a really long time

37
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,367
But he doesn't notice me

38
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,746
So I tried to make him jealous

39
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,956
By dating around

40
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,459
And?

41
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,548
It doesn't seem to work

42
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,384
So now..

43
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,222
I'm going to confess

44
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,893
Okay.. good luck

45
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,775
You really don't get it

46
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,069
Huh?

47
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,910
Oppa..

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,663
What do you think of me?

49
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,083
What?

50
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,089
I've liked you for a long time

51
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,968
I like you

52
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,897
Hey Choi Sol

53
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,777
Oppa, you've never really dated anyone seriously either

54
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,697
Always meeting people out of curiosity

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,283
Stop doing that

56
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,994
Can't you date me? Huh?

57
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,793
I have a girlfriend

58
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,504
Sorry

59
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,641
Jaemin oppa and I..

60
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,353
Didn't you break up?

61
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,522
How..

62
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,400
How do you know that?

63
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,237
Ah..

64
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,156
You’re more persistent than I thought

65
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,991
How do you know that!

66
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,743
Did you meet Jaemin?

67
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:46,995
Yes!

68
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,788
I met him

69
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,625
What did you say to him?

70
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,377
I told him to break up with you

71
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,257
Or I’d spread rumors about everything

72
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,344
You really

73
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,182
I can't understand

74
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,643
Why is someone like you dating someone like him?

75
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,561
You should date someone at your level

76
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,357
And with his specs

77
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,192
He can’t even apply to our company

78
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,402
I may have gone too far

79
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,904
But you'll thank me later

80
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,785
I didn't think it would be this bad

81
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,662
You're the worst

82
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,664
What?

83
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,586
You

84
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,507
I hate to even say this

85
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,467
But one last piece of advice

86
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,846
Don’t judge other people's lives by your standards

87
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,308
Me?

88
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,061
Even though I’ve dated around

89
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,063
I’d never date you

90
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,857
You're not even worth that

91
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,485
What did you say?

92
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,320
Don't contact me again

93
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:05,907
Oppa

94
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,617
Oppa!

95
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,012
You still..

96
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,597
Don't know me

97
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,193
Ah.. right, my phone..

98
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,032
Well, it’s good

99
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,369
I wasn’t getting any calls anyway

100
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,291
Jaemin!

101
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,718
I'm sorry

102
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,519
Whatever Sol said, I'm sorry for it all

103
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,855
I'm sorry for making you handle everything alone

104
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,275
For not understanding your feelings

105
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,488
For not holding your hand till the end

106
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,157
I'm sorry

107
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,344
Why didn't you tell me?

108
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,560
How could I say that?

109
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:41,855
Because of my situation

110
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,982
How could I say I was going to give you up

111
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,861
It felt shameless and cowardly

112
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,784
I thought having you was enough

113
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,996
But it wasn’t

114
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,084
After hearing what Sol said

115
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,171
I was worried and scared about everything

116
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,382
I was worried because you were beside me

117
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,800
I didn't want to tell you that

118
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,135
And hurt you

119
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,850
Because of me..

120
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,895
For making you feel that way

121
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,647
I'm sorry

122
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,047
I was only thinking of myself

123
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,132
I was too selfish

124
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,133
No

125
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,135
It's okay

126
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,513
I was only thinking of myself too

127
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,768
I live impulsively and without plans

128
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,521
But you're not like that

129
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,608
You have your own plans and goals

130
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,987
I can’t be an obstacle to that

131
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,369
In your life..

132
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,664
I promise I'll never be an obstacle

133
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,499
Promise

134
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,214
Are you sure it's okay?

135
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,800
Yes

136
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,010
As long as you're safe

137
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,263
But

138
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,185
Just let me stay by your side

139
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,649
Okay

140
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:51,734
Okay

141
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,990
I missed you

142
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,349
But didn’t you say we shouldn’t in case someone saw?

143
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,853
Did I say that?
