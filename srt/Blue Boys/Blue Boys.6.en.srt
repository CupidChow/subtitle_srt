1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,800
Hot, isn't it?

2
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:10,469
A little?

3
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,180
Still, I'd rather stay like this

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,683
Choi Jae-min, you've changed

5
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,644
Initiating skinship and all

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:21,688
Do you dislike it?

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:22,898
No

8
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,149
Who said I dislike it?

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,484
I love it

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,572
But...

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,450
If we keep sticking together

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,077
Won't it be hard for you?

13
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:36,662
For me?

14
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,288
Why would it be?

15
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,541
Well...

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,044
Oh, come on

17
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,883
When I'm next to you, I keep wanting to do it

18
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,260
I can't help it either

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,720
It's not something I can control

20
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,431
Oh! Don't you have an interview?

21
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:58,850
It's okay, I can be a little late

22
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,894
No, no, you can't be late

23
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,062
It's fine

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,980
Oh, wait a sec

25
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:04,606
Oh, wait a sec

26
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:05,774
Hm?

27
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,152
Then do it quickly

28
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,462
Will you be home today?

29
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,631
No, I told you I'm starting

30
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,466
My job search study group today, remember?

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,051
Oh, right

32
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,261
You did say that, didn't you?

33
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,096
I've been so out of it lately

34
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,347
Sorry

35
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,181
It's okay

36
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,350
You must be busy with interviews these days too

37
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,102
It's good if I'm busy too, you know

38
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,105
Yeah, that's good then

39
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,025
I was worried you'd be waiting for me all day

40
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,111
I'm not a kid

41
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,362
Don't worry

42
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,448
But

43
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,908
Are there a lot of guys there?

44
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,911
Guys?

45
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:00,996
Yeah

46
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,165
In the study group?

47
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,167
Um...

48
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,376
I guess so, right?

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,711
But why?

50
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:09,713
Ah

51
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,299
Places with a lot of guys are kinda...

52
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,510
Oh, come on

53
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,764
Should I just wrap you up tight

54
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,348
And carry you around in my bag?

55
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,808
Ah, I'm anxious

56
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,188
What are you saying? What's there to be anxious about?

57
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,481
You

58
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,194
You tend to smile too easily

59
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,071
With those flirty eye-smiles

60
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,448
Oh, seriously, you're talking nonsense

61
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,157
Hurry up and go

62
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,536
Anyway

63
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,246
Don't dress too cutely

64
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,665
Guys will drool

65
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,418
Oh, stop it, that's not a thing

66
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,878
Hurry up and go, stop saying weird things

67
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,505
Alright

68
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,214
I'm off then

69
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,006
Take care

70
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm really going now

71
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,313
Okay

72
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,797
Why isn't anyone coming?

73
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,512
Excuse me

74
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,139
Jae-min?

75
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:43,932
Yes?

76
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,146
Oh, hi

77
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,772
Ah

78
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,483
You didn't check the cafe post again, did you?

79
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,610
The cafe post?

80
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,530
Oh, our study group location

81
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,198
Changed, so we posted a new notice

82
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,409
But we didn't see a reply from you

83
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,744
So I thought I'd come check, just in case

84
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,248
Oh, I see

85
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
I didn't know

86
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,715
Did you come all the way here because of me?

87
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm sorry

88
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,303
No, it's okay

89
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,139
I'm glad I came, it seems worth it

90
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,850
Pardon?

91
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,395
I'm Lee Tae-ha

92
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,106
Oh

93
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,367
Um

94
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,370
What do you think is the most important question in an interview?

95
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,749
Well, I guess

96
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,043
The reason for applying?

97
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,629
That's right

98
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,255
Actually, applicants' specs and

99
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,049
Self-introductions are all pretty similar

100
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,428
What do you usually say?

101
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,765
Oh, well, I just

102
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,433
Say something like

103
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,436
I want to be an asset to your company

104
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,231
Oh

105
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,149
That's better than mine

106
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,777
What do you say?

107
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,488
I want to make money

108
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,530
...is what I say

109
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:27,661
Huh?

110
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,704
Are you laughing at me?

111
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,414
I'm being serious

112
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,084
Oh, no, I'm sorry

113
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,630
I was just kidding

114
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,340
It's funny, right?

115
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,676
The interviewers were all shocked too

116
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,679
So how did it go?

117
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,348
I bombed it, of course

118
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,267
Ah

119
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,604
That's why study groups are important, you know

120
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,899
Doing it alone, there are too many options

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,609
And I lack experience

122
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,612
There's a lot of trial and error too

123
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:03,989
Right?

124
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,032
Right

125
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,702
It's frustrating...

126
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,162
And suffocating

127
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,291
Let's do it together from now on

128
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,668
What?

129
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,504
I'll help you

130
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,466
Ah

131
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,180
Shall we look at your resume?

132
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,903
Oh? This part is really well-written

133
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,697
It feels sincere

134
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,450
And also

135
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,791
Hmm, here too

136
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,004
Did someone edit this for you?

137
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,547
It's really well-written

138
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,092
Oh, that friend did

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,012
Oh, that's a good friend

140
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,769
How about we become friends too?

141
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:19,814
Pardon?

142
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,124
This part is really well-written

143
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,210
It feels sincere

144
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,261
Hello?

145
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,555
Yeah, are you home?

146
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,224
Yeah, where are you?

147
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,351
I'm still at the company dinner

148
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,478
Looks like I won't be able to see you all week

149
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,148
It's okay, being busy is a good thing

150
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,568
Oh, how was your study group? Did it go well?

151
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,488
Ah...

152
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,447
Yeah

153
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,158
Were there any creepy guys or anything?

154
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,745
No, no, there's nothing like that, there weren't any

155
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,790
Ah, I'm just joking

156
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,125
I trust you

157
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,418
You know how I feel, right?

158
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:22,502
Yeah

159
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:23,878
Jae-min

160
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:26,840
Yeah?

161
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,633
I miss you

162
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,929
Me too
