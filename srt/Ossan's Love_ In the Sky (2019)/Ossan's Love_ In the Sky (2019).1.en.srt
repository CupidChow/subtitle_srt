(T/N: Oden is fishcakes and vegetables cooked in broth.)

178
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,170
It's your treat.

179
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,120
What? Just oden?

180
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,260
- Yeah. And... here!
- I knew it.

181
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,050
I'll leave the rest to you, Haru-chan-senpai.

182
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,040
Wait, Hina.

183
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,810
Could you stop calling me "Haru-chan-senpai"?

184
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,100
- Why?
- I mean, you're my senior here.

185
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,730
Well, I'll see you around then, Haru-chan

186

Yes.

I'm scared.

196
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,350
You're scared?

197

She's the first person I've dated.

198
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,880
She's too good for me.

199
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,520
I really... love her.

200
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,780
In that case, you should muster up your courage to tell her.

201
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,750
Captain.

202
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,820
I'm sorry for the flap inspection causing a take-off delay this morning.

203
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,740
Not at all. Safety comes first. Don't worry. Good work.

204
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,680
If they can't finish it in time, shouldn't you have stepped up as the leader?

205
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,630
Take it easy, Naruse.

206
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,870
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,040
But I can't stand people who do sloppy work.

208
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,670
I'll be more mindful in the future. I'm really sorry.

209
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,640
Excuse me.

210
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,450
Don't mind Naruse.

211
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,810
I-Is everything okay?

212
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,870
I guess not...

213
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,640
Haruta.

214
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,740
Captain! Good afternoon.

215
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,960
What did you do while you were on standby?

216
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,710
I organized documents in the lockers, assisted the PR department, and worked on the ground.

217
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,270
I see.

218
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,910
I won't tolerate such a mistake again.

219
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,360
Yes, Sir. I'm very sorry.

220
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,010
See you later.

221
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,930
A pen?

222
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,450
This is a pen for sketches.

223
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,780
- Sketches?
- Wow.

224
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,760
Do you like to draw, Haruta?

225
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,600
No, I found it.

226
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,050
Sketches?

227
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,800
No, there's no way.

228
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,390
- This passenger is a mystery.
- Sorry?

229
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:47,820
Every day, the passenger has been canceling the flight after check-in.

230
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,060
He delays the flights. What's he trying to do?

231
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,130
- May I see it?
- Sure.

- Yes, Mr. Mogi.

234

I cancelled my flight.

235

Mr. Mogi...

236
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,550
It's not a breakup because we never dated in the first place.

237
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,640
Huh? What do you mean?

238
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,910
I already like someone else, anyway.

239
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:26,480
You're lying. There's no way I believe that!

240
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,440
Sorry.

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,160
I'm sorry. It's not what you think, I'm sorry!

Hey, you. Who the hell are you?

248

00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,350
Why?

250
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,950
Thanks.

My flight time is currently at 18,250 hours.

256

I have accumulated quite a bit of experience,

257
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,990
even so, unforeseen events can happen.

258
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,920
Haruta and Naruse kissed.

What in the world does this mean?

260
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,280
Why? Why am I double-clicking?

261
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,780
It was just a kiss, but still a kiss.

Why am I so shaken up by this?

263
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,700
There were only elderly craftsmen in my old company.

Is there anyone at the company with a talent for drawing?

00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,560
- A talent for drawing?
- Why are you looking for a painter?

That's right.

If it's just one, they may have been testing out their pen.

284

- I sense strong feelings from this.

356
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,760
With our colleagues.

357
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,820
At the end of the day, our job is dealing with people.

358
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,120
Does that make sense?

359
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,770
Yes!

360
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,670
Was that you back then?

361
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,310
Yes, that was me.

362
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,640
I see.

363
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,220
Truthfully,

364
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,810
an airplane can't fly with a single pilot's efforts alone.

365
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,950
A comfortable and safe flight requires a joint effort of

366
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,160
the ground staff, the CAs, and the passengers.

♫ Even if I wish for three or four, I feel lifeless ♫

533
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,840
It'll be a full moon flight today.

534
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,880
A full moon flight?

535
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,920
Could I ask you something?

536
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,820
Sure. What is it?

537
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,610
The other day

538
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:16,110
someone told me, "The moon is beautiful, isn't it?"

539
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,170
I feel like I've heard that line before somewhere.

540
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,600
- Do you know where it's from?
- Oh!

541
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,590
Isn't that Soseki Natsume?

542
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,860
- Huh?
- A long ago, when he translated "I love you" into Japanese,

543
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,830
I think he translated it as, "The moon is beautiful, isn't it?"

544
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,510
"I love you"?

545
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,580
The moon is beautiful, isn't it?

546
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,790
"I love you"?

547
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,800
Oh my god...

548
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,520
Oh my god!

549
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,230
Oh my god!

550
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,190
Dear Soichi Haruta,

551
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,680
my proposal was a great success.

552
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,030
For our honeymoon, my wife and I definitely want to

553
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,040
take a flight you're working on.

554
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,960
His bride is super cute.

555
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,540
I can't believe this!

556
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,870
You really don't feel anything for Masaki anymore?

557
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,180
- Again?
- I told you, I don't.

558
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,630
Then tell Masaki that you're breaking up with him now.

559
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,470
- Masaki?
- I told you, we weren't even dating.

560
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,640
Naruse, you're so cruel.

561
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,540
W-Wait!

562
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,880
That was close.

563
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,990
We meet again. Have a good day.

564
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,950
Come on! What now?

565
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,490
Give it up, Masaki.

566
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,740
Naruse said he likes this guy.

567
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,000
What?

568
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,480
Right?

569
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,440
No, knock it off, will you?

570
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,110
Give it up already, Masaki. Come back to me.

571
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,790
Who the hell are you?

572
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,620
- What are you to Naruse?
- I'm nobody.

573
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,290
Don't take it seriously just because we slept together once.

574
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,130
- You slept with him?
- Were you just toying with me?

575
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,630
- Toying?
- Give me a break.

576
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,890
Seriously?

577
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,950
- You homewrecker!
- What?

578
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,680
Ouch! Why?

579
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,660
What are you doing?

580
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,220
Ouch. That hurts!

581
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,070
Hold on a second.

582
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,850
Hey, Naruse. What just happened here?

583
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:44,400
I got this all wrong. Were you

584
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,690
dating the guy instead of the girl?

585
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,830
Huh? W-Wait, what?

586
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,580
What are you doing?

587
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,890
Ouch! What the hell?

588
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,080
If you breathe a word of this, you're dead meat.

589
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,240
Don't you have anything to say about what just happened?

590
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,730
Naruse, what are you doing?

591
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,110
Shino, listen to me!

592
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,750
Hey!

593
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,420
What?

594
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,470
Was it you who drew these, Shino?

595
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,150
This is Captain Kurosawa from the cockpit. We have an emergency.

596
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,260
We're currently experiencing a turbulence of love.

597
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,410
Requesting guidance right away! We have an emergency!
