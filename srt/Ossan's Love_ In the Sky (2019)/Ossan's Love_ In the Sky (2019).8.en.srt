- You're a nuisance!

This is my first time being rejected.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,610
You're too kind. I mean it.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,290
I have decided to move out of the dorm.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,950
I've decided to quit being a pilot.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,140
It's goodbye, Haruta.

8
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,610
- Hey, Haruppi.
- Reiji, Reiji!

9
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,170
- Reiji, Reiji, Reiji...
- Yes? What is it?

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,600
- What is it?
- Why is...

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,380
Is the Captain quitting? Is this part of the reform?

12
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,260
No.

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,690
I was surprised as well.

14
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:01,170
This is sudden, but I'd like to submit my resignation.

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,850
His reason was that he can no longer fulfill his duty as a pilot.

16
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,110
He felt he has reached his limit.

17

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,000
he might have already decided to quit being a pilot.

Do you remember the time we flew to Fukuoka in bad weather?

71

Many airlines have canceled their flights.

72
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,480
Because I had experienced flying in the similar condition before...

73
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,780
It's not too severe, we can still fly.

74
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,570

Let's turn back... to Haneda.

76

But that was in hindsight. Under such difficult circumstances,

77
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,180
no pilot can predict how the weather would turn out.

78
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,070
You're wrong.

79
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:54,620
I... made my judgement solely based on my experience.

80
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,510
I didn't listen to my colleagues' opinions.

81
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,980
That... is not the ideal pilot that I want to be.

82

89

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,970
You're right.

91
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,790

177
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,690
Where are you going?

178
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,500
The dorm is not in that direction.

179
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,620
[Meet me at the Shichigo riverbank. - Musashi Kurosawa]

180
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,410
Did you also receive the same note?

181
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,620
- You, too?
- Yeah.

182
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,830
So... where's the Captain?

183
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,080
Hiya!

184
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,260
C-Captain, are you...?

185
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,340
Thanks for waiting.

186
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,570
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

187
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,120
Today... may be the last time

188
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,530
that we can all gather here.

189
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,940
Therefore, in order not to have any regrets,

190
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,170
or not to have any worries in the future, there is something...

191
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,310
I wish to tell you.

192
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,460
It is called... "Kurosawa Cup

193
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,240
Sumo Wrestling Competition!"

194
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,410
Come on, come on, come on!

195
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,490
Come on, Mr. Shinomiya!

196
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,660
Come, you malnourished mechanic!

197
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,720
I shall release the pent-up emotions... within you!

198
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,530
I've been regretting this!

199
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,700
If I had known our relationship would end up this way,

200
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,550
I wouldn't have confessed,

201
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,180
and just kept quiet about it forever!

202
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,940
Take off!

203
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,440
You idiot!

204
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,350
Don't deny that feeling of loving someone!

205
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,760
Isn't it wonderful to love someone?

206
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,750
But I am suffering now because of love!

207
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,450
You idiot!

208
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,120
If you call this "suffering,"

209
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,720
I would have died long ago!

210
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,430
You fool!

211
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,200
Next! Mr. Naruse, come on!

212
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,760
- You brat.
- You let your guard down.

213
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,550
You sly one. You tricked me.

214
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,820
Damn! But do you think...

215
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,230
you can take me down with this petty little trick?

216
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,490
You egoistic baby face!

217
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,720
Hey.

218
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,680
How do you plan to face Haruta? Eh?

219
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,350
Do you love him? Do you hate him? Which is it?

220
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,650
- Which one is it?
- I love him!

221
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,100
I love him, but it's not...

222
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,050
Soft landing.

223
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,620
If you're aiming to be a captain, you must trust the people around you.

224
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,770
Talk to them and open your heart to them.

225
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,360
But I guess I was too open.

226
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,280
Next! Mr. Haruta, come on!

227
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,420
Okay! Thank you for the match.

228
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,280
You...

229
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,880
muscular and pampered general!

230
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,950
What I... what I want to say to you...

231
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,620
what I want to say to you...!

232
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,120
what I want to say to you...

233
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,810
- I have nothing to say.
- Huh?

234
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,060
- Captain, say something to me.
- I have...

235
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,740
nothing to say.

236
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,470
Captain, it's not fair!

237
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,110
I really... have... nothing to say.

238
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,320
Haruta!

239
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,500
Fly away!

240
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,500
Haruta, figure it out yourself!

241
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,710
But... why?

242
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,240
Figure it out yourself!

243
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,550
- Figure it out yourself—
- Fine!

244
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,580
You weaklings can't even defeat me!

245
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,190
The three of you... come get me all at once!

246
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,810
It's beautiful.

247
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,200
Captain...

248
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,150
- Captain!
- Master!

249
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,080
Hey, what's wrong with you guys?

250
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,740
How old are you guys already?

251
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,850
- I'm 30!
- I'm 35.

252
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,270
I'm 41.

253
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,510
Doesn't this make us all old men?

254
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,070
- Captain...
- Master...

255
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,550
[Ossan's Love: In The Sky]

256
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,560
Hold on. Hold on a sec, Shino!

257
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,290
This is amazeball!

258
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,900
- Who says that?
- I don't know.

259
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,090
- There's more. Feel free to help yourself.
- It's so good!

260
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,170
He ate the carrot.

261
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,890
Really?

262
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,340
So annoying. One carrot doesn't scare me.

263
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,600
- Look who's talking.
- Me of course.

264
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,950
- Eat mine, then. Just eat it.
- Wait!

265
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,570
I have no choice then. I'll give you mine, too!

266
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,450
All right then.

267
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,870
He's grown up!

268
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,680
You've grown up, haven't you?

269
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,190
Are you binge-eating?

270
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,110
- Shino, I want a refill!
- Do it yourself.

271
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,320
Okay, I will.

272
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,110
- What's with that attitude?
- Delicious!

273
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,180
- Since when can you eat carrots?
- It's a secret.

274
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,900
Dad, there's something I wish to tell you.

275
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,250
Why do you all sound so formal?

276
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,150
Thank you very much... for taking care of me until now.

277
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,740
What? Are you getting married?

278
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,720
- How so?
- Who's the guy?

279
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,790
- D-Do I know him? Where does he work?
- No, that's not it.

280
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,100
- You got it all wrong.
- What's his income?

281
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,640
I was talking about you.

282
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,680
- What?
- What I meant to say was,

283
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,890
you worked hard as a pilot.

284
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,420
I see.

285
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,350
Thank you.

286
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,920
One more thing.

287
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,560
When you told me your feelings about Haru,

288
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,200
I couldn't believe it at first.

289
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,640
So I freaked out a little.

290
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,880
But you always put my well-being

291
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,410
ahead of your own.

292
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,340
That's why, this time, I will fully support...

293
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,870
your second chance in life.

294
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,600
Hina...

295
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,970
Fly!

296
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,420
Musashi Kurosawa!

297
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,310
Musashi Kurosawa... will fly!

298
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,380
Yes!

299
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,860
Thanks for the meal, Shino.

300
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,880
By the way, what were you doing at the Captain's place?

301
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,830
I was training to be a fine old man.

302
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,310
It's like cram school.

303
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,540
I call it, "Charge! Old Men's Private School."
(T/N: He's referring to the manga "Charge! Men's Private School")

304
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,950
- I don't get it at all.
- Don't you know the manga series?

305
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,430
- I know that.
- So you do?

306
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,650
That's not what I meant.

307
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,280
But Captain is really incredible.

308
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,840
He's amazing.

309
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,390
No one would have thought of gathering old men and do a sumo competition.

310
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,260
He really cares a lot about us, doesn't he?

311
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,170
He does.

312
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,310
Shino.

313
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,380
Next time, I want to eat your cheese hamburger steak.

314
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,640
- Why suddenly?
- Well, I want something cheesy.

315
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,200
Too bad.

316
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,220
I no longer comply with your requests.

317
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,670
- Why?
- Don't be such a baby!

318
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,610
Wait... Shino, I want to eat a cheese hamburger steak!

319
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,740
- I said, I'm not pampering you.
- Please, please...

320
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,590
- Don't be a baby.
- I'm not! I just don't know how to cook it!

321
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,910
What's wrong?

322
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,500
Let's go to the convenience store.

323
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,580
Huh? Me?

324
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,940
- Hey... what it is?
- Hm?

325
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,080
Don't "hm" me. There's nothing I want to buy.

326
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,470
Well, I'll come along. What's up?

327
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:42,290
Isn't it Captain Kurosawa's last flight tomorrow?

328
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,650
That's why... well...

329
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,140
Let's carry on as usual and work hard.

330
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,750
Okay. Sure.

331
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,390
Huh? What? Is that it?

332
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,710
You dragged me out just to say that?

333
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,340
- No.
- You're the type who does that?

334
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,720
Who do you think I am, you idiot? You better not mess up, you idiot.

335
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,920
Watch it.

336
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,990
That unpredictable character of yours really suits you.

337
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,660
Really?

338
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,970
Lately, people around me told me I've changed.

339
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,030
Well... sort of...

340
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,170
That probably...

341
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,470
is because of you.

342
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,560
People seem to like the way I am now,

343
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,370
so I'm a little disappointed.

344
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,850
Huh? Is that gratitude or a complaint?

345
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,590
- I'm thankfully complaining.
- What the hell's that?

346
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,590
To be honest,

347
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,140
if I were the old me,

348
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,720
I might have just...

349
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,340
dated you without thinking.

350
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,330
B-But... you, Haruta...

351
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,960
are important to me.

352
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,910
That's why... I couldn't do that.

353
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,560
I can't do that.

354
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,990
Wanting to cherish someone,

355
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,680
the feeling of loving someone,

356
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,310
the coolness of facing it without running away...

357
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:41,130
The one who taught me all these,

358
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,220
is you.

359
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,880
That's why...

360
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,390
I really... respect you.

361
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,400
Thank you very much.

362
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,390
Let's work hard tomorrow.

363
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,370
What are you crying for?

364
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,410
I'm not crying.

365
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,670
- Naruse.
- Yes?

366
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,260
Thanks.

367
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,420
It's fine to respect me a little more.

368
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,280
I do respect you.

369
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,190
It's the Christmas Eve flight today.

370
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,240
Weather conditions are favorable without any issues.

371
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,940
Okay. That's good to hear.

372
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,630
However, it's raining in my heart.

373
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,290
Have a happy, great, and holy flight!

374
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,960
Thank you.

375
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,060
- Dispatch!
- Dispatch!

376
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,490
Thank you.

377
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,810
- Have a safe flight.
- Thanks.

378
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,130
This will be my last flight today.

379
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,220
As usual, safety is our top priority.

380
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,860
Yes, Sir.

381
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,090
For today, well...

382
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,260
- I'm sorry.
- Neko.

383
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,920
There will be 173 passengers on board.

384
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,910
There are no issues with the weather and conditions are favorable en route. Is there anything else to add?

385
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,700
Yes.

386
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,380
Please let me take charge of...

387
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,680
today's in-flight announcement.

388
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,050
Please!

389
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,570
Attention all passengers,

390
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,980
thank you very much for choosing

391
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,670
Tenku Peach Airlines Flight 309 to Matsuyama today.

392
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:00,920
Our captain for today is Kurosawa, and the chief purser is Jumonji.

393
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,890
And this is the CA, Haruta, speaking.

394
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,650
Today, this will be the last flight...

395
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,320
for our captain, Kurosawa.

396
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,060
We apologize to everyone,

397
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,640
but please allow me to briefly introduce

398
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,950
Great Captain to you.

399
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,530
What?

400
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,600
Captain Kurosawa...

401
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,890
- is a really absurd person.
- Hey, hey.

402
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,100
Just the other day, he gathered everyone at the riverbank

403
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:38,650
and suddenly said, "All right! Let's have a sumo competition!"

404
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,100
His action really puzzled us at first.

405
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,810
But at that instance,

406
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,480
we fought with one another for real,

407
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:54,020
laughed a lot, and cried.

408
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,250
That's how

409
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,520
we were able to establish a strong bond.

410
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,030
We, the crew...

411
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,170
received lots of love from our captain.

412
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,800
In return, we also want to pass on that love

413
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,070
to someone else,

414
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,650
and want to make someone else happy.

415
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:26,860
Thanks to him, we are able to stand before you now.

416
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,240
I've lost of track what I was going to say.

417
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,590
However... all of us, today

418
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:42,360
it's our responsibility to escort you to your destination.

419
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,690
I hope you have a pleasant flight!

420
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,690
He's so full of nonsense.

421
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:04,240
Runway 348, cleared for take-off.

422
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,510
- Cleared for take-off.
- Cleared for take-off.

423
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,580
[Peach]

424
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,500
This is Captain Kurosawa speaking from the cockpit.

425
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,870
I apologize for the very long-winded greeting from the cabin attendant earlier.

426
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,580
The crew that I place my utmost trust in,

427
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,210
as well as this view, we are enjoying together now,

428
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,820
are what I will never forget in my life.

429
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,150
With 30 years of gratitude in my heart,

430
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,310
I will do my best to serve you today.

431
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,550
With that said, everyone,

432
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,290
Merry Christmas.

433
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:03,260
♫ I saw my happiness reflecting in your eyes ♫

434
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,760

Thank you! Thank you.

443
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,400
Captain, thank you for all the hard work.

444
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,150
Shishimaru, thank you.

445
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,270
Thank you.

446
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,850
Thank you for your service as a pilot for these 30 years.

447
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,950

Thank you very much!

450
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,280
I only sold one cup of coffee.

451
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,830
- Final dispatch!
- What do you mean by "dispatch"?

452
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,660
Dispatch!

453
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,690
Thank you for the hard work.

454
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Are you mentally prepared?

455
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,340
Yes.

456
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,950
When I become a captain,

457
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,690
could you be the first passenger to board my plane?

458
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,420
Of course.

459
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,520

Haruta asked me to pass this on to you.

465
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,660
Jeez, is Santa coming already?

466
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,280
Santa, come!

467
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,990
Do you really want him to come? Are you for real?

468
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,740
- Seriously? Here they come.
- ♪ Santa and Reindeer doo doo doo ♪

All right! Listen!

Reindeer Shishimaru has good news to share with all of you!

475
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,190
It has been decided that Captain Kurosawa

476
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,990
will remain here as a training instructor.

477
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,020
That's wonderful!

478
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,100

- Michibata, thanks for the hard work!
- Thanks for the hard work. Actually...

483
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,280
Well, what a coincidence.

484
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,590
Is it?

485
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,400
T-To celebrate this miracle,

486
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,520
shall we... go out for a meal?

487
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,040
Huh?

488
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,720
Shall we?

489
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,520
Okay, here's today's flight plan.

490
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,090
You made this for me? How cute!

491
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,620
Is it cute?

492
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,640
- Looks good.
- The finishing touch.

493
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,220
What? No! No!

494
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,210
Why did you do that?

495
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,910
- You like sweets, don't you?
- I do.

496
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,940
As a dessert, that is!

497
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,080
Sorry.

498
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,380
Tell me...

499
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,040
what do you like about me?

500
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,510
I feel like I can't leave you alone.

501
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,410
Are you the one to talk?

502
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,560
Somehow... you look pathetic.

503
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,220
Don't call me pathetic. I'm asking what you like about me.

504
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,140
Which part of you I like?

505
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,420
Eat your gratin.

506
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,010
I will.

507
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,600
- Well?
- It's good.

508
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,280
You're lying! This can't taste good.

509
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,420
Then try it.

510
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,790
- No, thanks.
- Try where it has the most sugar.

511
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,220
No, I don't want to.

512
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,270
I said, "no."

513
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,330
It's too sweet. It doesn't go well with sugar.

514
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,340
You got it on your face.

515
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,630
You were trying to kiss me, weren't you?

516
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,190
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

517
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,810
Yeah, I was. No! I-I wasn't.

518
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,820
- You were.
- I—

519
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,980
I'm going to wash my face.

520
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,540
[I'll wait for you at the heliport. - Haruta]

521
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,120
Captain!

522
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:54,010
Your last flight was great.

523
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,090
Thanks.

524
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,940
Thank you for your hard work.

525
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,510
Why did you

526
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,500
ask me to come out here?

527
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,600
Well...

528
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,640
I love you.

529
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,220
I...

530
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,060
love you... Captain.

531
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,400
Wait a second.

532
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,750
Why are you saying that now?

533
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,090
- Stop joking around.
- I'm not kidding.

534
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,500
Haruta...

535
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:53,000
I... have moved on already.

536
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,690
- Do you get that?
- I know.

537
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,360
Oh, I see.

538
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,770
Because I kept saying "I love you" you're being kind...

539
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,740
- and didn't want me to feel embarrassed. Sorry—
- That's not it.

540
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,990
I... don't want...

541
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,810
to part ways with you.

542
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,760
What you're feeling now is admiration.

543
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,460
I can't imagine life...

544
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,860
without you!

545
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,630
That...

546
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,800
is merely a relationship between superior and subordinate, right?

547
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,700
That's not love, is it?

548
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,690
Even I don't know it myself!

549
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,810
This feeling...

550
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,920
I don't know whether it's respect,

551
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,780
f-friendship,

552
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,370
or love.

553
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,690
But, I just...

554
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,810
I just...

555
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,520
am happy...

556
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,740
I'm just happy to receive the love...

557
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,390
you showered upon me.

558
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,390
It was warm...

559
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,030
and comforting.

560
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,940
That's why...

561
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,830
I'd like to be beside you

562
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,570
in the future.

563
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:41,390
I was hoping we can find happiness together.

564
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,020
That's why, Captain...

565
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,250
please let me say this.

566
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:58,890
Is it okay to fall in love with you, Captain?

567
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,180
No, no, no, no...

568
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,550
Do you even know what you're saying?

569
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,660
Captain!

570
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,390
I can't believe this.

571
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,950
It can't be true!

572
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,700
Is it okay...

573
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,110
to fall in love with you, Captain?
