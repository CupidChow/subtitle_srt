00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,550
We shouldn't be sneaking around.

354
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,550
- Let's go hit.
- What?

355
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,340
Batting.

356
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,490
- Good luck!
- Don't underestimate me.

357
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,920
[Home Run]

358
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,340
You did it!

359
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,970
- You're incredible!
- What just happened? It's too loud.

360
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,470
You hit a home run!

361
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,580
That's awesome!

362
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,520
- Captain?
- Naruse?

363
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,920
You're going to bunt? What? Why?

364
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,430
I didn't know what you like, so I bought drinks randomly...

365
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,760
W-Well...

366
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,330
C-Cap...

367
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,710
Thanks.

368
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,620
I'll leave them here.

369
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,010
How unexpected that we all meet here.

370
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,890
I know.

371
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,130
So you two are dating?

372
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,540
- No...
- No, we're not.

373
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,590
But, you know,

374
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,930
I heard rumors that you were.

375
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,720
Well, that's...

376
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,740
I gave him a week to consider.

377
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,940
Like a trial period.

378
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,650
What?

379
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,020
What?

380
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,680
What? A trial period?

381
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,060
A trial period?

382
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,160
Is there such a mail-order-like romance?

383
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,290
I wonder if you can return the goods.

384
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,960
Instant love?

385
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,090
- Haruta.
- Yes?

386
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,450
Is this the reason you rejected Hina?

387
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,650
Captain, that's not the case.

388
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,330
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

Does anyone want beer? Beer, anyone?

392
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
Fall back, Kurosawa! Retire already!

393
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,760
Fall back, you idiot!

Fourth batter and first baseman Kurosawa. Woo-hoo!

395
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,860
- What a duffer, Haruta!
- Why did you come here?

396
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,180
Who knows?

00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,530

Ouch, ouch, ouch!

405
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,130
This is terrible.

Young man!

407
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,380
- I have a favor to ask of you.
- Yes, what can I do for you?

408
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,310
I want to change this flight to an earlier one. Can you do that?

409
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,830
Yes, I understood. It'll take a moment.

410
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,500
What?

411
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,690
I'm sorry!

- Is everything okay?
- It's fine. I'm sorry.

414
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,710
I told you our study meeting starts at 2 p.m., didn't I?

415
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,990
You did. I'm sorry, let's get started.

416
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,240
Where's your tablet?

417
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,900
Haruta, Haruta!

418
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,770
You've been holding onto a passenger's ticket, haven't you?

419
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,970
- Ticket?
- Yes.

420
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,280

- Sorry, I'll take care of it now!
- Wait, wait!

424
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,300
The ground staff has already resolved it.

425
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,940
Is that true?

426
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,540
- Thank goodness.
- Seriously.

427
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,930
Holding on to a passenger's ticket is unheard of.

428
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,930
- I'm sorry.
- This affects the company's reputation.

429
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,420
Get yourself together!

430
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,970

What's wrong?

436
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,410
I'm sorry. I was trying to do everything right, but...

437
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,510
Don't do everything at once. Be responsible for one task at a time.

438
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,070
- Yes, Sir.
- These are the basics.

439
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,570
Yes, Sir. I'm sorry.

440
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,320
You'll be fine.

441
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,150
I know you can do it.

442
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,890
Thank you.

443
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,180
Right.

444
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,210
- You're home?
- Welcome home.

445
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,050
Are you tired?

446
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,910
I was a little sleepy.

447
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,090
Let's draw the sixth card, Shino.

448
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,590
You don't have to push yourself.

449
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,180
I'm not pushing myself at all.

450
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,520
There!

Oh, thanks.

455

- You'll get cold, Shino.
- I'm fine.

456
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,360
Let's share, then. Take half.

457
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,470
This is warm.

458
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,300
Why did she fall down at the crucial moment?

459
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,570
Oh, no.

460
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,290
They're in danger.

461
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,170
I knew she was going to die.

462
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,290
- She's not going to make it.
- I hate this.

463
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,930
It's going to get her leg.

464
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,760
What was that?

466
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,980
You've been working hard.

You, too.

468
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,810
You've caught a cold, haven't you?

469
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,730
But it's Reiji's first flight today.

470
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,430
He'll need me, his partner.

471
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,980
Well, I'll be off!

472
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,120
Take care.

473
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,700

00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,130
Seriously? Crap!

478
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,780
I'm done for it. I have a flight.

479
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,060
I'm sorry, Captain.

480
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,570
I've sent another CA. Go home and rest.

481
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,160
- I can still go.
- I said, go home!

482
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,420
Captain...

483
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,420
You probably think it's just a cold.

484
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,620
But what happens if you pass out on the flight?

485
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,440
Not only you can't provide service,

486
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,800
but what about your duty to protect passengers' lives?

487
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,250
If you can't see your surroundings, you're going to lose something important one day.

488
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,560
A self-centered person like you has no right to be in the air!

489
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,910
You...

490
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,820

No one else would scold you so seriously.

Gosh, I really hate myself.

00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:03,470
I always mess up and cause trouble for everyone.

496

want to tell you something, Shino.

524
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,880

00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,530
realized after spending this week with you,

that I really do love you, Shino.
