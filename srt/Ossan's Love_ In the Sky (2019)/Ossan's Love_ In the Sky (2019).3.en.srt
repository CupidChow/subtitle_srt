Well, the dough...

536
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,940
didn't rise so well.

537
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,490
What about Haruta?

538
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,840
Did Haru mess up or something?

539
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,420
No! Haru did great, of course.

540
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,400
- Really? Thank goodness.
- Yeah.

541
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,760
Is it going to rain?

542
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,090
Oh, my.

543
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,600
The wind is too strong.

544
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,480
They might not be able to land in this condition.

545
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,620
Wait...

546
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,830
Are they going to hold out in the air for a little longer?

547
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,490
- The wind is too strong.
- Roger that.

548
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,750
We'll stand by in the air.

549
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,670
He might be late.

550
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,710
I hope they could land in Tokyo safely.

551
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,960
- Wait, Hina...
- Yes?

552
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,120
You see...

553
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,660
I bought a present, but I forgot it at my place.

554
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,780
What? What are you going to do?

555
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,660
- What should I do?
- Are you asking me?

556
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,110
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Calm down. Are you okay?

557
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,350
What do I do? What do I do?

558
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,670
- Relax, just relax!
- I'm going to go get it.

559
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,590
Are you leaving?

560
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,100
- Excellent work.
- We're back.

561
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,300
Excellent work.

562
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,990
- Excellent work.
- We're back.

563
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,460
Excellent work! Excellent work!

564
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,260
- My shoulders are so stiff.
- Excellent work!

565
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,550
- Dispatch!
- Dispatch!

566
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,450
Everyone, great work today.

567
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,780
Thank you, Sir.

568
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,610
Thanks to all of you, our first flight to Ishigaki Island went smoothly.

569
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,520
I really appreciate it.

570
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,880
Thank you.

571
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,170
I'll be off.

572
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,720
Naruse, Shino's birthday party is today. Hey!

573
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,020
- I'll pass.
- Why? Come.

574
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,150
What's his deal?

575
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,150
He was in such a hurry. Did something happen?

576
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,870
- Did you see that?
- We sure did.

577
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,300
I bet he caused more trouble.

578
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,410
- Again?
- He's a troublemaker.

579
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,770
We finished the tea earlier.

580
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,410
- I'll go buy some more quickly.
- I'll go.

581
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,930
You can't. This is your birthday, Shino.

582
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,440
It's fine! It's going to rain soon. Just wait here.

583
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,910
Wait!

584
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,390
All right. See you tomorrow.

585
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,090
Hello, this is Tenku Peach Airlines.

586
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,590
Yes?

587
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,180
Naruse?

588
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,200
What?

589
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,870
What's with him? Why didn't he say anything?

590
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,040
His father?

591
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,190
I've tried calling him several times, but...

592
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,850
Dad is in critical condition. He might not make it in time.

593
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:08,530
Was he carrying all the burden by himself?

594
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,880
I mean, I... Damn it!

595
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,760
Where in the world is Naruse?

596
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,640
I knew it.

Naruse, go see your dad.

609

Are you listening to me?

610
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,390
What?

611

Let go! What do you think you're doing?
