00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,730
My Dad was a real jerk.

179
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,270
When I was little, he piled up debts, found a girl and left home.

180
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,840
He was a completely hopeless case.

181
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,280
After I became a pilot,

182
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,180
he came home and said he had turned over a new leaf.

183
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,820
He started to demand money.

184
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,440
Humans are untrustworthy.

185
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,150
Nothing good comes out of trust.

186
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,140
That's not necessarily true.

187
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,020
Well...

188
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,400
even though he was a real scumbag,

189
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,270
I think I would've regretted not seeing him in his final moments.

190
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,560
Thank you.

191
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,780
Well then, that's that.

192
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,700
Thank you, too.

193
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,010
Naruse, we're holding Shino's birthday party tomorrow at the dorm, so you should come.

194
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,320
- I'll pass.
- Why?

195
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,910
Don't laugh it off.

196
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,880
You'd better come!

197
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,810
Wait, these are your leftovers!

198
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,990
[HAPPY BIRTHDAY]

199
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,210
Happy Birthday, Shino!

200
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,260
- Happy Birthday!
- Cheers!

201
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,150
- Thanks!
- Cheers, everyone.

202
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,660
Captain, thank you for coming while you're busy.

203
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,220
Thank you.

204
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,730
- Haruta.
- Yes?

205
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,800
- Is this an all-guys party today?
- Yeah.

206
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,210
Where's Hina?

207
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,120
She had to attend a sudden meeting.

208
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,050
I guess that's unavoidable.
[Kanta Michibata | Mechanic]

209
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,220
I'm happy enough to have you guys here to celebrate.

210
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,970
You know, this is my first time in the dorms.

211
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,470
- So this is what it's like...
- Yes.

212
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm actually neighbors with Shino.

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,710
He's taken good care of me.

214
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,960
Oh... is that right?

215
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,560
Shino, can I go home for a bit?

216
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,970
Why?

217
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,650
- I can't hear you.
- I forgot your present.

218
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,270
- You're telling me that?
- Seriously...

219
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,460
- All right, go on.

220
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,820
Well, yes... I left the present at home. Sorry!

221
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,400
You're too loud.

222
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,240
- Naruse, is your meal different?
- Yes, sorry.

223
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,950
Sorry my ass. You shouldn't be eating the gratin today.

224
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,640
But I can't eat vegetables.

225
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,590
Hey, let go.

226
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,310
I'll serve you.

227
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,520
- I hate the taste of carrots.
- I won't put carrots.

228
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,960
- You put carrots.
- Just one. You can handle that, can't you?

229
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,850
If you really can't, just give it to me.

230
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,190
- I see one.
- Haruta!

231
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,480
- Yes?
- Serve me, too.

232
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,080
Of course. Is there anything you dislike?

233
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,840
I can't bring myself to hate anything.

234
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,700
It's great you're not picky.

235
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,290
I forgot we had cheese.

236
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,380
- Here.
- Thanks.

237
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,240
Shino, I want to eat those sausages.

238
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,270
Sure.

239
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,170
You're also in love with him, aren't you? Why aren't you telling him directly?

240
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,320
Are you cutting them into octopuses?

241
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,140
- Do you want to try it?
- Sure.

242
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,650
Let's see...

243
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,320
- Haruta!
- Yes, Sir?

244
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,060
- Add more kimchi.
- Of course.

245
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,100
I told myself to back off from Haruta.

246
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,710
But that's if Haruta and my daughter get together.

247
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,920
However, if this lad or that guy

248
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,600
try to steal him away, it's a different story.

249
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,790
- I brought the kimchi.
- Thanks.

250
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,600
I will give up on Haruta.

251
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,620
But before that, I need to settle things first.

252
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,100
For my sake, for Hina's sake,

253
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,300
and for the future of the Kurosawa Family!

254
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,810
- Captain?
- All right.

255
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,510
It's time... for us to have a showdown.

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,650
What is the meaning of...?

257
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,610
To commemorate Shinomiya's birthday,

258
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,710
we shall now hold the Kurosawa Ping-Pong Cup.

259
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,190
I'd like to take this opportunity to solve unanswered questions.

260
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,380
All right, first is Naruse!

261
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,920
Yes?

262
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,900
- What was the meaning behind that kiss?
- Huh?

263
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,070
Your kiss... with Haruta!

264
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,580
It meant nothing to me.

265
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,610
I don't believe you!

266
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,750
- I'm not lying!
- You're lying!

267
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,360
It seriously meant nothing!

268
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,290
You're wrong.

269
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,790
Wrong.

270
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:26,550
I don't understand the youngsters' prospective.

271
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,590
Next, Shinomiya!

272
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,710
- Yes, Sir!
- What set of rules is this?

273
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:38,670
You... should... be more... honest to... yourself!

274
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:45,080
Why do you... hold back... so much!

275
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,690
Why? Why? Why?

276
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,280
Why? Why?

277
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,390
Why? Why is that?

278
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,720
Why? Tell me!

279
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,600
- Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
- Calm down, Captain!

280
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,290
- Tell me! Tell me why?
- Captain! Captain!

281
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,710
- Captain, what are you talking about?
- Why?

282
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,050
We've been talking about you!

283
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,990
What?

284
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,420
What does that mean?

285
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,760
Don't worry. It has nothing to do with you, Haruta!

286
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,150
See? He's saying I'm irrelevant to all this!

287
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,310
Wait. Is he lying? Is this about me?

288
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,880
You should know if you've seen his sketches.

289
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,980
W-Woah! Those were...!

290
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,800
Huh? Shino said that was a hobby.

291
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,180
Woah!

292
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,950
- Is it not?
- You're an idiot!

293
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,030
- It means he likes you!
- Huh?

294
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,470
S-Sorry, I'm confused.

295
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,070
Pardon?

296
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,810
What's this? Wait...

297
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,690
Captain, what's going on here?

298
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,460
I also like you.

299
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,890
Pardon?

300
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,390
I can't bring myself to hate you.

301
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,970
I like you!

302
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,710
I like you, Haruta. I like you, Haruta!

303
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,110
I like Haruta!

304
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,470
- Captain, calm down.
- I like you, Haruta!

305
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,740
I like Haruta!

306
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,750
- Captain!
- I like you!

307
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,970
- Captain!
- I like you!

308
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,010
I've come to understand... how you all feel.

309
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,750
We've all deepened our bonds today.

310
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:14,840
This concludes the Kurosawa Ping-Pong Cup.

311
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,180
Good night.

[Ossan's Love: In the Sky]

313
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,480
Captain!

314
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,810
You see...

315
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,690
I must say...

316
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,740
I'm such a bothersome old grandpa.

317
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,150
You're not... a bother...

318
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,410
Even I am... surprised by myself.

319
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,220
I didn't think...

320
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,630
I'd fall in love so hard at my age.

321
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,570
I simply...

322
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,880
have no clue... what's happening...

323
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,940
to myself anymore.

324
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,450
Captain,

325
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,160
I...

326
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,380
cannot see you in that way.

327
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,290
I know. I know.

328
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,050
I know that.

329
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,510
I don't plan on inconveniencing you.

330
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,030
Besides... as a father,

331
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,280
I wish to cheer on my daughter.

332
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,810
- Captain...
- So...

333
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,930
I shall end this.

334
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,710
I'll stop loving you.

335
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,470
I'll end it.

336
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,460
However...

337
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,700
please give me more time.

338
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,530
Eventually,

339
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,460
I'll return to be your normal "Captain".

340
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,500
Yes, of course.

341
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

342
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,960
I apologize as well.

343
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,440
Gosh...

344
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,140
You're so kind, Haruta.

345
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,140
That's why I can't come to hate you.

346
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,580
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,490
Goodbye.

348

Goodbye.

349

Shino...

350
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,150
What do you like about me?

351
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,580
You idiot.

352
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,450
Who said I like you?

353
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,030
That was obviously a joke.

354
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,800
If that's the case, then...

355
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,500
You have Hina.

356
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,590
- Treasure her.

- Exactly!

- Yes, Sir.

it has to be the engine.

00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,730
We're... rivals now!

540
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,360
But I...

541
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,500
Bring it on, rival.

542
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Sure.

543
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,440
♫ I saw my happiness reflecting in your eyes ♫

544
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,800
♫ I've been searching for a future full of laughter ♫

545
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,460
Good work!

546
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,540
Good work! Good work!

547
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,370
What's with you, Haruta? You're in a good mood.

548
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,390
Karasuma, good work!

549
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,250
I sold a limited edition item,

550
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,540
a wallet, and coffee for the first time ever.

551
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,960
Great job, Haruta!

552
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,220
Brand new Soichi Haruta, dispatched.

553
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,330
Dispatch, I mean, Haru-patch.

554
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,580
- Haru-patch!
- Haru-patch.

555
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,320
That was thanks to the plane fans.

556
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,900
Today's sales don't count.

557
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,710
They do count. How much did you sell, Arisu?

558
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,550
One octopus balls platter.

559
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,250
That's a rare sale.

560
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,620
You're going easy on her.

561
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,300
Keep it up and catch up to Neko, you hear?

562
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,810
I won't just catch up. I'll surpass her.

563
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,200
- How annoying.
- Yeah, Haru-patch.

564

♫ While looking into each other's eyes, ♫

568
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,150
He's not here.

569
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,590
♫ It's a fleeting dream I saw in a pipe dream ♫

570
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,780
♫ While letting the short white breath, ♫

571
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,730
Thanks.

572
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,030
I haven't done anything that deserves your thanks.

573
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,520
You're studying mechanics, right?

574
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:50,310
On top of your own studies. That's incredible.

575
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,390
I just like... planes.

576
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,370
Naruse, you look cuter with that sort of expression.

577
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,520
I'll be in your care, Captain-in-the-making.

578
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,120
Okay?

579
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,440
- Oh, my bad.
- It's fine.

580
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,450
I'll be in your care.

581
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,930
How many times do you say that?

582
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,940
Hit me right here.

583
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,240
- Why?
- Try me!

584
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,890
- Out of the blue?
- Don't worry. I'm working out.

585
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,810
What's wrong?

586
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:47,410
I feel... irritated?

587
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,670
Huh?

588
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,590
Am I... upset?

589
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:56,120
Oh, you're back. Do you want dinner?

590
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,020
I'm good today.

591
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,530
What?

592
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,710
I'm going to bed.

593
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,390
What's with him?

594
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,990
Who knows?

595
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,460
Attention passengers.

596
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,920
I must ask you an unsightly question.

597
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,930
Where does the plane I'm on head to?

598
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,750
What's the matter, young man?

599
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,330
Nothing really.

600
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,320
Actually, this is an employee only zone. Sorry.

601
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,750
Is my Dad around?

602
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,400
Your dad? What's his name?

603
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,260
Shinomiya...

604
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,620
Kaname Shinomiya.

605
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,620
Kaname... Shinomiya?

606
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,190
Yes.

607
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,340
What?

608
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,350
Y-You're Shino's... really?
