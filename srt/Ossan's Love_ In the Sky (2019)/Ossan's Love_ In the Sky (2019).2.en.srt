00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,240
He somehow looks down on us mechanics.

178
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,510
I was also put off by that.

179
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,950
Well, in any case, let me speak to Naruse.

180
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,540
No.

181
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,990
I'll ask the management for advice.

182
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,300
I've been asked by the management

183
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,000
to find out from you about what happened.

184
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,710
I have nothing to say about this.

185
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,260
Don't say that.

186
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,420
I'm not interrogating you or anything.

187
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,530
For troubling you with my personal affairs,

188
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,710
I am very sorry.

189
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,850
Personal...

190
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,530
What?

191
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,960
Nothing.

192
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,900
If you have any trouble, just talk to me anytime.

193
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,740
Thank you very much.

194
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,600
Please excuse me.

195
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,420
He has nothing to say...

196
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:42,020
Didn't you and Haruto kiss?

197
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,750
I have to ask you about the power harassment.

198
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,440
It didn't happen.

199
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,550
Besides, I'm at the lowest level in the hierarchy.

200
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,260
You're right.

201
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,240
- Got it. Thank you.
- Please excuse me.

202
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,890
It hurts.

203
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:20,120
What is this pain... in my heart?

204
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,010
- He's picking a fight for no reason.
- Just calm down.

205
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,670
I'll obey if it's Captain Kurosawa's order, but Naruse's demand is unreasonable.

206
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,380
How should I put it?

207
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,640
He wants us to check the landing gear?

208
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,150
I told him that we have maintenance schedules, so it can't be done on such short notice.

209
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,460
- You're right, indeed.
- Then Naruse said,

210
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,060
"If anything happens, will you take responsibility for it?"

211
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,910
Who the hell does he think he is?

212
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,390
- Did you tell him that?
- Of course not.

213
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,830
I see. Let me speak to him.

214
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,630
Really, that guy...

215
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,650
He simply doesn't have any respect for us mechanics.

216
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,450
Come on. Let's go get some coffee.

217
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,640
- Please let me know after you've checked.
- Got it.

218
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,760
Naruse. Naruse.

219
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,250
I know you heard me. Don't ignore me.

220
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,300
What do you want?

221
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,890
- What do you plan to do about that email?
- Huh?

222
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,980
- It has nothing to do with you.
- Of course, it does!

223
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,560
My name was mentioned, there was even a photo of my face.

224
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,650
Well, given that you keep making enemies,

225
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,030
it's no surprise that people call you an authority abuser.

226
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,950
What does a newbie like you know?

227
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,370
Well, I might be a newbie,

228
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,050
but the Captain said you can't fly a plane with one person alone.

229
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,300
I know you have your reason.

230
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,930
You should speak in a way they can understand.

231
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,340
Hey...

232
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,240
- What?
- I...

233
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,540
really hate people who poke their noses

234
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,860
into others' business.

235
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,480
You are really...

236
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,560
Naruse, that's the problem with you.

237
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,840
Hey, wait a minute!

238
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,600
Well, all of a sudden

239
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,260
I get a knotted feeling in the pit of my stomach.

240
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,880
Did you experience any heart palpitations?

241
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,350
Yes, I do.

242
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,590
Do you tear up... all of a sudden?

243
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,780
Yes, I do.

244
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,940
I see.

245
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,700
Will this hinder me from doing my job?

246
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,520
No, your blood pressure and heart rate are normal,

247
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,080
so I think you're fine.

248
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,280
I see. But... I'm not sick or anything?

249
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,990
It feels weird for me to tell you this, but...

250
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,250
if I were to give a name to that illness...

251
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,770
Yes?

252
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,370
It's love sickness.

253
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,890
What?

254
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,600
L-Love?

255
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,500
What? It's love?

256
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,140
What?

257
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,500
I, Musashi Kurosawa, am in love?

258
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,110
What?

259
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,150
Excuse me, Captain.

260
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,590
Did you go to the clinic? Are you feeling unwell?

261
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,170
No. I'm perfectly fine.

262
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,240
Good to hear. Well...

263
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,160
can you spare some time tonight?

264
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,360
Of course, no problem.

265
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,390
Thank you very much.

266
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,900
Naruse abused his authority?

267
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,810
Some strange email was circulating among the employees.

268
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,550
It even spread on social media.

269
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,630
I don't use social media.

270
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,300
By the way, is Haruta all right?

271
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,110
Haru is probably just an innocent victim.

272
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,920
I see.

273
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,620
You're not eating the strawberry? I'll eat it then.

274
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,640
I was saving the best for last.

275
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,200
- Were you really? I'm so sorry!
- It's not your fault, Hina.

276
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,670
It's my fault for not eating it until the very end.

277
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,540
I did it again.

278
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,080
I-I'll order another one.

279
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,380
- It's all right!
- Are you sure?

280
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,010
Sorry. Sorry. I'm fine.

281
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,230
Sorry for the disturbance.

282
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,640
- How are things with Haruta?
- Pardon?

283
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,450
We're going to the oden restaurant that you recommended.

284
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,540
I'm not sure if it's a good place for a date.

285
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,850
It's not exactly a date or anything.

286
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,190
What? Even though you addressed him as "Haru"?

287
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,120
Well, that... It's too troublesome to address him as "Senior".

288
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,280
Tachibana!

289
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,490
See you around!

290
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,800
Shino, you idiot!

291
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,690
See you later.

292
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,410
[Ossan's Love: In the Sky]

293
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,650
You seem to have gotten used to being a cabin attendant.

294
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,840
Thank you. I still have a lot to learn.

295
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,490
It's always good to have some emotional strain.

296
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,010
I agree.

297
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,780
Didn't you say you have something to tell me?

298
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,590
Yes. It's about Naruse.

299
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:10,220
I tried speaking to him, but he's gotten angrier.

300
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,230
- He's socially awkward.
- I know, right?

301
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,380
He doesn't trust the people around him

302
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,070
and that really annoys me.

303
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,890
Indeed.

304
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,870
Wherever I work, I always value teamwork.

305
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,200
That's why, I wanted to...

306
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,400
consult with you if there's anything I can do to help.

307
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,590
I feel fortunate to have a subordinate like you.

308
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,110
Perhaps it's time for me to step in.

309
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,150
I'll try speaking with Naruse tomorrow.

310
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,690
- Captain.
- Yes?

311
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,260
I think he's back at the dorm.

312
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,090
Could you come with me now and speak with him?

313
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,210
What? His home?

314
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,290
Well... it's just right up ahead. I hope you can come.

315
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:09,040
No... I'm not mentally prepared to visit his home.

316
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,300
What's wrong?

317
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,970
No, it's nothing.

318
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,180
Is this all right? You won't be able to turn back, Kurosawa!

319
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,410
Captain?

320
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,460
I'm... going home for today.

321
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,330
But my dorm is really close.

322
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,190
Good work today.

323
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,690
Okay.

324
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,370
What excuse did you come up with?

325
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,360
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about your drawings.

326
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,360
That wasn't an excuse. I'm just practicing drawing.

327
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,240
You like him, don't you?

328
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,570
What?

329
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,640
Are you annoyed... about me?

330
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,060
What?

331
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,260
I kissed Haruta.

332
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,400
Haruta already has his match.

333
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,310
Don't toy with him anymore.

334
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,900
That guy is not my type at all.

335
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,760
Shinomiya, you're the type who suppresses your feelings

336
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,390
and just bears with it, correct?

337
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,290
What do you mean?

338
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,510
I guess that's easier than confessing your love to him.

339
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,910
Leave me alone.

340
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,060
If this goes on, you'll never be happy.

341
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,220
- Look here...
- I'm home.

342
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,440
Wow, that looks great. I'm starving. Did you make extra, Shino?

343
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,720
- Yes, I did.
- I want some.

344
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,170
Thanks.

345
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,400
Hey...

346
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,590
Hey... hello?

347
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,120
Hey.

348
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,150
Hey, there. Hello?

349
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,190
You're always eating gratin.

350
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,070
Are you being threatened by the Gratin Prince?

351
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,520
Who the hell is that?

352
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,940
You're talking to me now.

353
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,970
What are you reading?

354
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,960
Is that a manual for maintenance?

355
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,800
Naruse is probably more knowledgeable than some mechanics.

356
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,850
Well... look here...

357
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,430
You may think it's uncool or tacky to explain to people in detail,

358
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,460
but it wouldn't be funny if you're hired from your job.

359
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,060
It's none of your business.

360
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,880
Not that again.

361
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,470
W-Wait... H-Hey, hey!

362
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,140
You... Naruse!

363
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,780
Let him go.

364
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,460
I'm so frustrated.

365
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,700
He really pisses me off.

366
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,800
This won't do.

367
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,860
[Peach]

368
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,810
What?

369
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,840
- Excuse me, Karasuma.
- Yes?

370
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,770
Can you explain this to me?

371
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,750
Haven't you heard?

372
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:40,030
You've been suspended until the investigation is complete.

373
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,290
Excuse me.

374
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,850
- Can I take this, too?
- Yes, thank you.

375
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,710
Thank you for the hard work!

376
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,860
Neko, can't you help me with this?

377
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,420
Okay!

378
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll never forgive him.

379
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,650
I know where you're coming from, but...

380
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,950
Is this about Naruse?

381
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,520
- Listen, Arisugawa...
- Just call me Arisu.

382
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,950
What did Naruse say to you, Arisu?

383
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,380
Yesterday, I pressed the wrong button on the intercom,

384
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,340
and my report to the crew was broadcasted to the entire plane.

385
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,460
- He reprimanded me for that.
- And then?

386
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,500
I was furious. That was totally an abuse of authority!

387
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,870
He doesn't have the right to be a pilot.

388
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,430
Wait, isn't that your fault? Am I wrong?

389
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,260
- Huh?
- Bad news!

390
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,730
- Y-Y-Yes?
- It's about Naruse.

391
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,030
His disciplinary conference has started.

392
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,950
I need to step out for a bit.

393
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,320
[Ryu Naruse is a thieving cat who sleeps with anyone.]

394
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,160
We do not entirely believe the details of the complaint,

395
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,890
but could you explain about this power harassment?

396
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,460
After some questioning, there was indication

397
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,280
that you had been intimidating the mechanics and cabin attendants.

398
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,180
I heard the cabin attendant even cried.

399
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,820
Is that so?

400
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,070
This directly affects the reputation of our company.

401
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,980
Don't you want to continue being a pilot?

402
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,480
[Ossan's Love: In the Sky]

403
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,180
Captain...

404
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,330
What's going to happen to Naruse?

405
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,520
It depends, but he may not be able to fly for a while.

406
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,820
Please, Captain. Let's go.

407
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,880
H-Hey, Haruta. Wait.

408
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,180
Silence means that you admit the power harassment?

409
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:02,090
Very well. Please remain at home until we decide on your penalization.

410
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,420
We'll inform you once it has been confirmed.

411
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,930
Please excuse me.

412
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,460
- Who are you?
- I am Shinomiya from the maintenance department.

413
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,160
Well, from my viewpoint as a mechanic,

414
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,070
as far as our department is concerned,

415
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,860
I have not heard of any issues of him abusing his authority.

416
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,110
His briskness may have rubbed people the wrong way.

417
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,670
When it comes to planes, he's more passionate than anybody I know.

418
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,330
On November 1, we received a report from Naruse after the flight.

419
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,250
He conducted an inspection on the steering system.

420
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:44,880
Thanks to him, we were able to avoid the danger of the plane shaking on the runway.

421
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,530
He isn't only knowledgeable about being a pilot,

422
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,610
but about being a mechanic as well.

423
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,440
However, no matter how talented he is, abuse of authority cannot be tolerated.

424
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,930
Please excuse me!

425
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,970
Come on in.

426
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,960
W-Well...

427
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,130
This is Arisugawa, the cabin attendant who cried.

428
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,930
Well... I...

429
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,420
I was very angry,

430
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,030
and I still am angry with him now.

431
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,340
Hey!

432
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,280
But I was in the wrong, too.

433
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,390
So...

434
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,310
- I'll forgive you.
- Watch it!

435
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,370
I should have educated her properly.

436
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,750
I am very sorry for causing all the trouble.

437
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,920
Apologize!

438
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,430
I am very sorry!

439
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,910
Well, Naruse is also in the wrong, too.

440
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,970
He doesn't trust others and wants to solve everything alone.

441
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,750
He's a guy with a huge ego, pretending to be cool.

442
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,500
What?

443
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,500
But he's a very hardworking person,

444
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,690
and he loves the sky.

445
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,810
He values safety more than anyone else.

446
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,430
Before I joined here, I was working at a small sports shoes company.

447
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:16,470
Naruse reminds me of a stubborn craftsman who works there.

448
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,300
Well... in short, this guy's like an old man.

449
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,660
Huh?

450
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,640
He's not good at interacting with people,

451
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,320
but he's passionate about his job.

452
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,820
From what I know of him,

453
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,060
he might be an outstanding pilot in the future.

454
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,370
So... what I'm trying to say is...

455
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,580
Please reconsider your decision!

456
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,850
Captain Kurosawa.

457
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,700
What do you think?

458
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,880
Gaining knowledge or a skill

459
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,750
comes naturally when you do your job.

460
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:07,220
Ultimately, the job as a pilot requires the interaction with people.

461
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,250
Sometimes we disagree, understand each other,

462
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,910
overcome obstacles, and move forward together.

463
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,910
If there is one thing that you're lacking,

464
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,460
it would be your willingness to trust others.

465
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,760
Yes, Sir.

466
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:35,400
He is an exceptional and talented pilot.

467
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,080
Could you leave this matter to me?

468
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,520
We shall leave it to you, then.

469
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,990
Thank you very much.

470
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,360
I shall take my leave.

471
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,540

472
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,920
Good for you.

Well, say something.

474
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,700
- Ah.
- What do you mean by "Ah"?

475
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,810
You told me to say something.

476
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,580
After "Ah", comes "rigato". "Arigato".
(T/N: "Thank you")

477
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,930
Well, but I couldn't be of much help.

478
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,660
Huh? Did you just smile?

479
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,200
What?

480
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,930
- You smiled, didn't you?
- I did not.

481
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,110
Smile again. Why did you smile, anyway?

482

- I didn't smile.

No problem. It wasn't a big deal.

- Captain?
- Can I ask you...

487
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,800
one thing that's been bugging me?

488
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,350
Sure. Was there a problem on a plane?

489
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,200
No wonder.

490
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:16,070

00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:29,800
You are... in "L" with Haruta, right?

495
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,980
- "L"?
- Those were drawn by a person who's in love with Haruta!

You can fool him, but you can't fool me.

- Yes, I love him.

I'm desperately in love with him.

504

Do you plan to confess your feelings to him?

You're also in love with him, aren't you?

506

Why? Tell me the reason.

Are you sure?

It's great that Naruse finally cleared his name.

521
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,310
He really is socially awkward.

What makes you so great to criticize him?

If you put it that way, I am not.

A date... I suppose.

533
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,040
Where shall we go?

534
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,000
- To the aquarium?
- Ah.

535
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,040
But I don't really like fishes.

536
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,930
Do you mean eating them?

537
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,320
Eating and watching them.

538
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,590
- You don't like watching fishes?
- Not really.

539
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,620
- Did you know that "chikuwa" is also made out of fish?
- I love this.

540
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,060
The amusement park, then.

541
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,020
- What?
- This place.

542
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,430
- Wow, looks amazing!
- Doesn't it? I want to ride this.

543
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,530
They say it's the biggest one.

544
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,610
Good morning.

545
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,980
At 9 p.m...

546
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,890
I shall wait for you at the observation deck.

547
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,190
From Kurosawa.

548
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,880
"I shall wait"?

What? Why are we meeting here?

551
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,030
I wonder why he wants to meet me.

552
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,720
Wow, it's beautiful!

553
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,080
What?

554
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,150
- Haruta?
- C-Cap...

555
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,920
C-Captain?

556
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,890
Haruta... can you hear me?

557
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,010
Y-Yes, I can hear you!

558
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,460
You see...

559
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,280
To be honest with you,

560
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,720
I've been thinking about you

561
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,090
a lot lately.

562
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,500
Is it okay

563
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,360
to fall in love with you, Haruta?

564
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,330
What?

565
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,770
Is it okay...

566
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,600
to fall in love with you, Haruta?

567
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,710
Huh? What does that mean?

568
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,090
L-Love me? What? What?

569
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,620
I'm the one he loves? What's going on? I don't get it at all.

570
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,550
W-Wait a minute! B-But C-Captain...

571
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,390
- An "okay" sign?
- W-W-What?

572
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,770
- Does that mean it's okay?
- I-I-It's...

573
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:16,390
- Yes!
- I can't accept your love.

574
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,440
- Huh? Why, why?
- I did it!

Why? Cap-Cap...

Yes!

580

Did the...

581
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,090
Captain confess to me?

582
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,760
Not only that, did I give him the "okay"?

583
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,240
No, I didn't agree to it.

584
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,610
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Nothing at all!

585
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,350
- What?
- Nothing! Nothing!

Haru!

587

Oh my, that was really unlucky of you.

588
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,810
Tell me about it.

589
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,780
- I don't need that. I'm fine.
- But you're bleeding.

590
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,210
- Am I?
- Yes, you are. Right here.

591
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,660
We can still go to the amusement park.

592
