182
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,420
we have changed this year's program.

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,270
Oh my, the number of events has increased.
[Fans Appreciation Day 2019[

184
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,980
Are we able to prepare all of these by next week?

"Handshake event"?

186
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,620
I know it's tough doing this on top of your daily work,

187
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,860
but let's work hard to make the events a success.

188
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,290
Okay.

189
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,580
I'll be right back.

190
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,600
How do we handle all the workload on top of our regular duties?

191
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,610
We should first think of how we can do this.

192
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,270
Come on, Reiji!

193
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,480
- What?
- Don't "what" me.

194
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,210
You suddenly announced a reform and a profit target,

195
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,180
this is worsening the mood within the team.

196
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,940
Haruppi, a company can't survive on mood alone.

197
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,850
But... everyone loves the warm atmosphere like a family.

198
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,580
I told you that will not work.

199
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,720
If we don't provide productive results,

200
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,150
that warm family feeling is pointless.

201
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,190
Come on, Reiji!

202
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,680
Reiji seems to have a hard time.

203
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,670
What can I say? With the sudden reformation,

204
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,040
the team can't keep up with the change.

205
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,540
Since he's still new, he must be struggling to find the right method.

206
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,280
You're... probably right.

207
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,800
We can only face it and hope for the best.

208
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,130
In order to move forward,

209
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,850
I've told Hina everything.

- Huh?
- Don't worry.

214
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,560

- No.
- I seek your approval.

220
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,410
I said, no.

221

Just kidding!

After working as a CA for a week,

I felt

285
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,110
the warmth of the employees.

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,280
Instead of

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,640
imposing the amount of sales on them,

288
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,300
I believed that interacting with many customers,

289
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,160
and increasing the number of fans,

290
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,300
would be the fastest way to achieve the results sought by upper management.

291
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,360
In the end,

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,400
prefers Shino.

359
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,180
That's enough.

360
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,010
Okay, okay. Rest in my room for now.

361
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,330
I should bring my drink, then.

362
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,870
Wait, why? You have your own room, Shino.

363
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,880
- No, I don't.
- Of course, you do. You do.

364
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,790
What are you doing? What are you doing?

365
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,750
Stop singing. Naruse, give me a hand here!

366
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,320
Stop singing, I said!

367
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,150
Haruppi and Naru-sama...

368
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,320
- What are you...?
- Huh?

369
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,790
♪ Haruppi and Naru-sama doo loo doo ♪

370
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,520
- What kind of song is that?
- ♪ Haruppi and Naru-sama... ♪

371
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,190
- Watch it! Stay still.
- ♪ doo loo doo ♪

372
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,000

♪ Haruppi and Naru-sama... ♪

374
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,990
Reiji, don't fall asleep!

375
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,570
You'll catch a cold.

376
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,040
Here is your water. Drink up.

377
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,560
Good boy.

378
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,940
Jeez!

379
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,510
I'm sorry.

380
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,790
It must have been tough...

381
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,510
preparing for the events, right?

382
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,930
Like hell, it was.

383
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,090
I'm still not convinced by your reform idea.

384
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,110
I know.

385
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm sorry.

386
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,410
Hold on.

387
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:14,020
You must be having a hard time fulfilling the order from the upper management.

388
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,910
We'd do our best if it'll improve the company.

389
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,970
- Haruppi!
- What is it? What's wrong?

390
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,960
Hey, are you all right?

391
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,840
Okay, don't cry. It was my bad.

392
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,750
Aren't we dancing now?

393
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,900
W-Wait, wait. Whoa!

394
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,660
What the heck are you doing?

395
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,040
Dear visitors, welcome to

396
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,170
Tenku Peach Airlines' Fans Appreciation Event!

397
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,320
Here is a quiz for you. The plane's boarding entrance is...

398
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,820
We're holding a quiz event for the Fans Appreciation Event.

399
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,600
Please help yourself to more coffee.

400
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,910
Thank you very much!

401
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,720
You want matching ones? Sure!

402
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,430
Thank you.

403
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,770
Young lady, thank you.

404
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,950
- Come here!
- Thank you for coming.

405
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,410
Okay. Look over here.

406
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,510
Looks like the Fans Appreciation Day is a success.

407
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,850
Apparently so. It's great.

408
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,770
Please bring additional ones.

409
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,910
Okay, sure!

410
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,380
- Could you please add more fuel?
- You bet.

411
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,750
Who's the person in charge?

412
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,350
I said, who is the person in charge?

413
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,520
Get me the person in charge!

414
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,000
What's going on?

415
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,900
[Ossan's Love: In The Sky]

416
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,070
I am in charge here. How may I help you?

417
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,110
"How may I help you?" Cut the crap!

418
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,580
- Are you the person in charge?
- I am.

419
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,350
My apologies for any inconvenience...

420
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,150
All right, next!

421
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,120
Shinomiya here. What is it?

422
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,300
Bad news... Captain Kurosawa is...

423
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,080
Calm down. What's wrong?

424
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,810
Calm down. Take a deep breath. What happened?

425
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,740
Captain Kurosawa is in trouble.

426
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,670
What happened to Captain? Hey!

427
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,150
Please come over quickly!

428
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,870
- Something seems to happen at the office.
- I'll go.

429
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,400
It'll be fine. Leave it to me.

430
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,000
Excuse me.

431
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,550
I heard that numbered tickets will be handed out if you start queuing from 9 a.m on.

432
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,300
- That's right.
- But when I came at 9 a.m., there were none left. What the hell is this?

433
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,990
Why should I suffer because of those who broke the rules and got what they want?

434
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,640
- Don't you think it's unfair?
- Why is he angry?

435
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,170
He probably couldn't receive the limited edition Tenpuchi goods.

436
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,010
- We are very sorry about this.
- Look...

437
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,150
I was a huge fan of your airline.

438
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,320
But don't you think this kind of treatment is cruel?

439
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,310
- What's going on here?
- You're causing trouble here.

440
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,180
- No, it's fine.
- Hey!

441
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,460
- What the hell! What are you doing?
- Just let him go.

442
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,750
- Are you picking a fight?
- Please, calm down!

443
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,040
Calm down! Watch out! Please put the chair down.

444
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,130
Just calm down!

445
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,030
Haruta, stay away!

446
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,990
- Watch out!
- Put it down!

447
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,950
- Put it down! It's dangerous!
- Sir...

448
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,780
Captain!

449
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,670
- Cap─
- Dad!

450
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,920
- No, no! Sir!
-What the heck?

451
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,710
- Put it down for now! Calm down!
- Did I commit a crime or something?

452
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,460
- I don't know, but put the chair down!
- What do you mean you don't know?

453
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,450
- Please calm down, Sir.
- Haruta... Haruta...

454
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,850
He came here at 9 a.m., but he couldn't get a ticket.

455
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,460
- What?
- See?

456
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,710
- What did I do wrong?
- We are terribly sorry!

457
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,540
Sir, these...

458
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,880
These are the limited edition badges that were handed out last year to customers who flew with our airlines...

459
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,210
more than 30 times annually.

460
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,320
That's right.

461
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,820
It's my first time seeing them.

462
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,310
Well...

463
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:08,010
thank you so much for your continuous support.

464
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,590
Let us discuss this further.

465
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,850
Could you follow us over there, please?

466
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,390
Well, well...

467
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,370
if you insist...

468
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,830
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much! Ouch!

469
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,900
You're right.

470
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,180
You've completed the entire collection!

471
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,800
Captain, are you all right?

472
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,320
Haruta... are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

473
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,990
I should be the one asking you that!

474
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,840
- Huh?
- How could you be so reckless?

475
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,150
If something had happened to you...

476
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,710
I'm glad you're okay.

477
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,910
Nah, I'm fine.

478
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,010
I'm fine.

479
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,760
- Are you really okay?
- I'm fine.

480
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,510
Hina... thanks.

481
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,140
I'm fine.

482
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,120
Thank you.

483
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,410
Thanks to you, everything was settled amicably.

484
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,420
I didn't do much, really.

485
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,270
The Fans Appreciation Day was also a resounding success.

486
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,450
The management was initially focused on only raising profits,

487
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,160
but now they're saying we should focus on the customers' satisfaction.

488
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,470
It's so typical of them. They did a one-eighty.

489
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,840
What the heck is that?

490
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,250
Well, that's how a company works.

491
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,720
It's going to be tough on all of you, moving forward.

492
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,560
I'm counting on you, Haruppi.

493
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,940
I'll do my best!

494
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,880
I look forward to that!

495
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,680
Do your best, too, Reiji!

496
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,430
I will.

497
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,020
By the way...

498
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,880
I've lost the memory of the night I drank at your dorm.

499
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,050
Did I... cause any trouble?

500
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,480
You caused so much trouble.

501
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,590
- W-What did I do?
- You were crying buckets.

502
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,030
You said, "Haruppi!"

503
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,910
and then...

504
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,160
My dance skill is better than that.

505
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,920
I'm so glad you didn't get hurt badly.

506
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,600
Agreed.

507
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,650
Does it hurt?

508
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,210
- No, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

509
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,010
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

510
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,670
There's something...

511
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,310
that I want to tell you.

512
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,300
Is it the thing about Haru that you mentioned the other day?

513
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,620
No, it's not that.

514
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,380
Actually...

515
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:47,080
Jeez, they should have cleaned up.

516
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,410
Those two are acting strangely. Did they come back from a date?

517
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,390
Haruppi and Naru-sama...

518
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,060
What are you... Huh?

519
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,450
Haruta... and Naruse?

520
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,110
You're leaving your stuff everywhere. Clean this up, will you?

521
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,610
Sorry.

522
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,550
Next time, shall we go together?

523
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,620
To see the light decorations.

524
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,510
I'm not going.

525
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,310
Then...

526
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,710
what about b-burial mounds?

527
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,190
That's even worse.

528
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,050
How about... we go eat sweets?

529
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,590
I said, I'm not going. What do you want?

530
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,760
Well...

531
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,560
Then how about...

532
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,720
the art museum?

533
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,560
I'm fine with anywhere... as long as we go together.

534
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,680
You're persistent.

535
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,400
I have no interest in you at all.

536
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,330
Can you just give up already? You're a nuisance!

537
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,230
Naruse?

538
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,120
What's wrong with Naruse?

539
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,300
Go after him.

540
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,290
Huh?

541
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,390
Go find Naruse.

542
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,020
Well...

543
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,270
Go now!

544
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,320
Okay.

545
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,950
Where is he anyway?

546
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,710
Huh?

547
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,030
What are you doing here?

548
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,820
This is my first time being rejected.

549
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,470
I see.

550
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,060
Your first time?

551
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,770
It hurts.

552
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:18,280
That's how people feel when they're rejected.

553
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,270
Now you know, right?

554
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,750
You should also understand the feeling of having coffee thrown at you

555
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,320
by someone you don't know.

556
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,080
I'm sorry.

557
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,050
It's fine. I don't mind. Sorry for mentioning it.

558
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,240
I'm a loser. I'm a holeless idiot.

559
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,850
You're not. Stop it, Naruse.

560
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,140
Naruse, that's not true at all.

561
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,480
You're really working hard now.

562
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,150
You've learned to interact with others,

563
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,710
and you care a lot for the team, don't you?

564
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,780
You're doing well.

565
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,290
I was able to do all that

566
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,250
thanks to you.

567
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,400
I'm flattered.

568
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,790
You're too kind.

569
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,410
I mean it.

570
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,480
Naruse.

571
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,980
Let's go home.

572
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,660
♫ I saw my happiness reflecting in your eyes ♫

573
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,650
♫ I've been searching for a future full of laughter ♫

574
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,880
Your hands are cold.

575
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,650
Let's go.

576
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,050
♫ Because I've always been watching you, ♫

577
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,220
♫ I've noticed small changed in you ♫

578
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:26,300
♫ before everyone else has.
When you follow her with your eyes, you look sorrowful ♫

579
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:31,540
♫ I can see you're in love ♫

580
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:37,170
♫ Even if I wish for one or two, I'm not her ♫

581
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,280
♫ I can't be her substitute ♫

582
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,850
♫ Even if I wish for three or four, I feel lifeless ♫

583
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,620
Shino?

584
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,630
♫ Until the day you wake up ♫

585
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,270
Welcome back.

586
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,580
We're home.

587
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:04,780
I... have decided to move out of the dorm.

588
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,550
Why?

589
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,210
Thanks for everything.

590
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,080
♫ I wanted to say those words by your side ♫

591
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,290
Shino!

592
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:22,200
♫ Please stay with me ♫

593
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,830
Why?

594
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,220
Good morning!

595
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,130
Morning! Good morning!

596
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,330
- Haruta, Haruta.
- Yes?

597
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,430
Captain Kurosawa was looking for you.

598
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,930
- Captain?
- Yeah.

599
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,440
Okay.

600
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,440
- Captain!
- Sorry to disturb you.

601
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,450
No problem. Did you want to speak to me?

602
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,670
I've decided to quit being a pilot.

603
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,600
- What?
- Next week will be my last flight.

604
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,000
I wanted to tell you that.

605
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,260
Huh? What? C-Captain?

606
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,360
It's goodbye, Haruta.
