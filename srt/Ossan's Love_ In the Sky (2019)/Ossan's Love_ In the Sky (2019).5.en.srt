00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,250
Nah, I haven't done anything that noteworthy.

181
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,550
Hot.

182
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,280
Listen... do you want to go somewhere on our next day off?

183
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,020
- Sure.
- Cool!

184
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,740
A date?

185
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,940
- Dad, why are you here?
- It's good to go on a date. I'm rooting for you.

186
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,540
- Huh?
- Where to?

187
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,800
- It doesn't concern you.
- Let's all brainstorm together.

188
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,350
How about the art museum? They're currently holding a Filippo exhibit.

189
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,620
By the way, where do you want to go, Haruta?

190
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,270
- How about a light show?
- A light show?

191
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,390
Sounds good!

192
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,550
- How about a giant maze?
- A giant maze?

193
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,300
- We can stop by at the light show after work.
- True.

194
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,210
- Yokosuka Giant Maze.
- Shut up.

195
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,720
- Shut up. Ignore him.
- Giant maze?

196
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,020
A light show is better, right?

197
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,930
- I'm helping you out here.
- What is your ulterior motive?

198
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,350
- Look, I found a light show.
- Where, where?

199
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,420
- Captain, Captain, Captain.
- Hey, Dad.

200
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,550
- What?
- Aren't you rooting for us?

201
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,260
I am!

202
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,150
- Let's brainstorm together.
- If you were, you'd just be quiet.

203
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,720
- E-Excuse me...
- Yes?

204
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,980
D-Do you want to come along, Captain?

205
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,380
- Can I?
- Absolutely not.

206
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,370
- But...
- I disagree. Dad, just go home for now.

207
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,550
Go home? What do you mean by go home for now?

208
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,430
- This is weird! Go home!
- We can return home together!

209
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,820
- Why would you push me?
- Just leave!

210
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,120
- I'm so tired. Good evening.
- Good evening.

211
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,070
I'm back.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,450
Huh?

213
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,710
- Shino.
- Oh, hi.

214
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,280
Dinner, right? I made pork cutlet tonight.

215
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,520
Sorry, I ate out today.

216
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,360
Oh, okay.

217
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,180
What's up?

218
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,960
Tsubasa was part of the observation class today.

219
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,890
Are you sure you don't have to meet him?

220
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,730
Yeah.

221
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,040
Shino... is there anything I can do?

222
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,100
Thanks.

223
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,530
Did you hear about Shino's circumstances?

224
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,680
About his son coming to meet him?

225
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,600
Yeah.

226
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,080
I think those two should definitely meet,

227
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,010
but Naruse says I'm meddling.

228
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,980
What do you think?

229
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,890
I know each family has their circumstances,

230
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:26,780
but even Naruse met up with his father in the end.

231
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,140
Man... family matters are complicated.

232
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,560
Oh, sorry, sorry.

233
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,400
Huh? "Hyper..."? What the heck?

234
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,750
Wait, is he watching us?

235
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,160
He couldn't be.

236
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,110
What impeccable timing.

237
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,160
See, Naruse never sent stickers like this.
[HYPER!]

238
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,240
He's seriously changed.

239
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,770
How should I respond?

240
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,430
"Shut up"? Nah, that's wrong.

241
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,580
Where should we go next?

242
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,680
How about that museum Captain mentioned?

243
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,110
Why? I'd rather not.

244
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,620
Who knows, it might be fun.

245
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,180
No, I'm good.

246
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,770

What are our dinner plans?

248
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,700
Oh, shoot!

249
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,880
Right, Shino's making croquettes today.

250
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,210
I'll ask if he can make some for you, too.

251
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,990
No, thanks.

252
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,500
Why not? Do you dislike croquettes?

253
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,580
Do you have to ask, "why?"

254
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,300

Haru, you don't like me, do you?

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,260
Pardon?

Why do you ask?

262
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,350
I've had a crush on you for ages, so I can tell.

263
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,950
I mean...

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
It's not what you think.

265
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,730
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,510
- I'll do my best!
- Is being with me something that requires effort?

267
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,860
No, it's just...

268
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,310
I'm sorry.

269

Well...

270
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,780
If you didn't like me, you should've turned me down.

I like your kindness, Haru.

272
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:41,620
But this kindness... really hurts.

273
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,780

Jeez.

You're 41 and still get cream on your face.

280
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,280
No wonder Ran divorced you.

281
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,990
That's got nothing to do with this.

I still keep in touch with her every once in a while.

After she quit being a CA, she's been working in a hotel.

She's going to work at a newly opening branch,

so she and Tsubasa are going to Bangkok.

286
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,030
Bangkok?

287
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,220

It's not like you two got a divorce on bad terms.

I married Ran, Tsubasa was born,

292
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,680
and I truly loved my family.

293
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,380
Was it because you prefer men?

00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,820
it seems like... I love you.

536
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,600
Am I not good enough?

537
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,340
You're not.

538
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,440
What do you think you're doing?

539
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,750
Didn't you say you would kiss just anyone?

540
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:30,020
I'm hungry.

541
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,330
- What's wrong?
- Hm?

542
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,710
Haru rejected me.

543
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,010
Oh, I see.

544
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,100
- What do you want for dinner?
- Hm...

545
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,570
- Anything's fine.
- Okay.

546
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,980
How about fried rice?

547
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,020
Sounds good.

548
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,440
I have bacons in the fridge... did you say rejected?

549
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,520
When? Where? Who? Oh, that'd be Haruta.

550
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,920
- Huh?
- Dad, calm down.

551
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,690
Like hell, I will!

552
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,480
How is it possible that you were rejected?

553
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,820
- Just let it be.
- Why, oh, why?

554
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,920
Yes, hurting my daughter is unforgivable.

555
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,910
Why did I give him up in the first place, then?

556
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,240
Why?

557
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,610
Right now,

558
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,880
I'll talk to Haruta.

559
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,600
- No! Don't go, Dad.
- Don't stop me!

560
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,250
- Let go!
- I won't!

561
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,920
Let me go!

562
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,010
Where's Naruse?

563
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,990
Haruta... thanks.

564
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,530
Excuse me?

565
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,680
Thanks to you, I resolved my family matters.

566
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,910
It's given me the courage to move forward.

567
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,910
I didn't do anything...

568
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,010
So let me say this again.

569
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,260
Haruta...

570
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,280
I...

571
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,890
love you, Haruta.

572
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,320
- Huh?
- I'd like you to go out with me.

573
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,660
That...

574
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,990
I...

575
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,680
Well...

576
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,660
I knew you'd react that way.

577
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,780
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

578
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,770
I can't blame you for being shocked.

579
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,690
- Then let's do this.
- Hm?

580
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,800
First, let's date for a week as a trial!

581
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,980
- Huh?
- Yup.

582
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,490
I have an announcement to all passengers on board.

583
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:54,160
I've never heard of such a system prior to this flight.

584
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,170
Can I think about it first?

585
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,980
- Yes.
- What?

586
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,550
