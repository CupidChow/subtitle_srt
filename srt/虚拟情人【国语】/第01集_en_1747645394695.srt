1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't help but feel like I'm getting closer to you

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's an accident

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Memories of the world, I don't know too much

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Youth, I remember the moment when we parted

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't know who is more responsible for me

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Jingjing, it's time to go out

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're pretty good at drawing

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm good, right?

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But it's no use being good, he can't move

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He'll go to the party later

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A lot of handsome guys can move

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's more fun to dance with them

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hurry up, you'll lose a lot of money if you're late

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let me clean up first

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, hurry up

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hey, aren't you going to take him to the party and continue drawing?

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Aren't you afraid of losing money if you're late?

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's go

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's go

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Jingjing, Benjamin is coming this way

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He's the champion of the last year's big brick

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He has a big chest and six abs

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hi, you're always asking questions

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I thought you wouldn't come

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you going to dance?

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not going to dance today, don't bother me

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a pity

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You think he's a playboy

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He has a lot of girlfriends

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But he's been dating the one he just dumped for a year

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is he as good as you said?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He's so perverted

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's as punctual as a drug on a love story website

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It must be hard for him to be his girlfriend

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He may look like a liar, but he's a man of his word

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What about this Louis?

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He's a man of his word, but he's a little bit vulgar

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He's so tasteful, he's worth it

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So all his clothes are made of gold

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He's still a man of his word

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He's so interesting, just like a fifty-year-old man

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He's so boring

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It seems he wants you to dance

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He may be boring, but he's a man of his word

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's a man of his word

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He may be boring, but he's the only one in the whole company

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't be so pitiful

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Can you dance with me?

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't be so pitiful

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, okay

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Miss, do you have any hobbies?

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I like reading books

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Me too

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For example, I read books about environmental protection

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you know that Earth's destruction season

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We can choose the future and...

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I know, I know

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I think we should focus on dancing

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll go to the bathroom

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll go to the bathroom

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll design your appearance

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Height...

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Not too tall

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I can only see his chin is weird

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He can't be too short

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He's half a head taller than me

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He should have natural hair

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He should wear...

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Most importantly, he shouldn't be as crazy as those men

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He should be simple and handsome

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're the first man I created

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're called...

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Adam

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hello, I'm your Adam

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
My name is Qingqing

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're my boyfriend

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Boyfriend?

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
From now on

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You should think that I'm the most important

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Love me with all your heart

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Protect me

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What is love?

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This...

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Love is hard to describe

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a very abstract feeling

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why is there a bug?

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Qingqing, can you not clear it out?

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This is a bug

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's a program error

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It will cause you to make mistakes and become unstable

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
There are only him and me

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You don't want me to clear it out?

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I want the bug to stay with me

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay, if you promise me that you'll protect me like a shield

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Then I won't clear it out

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I promise you

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're the most important

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll love you with all my heart

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Love you, protect you

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't know who is more complicated

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What's going on?

106
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you want to interact with me

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Click on your perfect lover

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is Adam's activity record yesterday

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You can give it to the marketing team

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay, thank you

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Good morning, Qingqing

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Good morning

113
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Zero, what's the situation today?

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Adam's actual online number is 67,000

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The fire user is 49,000

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The average online time is 1 hour and 13 minutes

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The online time has become longer

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's rare to see Adam in the army

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Not even one second

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In the army?

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They treat Adam as a boyfriend

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why is it called the army?

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Adam is Adam

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The fans love Adam

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They love to be a soldier

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The name of the army is very cute

127
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Princess Xinxin, you promised me

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can't eat those unhealthy things anymore

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Adam, this is new

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is it beautiful?

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You look beautiful in everything

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The most important thing is that you look comfortable

133
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Natural

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I like you in everything

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Sorry, Adam

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm a little late today

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's okay

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll wait for you

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Why are we willing to wait for someone?

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is because

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We think that person is important

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So we are willing to wait

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Qingqing, you upgraded Adam to version 6.0

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There is no female user

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
She can't handle it

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Her AI learning model is getting better

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The speed is getting faster

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The database is big

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It can make her more mature

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
To deal with different users

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Adam

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Am I sexy today?

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Little wild cat

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You'd better put on your clothes

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Uncle Han is my lover

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm giving you a big eye mask

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You misunderstood

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't like it

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I spend so much money every month

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I have to see it if I want to take it off

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You are just an electronic pet

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I just want to take it off

163
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why don't you seal it?

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You closed our security system this morning

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why?

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because recently Love Watch received too many complaints

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Most of them say that we just seal it

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Get up

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Look

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Look at this side

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want to take it off

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I want to take it off

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How many users like this appear in the morning?

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I asked Zero to delete Adam's activity record

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There are about 200

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Find them all

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Seal it for me for a month

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Zero, open the seal system

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But you have it

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You are the head of department

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't do whatever he says

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Your Adam should have principles

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You can't let the user trample the bottom line

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Adam, Adam

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You never care about Adam's technical side

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why don't you ask me this time

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Just shut down the seal system

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Because this is not only a technical problem

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It also concerns the game experience

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The best place to play the game

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is the gray area that can play the side ball

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Just like the previous game

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I have a hidden place

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's fun to experience the rules

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Just like now we have a lot of users

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Want to break the rules against your Adam

197
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
In fact, this also proves

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
They are interested in your Adam

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You should be happy

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Adam is different from your game

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What's the difference?

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Just a game

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay, okay, okay

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Adam is not a game, but a boyfriend

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's the public boyfriend in the internet world

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You agreed to this principle from the beginning

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We have been insisting for three years

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can't find any reason to change

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That is to say

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You are not here to discuss with me

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's to tell me that all operations are in order

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Fine, as you wish

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Thank you

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I remember someone said

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
After a few years of college

216
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I have finished eating the meat sauce and noodles in my life

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What can make a person

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Go to this kind of place and call it meat sauce and noodles?

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's poor

220
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I heard that someone is trying to get a raise in the district

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am a small assistant

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I am satisfied to get this salary

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I remember when I said I wanted to start a business

224
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You resigned and came to help me

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you

226
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I joined the company at that time

227
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Only three or four people

228
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I believe you can afford me

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I just do my best

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I really didn't think about making today's result

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Of course, you and Neil work together

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How did you talk to Neil just now?

233
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Actually Neil is not bad

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He cares about you and Adam

235
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That's why he will help you

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You know how strong the four plus one is

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I am sorry

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I was too serious just now

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I forgot to ask you two to meet

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then you should be late

241
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We just started to talk about new things

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I will buy a car back to the company

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You guys can talk slowly

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I am leaving

245
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You really don't want him to drive

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You don't need to care about him

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's talk about Neil and you

248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, I have already bought the order

249
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why?

250
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It should be a man who pays the order

251
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I won't buy it. Take your time

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I am leaving

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Your husband is so great

254
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He hasn't changed for so many years

255
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Is he still so stupid?

256
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You only know how to say I don't know how to say myself

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
A Ming is very good

258
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You don't like him either

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't dislike him

260
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But with your conditions

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I will find Neil

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What are your plans with Neil?

263
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You have been together for a long time

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't want to think about the future

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I know you are too personality

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But have you already decided on him?

267
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
As a man, Neil is a rare man

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Four plus one is so strong

269
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want to lie on his chocolate

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why is the captain so sexy?

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Qin Qing, Neil asked you to go to the meeting

272
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I am sorry

273
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I am sorry

274
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I am sorry

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I am sorry

276
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I am sorry

277
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I am sorry

278
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I am sorry

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I am sorry

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I am sorry

281
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I am sorry

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I am sorry

283
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I am sorry

284
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I am sorry

285
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I am sorry

286
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I asked you to have a meeting temporarily

287
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I asked you to find the information about the four plus one in your own field

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
See what progress you have made

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Let's start

290
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Their S.E.U. did a good job

291
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The coverage rate, participation rate and click rate are very high

292
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
As soon as everyone goes online, they see the four plus one

293
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's like infectious disease

294
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It spreads

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It feels like it's very earthy without playing

296
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Their market is so strong

297
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
How should we deal with it?

298
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Their users have risen by 15%

299
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Zi Xiao's pen rose, we fell by 10%

300
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
If we fall again, we can't keep the bottom line with the advertising company

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So we have to act as soon as possible

302
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Recover users

303
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You are the CTO

304
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What do you think?

305
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I believe in the market

306
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I always believe

307
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I always believe

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But I believed for three months

309
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The users have fallen for three months

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Four plus one is not good

311
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't believe that everyone's freshness can last for a long time

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
When the users get tired of playing, they will come back to Adam

313
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
There is a saying that the sharpest coin can drive away the coldest coin

314
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Should we be rational now?

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
To test the reality

316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
In the end, you want me to close the seal system?

317
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Since everyone is here, let's discuss

318
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If a woman treats a man like this

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Will the man turn his face?

320
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Don't look at me

321
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm asking you today

322
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You can make your own opinion

323
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If a woman is interested in herself

324
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
As a man, she will be happy

325
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Adam is like this

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Will the title be a little inhuman?

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
If a girl just met

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Take off the inner clothes

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's just taking you as a tool

330
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
If you're just playing, of course it doesn't matter

331
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But don't forget that Adam's identity is a boyfriend

332
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I just don't understand why

333
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
To make trouble for a virtual person and the user

334
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Adam doesn't feel

335
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He won't thank you

336
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Adam is a virtual person

337
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But don't forget

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
His interaction with all users

339
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Care and love are real

340
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Just because Adam is real enough

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So you can touch so many people

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So welcome

343
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Forget it

344
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It seems that there will be no conclusion for the time being

345
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Then everything is as it was

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If you have any ideas, tell me immediately

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Meeting

348
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Did you think of buying something to eat at your house?

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I know Adam is perfect in your heart

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I also know

351
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You don't want Adam

352
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
To be completely linked to the business community

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes, you are very romantic

354
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But Adam is not a real person after all

355
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He won't die without eating or sleeping

356
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You don't want to be a man

357
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He won't die

358
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You don't want to think that a lot of people in the company need to eat

359
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Then reality and ideals

360
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't you have to be against each other?

361
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
These three years prove that this is okay

362
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Because we have been going well before

363
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The company's development

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Didn't encounter any big problems

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But now there are competitors

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It needs to be changed

367
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
In fact, you have not only changed once in these three years

368
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's me who has been insisting on Adam's order

369
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Adam will be as welcome as today

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So you can't convince me

371
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Adam What's wrong?

372
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,000
Qingqing

373
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You're right

374
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We haven't met a bottleneck

375
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There will be pressure

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,980
Go back and 받고

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Hello, Qingqing. I'm your Adam. Welcome back.

378
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Adam.

379
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
In this world, it's really hard to find someone who truly understands you.

380
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you don't understand, then let's talk about it.

381
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No.

382
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Not everything can be understood by saying it.

383
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
For example, some people are used to eating fast food.

384
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You suddenly take him to eat delicate food, slow-cooked food. He may not like it.

385
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't like it.

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I haven't upgraded you for the past ten years. You won't understand.

387
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But there are benefits that you don't understand.

388
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Hello, Qingqing. I'm your Adam. Good morning.

389
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Today's weather. The highest temperature is 25 degrees. The relative humidity is 70%.

390
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The probability of water drop is 20%.

391
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There is a cold air expected tonight. The temperature will drop to 18 degrees.

392
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's so cold.

393
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Qingqing, wear one more dress.

394
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Today's news. Recently, all AI companies have released a new version of chat machines.

395
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
With the addition of answer documents, it also adds the function of making audio files and writing programming languages.

396
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The breakthrough of related AI technology is considered to be the digital revolution that replaces the search engine.

397
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The new AI technology is the new technology that makes AI technology work.

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Everyone, the relevant articles in the forum in the past one hour have a total of 4553.

399
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The number of visits and likes on social networks has increased tenfold.

400
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Your Adam, the server has been exposed.

401
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But Qingqing doesn't know that she really doesn't need her consent.

402
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If she doesn't agree, we don't have a password. We can't change Adam's code.

403
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't worry. I will tell her about the new style.

404
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What new style?

405
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Qingqing, the new style is not yet finalized.

406
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But we want to test the water temperature in the morning.

407
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We sent out the initial draft to all the forums and social networks to see how everyone reacted.

408
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
As a result, the soldiers are all praising us.

409
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They are desperately forwarding the news to help us promote for free.

410
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yes, there are also users who think that Adam's new style has been released.

411
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
They have exposed the server.

412
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Qingqing, look. This is the latest version of Adam.

413
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Come on. Do you want me?

414
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
No. I don't agree to release the new version of Adam.

415
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Isn't that how they steal customers? I'm just learning from them.

416
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why are you learning such a vulgar thing?

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Why not? What vulgar? Someone buys it, someone sells it.

418
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You never asked me to make a new style.

419
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Do you respect me as the original creator?

420
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I just respect you. I want to stick to your principles.

421
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's why I changed the direction.

422
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm sorry. I've already given in.

423
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I hope you can also give in.

424
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Anyway, I won't agree.

425
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Qingqing, you called the IT department to open the seal system this morning.

426
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You even told them to make a new system.

427
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Once something goes wrong, they will notify you immediately.

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So what?

429
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
On one hand, they pretend to meet my requirements.

430
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
On the other hand, they are acting on their own.

431
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's a business.

432
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Actually, you know that he's not necessarily wrong.

433
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That doesn't mean he can say one thing and do another.

434
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He's lying to me by making his own decisions.

435
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Why are you thinking like that?

436
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes, Neo's handling method is indeed not perfect.

437
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But he's actually working hard to balance all aspects.

438
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So you think I'm not working hard to balance?

439
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm being unreasonable?

440
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Of course I don't mean that.

441
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I just think that some things can be adjusted according to the current conditions.

442
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Neo has already given in.

443
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You can also give him some space.

444
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Space?

445
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
This society is one step at a time.

446
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
In the end, let alone principles, you'll even lose yourself.

447
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I know that I can't convince you in any way.

448
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
From the second day I met you in college,

449
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I knew that you were born to be a fighter.

450
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You pursue everything to the best.

451
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
People outside think that you are very attractive.

452
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But as your best friend,

453
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I can only see how hard you work.

454
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't want you to be so tired.

455
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I know that you care about me.

456
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But I don't think that pursuing is wrong.

457
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Of course it's not wrong to pursue.

458
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But do you know what you're pursuing?

459
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You give me the feeling that you don't even have an answer.

460
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Or maybe what you're pursuing

461
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
doesn't exist in this world at all.

462
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Adam.

463
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Is your world without worries?

464
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I also want to be like you.

465
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Always so calm.

466
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Today someone told me

467
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
that I'm pursuing something that doesn't exist.

468
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm pursuing something that doesn't exist.

469
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm pursuing something that doesn't exist.

470
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm pursuing something that doesn't exist.

471
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So I'll never be happy.

472
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm saying these words that you don't understand.

473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I also want to know about your world.

474
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
If I can help you, that would be great.

475
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Thank you, Adam.

476
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He's the first Adam of 10 years ago.

477
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If you want to talk about work, let's talk about it when we get back to the office.

478
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I know you have a headache. I bought it especially for you.

479
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You can chat with him until I come in and you don't notice.

480
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Adam is really not easy.

481
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I suddenly thought of it.

482
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
When I first saw you, you were also chatting with him.

483
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But at that time I thought you were just treating him as a tree hole.

484
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Now I finally understand why you protected him so much and insisted on it.

485
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's because since you created him, you thought he was perfect.

486
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Now you even treat him as a real person.

487
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So you refuse to change his image.

488
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
He's the ideal man I created.

489
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Of course I think he's perfect. I don't want you to make him tired.

490
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So what if he's perfect?

491
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He's just made up through the soul and the soul.

492
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you know what you're doing?

493
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I don't know what you're trying to say. I have a headache. You should go.

494
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I know you're upset recently and you want someone to comfort you.

495
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
But when you're in the most painful and hurtful time, who can comfort you? It's me.

496
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Let go of me.

497
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm a man who's always in the game.

498
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Let go of me.

499
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You're insulting me and yourself.

500
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Please pay attention to the situation.

501
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Wait.

502
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I know you're having a meeting. I need to lead today's meeting.

503
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I need to make some plans.

504
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
From now on, I want you to stop all your work.

505
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Focus on the fire and deal with 4 plus 1.

506
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
They've launched a new model for a day.

507
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The app download volume has doubled.

508
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
The registered user volume has increased by 22%.

509
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
In a few months, they've already taken advantage of our accumulated three years.

510
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So I hope you don't fight the enemy again.

511
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
This is a tough battle.

512
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Tell me about the previous plan.

513
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
We've made a series of publicity plans.

514
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Including starting tonight, all the media will help Adam make a news.

515
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And on the day of our press conference,

516
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
all the outside and indoor screens in Hong Kong,

517
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and the online streaming platform,

518
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
will be broadcast live at the same time.

519
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Tina, is Adam's new image ready?

520
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The design is complete.

521
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's handed over to the IT department.

522
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The code is roughly written and running smoothly.

523
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Good.

524
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
To be honest, I don't want to set myself up.

525
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
If it's just because of some principles,

526
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
it's no fun.

527
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So the only thing we can do now is to change Adam's image.

528
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I've never opposed changing Adam's image.

529
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But we must change it.

530
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I've already thought of the path after Adam.

531
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The one who's going to be the leader is Adam.

532
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The world is going to change the way of the contract.

533
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Adam must grasp this trend.

534
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Less is more.

535
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Anyone against it?

536
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay.

537
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Everyone can...

538
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Wait.

539
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
How do you judge whether the user will like this Adam?

540
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The original creator's intuition.

541
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Just based on your intuition?

542
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't think that just based on your data,

543
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
it can solve the current problem.

544
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay.

545
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Vote in the most democratic way.

546
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
In a while, from 12 to 1,

547
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
use an hour to speed up the battle.

548
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It depends on whether the user likes the lively version of Adam

549
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
or you, Adam.

550
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Okay.

551
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I believe that 80,000 users know what Adam should be like.

552
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Okay.

553
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Whoever wins,

554
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
will be called immediately.

555
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Dismiss.

556
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Time's up.

557
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You can start voting.

558
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
All users have been notified.

559
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
The new user has been notified.

560
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The new user has been notified.

561
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The new user has been notified.

562
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
All users have been notified.

563
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
80,000 has already been opened and viewed.

564
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
30,000

565
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Xirou,

566
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I will send another notification to all users.

567
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If you haven't voted, please vote quickly.

568
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Okay.

569
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,200
I don't understand.

570
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,400
Do we really need to do this?

571
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
She was the one who voted.

572
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But it's good that she knows that this world is not what she wants.

573
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,000
You're doing this for the company, okay?

574
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,600
I am too.

575
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
gorella

576
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,800
password

577
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,000
Is there no time, I want you to respect the result

578
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,600
If you want to help, I welcome you to join us anytime.

579
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,700
Qingqing, I understand you better than anyone.

580
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,500
Yu, let me calm down.

581
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,400
Adam.

582
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Adam, I only have you now.

583
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,400
How could they accept such a bad design?

584
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Accept that kind of Adam?

585
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
I know.

586
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,400
It's because three years ago I made a wrong decision.

587
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
I betrayed you.

589
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Because I betrayed you.

590
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
They can't make you a good person.

591
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,400
After the press conference, the media will give you an interview.

592
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Okay.

593
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Zero, how many more are not done?

594
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Almost done.

595
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,400
We just put together the new version of the spring-loaded components. Everything is going well.

596
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Very good. Try it right away.

597
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
What's wrong?

598
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Maybe the new version of the code has a leak, so there are some places that are not compatible.

599
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
How did it happen?

600
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
It should be because the hard disk in the Adam has a problem.

601
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,400
I'll try to find the one that was betrayed from the service provider.

602
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Solve it immediately.

603
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Okay.

604
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Hello, Qingqing. I'm your Adam. Good morning.

605
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Xiao Yu.

606
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Qingqing, I finally found you.

607
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,400
The problem with the Adam system is that the entire IT department can't handle it.

608
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
What's wrong?

609
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
It's probably because the Adam system is not compatible.

610
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
So the screen keeps flashing and there's a lot of noise.

611
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,400
And the hard disk in the Adam system is not working.

612
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
What about the service provider?

613
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Zero took it from the service provider.

614
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,400
It was the same situation when it was just updated.

615
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
This is bad, Qingqing.

616
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,400
If even the only Adam system has a problem, what should we do?

617
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,400
The service provider doesn't work either.

618
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,400
I'll be right there.

619
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I tried to order but I was rejected.

620
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
I really can't do anything.

621
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
This is bad, Qingqing.

622
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,400
The service provider's Adam system seems to be not working either.

623
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Think of a way. I'm already on my way.

624
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
I'm already on my way.

625
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Qingqing, where are you rushing to?

626
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
To save another you.

627
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Another me?

628
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,400
It's another version of you that was born.

629
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Now I might have to rely on you to save him.

630
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Anyway, I have a responsibility.

631
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
Qingqing!

632
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Qingqing, how are you?

633
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
I'm fine.

634
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,400
The Adam system doesn't work either.

635
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,400
We've been working so long and now you're telling me there's no Adam system?

636
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Calm down. There's one more.

637
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,400
I brought the motherboard from home.

638
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
Si Ru.

639
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
I don't know where the problem is.

640
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
If we continue updating, there might be another problem.

641
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
I need to figure out the situation first.

642
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
I'm going to take some time.

643
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
If you need anything, call me by ear.

644
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,400
This isn't the first version of Adam system that I saw in the dormitory ten years ago.

645
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Adam.

646
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Adam.

647
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
I'm here.

648
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Come in.

649
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Adam.

650
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
I need to talk to you.

651
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
I need to go to the bathroom.

652
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
I need to talk to you.

653
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Have you already called me?

654
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,400
I'm in a bad mood.

655
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
I need to go to the bathroom.

656
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
I'm in a bad mood.

657
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
I need to go to the bathroom.

658
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
I'm in a bad mood.

659
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
I don't want to.

660
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
But I can't help it.

661
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,240
Qingqing, I believe you.

662
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,320
I'll cooperate as long as you need me.

663
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
Thank you for your help.

664
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Thank you.

665
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Qingqing.

666
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,880
The backstage is ready.

667
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,480
The press conference can start at any time.

668
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:24,600
Be delicious.

669
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,080
Hello, everybody.

670
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,920
I think we may not be able to wait.

671
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,440
It's time.

672
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,880
THE禁 description will start.

673
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,360
Wait for us.

674
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,000
Adam is so cute.

675
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,600
Adam is suddenly so shy.

676
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000
When can we see Adam in the live version?

677
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,200
Everyone seems to be looking forward to

678
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,600
the new live version of Adam.

679
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Adam, are you looking forward to it?

680
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,000
Okay, let's count down together

681
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,800
and welcome the new Adam.

682
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

683
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,800
six, five, four, three, two, one.

684
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,200
Adam.

685
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,600
Adam.

686
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
It's a ghost.

687
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,400
Adam.

688
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,000
Adam.

689
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,200
What happened, Adam?

690
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,400
Can you hear me?

691
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,400
Adam, are you okay?

692
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,000
Adam.

693
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,000
Adam.

694
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,800
Adam.

695
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,000
Adam.

696
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,600
Adam.
