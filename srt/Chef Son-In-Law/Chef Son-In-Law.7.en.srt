I'm so sorry.

to start a brand-new e-commerce model,

145
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,020

147
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,180

148
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,340
so he's wanted to talk with me.

149
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,900
However, I'm still considering it.

150
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,300
Mr. Xu,

151
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,540
what do you think of Zhan Jun?

152
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,420
All style and no substance,

153
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,900
like food tasted like cardboard

154
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,900

155
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,180

half a cookbook,

coming on my show as a guest?

184
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,020
If there's no food,

185
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,860
I'm not going.

186
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,660
See?

187
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,620
There he goes again!

188
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,300
You mean that creep used ads
as an excuse

189
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,420
to get your boss

190
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,820
to set up a dinner with you?

191
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,460
Is that completely out of line?

192
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,300
What a terrible businessman!

193
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,060
But never offend your boss.

194
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,620
What if he sidelines you?

195
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,940
That's why I'm so worried now!

196
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
I can't even remember

197
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,860
when I last had coconut chicken
by the sea.

198
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,700
I miss those times so much.

199
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,100
Oh, it's alright.

200
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,540
At the end of the year,

201
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,740
we can go on a vacation to the beach.

202
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,900
We?

203
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,300
Except you,

204
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,620
no one treats me like family.

205
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,340
Right,

206
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,140
why did you never tell your mom

207
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,420
what happened to you?

208
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,340
I have never seen her as my mom.

209
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,860
She only sees

210
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,620
Tao Ruxue who can be manipulated.

211
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,620
Well,

212
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm out of ideas.

213
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,260
Take your time and eat.

214
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,260
Pay me back.

215
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,300
What? Again?

216
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,420
No.

217
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:37,900
Wait.

218
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,380
I've got injured.

219
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,260
I don't have any money,

220
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,140
but you can take my life.

221
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,620
Again,

222
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,860
putting on a show again?

223
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,740
I know you're good at acting.

224
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,980
Don't pull that with me!

225
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,860
I agree I can't afford
to offend my boss,

226
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,780
so I have to meet that creep.

227
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,380
But neither my mom nor Ruxue

228
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,940
will help me.

229
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,460
Can you please help me?

230
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,140
Why are you meeting him?

231
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,260
Offering yourself up to him?

232
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,340
You said
you wouldn't let anyone bully me.

233
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,900
Now I'm being threatened.

234
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,180
Are you going to help or not?

235
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,260
I want to help,

236
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,420
but I'm injured right now

237
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,060
and can't get into a fight.

238
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,140
Don't worry.

239
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,980
It'll be a friendly negotiation.

240
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,860
Things won't come to blows.

241
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,180
Not for any other reason,

242
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,700
I just want to beat him up.

243
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,100
I got stabbed for no reason,

244
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,860
yet he was fine.

245
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,780
Right?

246
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,380
How about this?

247
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,620
I'll attract his attention before him,

248
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,260
and you'll attack him from behind.

249
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,140
Oh, come on!

250
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,700
I was just kidding.

251
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,260
Just talk if you can.

252
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,100
Anyway,

253
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,900
you must go with me this time.

254
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,540
Any more?

255
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,060
You can really put it away!

256
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,500
Yes.

257
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,820
How I wish you hadn't married Ruxue.

258
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,420
The style of this room suits me.

259
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,940
It meant for my dad.

260
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,740
Oh.

261
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,100
You never mentioned him before.

262
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,700
Are they divorced?

263
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,260
He cheated on my mom
while she was pregnant

264
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
with Rushuang.

265
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,260
So I don't even know his name

266
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,380
or what he looks like.

267
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,540
Yet still keep this room for him.

268
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,380
Your mom must be thinking of him.

269
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,180
This brat

270
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,380
is late.

271
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,060
What a surprise!

272
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,300
You'd actually ask me out.

273
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,460
So what do you think?

274
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,820
Thought I was some
greasy middle-aged man?

275
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,620
But to your surprise,

276
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,780
I'm this handsome, huh?

277
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,700
With your attitude,

278
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,060
I prefer the greasy middle-aged man.

279
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,940
Must it be like this?

280
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,300
I admit I startled you before,

281
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,460
so I'm sorry.

282
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,860
Can we just let it go?

283
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,620
Sorry?

284
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,420
You threw sulfuric acid at me

285
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,940
and stabbed my friend.

286
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,260
You think an apology is enough.

287
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,180
I can't understand

288
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
what you are talking about.

289
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,140
I'd never stoop to that!

290
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,420
The police have opened an investigation.

291
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,180
Just wait.

292
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,820
Feel free to investigate.

293
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,380
It has nothing to do with me.

294
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,900
All I want

295
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,260
is to pursue you purely.

296
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,700
Is that not allowed?

297
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,060
You have the company suppress me.

298
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,100
Come on.

299
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,700
I'm trying to help you make money!

300
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,340
A project worth hundreds of thousands.

301
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,700
All I asked was to dine with me.

302
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:10,980
Wasn't that reasonable?

303
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,860
Fine.

304
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,540
Alright.

305
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,140
I'll tell you right now.

306
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,940
The touch of a man makes me feel sick.

307
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,340
Please, in the future,

308
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,620
stop harassing me.

309
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,780
Tao Rushuang,

310
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,420
I was harassing you?

311
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,940
I knew

312
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,500
there can't be any rational discussion.

313
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,900
Did I say you could go?

314
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,180
What are you doing? Let go of me!

315
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,220
Don't go before finishing talking.

316
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,220
Did I say you could go?

317
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,180
Easy on the hands.

318
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Let me tell you.

319
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,700
I'm her brother.

320
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,860
If you dare lay a finger on her again,

321
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,980
you are dead.

322
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:03,940
Let's go.

323
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,380
Why did you say

324
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,860
you were my brother?

325
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,420
What was I supposed to say?

326
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,300
I'm her sister-in-law
who stands up for her?

327
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,220
That sounds a bit strange.

328
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,660
My own family won't help me,

329
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,940
yet you step in

330
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,180
and help me.

331
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,020
It's such an irony.

332
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,820
I do know a little

333
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,580
about your mom and Ruxue.

334
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,460
Though they may seem cold or distant,

335
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,460
when it comes to matters of principle,

336
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,500
they will never just stand by.

337
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,620
Give them time to process everything.

338
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,660
They will never do anything to harm you.

339
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,700
I've lost all faith in them.

340
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,700
You've endured their coldness,

341
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,780
yet still so naive.

342
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,140
Never surrender

343
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,180
to your fate so easily.

344
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm leaving.

345
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,980
Darn it!

346
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
He's ruined my plans again and again.

347
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,220
Bro, I found out about him.

348
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,580
Who is he?

349
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,820
He's planning to lease a spot

350
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,860
on the food street recently,

351
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,940
getting ready to open a restaurant.

352
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,980
Alright.

353
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,500
He can forget about that.

354
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,020
What else have you got?

355
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,820
He is Qiao Zhi

356
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,100
and is living with the Taos now.

357
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,900
He lives with them?

358
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,740
Is he actually their relative?

359
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,940
If he wasn't,

360
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,300
he must have some kind

361
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,340
of background to live with them.

362
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,420
Seems nothing special about him.

363
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,060
He has no family and no connections.

364
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,180
Used to be a trainee cook

365
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,220
in the kitchen of Huaixiang.

366
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,660
A trainee cook?

367
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,100
I got pushed around by some nobody.

368
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,380
Utterly shameful.

369
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,580
Just as expected,

370
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,460
all of our earliest investors

371
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,260
have been approached by Baiwei Group.

372
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,380
Right,

373
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,700
and by your uncle.

374
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,480
[Huaixiang Group Holdings Management]

375
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,500
My family holds
the absolute controlling stake,

376
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,780
but the resources behind these investors

377
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,380
fundamentally support
the company's operations.

378
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,780
If Baiwei Group

379

is to buy out all of their shares,

00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,740
my mother's position as president

381
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,340
will exist in name only.

382
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,020
We'll have to yield to the Zhan family.

383
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,660
How's the dinner arrangement going?

384
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,180
Everything has been finalized.

385
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,060
The chef will be Mr. Zheng Ze,

386
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,060
known as the National Chef of Banquets.

387
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,700
His team is highly professional.

388
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,820
There won't be any issues.

389
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,580
Good.

390
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,660
At tomorrow's meal,

391
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,900
failure is not an option.

[Huaixiang Restaurant]

393
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,380
Not bad!

394
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,940
The flavor is excellent.

395
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,660
Today in the kitchen

396
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,420
is Mr. Zheng Ze,
a national chef of Shandong Cuisine.

397
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,420
This menu features
all his signature dishes.

398
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,020
I didn't even eat breakfast,

399
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,220
saving myself

400
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,420
to truly indulge today.

401
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,900
Let's have a drink.

402
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,860
You are all my mother's old friends.

403
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,180
As the younger generation,

404
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,980
if I say anything out of line today,

405
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,460
I ask for your forgiveness.

406
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,580
I assume Baiwei Group has approached you

407
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,780
about buying out your original shares.

408
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,220
May I know your plan?

409
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,260
Young people are so direct.

410
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,220
I like that.

411
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,380
Xue,

412
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,780
we are all investors

413
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,060
chasing profit.

414
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,260
Your mother's cancer

415
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,420
came on so suddenly.

416
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,620
Originally,

417
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,020
we were quite confident

418
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,300
in Huaixiang Group's IPO plan,

419
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,180
but now...

420
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,420
That's right, Xue.

421
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,580
You've only just graduated.

422
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,060
To take the company public,

423
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,540
it's impossible.

424
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,340
After all,

425
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,540
Baiwei Group is hindering the process.

426
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,220
I may be young,

427
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,660
but I won the cooking contest
against Baiwei.

428
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,620
Our dishes also received

429
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,020
recognition from Mr. Xu Hexiang.

430
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,780
More importantly,

431
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,420
we've secured a supply chain
from Huasheng Group

432
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,820
at a deeply discounted rate.

433
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,340
So, what more can I do

434
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
to convince you that I can

435
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,460
lead Huaixiang Group to its IPO?

436
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,140
Indeed,

437
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,260
these recent developments

438
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,540
have been quite shocking to us.

439
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,020
Especially the fact that

440
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,980
Huasheng Group,

441
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,260
a Fortune Global 500 company,

442
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,180
was willing to partner with us.

443
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,220
Would you

444
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,180
tell us how you managed to to that?

445
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,020
That is something I can't disclose.

446
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,460
But I want to tell you,

447
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,180
we have more surprises in store.

448
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,940
For instance, at the quadrennial
King of Chefs Championship,

449
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,660
we are certain to achieve great results.

450
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,060
We can't afford to offend Zhan family

451
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,380
based on your word alone.

452
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,980
After all, our two companies have

453
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,900
a lot of business collaborations.

454
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,220
With all due respect,

455
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,620
several of Huaixiang Restaurant's chefs

456
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,980
are loyal to Tao Rende.

457
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,780
I'm afraid you won't have an easy time

458
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,420
in this King of Chefs Championship.

459
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,700
But we have our own talent pool.

460
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,980
Like the chef who has impressed

461
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
Mr. Xu this time.

462
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,300
His culinary skills
were endorsed by Mr. Xu.

463
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,300
Excuse me.

464
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,100
Sorry to interrupt.

465
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,740
Regarding the talent pool

466
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,420
you just mentioned,

467
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,740
how can you guarantee

468
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,260
they won't be bought off by Tao Rende?

469
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,500
In the name of Huaixiang Group,

470
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,300
we invested in his personal brand.

471
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,380
I assume all of you have heard of it.

472
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,940
Its name is

473
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,220
Canteen.

474
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,940
You mean Qiao Sihai's Canteen?

475
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,860
But it closed years ago.

476
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,460
Xue,

477
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,460
who is the chef you mentioned?

478
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,780
Qiao Zhi.

479
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,700
I see.

480
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,500
Alright.

481
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,140
First, I want to state
my group's position

482
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,780
that we'll not sell
our original shares to Baiwei.

483
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,740
Like Mr. Huang,

484
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,220
I'll stand with Huaixiang Group
until the very end.

485
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,820
Why did you

486
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,660
suddenly...

487
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,660
Let me explain.

488
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,540
A few days ago,

489
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,820
I met Qiao Zhi with Mr. Zhong.

490
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,620
That young man impressed me.

491
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,860
He is indeed young.

492
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,580
If he has done anything wrong,

493
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,100
please tell me,
and I'll speak to him later.

494
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,980
Here is the case.

495
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,700
A few days ago, Mr. Xu Hexiang

496
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,780
took us to Qiao Zhi's restaurant

497
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,140
for a tasting.

498
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,500
That flavor...

499
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,460
How should I put it?

500
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,540
For example,

501
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,660
the meal we're having today...

502
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,980
Both its ingredients

503
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,420
and the chef's skill

504
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,340
are undoubtedly top-tier.

505
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,820
But that meal prepared by Qiao Zhi

506
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,060
left a deeper impression on me.

507
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,140
At the time,

508
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,020
we even wanted to invest in him.

509
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,980
But as it turns out now,

510
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,500
that's already our restaurant.

511
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,780
His skills are indeed impressive.

512
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,660
But compared to Mr. Zheng,

513
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,220
he just isn't quite there yet.

514
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,380
Let me put it this way:

515
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,780
Today's meal is certainly delicious,

516
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,180
but Qiao Zhi's meal

517
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,060
gave me more surprises.

518
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,940
So, Xue,

519
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,380
I support your plan

520
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,540
not just because

521
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,900
of what looks good on paper,

522
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,820
but also Huaixiang Group's

523
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,900
future development and potential.

524
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,100
That's what matters most.

525
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,420
The Wang family holds its own.

526
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,620
As for these original shares,

527
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,620
I've decided not to sell.

528
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,420
I won't drop the ball
when it matters most.

529
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,940
Thank you all for your trust.

530
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,620
We will not let you down.

Yes.

Right now,

545
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,300
are you feeling very sentimental?

546
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,580
I've dreamed of it for so long.

00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,580
is the discount Qiao Sihai offered

551
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,700
to the old neighbors still available?

552
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,580
Of course.

553
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,060
It's the same restaurant

568
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,380
Thanks!

569
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,340
You're

570
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,900
Guo Yan from the barbecue place
across the street?

571
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,220
That's right.

572
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,100
From now on, we're neighbors.

573
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,420
Please look out for each other.

574
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,860
By the way,

575
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,220
what's your name?

576
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,260
Qiao Zhi.

577
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,220
Congratulations on your grand opening!

578
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,180
Thanks.

579
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,260
Well.

580
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,940
Hello.

581
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,300
My surname is Bao.

582
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,420
My full name is

583
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,220
Bao Tong.

584
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,420
It's a pleasure to meet you.

585
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,620
Hello.

586
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,580
Hello.

587
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,940
Still watching?

588
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,380
Let me tell you,

589
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,460
she's not a good thing.

590
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,380
All the shops on this street

591
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,740
has been targeted by her.

592
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,100
She complains about them frequently.

593
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
And her dishes

594
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
are outrageously expensive.

595
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
She uses her beauty
to win over the guests.

596
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,340
So what?

597
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,820
I also want to be won over.

598
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,540
You...

599
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,860
Take it.

600
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,220
Congratulations, Mr. Qiao!

601
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,340
Ellie,

602
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,580
welcome.

603
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,900
But you even come with a gift?

604
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,660
What...

605
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,340
is this?

606
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,500
Top-grade Wagyu from the Huasheng Group!

607
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,260
There's an old saying in China,

608
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,140
A small gift
as the token of my sincere respect.

609
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,380
Please kindly accept it.

610
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,740
You're too generous.

611
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,820
This is no small gift!

612
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,220
It's far too extravagant!

613
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,100
Extravagant?

614
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,740
Well, I'll have them slice it for you.

615
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,380
No.

616
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,300
That's not what I meant.

617
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,100
I mean

618
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,180
it's embarrassing

619
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,380
for me to just take all this for free.

620
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,580
Don't tell me

621
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,540
you actually get embarrassed!

622
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,060
Why

623
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,220
isn't Ruxue here yet?

624
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,940
I don't know.

625
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,820
Forget her. Let's take a photo.

626
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,980
Yeah, let's take one!

627
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,500
Alright.

628
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,100
Great!

629
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,420
Let's take one first.

630
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:18,900
Okay.

631
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,060
Scoot in closer.

632
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,380
Why is Ellie here?

633
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,940
She's one of the shareholders now.

634
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,500
Exchanged an equity stake
for a discount on supplies.

635
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,660
Qiao Zhi

636
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,140
handled that brilliantly.

637
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,660
Why is Rushuang here too?

638
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,780
She invested as well.

639
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,580
Rushuang?

640
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,020
She never told me.

641
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,540
Who's that girl?

642
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,300
She's the first employee of Canteen

643
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,540
and also a partner.

644
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,340
Seems anyone can get shares these days.

645
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,780
Maybe he has his own reasons.

646
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,740
Let's go over there.

647
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,260
I'm not going. Go by yourself.

648
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,380
Alright.

649
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,340
Chat for a bit.

650
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:29,820
Hello.

651
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,620
What's taking you so long?

652
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,780
Waiting for you to start the meal!

653
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:33,860
I have things to do.

654
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,220
Don't wait for me, just eat.

655
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,500
Who ticked her off?

656
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,980
Over here is our main dining hall.

657
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,060
How do you like it?

658
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,060
The decor style,

659
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,020
including the design touches,

660
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,940
was done by Bao and his team.

661
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,140
During peak hours,

662
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,100
we can arrange for shared tables,

663
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,220
which allow us to seat

664
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,980
up to 57 guests at once.

665
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,980
Based on the data from back then,

666
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,420
a similar number of customers

667
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,540
may choose to take their food home.

668
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,860
So when preparing ingredients,

669
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,740
we'll take that into account.

670
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,380
What's wrong?

671
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,700
You feel

672
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,340
this is too down-to-earth?

673
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,380
With your skills,

674
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,980
you could aim for something better.

675
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,740
Food is the necessity of the people,
and it caters to the people first.

676
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,380
I believe a restaurant

677
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,300
shouldn't turn away

678
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,100
any type of customers.

679
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,420
A place where ordinary people,

680
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,900
celebrities and millionaires can dine

681
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,500
is the Canteen I desire.

682
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,820
Go and see more in the courtyard.

683
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,780
Amazing!

684
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,220
What a surprise!

685
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,340
Yeah, okay.

686
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:42,780
Okay.

687
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,460
A whole world is hidden inside!

688
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,860
It's good, huh?

689
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,220
This is the place

690
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,220
where I grew up.

691
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,540
I turned it into a private dining room.

692
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,300
Guests who want to try
our signature dishes

693
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,700
can book it in advance.

694
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,100
How about that?

695
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,900
Now

696
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,940
are you confident?

697
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,380
Alright,

698
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,780
let's get ready to eat.

699
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,220
Here's to a booming business tomorrow!

700
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,820
Ding Chan,

701
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,060
serve the dishes.

702
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,660
Okay.

703
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,300
[Canteen]

704
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,420

[Menu Special]

706
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,020
This is way too cheap!

707
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,700
[15 yuan for Any 3 dishes]
Boss, can you profit like this?

708
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,100
Fifteen yuan for three dishes.

709
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,300
Just five yuan per dish.

710
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,900
The Three Friends of Winter is 288.

711
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,780
The Golden Coin Tofu Pie is 288.

The Crab Meatballs is 588.

Nine-Five Supreme.

714
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,220
I've never heard
of these national banquet dishes before!

715
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,340
A reservation three days in advance.

716
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,780
Their prices fluctuate with the market.

717
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,540
Do you think the boss has lost his mind?

718
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,580
The prices

719
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,260
are worlds apart!

720
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,460
He said last night

721
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,780
our canteen

722
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,860
is for all types of customers.

723
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,420
That's just wishful thinking!

724
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Qiao Zhi,

725
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,340
[588 yuan/serving]
are you kidding me with the prices?

726
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,060
I'm serious.

727
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,540
Others may question me,

728
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,700
but why are you joining them?

729
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,300
You've had my food before.

730
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,620
I know you're an excellent chef,

731
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,220
and your food is worth that price.

732
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,420
But our food street

733
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,020
has fallen on hard times.

734
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,020
Will any high-end clients come?

735
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,140
As the old saying goes,

736
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,940
good wine needs no bush.

737
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,060
Alright then.

738
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,100
Once we close for the night,

739
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,900
you'll see what the problem is.

740
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,660
Fine. Get back to work.

741
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,420
288! 588?

742
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,260
Your boss must be desperate for money.

743
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,540
If you can't afford it,

744
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,300
order the fifteen-yuan set meal.

745
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,420
The price is very reasonable.

746
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,740
I can't afford it?

747
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,740
I'm treating my friend,
yet you make me buy a set meal?

748
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,980
I'm not eating. Go.

749
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,300
Let's go.

750
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,940
Miss,

751
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,100
think twice before eating here.

752
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,260
This is a scammy, crooked shop.

753
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,140
A scam?

754
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,220
Is it expensive?

755
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,300
Let me see.

756
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,220
Is it a real rip-off?

757
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,620
I think it's fine.

758
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,780
I'll have this Golden Coin Tofu Pie,

759
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,860
and this.

760
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,420
And this.

761
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,580
This one too.

762
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,980
And one more of those.

763
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,660
What a sucker.

764
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,340
Let me take a look.

765
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,620
Alright, thanks.

766
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,700
Okay, please wait a moment.

767
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,580
What a bad luck!

768
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,620
Seriously.

769
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Oh my god.

770
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,020
Did we hit him?

771
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,020
No.

772
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,020
That was a close one.

773
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,660
How do you even drive?

774
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,820
Are you blind?

775
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,940
You were making a turn,

776
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,900
and you didn't check
for oncoming traffic.

777
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,620
Do you know the traffic rules?

778
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,220
Did you even take the theory test?

779
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,780
How did you even get your license?

780
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,340
Want to talk about rules?

781
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:58,980
Fine.

782
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,260
I'll teach you the rules.

783
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,660
Hold on, I'll get this.

784
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,420
What are you doing?

785
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:24,780
Mr. Huang,

786
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,020
that's Zhou Yuan's son.

787
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,860
Call Zhou Yuan.

788
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,900
Miss,

789
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,020
do you think our food isn't expensive?

790
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,580
Trouble. Chan.

791
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,340
The customer just now is smashing a car!

792
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,740
Zhou Chong.

793
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,780
Something's wrong!

794
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,820
Zhou Chong is smashing a car.

795
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,820
Let's go and see.

796
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,820
Right over there!

797
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:54,980
What's going on?

798
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:07,900
Call the police!

799
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,740
Someone, call the police!

800
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,540
No need to call the police.

801
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,700
I smashed

802
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,500
your car, I'll pay for it.

803
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,940
Feeling bad now?

804
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,580
My car is over there.

805
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,620
Come on.

806
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,540
No?

807
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,060
You can't compete with me.

808
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,260
Must work every day to make money?

809
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,700
As for us,

810
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,300
even if we skip school for a day,

811
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,900
my dad will still have his secretary

812
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,020
wire money into my account.

813
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,940
Zhou, you're a legend!

814
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,980
That was so satisfying!

815
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,260
Like slapping them in the face!

816
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,660
I keep going.

817
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,700
Stop it!

818
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,700
If you don't want this to escalate,
listen to me.

819
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,900
Who are you?

820
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,580
Get lost.

821
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,420
I won't bother talking with you.

822
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,780
It hurts.

823
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,460
You lack real-world experience.

824
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,260
You just can't afford to offend someone.

825
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,700
This is a cheap thing.

826
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,620
The car might not be a big deal,

827
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,300
but his relatives are untouchable.

828
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,060
See that Mercedes over there?

829
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,380
Your father can't afford
to offend them either.

830
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,700
Get up.

831
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,700
Getting yourself into trouble
is bad enough,

832
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,140
but don't drag your dad down with you.

833
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,540
Anyone can talk big.

834
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,060
He is my guest,

835
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,460
so I know who he is.

836
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,660
In the entire Huainan region,

837
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,380
maybe only one or two truly outrank him.

838
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,660
Mr. Huang,

839
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,780
he's young and doesn't know any better.

840
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,820
Please don't hold it against him.

841
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,300
They'll get a brand new car.

842
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,540
You're Zhou Yuan's son?

843
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,340
Well. It has nothing to do with my dad.

844
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,340
Listen more to your dad.

845
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,190
[Dad Calling]

846
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,300
Are you okay?

847
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,580
Nothing, Cheng.

848
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,460
Mr. Huang,

849
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,020
I'm so sorry about this.

850
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,860
The meal is ready. Enjoy it first.

851
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,540
Right.

852
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,380
Let's have the meal first.

853
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,700
Handle things here.

854
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:34,980
Let's go.

855
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,660
After you.

856
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,020
Stop giving me so much trouble.

857
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,300
Must you

858
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,980
provoke Mr. Huang?

859
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,940
Stop going to school.

860
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:43,940
Get back home right now!

861
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,140
From now on,

862
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
you're staying at home.

863
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,100
You're not learning in school,

864
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,820
just causing trouble.

865
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:50,900
That's final.

866
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,420
Come.

867
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,820
Sit down.

868
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,580
Nothing good happens when you show up.

869
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,740
It's fine. Everything is taken care of.

870
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,060
Let the police handle the rest.

871
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,100
By the way,

872
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,460
a car for you to get around

873
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,100
for now.

874
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,780
I don't need it.

875
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,380
Dong,

876
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,540
I truly didn't know about

877
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,420
Mom's critical illness.

878
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,940
Besides, it has been a long time.

879
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,380
Let's just let it go.

880
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,140
Some things aren't meant
to be forgotten.

881
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,700
Mom held on to her last breath in bed,

882
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,380
waiting for you for three days.

883
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,900
Dong had to pretend to be you

884
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,420
before Mom passed away.

885
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,460
Fang,

886
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,220
she was my mother.

887
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,140
Do you think I feel good about it?

888
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,940
You still remember she was your mother?

889
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,820
I admit,

890
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,220
over the years, because of my business,

891
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,260
I did neglect my family

892
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,220
and show them less care.

893
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,700
But I've been trying very hard

894
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,780
to find what I lost in the past.

895
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,700
Feelings aren't a physical thing

896
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,860
that you can find because you want to.

897
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,100
Dong, why are you still sitting here?

898
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,460
We agree

899
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,100
to get everything out in the open today.

900
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,660
Do you intend to forgive him?

901
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,900
I...

902
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,540
Fang.

903
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,500
Be careful!

904
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,820
Are you okay?

905
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,860
Alright.

906
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,660
Excuse me.

907
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,460
Wait a second.

908
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,060
What is it?

909
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,620
Do I need your permission to go?

910
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,740
You misunderstand.

911
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,300
Mr. Huang

912
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,660
specially ordered this dish for you.

913
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,220
It took me three days and three nights.

914
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,900
And this dish

915
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,700
is the very reason of this gathering.

916
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,100
I hope

917
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,780
you could at least taste it.

918
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,460
Yes, Fang.

919
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,060
Sit down and chat for a while.

920
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,620
Right.

921
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,260
Take a seat.

922
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,820
Smells so good.

923
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,060
Let's get a bowl for Fang first.

924
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,900
I'm not hungry.

925
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,580
Go ahead and eat.

926
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,260
This tastes so good.

927
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,260
It's the flavor of Mom's cooking.

928
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,260
No wonder Cheng chose
this unremarkable restaurant.

929
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,900
What happened earlier

930
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,020
just dampened my spirit.

931
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,020
But now, it all feels worth it.

932
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,220
Is it really that amazing?

933
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,020
You have to try it!

934
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,580
Yes.

935
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,740
Try it!

936
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,380
Ding Chan.

937
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,300
Here, Dong.

938
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,180
Drink up.

939
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,420
Here

940
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,260
Have a taste.

941
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,620
This soup is excellent.

942
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,940
It has the taste of home.

943
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,260
Fang,

944
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,260
you have to try it!

945
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,580
Fang.

946
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,060
Last time

947
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,260
I had another dish here.

948
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,060
But after I tasted

949
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,100
that soup back then,

950
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,140
it instantly brought back

951
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,900
our childhood memories.

952
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,740
So Qiao suggested

953
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,660
inviting my family

954
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,620
over for a reunion.

955
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,220
I know you have been haunted

956
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,060
by what happened in the past.

957
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,700
But

958
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,620
family ties and blood relations

959
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,020
can never be severed.

960
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,660
I believe

961
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,740
if we could

962
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,740
reunite together,

963
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,660
that would

964
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,740
be what our parents want to see most.

965
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,860
When Mom was gravely ill,

966
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,340
I just finished my own surgery.

967
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,380
Afraid that my wound

968
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,020
could get infected,

969
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,180
my wife decided not to tell me about it.

970
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,460
So I truly didn't know

971
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,420
Mom's illness.

972
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,660
Cheng.

973
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,740
Why didn't you say so earlier?

974
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,820
I failed to be a dutiful son.

975
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,740
I have no face to offer any excuses.

976
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,860
But later,

977
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,460
Qiao Zhi made the rice with soup

978
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,060
and I understand a truth.

979
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,980
Our family was poor When we were little,

980
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,140
but Mom would save the best

981
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,140
for me first.

982
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,940
She didn't favor me personally,

983
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,140
but because I was the eldest son!

984
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,060
When they are no longer here,

985
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,940
I must support the family.

986
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,660
So for all these years,

987
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,940
I've been trying very hard.

988
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,700
I hope you can forgive me.

989
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,020
I hope our family

990
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,940
can be together often.

991
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,260
That's all.

992
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,460
Let's drink the soup.

993
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,340
[Canteen]

994
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:34,980
Qiao Zhi,

995
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,420
you're very thoughtful.

996
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,100
You've helped me a lot.

997
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,740
Whoever started the trouble
should end it.

998
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,580
I was only providing support.

999
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,820
In the past,

1000
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,620
I felt they would never forgive me.

1001
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,700
The more I thought about it,

1002
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,660
the more terrified I became.

1003
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,180
Later, I finally understood

1004
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,300
I was too afraid to face it.

1005
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,620
Your soup

1006
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,860
is the masterstroke,

1007
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,540
bringing back

1008
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,300
all our childhood memories.

1009
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,060
I'm in awe.

1010
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,900
Dong and Fang agreed

1011
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,780
to have a family dinner

1012
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,740
once a month

1013
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,140
right here

1014
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,020
at your place.

1015
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:09,980
I was afraid

1016
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,260
if you visited

1017
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,340
our restaurant more,

1018
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,540
you'd find it not classy enough.

1019
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,900
Precisely this warm and cozy feeling

1020
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,340
in your restaurant

1021
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,540
makes it perfect for a family gathering.

1022
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,820
I was planning

1023
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,860
to invest in your restaurant,

1024
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,860
but then I found out

1025
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,380
you're in business with Huaixiang Group.

1026
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,700
Ms. Tao has a unique vision.

1027
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,300
Alright.

1028
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,260
As long as you like it,

1029
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:28,860
you are

1030
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,700
always welcome here.

1031
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,260
Okay.

1032
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,260
There is one more thing.

1033
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,340
Please go ahead.

1034
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,260
I heard

1035
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,780
from Mr. Xu

1036
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,820
that you are good at diet therapy.

1037
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,780
It's not my speciality,

1038
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,980
but I know a bit.

1039
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,300
May I ask

1040
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,740
what's wrong?

1041
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,580
Well...

1042
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,180
it's the man stuff.
