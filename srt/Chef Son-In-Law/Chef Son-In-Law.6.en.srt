Now suddenly you act concerned.

87
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,460

Can't stand how she acts.

97
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,140
As if being pretty

98
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,940
means she owns the whole world.

99
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,460

103
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,060

104
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,260
if I don't love her,

105
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,420
should I hate her instead?

106
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,460

107
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,340
She is plotting how to kick you
out of the door!

108
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,420
But she failed.

109
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,860
Listen.

110
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,260
You've met too few beauties,

111
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,380
so you'd be easily manipulated.

112
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,020
What should I do then?

113
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,060
Beauty is commonplace;

114
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,620
an interesting soul is rare.

115
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,900
Yet how do you know

116
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,260
she has no interesting soul?

117
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,740
Besides,

118
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,860
I simply go

119
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,060
for her appearance.

120
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,340
Talking to you kills my vibe completely.

121
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,380
What's wrong?

122
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,220
Alright.

123
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,220
I'm fine.

124
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,380
What did you bring today?

125
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,140
A sandwich.

126
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,220
Finish every bite.

127
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,300
No complaints about its taste.

128
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,420
Sandwich?

129
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:43,820
How does it taste?

130
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,620
Oh heavens!

131
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,300

If Mr. Tao ever tried your cooking,

136
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,220
he'd probably hit the roof!

137
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,020
But he sampled my dishes

138
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,420
and

139
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,100
even complimented.

140
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,060
He really loved you.

141
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,100
Eat it or throw it away.

142
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,780
No.

143
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,660
I'll eat.

144
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,580
How are you?

145
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,460
Does it still hurt?

146
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,380
Yeah, it hurts.

147
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,340
But nothing serious.

148
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,220
Focus on your work.

149
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,060
Alright, I'll head to the meeting now.

150
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,260
Having a board meeting today?

151
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,460
Go for it!

152
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,460
Off I go.

153
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:26,980
Keep killing it!

154
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,620
Didn't you bring me any food?

155
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,540
That hamburger on the table is for you.

156
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,420
By the way,

157
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,420
what did the police say?

158
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,700
The suspect was arrested at the station.

159
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,940
The police pressed him,

160
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,460
but he insisted it was solely his doing.

161
00:06:59,380 --> 00:06:59,980
However,

162
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,740
I suspect

163
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,140
it might involve one of my fans.

164
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,100
A fan?

165
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,500
Who exactly?

166
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,540
I don't know,

167
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,580
but he showered me with virtual gifts,

168
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,380
and messaged repeatedly to meet up.

169
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,220
After I turned him down,

170
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,340
he warned me to watch my back.

171
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,900
I have a feeling.

172
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,900
He might be the one who stalked

173
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,260
and secretly photographed me.

174
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,220
You've never even met him.

175
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,900
I'll never meet such a madman.

176
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,260
He clearly has deep pockets

177
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,020
and a powerful backing force.

178
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,860
Such a pervert will be over someday

179
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,940
no matter how powerful he is.

180
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,620
Right,

181
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,580
what exactly did you do

182
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,780
with that 100,000 yuan?

183
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,740
Started a business!
My budget wasn't enough,

184
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,260
so I borrowed money from you.

185
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,660
Starting a business?

186
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,060
Nine out of ten end in losses.

187
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,660
I don't look down on you.

188
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,820
One of my friends

189
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,700
tried multiple times over the years,

190
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,300
each time losing everything.

191
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,300
His family had to deal  with his mess.

192
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,380
Pfft!

193
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Don't talk like such a pessimist!

194
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,220
If you really don't believe in me,

195
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,300
I'll give the money back to you.

196
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,540
No.

197
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,300
The money's spent.

198
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
Alright.

199
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,900
Drop the whole borrow thing.

200
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,420
Just call it an investment.

201
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,340
So I'm now your shareholder!

202
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,260
From now on,

203
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,380
speak to me with more respect.

204
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,660
And

205
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,340
stop blackmailing me

206
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,860
with that shady incident.

207
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,060
Fine then.

208
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,340
At most, provoke you with sharp words.

209
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,260
No beauty would spare

210
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,300
a glance at your runaway mouth.

211
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,480
[Ellie Calling]

212
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,660
Ellie,

213
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,300
has that matter been resolved?

214
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,220
Resolved?

215
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,620
What's that?

216
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,540
It's about Huaixiang Group.

217
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,340
Can we collaborate?

218
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,860
My father has only agreed

219
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,700
to supply to Huaixiang Group
and the Canteen.

220
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,380
As for your customized dish proposal,

221
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,940
he wants to discuss it with you
via video call.

222
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,500
Can you come over?

223
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:04,940
Sure,

224
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,180
I'll head there right away.

225
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,780
Are you out of your mind?

226
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,540
Look at yourself! You can't go!

227
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,660
Why not?

228
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,980
It's crucial for our family's future,

229
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,820
and I promised Ruxue.

230
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,260
Absolutely not.

231
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,420
Your life was at risk!

232
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,700
It's nothing serious.

233
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,940
At worst, the wound heals more slowly.

234
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,780
I'm really fine.

235
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,540
Let's go.

236
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,460
Drive me there.

237
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,940
Slower.

238
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,580
Already.

239
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,300
How are you?

240
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,540
I told you not to come out!

241
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,820
Nothing serious.

242
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,460
Focus on the road.

243
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:55,780
Come in.

244
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,340
Ellie.

245
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,740
Why are you

246
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,020
so pale?

247
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,660
Ate too much since returning home

248
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,060
and turned all pale and gingerly!

249
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,180
If you feel unwell, take a rest.

250
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,740
I'm fine.

251
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,020
Let's not waste your father's time.

252
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,220
Begin.

253
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,580
Daddy.

254
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,700
Ellie,

255
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,740
my sweetie.

256
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,780
Mr. Li,

257
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,940
it's been a long time since we last met!

258
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:30,820
Qiao Zhi,

259
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,020
has Ellie

260
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,140
caused you any trouble?

261
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,700
Not at all.

262
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,700
She's helped me tremendously.

263
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,900
If not causing trouble,

264
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,300
she's excelling beyond expectations.

265
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,380
Daddy,

266
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,580
please have faith

267
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,780
in me.

268
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,220
Look at the branch company.

269
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,100
Operations are running smoothly now.

270
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,540
Absolutely!

271
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,940
You're the best!

272
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,420
Now back to business.

273
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,180
Qiao Zhi,

274
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,620
you should understand

275
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,380
it's our honor to partner

276
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,780
with an outstanding company

277
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,060
like Huaixiang Group.

278
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,460
But your pre-made food solution is new.

279
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,460
Can dishes turn into IP

280
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,340
and be sold online?

281
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,780
It leaves me very confused.

282
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,900
Yes.

283
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,540
After all, Huasheng Group still relies

284
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,180
on offline sales in other countries.

285
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
But things work differently here.

286
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,820
Nowadays, food delivery

287
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,620
and online shopping

288
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,580
have become indispensable parts
of daily life.

289
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,020
I'm fully aware of that,

290
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,420
but the largest food delivery platform

291
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,220
is Tianxiang Rankings of Baiwei Group.

292
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,540
It's our direct competitor.

293
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,660
But soon enough,

294
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,620
a bigger platform will take its place.

295
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,540
Which one?

296
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,060
Have you heard of short videos?

297
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,940
Of course,

298
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,820
it is blowing up worldwide!

299
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
But I recall

300
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,060
they lack food delivery services.

301
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,060
Yes.

302
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,100
They're a newcomer.

303
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,660
It's only available in China for now.

304
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,740
If it succeeds domestically,

305
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,260
they'll immediately replicate this model

306
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,380
in their international version.

307
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,340
At that point,

308
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
Huasheng Group

309
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,220
will seize the first-mover advantage.

310
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,140
If the pre-made food sales

311
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,380
can reach 100 million units,

312
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,020
I'll approve your proposal.

313
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,700
How long?

314
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,620
One year.

315
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,420
Two years.

316
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,180
Or

317
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,820
compromise at 50 million units?

318
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,580
You should know

319
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,100
before entering new markets…

320
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,540
Qiao Zhi,

321
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,140
I have confidence in you

322
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,260
and your dishes.

323
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:18,940
Ellie,

324
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,540
could you step outside for a moment?

325
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,500
I need to speak

326
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,900
with him privately.

327
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,900
Daddy,

328
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,300
what is it that I can't hear?

329
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,660
Be good.

330
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,540
This is a conversation between men.

331
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,340
Qiao Zhi,

332
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
given Huasheng Group's scale and resources,

333
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,980
you aren't our top choice.

334
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,420
I have many options available,

335
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,340
or I could choose none at all.

336
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,660
All terms and agreements
for this collaboration

337
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,980
must satisfy one precondition.

338
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,540
Please specify.

339
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,780
Ellie went back to China because of you.

340
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,100
I don't care what dynamic exists

341
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,180
between you two.

342
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,180
Ellie must

343
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,580
live happily.

344
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,140
I promised her mom

345
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,780
on her deathbed.

346
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,740
Therefore,

347
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,700
whether she lives happily

348
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,740
is the sole precondition.

349
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,300
Otherwise,

350
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,660
everything is off the table.

351
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,580
But I...

352
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,620
Speak up already!

353
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,540
How's the talk going?

354
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,300
Nothing to worry about.

355
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,340
Will Ruxue's matter get resolved?

356
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,940
Right now, all the pressure's

357
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,260
shifting onto my shoulders.

358
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,660
Why?

359
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,940
The next step is critical.

360
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,380
Even if I explain, you won't get it.

361
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,740
But you need to say something!

362
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,140
Tomorrow's the 15th.

363
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,780
To become King of Viral Trends,

364
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,780
it depends entirely on this dish!

365
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
What's this King of Viral Trends?

366
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,580
Who?

367
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,300
Please focus on driving safely.

368
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,060
I beg you.

369
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,460
I'm sorry.

370
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,100
My apologies.

371
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,420

[Huaixiang Group]
Among all current distributors,

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,940
No objections.

386
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,580
I've proposed working with them last year,

387
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,260
but Ms. Tao vetoed it then.

388
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,740
I also agree.

389
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,980
Calculating this way,

390
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,220
our profit this year will increase
by at least six percentage points.

391
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,940
Then it's settled!

392
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,340
Ms. Tao,

393
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,020
any opinions?

394
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,540
It's all about profits.

395
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,580
I can understand that.

396
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:49,900
Ms. Tao,

397
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,340
what do you mean by that?

398
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,940
For us investors,

399
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,820
if not for returns,

400
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,820
what are we investing for?

401
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,020
Exactly!

402
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,020
Ms. Tao,

403
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,180
you're too young.

404
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,180
Business

405
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,740
isn't as simple as it seems.

406
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,260
When you all unite against me,

407
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,180
what can I say?

408
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,900
Their ingredients are produced

409
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,940
with chemical fertilizers
and various technologies.

410
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,180
You'd stoop to anything for profit!

411
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:14,780
Tell me

412
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,300
if you eat the dishes from Baiwei Group.

413
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,060
If all the restaurants

414
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,940
serve identical dishes

415
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,140
with the same additives,

416
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,380
are we abandoning culinary culture

417
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,540
and individuality altogether?

418
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,700
It's inevitable, Xue.

419
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,180
Let me

420
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,420
tell you something.

421
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,660
As a company,

422
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,780
we can't single-handedly

423
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,980
change an entire industry.

424
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,460
You've just graduated.

425
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,060
I know

426
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,660
you have ideals and ambitions.

427
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,260
But look around.

428
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,340
Everyone here

429
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,860
was just like you

430
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,180
back then.

431
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,060
But now?

432
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,900
After years of being worn down by time,

433
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,580
we've grown numb.

434
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,140
Look at Mr. Jing

435
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,340
and Mr. Sheng.

436
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,460
They're from an investment firm.

437
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,460
focusing on ROI and output ratios.

438
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,020
Everything else is off the table.

439
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,820
You mentioned culture just now,

440
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,700
but what is culture?

441
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,260
It's merely rhetoric

442
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,420
used by capital to package itself.

443
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,380
Back then,

444
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,780
when your mother chose capital,

445
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,940
she abandoned cultural inheritance.

446
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,620
At such a major event today,

447
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,260
why isn't she presiding over it?

448
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,100
Wake up and face reality.

449
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,460
Alright.

450
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,300
Impressive teamwork!

451
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,580
To win at all costs, huh?

452
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,660
Fine, I'm not changing the supplier.

453
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,780
Our family holds veto power.

454
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,900
If losses occur, share them equally.

455
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,740
How could this work?

456
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,300
Unacceptable.

457
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,940
Massive funds involved!

458
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,700
Xue,

459
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,620
have you lost your mind?

460
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,460
Must you fight against money like this?

461
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,780
Yes,

462
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,180
we suffered losses due to Baiwei Group.

463
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,260
But now

464
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,300
what matters most

465
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,220
is making money!

466
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,060
Do you get it?

467
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,820
Smashing the rice bowls
of future generations?

468
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,660
You can do that, but I can't.

469
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,580
I'm sorry.

470
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,780
I don't lack money,

471
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,500
and what you're doing is unethical.

472
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,340
This meeting is over.

473
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,700
What kind of attitude is this?

474
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,900
Look at her attitude.

475
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,060
Well said!

476
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,420
I now believe

477
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,020
partnering with Huaixiang Group

478
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,300
is a wise choice for Huasheng Group.

479
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,940
You are...?

480
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,980
Head of Huasheng Group in Greater China,

481
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:21,860
Ellie.

482
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,340
Qiao Zhi,

483
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,260
we…

484
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,580
Look at him.

485
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,220
If any issues arise later,

486
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,580
we'll not take responsibility.

487
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,140
I'm terribly sorry.

488
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,740
If anything happens,

489
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,740
we'll take full responsibility.

490
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,580
Where did Qiao Zhi go?

491
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,940
All because of you.

492
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,140
What did I do?

493
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,860
He even…

494
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,780
Never mind.

495
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,740
Forget it.

496
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,060
Anyway, he went out for you

497
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,900
and felt that he was fine

498
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,940
and could work.

499
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,340
He got carried away

500
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,220
and went to deal with his Canteen.

501
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,180
For me?

502
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,860
He wouldn't let me tell you.

503
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,700
Mustn't go to him.

504
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,140
Pretend you don't know about this.

505
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,700
Hey. Your injury hasn't healed.

506
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,380
It's okay.

507
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,460
I haven't exercised for too long.

508
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,140
Why are you still up so late?

509
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,860
What do you need me for?

510
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,740
I've asked Ms. Chen

511
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,220
to prepare the room upstairs.

512
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,620
It has a spacious environment
and good lighting.

513
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,420
Move up there.

514
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,620
What does that mean?

515
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,700
After all my big help,

516
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,700
is this how you thank me?

517
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:44,900
I won't move.

518
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,180
Let me tell you.

519
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
I won't move.

520
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,980
I refuse.

521
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,100
I want to constantly remind myself

522
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,580
of the grievances I endured here,

523
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,220
so you'll feel guilty
for the rest of your life.

524
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,660
You're so childish.

525
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,460
So what if I'm childish?

526
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,020
I've put myself on the line
for this matter.

527
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,100
Can't I be childish?

528
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,060
What did you promise Huasheng Group?

529
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,140
You think I'm childish, right?

530
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,660
I won't tell you!

531
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,740
I won't tell you.

532
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,620
I'll piss you off.

533
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,860
After all the huge favor I did for you,

534
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,140
not only are you stingy with money,

535
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,380
you didn't even get me a gift!

536
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,940
There is a gift.

537
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,580
I just didn't expect

538
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,060
the custom-made would take this long.

539
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,380
What's this?

540
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,980
Tianqing Pavilion designed this,

541
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,180
with hand-embroidered craftsmanship.

542
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
They tailor for all past Kings of Chefs.

543
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,220
Based upon the design of your grandpa's,

544
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,020
they've made modifications:

545
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,340
less rustic simplicity,

546
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
more bold extravagance.

547
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,220
I've kept a low profile, okay?

548
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,700
Though I truly do love this gift.

549
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
Honestly, I adore it.

550
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,700
The quadrennial
King of Chefs Championship

551
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,620
is about to begin!

552
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,300
You need a proper outfit.

553
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,140
I never said I'll participate.

554
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,140
Deny it all you want,

555
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,140
but reclaim the honor
that rightfully belongs

556
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,420
to your grandpa from Zhan Jun!

557
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,060
It's hard for a cook like me

558
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,980
to become the King of Chefs.

559
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,940
Focus on perfecting your dishes.

560
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,260
Leave everything else to me.

561
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,940
I'll redeem the mistakes

562
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,860
my grandpa made years ago.

563
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,660
Hurry up and pack!

564
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,060
I'll help you move shortly.

565
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,280
[Kenjiro Ito, one of the Three
Japanese Gods of Cuisine]

566
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,580
Mr. Zhan,

567
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,060
who is he?

568
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
This is Kentaro Ito,

569
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,860
one of the three
Japanese Gods of Cuisine.

570
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,940
He's notoriously eccentric.

571
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,460
When I speak later,

572
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,020
just listen quietly!

573
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,740
I see.

574
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,020
Losers.

575
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,260
You imbeciles!

576
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,340
Disgraceful!

577
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,380
Sorry, Master.

578
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,660
I should have cut off your fingers!

579
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,620
But since we're in China now,

580
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,700
consider them spared for now.

581
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,980
Yes, Master!

582
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,700
Get lost!

583
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,380
Mr. Ito,

584
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,780
hello.

585
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,380
You must be Zhan Jun's son.

586
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,380
Yes, sir!

587
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,820
Please call me Zhan.

588
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,220
It's an honor

589
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,620
to meet you personally.

590
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,860
I

591
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,380
just prepared a gift.

592
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,420
It's made by Mr. Xu,

593
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,100
Porcelain King of Jingdezhen.

594
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,780
Please accept it.

595
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,420
Let's cut to the chase.

596
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
You're so straightforward.

597
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,380
I heard you came to Xunyang looking for

598
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,980
a new location for your restaurant,

599
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,780
yet haven't found one.

600
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,500
Yes.

601
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,580
Honestly,

602
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,420
I had secured

603
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,940
an ideal spot for you,

604
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,460
but some idiot snatched it away.

605
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,100
He even claimed

606
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,540
the Japanese people

607
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,620
don't deserve to open restaurants here!

608
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,340
Unforgivable.

609
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,740
So I'd like you to teach him

610
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,980
a lesson

611
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,580
to convince him.

612
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,780
Thus, things will fall into place.

613
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,180
A man's got to eat!

614
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,060
Let's take a break.

615
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,780
Are you Qiao Zhi?

616
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,740
To think I actually believed

617
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,140
you were a bodyguard at first!

618
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,220
What's the matter?

619
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,140
Baiwei Group wants your restaurant.

620
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,420
Name your price.

621
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,860
I've just got it reopened,

622
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,380
and you're eyeing it up.

623
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,300
Here is the thing.

624
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,620
I promised the neighbors

625
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,100
that I'd help boost business

626
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,860
for all the shops on this street.

627
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,220
Boost business?

628
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,620
You? Seriously?

629
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
Don't you know your own place at all?

630
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,860
Let me tell you.

631
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,740
The Japanese God of Cuisine

632
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,860
is coming.

633
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,220
He wants this restaurant.

634
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,460
His arrival

635
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,740
will make the entire food street thrive.

636
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,500
And you

637
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,340
go back to being a bodyguard.

638
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,700
As for compensation,

639
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,140
you won't be shortchanged.

640
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:26,700
You...

641
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,940
The Japanese God of Cuisine?

642
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:31,980
Alright.

643
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,020
I'm quite curious to meet him.

644
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,060
Qiao Zhi.

645
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,140
What are they getting at?

646
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,180
What Japanese God of Cuisine?

647
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,820
Never mind. Wait and see.

648
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,220
Asking for a hard time.

649
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,580
Seeking death!

650
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,580
Has Mr. Ito arrived yet?

651
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,300
He's here.

652
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,940
Mr. Ito,

653
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,140
this is the restaurant.

654
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,580
This restaurant

655
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,420
is quite good.

656
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,900
I like it very much.

657
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,900
That's great!

658
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,220
As long as you step in,

659
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,340
things will go smoothly for me later.

660
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:08,980
Where

661
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,900
is the arrogant

662
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:11,820
young man now?

663
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,420
Someone like him

664
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,260
doesn't deserve your attention.

665
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,660
But since you're here today,

666
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,020
please teach him

667
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,540
a lesson

668
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,340
and get him out of this food street.

669
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:26,860
Please.

670
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,500
This way.

671
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:28,780
Please.

672
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,180
Mr. Ito,

673
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,140
that's him!

674
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,060
Mr. Qiao,

675
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,860
it's really you!

676
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,420
I've searched for you everywhere!

677
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,900
Bow down!
This is the master I've been seeking.

678
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,940
Greetings, Master of God.

679
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,860
Please, get up.

680
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,900
We don't go by this in China.

681
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:07,980
Yes.

682
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,380
Mr. Qiao,

683
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
what are you doing here?

684
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,700
This is my restaurant.

685
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,820
Why wouldn't I be here?

686
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,900
So this is your restaurant.

687
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,300
Now it makes sense!

688
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,900
Mr. Ito,

689
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,180
he is the arrogant man!

690
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,420
Have you made a mistake?

691
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,140
I could mistake anyone

692
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,820
but not Mr. Qiao.

693
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,740
No way!

694
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,500
He's just a trainee cook
at Huaixiang Restaurant!

695
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,580
How could he know you?

696
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
You fool! Show respect to my master!

697
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,060
Without his guidance,

698
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,660
I'd have never been the God of Cuisine.

699
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,780
Although

700
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,740
he doesn't allow me to say it,

701
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,660
in my heart,

702
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,140
he'll always

703
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,500
be my master.

704
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,100
Never expected you would run
a restaurant here.

705
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,620
True masters are among the common folk.

706
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,900
Alright, Ito.

707
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,340
Let bygones be bygones.

708
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,300
I had no idea

709
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,580
you owned this place.

710
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,660
I came so suddenly.

711
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,780
My deepest apologies.

712
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,300
All I have

713
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,740
to offer now is what's at hand.

714
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,580
This

715
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,340
is a materpiece by Mr. Xu of Jingdezhen.

716
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,420
Please accept it.

717
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,340
Very well.

718
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,020
Thank you.

719
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,860
Ding Chan,

720
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,060
put this away safely.

721
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,580
Yes.

722
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:31,940
[Canteen]

723
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,340
Mr. Qiao,

724
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,660
I have so many questions to ask you.

725
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,380
Do you

726
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,380
have the time?

727
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:37,700
Of course.

728
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,700
Come inside and we'll talk.

729
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,140
Come.

730
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,500
Yes.

731
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,140
Go.

732
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,300
Mr. Ito!

733
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,980
What are you doing?

734
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
Am I not even allowed inside?

735
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,620
How dare he present my gift to him?

736
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,100
Let's go.

737
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,180

738
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,940

Mr. Xu,

772
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,660
thanks to you,

773
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,620
our partnership
has been such a pleasure.

774
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,500
By the way,

775
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,580
I had Zhan Jun make a reservation
at a restaurant

776
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,980
with a chef who's nearly impossible
to book!

777
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,820
Let's go.

778
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,540
We'll show you our appreciation.

779
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,740
You are visiting me

780
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,220
as a CEO and a top producer,

781
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,380
and I'm deeply thankful.

782
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,500
Now,

783
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,220
I wouldn't dare to eat carelessly.

784
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,860
Mr. Xu,

785
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,140
- it's Qiao Zhi.
- He loves to eat the most!

786
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,500
Qiao Zhi!

787
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,340
Mr. Xu,

788
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,220
will you be free later?

789
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,180
I'd like to treat you to a simple meal.

790
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,820
Of course, I have time!

791
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,820
By the way,

792
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,700
two of my good friends are visiting me.

793
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,940
May I bring them along?

794
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,780
Absolutely!

795
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,260
Welcome.

796
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,140
Great.

797
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,060
What's going on?

798
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,660
You said you wouldn't eat carelessly?

799
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,620
This isn't being careless.

800
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:06,820
Let's go!

801
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,460
I know a fantastic spot.

802
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,300
But Zhan Jun made a reservation.

803
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,380
Don't worry about that.

804
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,700
Just come with me.

805
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,340
You won't be disappointed!

806
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,460
Mr. Xu,

807
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,140
maybe you should change clothes?

808
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,260
Look at him.

809
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,620
I'll get changed.

810
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,340
Just give me a minute!

811
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,940
Please be careful.

812
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,660
Mr. Xu,

813
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,980
is it

814
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,900
really here?

815
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,900
The GPS says we've arrived.

816
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,900
Are you serious?

817
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,380
Wanting to recall the hard past?

818
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,140
It looks totally dilapidated!

819
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,980
Be patient!

820
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,940
You'll see it in a minute.

821
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,100
It seems really familiar.

822
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,860
I think I've got it.

823
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,020
This was Canteen

824
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,660
that was very popular back then?

825
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,900
Yeah, this looks like the spot.

826
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,580
That's right!

827
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,340
Now that you say that,

828
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,940
it all makes sense.

829
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,820
The owner here was surnamed Qiao, too.

830
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,860
So he…

831
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,020
Good day.

832
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,980
Are you here at Mr. Qiao's invitation?

833
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,740
Mr. Qiao?

834
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,860
You mean Qiao Zhi?

835
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,620
Yes.

836
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,700
Then we are.

837
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,580
He asked me to welcome you.

838
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,260
Please, come this way.

839
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,700
Okay.

840
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,340
Right this way, please.

841
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:21,580
Well.

842
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,740
Please mind the step.

843
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,020
Mr. Xu,

844
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,060
this place hides a world of wonder!

845
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,780
The decor is quite impressive.

846
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,700
Such a classic, elegant feel.

847
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,540
Very distinctive.

848
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:34,940
Mr. Xu.

849
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,500
Ding Chan, serve tea.

850
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,820
Allow me to introduce.

851
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,860
This is Mr. Huang.

852
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,300
Mr. Huang, how do you do?

853
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,060
How do you do?

854
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,140
And over here,

855
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,060
Mr. Zhong!

856
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,060
Mr. Zhong, hello!

857
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,780
Very nice to meet you!

858
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,460
Well.

859
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
Please wait for about 20 minutes.

860
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,100
We'll begin dinner right on time.

861
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,380
Perfect!

862
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,660
Alright?

863
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,340
Ding Chan,

864
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:53,940
look after them well.

865
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,220
Alright.

866
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:54,940
Have a seat.

867
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,620
Please sit down.

868
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,740
Is this soup?

869
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,420
This fragrance…

870
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,020
Wait.

871
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,060
I can't even tell

872
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,300
what this soup is by smelling it.

873
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,180
Is it really that mysterious,

874
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,060
Mr. Xu?

875
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,380
Yes.

876
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,260
You've eaten every luxury under the sun.

877
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,300
You are being modest.

878
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,980
Here comes

879
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,260
the soup!

880
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,540
What's its name?

881
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,380
Have any of you read

882
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,300
the Legend of the Condor Heroes,

883
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,220
the novel of Mr. Jin Yong?

884
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,100
Before us

885
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,260
is the very imperial delicacy

886
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,980
that haunted the memories of Hong Qigong

887
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,460
Mandarin Ducks Stewed
with Five Treasures.

888
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,660
Mandarin Ducks Stewed
with Five Treasures?

889
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,380
It's mentioned in the novel,

890
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,900
but does this dish

891
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,500
really exist in real life?

892
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,020
I've never heard of it.

893
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,780
Historically, this dish did exist.

894
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,740
It was made by stewing
together five different parts

895
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,860
from birds, wild animals,
mountain treasures,

896
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,620
seafood, and freshwater fish.

897
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,260
So, Five Treasures.

898
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,820
Then, mandarin ducks

899
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,860
refer to a male and a female pigeon.

900
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,260
Mr. Xu, impressive.

901
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,380
This broth is made with male
and female pigeon soup,

902
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,500
supplemented with ginseng,
Dangshen, Taizishen,

903
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,380
Chongcao flower, Maidong,

904
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,220
Tianma, Danggui, and goji berries.

905
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,620
It is simmered for four hours.

906
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,460
My goodness!

907
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,260
There was so much to a soup.

908
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,380
But

909
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,780
what are these Five Treasures?

910
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,900
As the saying goes, there may
be dragon meat up in heaven,

911
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,740
but on earth, nothing
is like good donkey meat!

912
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,460
Now "dragon meat" is the pigeon breast.

913
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,860
The second treasure

914
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,020
is the camel's paw.

915
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,380
Since ancient times,

916
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,060
it's been a staple
of imperial court banquets.

917
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,900
The third treasure is the deer sinew,

918
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,660
the fourth is the shark's lip,

919
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,100
and the fifth

920
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,340
is the pufferfish tail.

921
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,740
First prepare them.

922
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,340
Then bath them in ginger-scallion water
to remove fishiness.

923
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,460
Finally,

924
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,860
add them into the pigeon broth

925
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,740
and steam over high heat for 40 minutes.

926
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,740
Great.

927
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,740
Get me a bowl of it.

928
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,300
Sounds so incredibly complex.

929
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,140
I absolutely have to try it.

930
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,940
I can't wait!

931
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,020
Here, try it!

932
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,420
How is it?

933
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,220
It's absolutely exquisite.

934
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,660
The aroma is incredible.

935
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,180
Every piece of meat has
its unique texture and flavor.

936
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,740
The greatest delicacies in the world!

937
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,580
This broth is the real treasure!

938
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,420
I dare say

939
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,860
it's more fragrant
than Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

940
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,300
It'd be perfect for soaking up rice.

941
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,540
Qiao,

942
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,020
any cooked rice?

943
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,660
It was prepared long ago.

944
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,340
Ding Chan.

945
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,300
It was prepared long ago.

946
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,140
So fragrant.

947
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,060
So delicious.

948
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,340
Mr. Huang?

949
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,340
This suddenly reminded me of the past.

950
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,820
When I was a child, my family was poor

951
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,180
and couldn't afford meat.

952
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,140
My mom would save all the meat for us,

953
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,620
while she ate just a bowl
of soup and rice.

954
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,900
Parents always love their children.

955
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,180
Mr. Huang,

956
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,740
you've now achieved great success

957
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,380
and can repay your parents.

958
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,180
But I have no such chance.

959
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,180
My parents

960
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,940
passed away a long time ago.

961
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,460
That's truly a shame.

962
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,140
So

963
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,500
the rumors are true.

964
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,460
Mr. Huang is a devoted son.

965
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,300
Mr. Huang,

966
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,500
in this case,

967
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,980
why not bring your family here

968
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,460
as my guests someday?

969
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,980
You've reminded me.

970
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,220
I haven't spent time

971
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,700
with my family in a very long while.

972
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,540
But our relationships are complicated.

973
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,980
I'm not even sure

974
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,460
if they still acknowledge me
as their brother.

975
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,420
How about this?

976
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,700
My restaurant is opening on the 30th.

977
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,700
On that day,

978
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,940
if it's convenient for you,

979
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,140
bring them along

980
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,460
to join us.

981
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,460
Alright, I'll give it a try

982
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,020
and support Mr. Qiao.

983
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,700
Mr. Huang, just call me Qiao.

984
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,180
By the way,

985
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,140
I'd like to reserve a table as well.

986
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,420
On that day,

987
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,300
I can bring some friends

988
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,780
or family over

989
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
to taste your cooking.

990
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,220
I'm always so full

991
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,260
from the wine

992
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,500
that I almost forget

993
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,220
what it feels like to be full from rice.

994
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:29,980
Right?

995
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,380
Admit defeat?

996
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,180
I'm completely convinced.

997
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,940
Alright, I'll handle everything

998
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,740
for the upcoming events.

999
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,460
How about that?

1000
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,420
- Good. - Good.

1001
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,260
Qiao, you got time? Come with us!

1002
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:42,940
Join us.

1003
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,980
I don't think I should go.

1004
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,460
We're opening soon

1005
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,700
and there's still a ton of stuff to do.

1006
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,300
Okay.

1007
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,140
Alright then.

1008
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,780
See you on the 30th.

1009
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,700
Okay.

1010
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,160
[Zhan Jun Calling]

1011
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,460
Mr. Zhan.

1012
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,220
Mr. Zhan,

1013
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,660
I'm so sorry.

1014
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,020
