00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,140
I didn't know about it.

380
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,220
Same for me.

381
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,340
When I saw Zhi for the first time,

382
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,340
I knew he could become
the son-in-law of a rich family.

383
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:18,780
Am I right?

384
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,900
I see.

385
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,860
Because of our work,

386
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,660
I decided to keep it from the public
after we got married.

387
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,900
As his wife,

388
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,980
I trust Qiao Zhi as a person.

389
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,180
The rumors about Qiao Zhi online

390
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,140
are totally made up.

391
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,820
The lawbreakers

392
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,140
have severely damaged

393
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,060
the reputation of me, Qiao Zhi,

394
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,220
and Huaixiang Group as a whole,

395
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,540
as well as our partners.

396
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,060
We will take legal action

397
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,340
against the rumormongers.

398
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Not a single person will be spared.

399
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,340
Does anyone have any objections?

400
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,020
Not at all.

401
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,540
We as shareholders
have no second opinion either.

402
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,860
This is obviously

403
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,940
because the new dishes

404
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,140
of Huaixiang earlier

405
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,540
have been too popular.

406
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,420
Some people are jealous,

407
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,940
and they played some tricks
behind the scenes.

408
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,980
I think

409
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,860
someone is so desperate

410
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,180
to ruin Huaixiang.

411
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,460
So now, I announce

412
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,180
that Qiao Zhi
is reinstated for the competition.

413
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,300
The company will not bend any rules

414
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
for anyone, no matter who they are.

415
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,940
Qiao Zhi is the same as everyone else.

416
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
It will be a fair competition,

417
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,060
and let's see who's better.

418
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,340
The competition starts now.

419
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,100

423
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,540
Of course.

424
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,260
Time for our contestants
to take the stage.

425
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,460
The competition starts now.

426
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,220

428

[Tao Ruxue. Marriage Certificate]

is married to Ms. Tao?

Go ahead.

435
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,460

and Shengtang Entertainment.

437
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,420
Don't worry.

You know it.

442

Spreading rumor won't get you into jail.

443

Mr. Zhan will pay for it.

444
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,380

the way you turned things around
was awesome.

452
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,780

Hi, Ms. Tao.

Why are you all here?

We are here to support Zhi.

461
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,660
That's right.

462
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,020
Is Qiao Zhi's hand okay?

463
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,180
He said it was fine.

464
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,140
We should trust him.

465
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,100
If I'm right,

467
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,220

it's going to ruin everything.

Is Master that good?

Why I didn't know about it?

489
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,260

Mr. Zheng,

492
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,460
is that Yanyue cutting technique?

493
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,540
That's right.

494
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,380
It's Yanyue cutting technique.

495
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,140
It is

496
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,260
the best of straight cutting technique.

497
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,860
It requires constant cutting,

498
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,460
the sound of which

499
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,260
is with clear tempo and rhythm.

500
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I can tell

501
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,900
that he has mastered it.

502
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,260
Qiao Zhi does have some skills.

503
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,820
The winter melon swells as it is heated,

504
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,700
and its plant mucilage

505
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,460
and xyloglucan

506
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,780
transform into a semi-gelatinous form.

507
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,260
The slices turn from translucent

508
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,580
to greenish jade,

509
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,420
giving off a clean,

510
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,260
characteristic fragrance
of winter melon.

511
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,020
He took one third teaspoon

512
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,020
of fine salt

513
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,860
and carefully sprinkled it

514
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,820
to the winter melon

515
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,140
with his right hand

516
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,020
while stirring the melon
with his left hand,

517
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,620
so that the juice from the melon

518
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,940
is gradually getting solidified.

519
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,980
This is smart.

520
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,820
It's good, right?

521
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,980
You should try it for me.

522
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,700
The texture of the winter melon
remains tender,

523
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,620
soft but not overcooked.

524
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,260
I didn't expect

525
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,940
that Qiao Zhi can have
such a perfect control

526
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,540
over the heat and timing

527
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,100
while cooking for two dishes
at the same time.

528
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,100
Look.

529
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,660
Mr. Zheng Ze is smiling.

530
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,420
It means

531
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,820
that his dish

532
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,900
is good indeed.

533
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,580
This guy got some skills.

534
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,540
This guy?

535
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,900
Watch your mouth.

536
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,740
He's the son-in-law of the Tao family.

537
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,660
You are right.

538
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,140
Bao.

539
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,220
There is a story

540
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,300
behind the braised boneless fish head

541
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,820
by Qiao Zhi.

542
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,220
What's the story?

543
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,900
Tell us.

544
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,700
You don't know it?

545
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,740
Listen carefully.

546
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,220
It's said that there was a rich man
by the end of the Qing dynasty.

547
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,340
He was very mean to his workers,

548
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,060
a penny pincher, let's say.

549
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,060
To save money and time,

550
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,900
he asked his chef
to cook for the workers

551
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,540
with the leftover fish heads
from the banquet.

552
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,260
He also asked the chef in particular

553
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,380
to pick out the bones
from the fish head.

554
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,180
Naturally, the chef was very mad.

555
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,140
He added all kinds of accompaniments

556
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,780
such as

557
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,700
golden needle mushroom and black fungus

558
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,540
into the fish head,
together with a lot of chicken broth

559
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,780
and

560
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,540
a plate of shredded chicken

561
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,980
in the pot.

562
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,100
In a few moments,

563
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,620
the aroma fills the air,

564
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,540
and the flavor is exceptionally fresh.

565
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,780
The workers

566
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,540
immediately pick up the cutlery.

567

00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,420
than the day the Diet Meal was out.

760
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,340
With the current popularity,

761
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,780
both the sales and the profit

762
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,340
will greatly increase.

763
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,860
However,

764
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,100
there are some rumors

765
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,820
about Qiao Zhi
within the company lately.

766
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:39,900
What do they say?

767
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,020
It's said that he could only win

768
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,580
because

769
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,220
he is your son-in-law,

770
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,580
and that the business

771
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,100
is doing well because we were

772
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,780
paying a lot for advertisement.

773
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,940
The reputation will prove everything.

774
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Isn't Huaixiang Restaurant climbing

775
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,820
on Tianxiang Food Rankings?

776
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,660
That's right.

777
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,860
And Qiao Zhi

778
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,220
is getting more and more followers

779
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,300
on Tianxiang Food Rankings, too.

780
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,180
Mr. Song, you are also here.

781
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,900
You can have a chat.

782
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,700
I should get back to work.

783
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,260
Alright.

784
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,940
What's the meal today?

785
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,180
Mom,

786
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,700
do you know

787
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,820
what your daughter did this time?

788
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,700
Let's not talk about her post online.

789
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,340
She announced it
in front of all the staff,

790
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,060
which made me
look like a crowned queen.

791
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,060
Do you know how many people
want to be this queen?

792
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,180
It sounds like you are

793
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,100
not happy about it.

794
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,660
That's not true.

795
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,740
Here you go. It's hot.

796
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,260
I'm just worried about her.

797
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,340
She is a girl,

798
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,180
and she is

799
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,220
pushing herself forward for me.

800
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,300
A girl?

801
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,260
She is the Acting CEO
of Huaixiang Group now.

802
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,860
You are right.

803
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,180
Alright.

804
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,220
Let's get down to business.

805
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,980
King of Chefs Championship
is around the corner.

806
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,220
This is different
from the internal competition.

807
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,620
There is a lot behind it.

808
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,380
Do you think Zhan Jun won two times

809
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,700
because of his skill?

810
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,100
I checked the records
of the previous years.

811
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,140
All the chefs who competed with him

812
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:15,940
ended up

813
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,660
working for Baiwei Group.

814
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,580
So what's your plan?

815
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,220
Baiwei Group

816
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,500
is a business owned by Zhan Jun.

817
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,940
Mr. Biao is also a major shareholder
of Baiwei Group.

818
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,340
He's taking a back seat now,

819
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,660
but he still has a reputation
among the shareholders.

820
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,460
Did you use

821
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,340
the bad reviews
of Canteen and Tianxiang Rankings

822
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,340
to get his attentions
on purpose earlier?

823
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,140
I did try to get his attention
on purpose,

824
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,340
but after seeing him,

825
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,980
I found out that he was sincere

826
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,860
about my grandfather.

827
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,060
That's why

828
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,700
I'm willing to have him

829
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,780
as my sworn grandfather.

830
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,780
Baiwei Group

831
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,460
has a lot of hidden shareholders.

832
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,820
A lot of personal interests
are involved.

833
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,860
Plus,

834
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,660
Mr. Biao is already retired.

835
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,900
Do you think

836
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,140
he will stir things up

837
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,300
for you?

838
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,860
He will.

839
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,780
He uses most of his fortune

840
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,980
for charity.

841
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,900
I can see

842
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,020
that he is still

843
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,700
feeling bad for my grandfather.

844
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:24,860
Alright.

845
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,940
I will find a good timing
for you to meet.

846
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,740
There's one more good news.

847
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,220
Eight Great Restaurants have agreed

848
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,580
to the joint listing.

849
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,180
Really?

850
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,660
It's great news.

851
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,900
Now it makes sense.

852
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,340
What?

853
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,380
Zhan Jun

854
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,180
is changing his plan and coming back.

855
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,700
He

856
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,220
must have heard some news, too.

857
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,180
Mr. Zhan,

858
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,780
are you looking for me?

859
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,220
Qiao Zhi is going further and further.

860
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,060
Is there a way to take him down?

861
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,140
I'm so confused.

862
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,740
What did he do?

863
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,180
Did he drug these girls or something?

864
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,580
Is there a man called Bao Tong
working for him?

865
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,220
That's right.

866
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,500
He used to be

867
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,580
a junior chef of Huaixiang Group.

868
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,420
Find a way to get him on our side.

869
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,060
As long as he can work for us,

870
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,460
we can get him money or girls,

871
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,620
whatever he wants.

872
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,300
Money can solve everything.

873
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,140
Dad,

874
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,620
why are you back?

875
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,380
Kun.

876
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,300
Look at what happened

877
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,300
to the company when I'm away!

878
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,660
And you, Hao!

879
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,700
I asked you to keep an eye on him.

880
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,820
Is this how you do your job?

881
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,620
How could you let him
do all these stupid things?

882
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,580
The business of pre-made food nosedived,

883
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,180
and now the Eight Great Restaurants
are having a joint listing.

884
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,300
What's going on with the merger?

885
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,580
You can't even get the girl.

886
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,060
What can you actually do?

887
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,140
I haven't lost!

888
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,180
I can't possibly

889
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,260
let Qiao Zhi get into the first around

890
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,660
of the King of Chefs Championship.

891
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,460
I will let him lose,

892
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,060
and I ruin him completely.

893
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,180
None of the Eight Great Restaurants

894
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,980
will give him a second glance!

895
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,100
How dare you talk back!

896
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,220
Do you like to hit me?

897
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,660
Go ahead!

898
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,180
Whose car is this?

899
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,980
A 3.0T V6 engine,

900
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,180
with a highest HP of 350.

901
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,820
The maximum torque is 500 Nm,

902
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,820
and it accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h
in 4.8 seconds. It's a good car.

903
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,500
Not bad, Mr. Qiao.

904
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,260
You usually ride a bike.

905
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,820
Didn't know you were such a car guy.

906
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,180
Everyone's got a hobby.

907
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,340
Who parked
right in front of the entrance?

908
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,340
Some drivers have no manners.

909
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,520
[Bao Tong]

910
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,700
