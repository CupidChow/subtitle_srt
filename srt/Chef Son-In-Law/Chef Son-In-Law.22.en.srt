The set of knives Wu Linfeng uses

261
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,020
is very well-known in Sichuan cuisine.

262
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,620
It's called Dragon Knives.

263
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,740
It's said

264
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,780
that Cao Lin,
the great master of Sichuan cuisine,

265
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,260
asked a famous blade smith

266
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,420
to forge them meticulously.

267
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,820
Liu Da, the executive chef
of Baiwei Group,

268
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,020
is the last disciple of Cao Lin

is then passed down to Liu Da.

Now, Liu Da

273
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,460
is willing to let Wu Linfeng

his trust and expectation
for Wu Linfeng.

Is that...

278
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,500
What's wrong?

279
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,460
Does Qiao Zhi's knives
also have a story?

280
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,580
It seems

281
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,980
ordinary.

282
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,140
It can't be wrong.

283
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,980
I've only seen it once

284
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,020
at Mr. Biao's place.

The contestants are now
choosing their ingredients.

Every part of a cattle is valuable.

300
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,740
The finest one is the tenderloin,

301
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,500
the most tender cut in beef.

302
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,140
It's perfect for pan-searing,
frying, stir-frying, or as steak.

303
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,500
In Western cuisine,

304
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,220
it's ideal for

305
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,340
filet mignon and teppanyaki.

306
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,900

by both young and old.

308
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,460
Next, cuts like chuck and brisket

309
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,860
are also excellent choices.

310
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,580
Authentic premium quality.

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,500
Top-grade marbled beef from Dachang.

- Now...
- Cheers.

313
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,620
Only one contestant, Qiao Zhi,
remains here now.

314
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,140
He is carefully
selecting his ingredients.

315
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,380
What will he choose?

316
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,620
Let's wait and see.

317
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,700
He picks up

318
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,540
a massive back bone ribs.

319
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,420
What dish could he possibly create

320
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,780
with this spine bone?

321
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,700
We're very curious.

322
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,020
What is Qiao Zhi doing?

323
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,260
Why is he choosing the back bone?

324
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,580
Let him do it.

325
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,420
It will be a disaster.

326
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,300
Cut of back bone ribs
is the worst on the cow.

327
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
It's the lowest-grade ingredient,

328
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,260
inherently inferior.

329
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,260
Most people

330
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,860
would toss it away as trash.

331
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,700
I now declare

332
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,780
the competition officially begins.

333
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,380
The dark horse, Liu Shuo,

334
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,540
completed a fragrant dish,

335
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,580
Shredded Beef with Spices,

336
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,540
in just over ten minutes.

337
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,900
It is incredibly quick.

338
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,740
That's so fast.

339
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,860
Speed doesn't matter.

340
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,900
The first dish

341
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,980
is Liu Shuo's.

342
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,460
The meat is thin yet intact.

343
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,100
This chef's knife skills

344
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,340
and control over heat

345
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,380
are astonishing.

346
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:29,980
Moreover,

347
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,140
the beef unexpectedly carried

348
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,420
a hint of osmanthus honey.

349
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,380
It does taste like osmanthus honey,

350
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,300
adding rich layers

351
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,380
and textural complexity.

352
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,140
It not only

353
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,140
radiates
the signature sipcy and numbing aroma

354
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,460
of Sichuan dishes,

355
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,420
but also

356
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,220
offers more chewiness than anticipated.

357
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,180
Compared to the first bite,

358
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,100
the flavor is more intense,
(Watch on www.kisskh.la to support Admin)

359
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,060
tingling the taste buds.

360
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,780
I know.

361
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,980
It's the capsaicin
from Sichuan peppercorns,

362
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,260
a unique taste sensation.

363
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,380
The tongue tip

364
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,300
undergoes electromagnetic field effects

365
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,300
and vibrates

366
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,380
at an average frequency
of fifty times per second.

367
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,260
It causes a stinging,

368
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,780
burning sensation

369
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,020
with a buzzing feeling.

370
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,740
It's fascinating.

371
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,060
I'm curious

372
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,620
whose creation this is.

373
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,340
Replacing
the traditional sun-drying process

374
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,100
with fire-roasting.

375
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,700
Otherwise,

376
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,780
sun-drying

377
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,300
would take another four or five days.

378
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,900
This contestant

379
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:20,980
is truly

380
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,020
a genius.

381
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,780
Alright.

382
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,820
Let's begin scoring.

383
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,820
Sure.

384
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
[Please rate the dish from Liu Shuo]

385
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,660
This is by Wu Linfeng.

386
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,180
This is

387
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,860
disappointing.

388
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,740
Let's score.

389
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,820
Wu Linfeng

390
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,180
unexpectedly failed?

391
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,220
Congratulations, Mr. Zhan.

392
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,100
Wu Linfeng,

393
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,820
the champion contestant,

394
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,940
has been unexpectedly eliminated.

395
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,980
You're about
to pocket over a hundred million.

396
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,100
It's not worth mentioning.

397
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,700
What's Qiao Zhi

398
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,900
dawdling about?

399
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,780
The beef shank he chose

400
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,620
has dragged down
the entire competition's standards.

401
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,220
He is pandering for attention,

402
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,180
trying to take a different path
to win over the judges.

403
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,900
He's nothing but a clown.

404
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,260
Attention. All contestants,

405
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,940
five minutes left
until the deadline of the first course.

406
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,580
What on earth is Qiao Zhi doing?

407
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,540
Master seems to be carving a flower...

408
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,300
Or not.

409
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,860
Flowers?

410
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,900
Look, there are two claws.

411
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,340
Is it...

412
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,900
He is carving a dragon.

413
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,740
Ladies and gentlemen,

414
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,780
Qiao Zhi has used
the fragments of the back bone

415
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,340
to assemble the skeleton of a dragon.

416
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,300
Amazing!

417
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,660
It really is a dragon,

418
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,980
the totem of Chinese civilization.

419
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,020
Master is incredible.

420
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,820
I know him.

421
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,060
This tactic
of feigning failure before triumph

422
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,540
is executed to perfection by him.

423
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,420
Oh my god, this is a Chinese dragon!

424
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,740
This is unbelievable.

425
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,660
What the heck?

426
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,220
Are you blind?

427
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,940
Look.

428
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,460
It's a dragon.

429
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,660
Can't you see me?

430
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Dragon? I'm not blind.

431
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,500
Of course I saw it.

432
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,060
Is this something you can touch?

433
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,420
Well...

434
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,220
It looks pretty good.

435
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,180
It's just a dragon.

436
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,300
All show and no substance.

437
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,460
Looks good but tastes like crap.

438
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,300
This dish is Qiao Zhi's.

439
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,420
No one is to shine lights on him.

440
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,460
Alright.

441
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,460
Mr. Francis,

442
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,860
is it really that good?

443
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,140
It's tender,

444
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,460
melting in your mouth.

445
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,900
It doesn't vanish immediately,

446
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,660
but dissolves on your tongue.

447
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,020
Qiao Zhi

448
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,780
destroyed my taste buds

449
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,740
with his delicacy last time.

450
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,340
This time,

451
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,780
he used it

452
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,620
to dive deep into my cells.

453
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,020
No way.

454
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,180
I can't be conquered like this.

455
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,220
After all,

456
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,060
I got paid.

457
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,060
Alright.

458
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,460
Let's score it.

459
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,300
Not a full mark for this?

460
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,780
Is there some shady deal going on?

461
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,900
Or are the judges' hands broken?

462
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,620
Exactly!

463
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,500
It should definitely get full lights!

464
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm so angry.

465
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,380
Now, in order of completion,

466
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,420
we'll announce the scores
for the first dish.

467
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,900
Liu Shuo's

468
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Shredded Beef with Spices
gets 15 lights.

469
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,220
Deng Daxian's

470
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,100
Golden Shredded Beef gets 15 lights.

471
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,140
Shi He's Citrus Beef

472
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,300
gets 14 lights.

473
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,580
Wu Linfeng's

474
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,820
West Lake Beef Soup gets three.

475
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,060
Ge Yu's
Stir-fried Beef with Dried Vegetables

476
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,140
gets ten.

477
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,780
Wang Ruiwen's

478
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,020
Chaoshan Beef Hot Pot gets eight.

479
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,220
Lin Jie's

480
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,060
Beef with tofu gets 12 lights.

481
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,140
Qiao Zhi's

482
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,860
Roaring Dragon gets 14 lights.

483
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,820
The favorite to win, Wu Linfeng,

484
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,180
has been unexpectedly eliminated.

485
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,620
Congratulations to Liu Shuo,

486
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,500
Deng Daxian, Shi He, and Qiao Zhi.

487
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,140
You are in the second knock-out round.

488
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,860
Eliminated contestants,
please exit in order.

489
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,180
Jin Chengwei,
what the heck are you scared of?

490
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,780
Don't you want the money anymore?

491
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,820
The competition is exciting, isn't it?

492
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,420
That's right, Master.

493
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,740
What are you looking for?

494
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,260
No...

495
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,460
Nothing.

496
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,660
Focus.

497
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,460
I now announce

498
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,580
the start of the second round
of the knockout stage.

499
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,500
Beef

500
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,340
and foie gras

501
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,220
are both common ingredients
in Western cuisine.

502
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,260
Europeans rank foie gras
alongside caviar and truffles

503
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,340
as the world's
three greatest delicacies.

504
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,060
It seems like this competition

505
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,180
does have a hidden agenda.

506
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,660
Qiao Zhi's Roaring Dragon

507
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,980
looked pretty impressive.

508
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,900
This is truly

509
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,780
the pupil surpassing the master.

510
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,860
Sihai can finally

511
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,780
rest in peace.

512
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,100
Whether the pupil
or the master is better

513
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
is still unknown.

514
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,260
Wait,

515
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,060
how could Qiao Zhi do it so fast?

516
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,620
No matter how exquisite foie gras is,
it will get cloying.

517
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,060
The second bite still holds promise,

518
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,260
but by the third and fourth bites,

519
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,820
the sense of anticipation and delight

520
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,740
drops steadily.

521
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,660
I didn't know
Qiao Zhi could be so cunning.

522
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,100
The first one is from Qiao Zhi.

523
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,220
No light for him.

524
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,380
Did you hear me?

525
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,500
This foie gras

526
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,580
possesses a richness akin to fat,

527
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,980
yet intertwined with hints of sweet and sour,

528
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,060
filling the mouth.

529
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,860
The crispy outer layer

530
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,940
blends with a trace of eggplant.

531
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,180
The complex texture

532
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,140
not only complements
the foie gras's essence,

533
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,100
but also offers something refreshing,
like lemon or apple,

534
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,500
cutting through the richness.

535
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,540
The fragrance

536
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,860
and smooth texture ferment together,

537
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,660
producing a lingering, velvety sensation

538
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,940
blended with supreme fragrance.

539
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,500
It transports me

540
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,060
to the springtime
of my French farmstead at home.

541
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,220
This foie gras is truly exquisite.

542
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,140
In terms of speed,

543
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,740
Liu Shuo is undoubtedly
better than Qiao Zhi.

544
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,740
Qiao Zhi worked so slowly
in the first round.

545
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,740
His strategy

546
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,860
must be playing it safe.

547
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,740
Therefore, even though this dish

548
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,100
is not from Liu Shuo,

549
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,020
it is certainly not from Qiao Zhi.

550
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,660
This

551
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,140
should be Liu Shuo's dish.

552
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,140
What's happening?

553
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,420
Jin Chengwei, are you out of your mind?

554
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,580
What are you doing?

555
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,380
Did you take my money?

556
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,540
Or did you take Qiao Zhi's money?

557
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,460
Answer me!

558
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,020
Mr. Zhan,

559
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,740
did Jin Chengwei betray us?

560
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,220
The answer is not important.

561
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,500
[Please rate the dish from Qiao Zhi]
Qiao Zhi has full lights now! See?

562
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,540
Ladies and gentlemen,

563
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
this is the result of the second round.

564
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,260
Congratulations
to Qiao Zhi and Liu Shuo

565
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,540
for advancing to the final round
with a perfect score of fifteen lights.

566
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,860
Unfortunately, Deng Da and Shi He

567
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,300
are leaving the competition.

568
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,580
Please allow our contestants

569
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,740
a brief moment to rest.

570
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,860
Stay tuned, everyone.

571
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,580
We will be back shortly!

572
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,340
Qiao Zhi is hiding so well.

573
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,940
If this goes on,

574
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,620
Liu Shuo can hardly win.

575
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,660
Master,

576
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,860
I ate too many different things.

577
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
My stomach feels a bit off.

578
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,140
I need to use the restroom.

579
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,820
Go ahead.

580
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,500
Come on, pick up.

581
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:34,940
Hello?

582
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:35,780
Hey,

583
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,740
it's me, Jin Chengwei.

584
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,100
What on earth are you doing?

585
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,780
My earpiece fell out.

586
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,780
Tell me immediately

587
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,300
what Liu Shuo's final dish is.

588
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,580
Black Mountain Moonlight,

589
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:44,900
alright?

590
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,380
Shining Moonlight.

591
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,980
Black Mountain Shining Moonlight!

592
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,060
Alright. Got it.

593
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,020
Let me give you a massage.

594
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,860
Did you use this arm?

595
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,740
It's okay.

596
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,300
You can do it.

597
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,780
The last round is about to begin.

598
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,380
Contestants, please get ready.

599
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,260
No way.

600
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,180
Mr. Zhan Junior
has arranged it properly.

601
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,340
Qian Zhi shouldn't have been able
to get in.

602
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,660
Where did things go wrong?

603
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,220
You don't seriously think

604
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,900
Mr. Zhan wants you to win, do you?

605
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,860
What do you mean?

606
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,340
Let me tell you.

607
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,780
Mr. Zhan

608
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,660
is my shareholder.

609
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,660
Don't tell it to anyone else.

610
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,940
Shareholder?

611
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,820
The Zhan family does hold shares
in Huaixiang Group.

612
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,660
A new publicly traded corporation

613
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,420
can make a fortune.

614
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,780
Now, it's the thrilling moment.

615
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,100
The ingredient
for the third dish will be

616
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,420
the black truffle,
known as the diamond of mushrooms.

617
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,500
Please welcome both contestants
to the stage.

618
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,580
Please welcome Liu Shuo to the stage.

619
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,340
Liu Shuo?

620
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,100
Calm down.

621
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,540
I must calm down.

622
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,340
I'm the most talented

623
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,500
and hard working young chef

624
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,740
at Baiwei Group.

625
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,980
I can win it.

626
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,780
My goal is to challenge King of Chefs
and make my name known.

627
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,660
Jin Chengwei is so stupid!

628
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,660
Mr. Zhan, don't worry.

629
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,180
We have
Black Mountain Shining Moonlight.

630
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,060
This dish of Liu Shuo has been guided

631
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,020
by the National Master Liu Da.

632
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,180
It is inspired

633
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,620
by the King of Broth, the clear broth
in Sichuan cuisine,

634
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,740
Moon Unveiling.

635
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,780
Plus, he boldly

636
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,820
substituted

637
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,940
the precious mountain delicacy,
bamboo mushroom, with black truffle.

638
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,900
For both flavor and creativity,

639
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,660
it's the pinnacle.

640
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,380
It's bound to get a perfect score.

641
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,220
So,

642
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,180
don't worry.

643
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,300
Let's keep watching.

644
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,220
Is he making

645
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,980
Truffle Crab Cups?

646
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,020
There is indeed
a well-known dish in Huaiyang cuisine

647
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,340
called Snow Crab Cups.

648
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,540
Obviously,

649
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,340
Qiao Zhi is innovating this dish

650
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,340
and turns the Snow into black truffles.

651
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,700
The difficulty of this dish

652
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,620
lies in seasoning
the crab roe and crab hearts.

653
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,700
Innovating?

654
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,580
He will mess it up!

655
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,820
What is he doing?

656
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,220
What is he doing?

657
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,300
How could he be so stupid?

658
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,660
This is so stupid!

659
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,660
How could he make such a basic mistake?

660
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,380
It's over.

661
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,380
It's over.

662
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,780
A chef is cutting his hand

663
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,340
and bleeding in public.

664
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,580
Even the King of Broth
has no chance now.

665
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:01,980
Idiot.

666
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,020
Absolutely idiot!

667
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,860
Hao,

668
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,220
contact the two actuaries

669
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,540
immediately.

670
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Ask if I can withdraw

671
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,380
my current funds.

672
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:10,660
Hurry.

673
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:10,980
Got it.

674
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,460
Got it.

675
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,700
Hello?

676
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,380
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

677
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,260
No answer.

678
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,180
Call again!

679
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,540
Alright.

680
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,220
Congratulations to Qiao Zhi,
who got the full score of 15 lights

681
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,860
and won first place
in this King of Chefs Championship.

682
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,220
He has also earned

683
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,180
the chance to challenge Zhan Jun,
the current King of Chefs.

684
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,220
Master can finally challenge
the King of Chefs!

685
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,740
- Next, let's welcome...
- Stop calling.

686
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,900
The chairman of the jury,

687
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,420
Mr. Xu Kang'an,
and the previous King of Chefs champion,

688
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,660
Mr. Zhan Jun,

689
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,940
to hand the award
to this year's champion, Qiao Zhi!

690
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,060
Congratulations!

691
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,180
I guess Qiao Sihai's work
can finally be carried on.

692
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,700
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

693
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,720
[Champion]

694
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,420
Thank you,

695
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,220
King of Chefs.

696
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,300
Congratulations to Qiao Zhi

697
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,380
on winning the chance to challenge
the reigning King of Chefs, Zhan Jun.

698
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,780
Will Qiao Zhi be crowned
the new King of Chefs,

699
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,180
or will Zhan Jun
successfully defend his title?

700
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,060
Stay tuned

701
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,700
for the Showdown for King of Chefs.

702
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:56,200
[Ultimate Showdown]

703
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,020
Why are you here?

704
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,940
Congratulations
on winning the championship.

705
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,700
I thought you were busy with work?

706
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,540
Work is nothing compared to you.

707
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,020
See?

708
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,700
My wife cares about me a lot.

709
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,380
But, I mean,

710
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,900
shouldn't you have brought
a gift or something?

711
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,580
I can give you a hug.

712
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,900
Just a one?

713
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,660
Do you want it or not?

714
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,540
Fine, but...

715
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,100
Make it last.

716
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,220
Come here.

717
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,660
Congratulations.

718
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,580
Oh my god.

719
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,980
We're hugging like this

720
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,340
with all these people watching.

721
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,100
It's fine.

722
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,980
They know we are married.

723
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,900
What's wrong?

724
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,940
Why are you looking at me?

725
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,500
We are three,
and you two are having a hug.

726
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,620
What can I do?

727
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,180
We are going to celebrate tonight.

728
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,060
You...

729
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,100
You want to be lovey-dovey
in front of me?

730
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,300
No way!

731
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,020
I have plans too.

732
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,620
Oh my god.

733
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,780
Bye.

734
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,100
Let's go. Ignore him.

735
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,980
Let's go.

736
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:26,980
Mr. Zhan,

737
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,180
I'm sorry.

738
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,660
It's okay.

739
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,180
Sorry?

740
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,740
I lost four hundred million!

741
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,660
Mr. Biao.

742
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,940
That old man

743
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,980
is stabbing me in the back now.

744
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,100
He asked for it.

745
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,300
Hello?

746
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,620
Pass it to Shikun.

747
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,300
Yes, Mr. Zhan.

748
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,220
It's your father.

749
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:15,820
Dad,

750
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,220
it was Mr. Biao.

751
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,420
Don't make another mistake,

752
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,300

Got it.

755
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,860
I'd rather die

756
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,500

Hi, Mr. Zhan Junior.

761
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:39,980
Alright. Got it.

762
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,900

Hello, Ma'am.

The total is 830.

Miss, let me pay.

770
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
Didn't you say I'd treat?

771
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,380
You came all this way.
How could I let you pay?

772
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,900
Of course I'm treating.

773
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,660
Do we really need to be so precise?

774
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,380
You're the one
who said we should be independent.

775
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,780
Fine.

776
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,780
It's up to you.

777
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,380
Scan whichever code you want.

778
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,820
What? Are you looking down on me?

779
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,860
Thank you.

780
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,100
What does this mean?

781
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,540
Do I look like someone
who can't afford it?

782
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,580
Are you upset now?

783
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,740
My dignity as a man

784
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,980
has been insulted.

785
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,660
I traveled all this way
to dine with you,

786
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,820
yet you are still not satisfied?

787
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,460
If you put it that way,

788
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,140
I...

789
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,660
I am.

790
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,100
You know why the waitress scanned mine?

791
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:56,860
I know.

792
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,220
You must have said something to her

793
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,580
on your way to touch up your makeup.

794
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,620
Can't you stop assuming
everyone's so scheming?

795
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,460
She's sharp.

796
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,300
She saw through our relationship.

797
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,660
She heard I called you my wife?

798
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,380
If we were just dating,

799
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,220
you'd definitely
be paying for this meal.

800
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,860
But since we're married,

801
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,940
from her perspective,

802
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,140
she was taking care of your dignity.

803
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,260
Don't all married men's money
end up in their wives' hands?

804
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,980
You see?

805
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,060
The status of married men

806
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,380
is precarious.

807
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,700
This isn't individual.

808
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,140
It's a widespread social phenomenon now!

809
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,820
Alright.

810
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,620
Don't be upset.

811
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,940
I was not upset.

Will Zhan Jun
successfully defend his title,

820

be crowned the new King?

Mr. Qiao,

850
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,700
are you

851
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,380
overestimating yourself?

852
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,100
