I haven't had the chance
to take out my anger on you,

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,460
and now you are coming at me.

Your sister...

41
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,620
Your sister made an investment.

42
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,380
That's the biggest help, isn't it?

43
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,540
It's okay. Let's go home.

44
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,860

Hey.

I have something to discuss with him.

57
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,140
Not yet. I have more to say!

58

Almost 300,000.

you're in charge of.

66

to spy on us?

He found it at the door of Mom's ward

80
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,820

You didn't tell me.

106
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,860

He wants to kick me out of the game.

110
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,420
Now he's using Canteen
to hold it against me.

111
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,540
I see.

112
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,140
Don't worry,

113
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,460

I've arranged to meet with the producer
of a food show

123
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,820
You'd better put on a good performance.

124

188
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,740
Looking at it now,

189
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
I wonder what the point of life is.

190
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,380
You can never earn all the money.

191
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,420
Making enough is all you need.

192
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,300
Live in the moment.

193
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,420
To do what I love with whom I care for.

194
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,820
That's my biggest wish.

195
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,900
Qiao Zhi,

196
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,580
I've been thinking these past few days.

197
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,260
I'm so lucky to have met you.

198
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,140
I feel the same way.

199
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,380
Never expected to find
such an outstanding partner.

200
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,300
Qiao Zhi,

201
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,220
there's something

202
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,060
I've always wanted to ask you.

203
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,220
Do you,

204
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,020
you...

205
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,340
currently...

206
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,700
have

207
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,300
a

208
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,780
girl…

209
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,580
girl...

210
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,700
A girl apprentice?

211
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,620
Yes!

212
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,220
A girl apprentice!

213
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,100
That's it.

214
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,140
Are you in such a hurry

215
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,660
to become Zhou Chong's junior?

216
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,260
I don't mean that.

217
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,300
I refuse.

218
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,660
Ding Chan,

219
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,700
I sometimes speak

220
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
my mind directly.

221
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,900
Please don't take it to heart.

222
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,740
Having observed you for a period,

223
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,340
I have to say you have no talent
for cooking.

224
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,780
This direct?

225
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,780
I really have no talent?

226
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,500
But you have a skill

227
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,180
that has impressed me.

228
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,060
What skill?

229
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,340
Tell me.

230
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,300
What was the bill
for the most expensive table on the 21st?

231
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,540
2,360 yuan.

232
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,260
What did they order?

233
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,060
That group of guests was special.

234
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,660
They didn't have a reservation,

235
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,500
but they ordered many expensive dishes.

236
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,740
I observed them.

237
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,660
The guest who paid had Gucci glasses,

238
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,020
worth over 4,000 yuan,

239
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,620
Balenciaga shoes,

240
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,100
and a Hermès hoodie.

241
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,380
Do you know
what the most outrageous thing was?

242
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,820
He was wearing
a Rolex Yacht-Master watch

243
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,420
worth over 200,000 yuan!

244
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:32,940
No.

245
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,700
I was asking

246
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,420
what dishes they ordered.

247
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,180
Ah, right!

248
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,220
You mean the food.

249
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,860
They ordered
the Sturgeon Dragon Banquet,

250
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,820
Glazed Fish Bones,

251
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,580
Chicken Marrow Bamboo Shoots,

252
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,740
and Crab Meatballs.

253
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,340
The four dishes are 588 yuan each.

254
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,180
With drinks and rice included,

255
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,580
the total came to 2,360 yuan.

256
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,500
Another question.

257
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,980
What was the best-selling dish

258
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,540
on the second day of our opening?

259
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,300
Mapo Tofu!

260
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,220
How many servings were sold?

261
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,980
127.

262
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,900
You really are...

263
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,700
What?

264
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,740
You're sensitive to numbers, aren't you?

265
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,500
I majored in finance and accounting.

266
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,940
Isn't that only natural?

267
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,820
No.

268
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,500
I have an idea.

269
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,180
I wonder

270
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,220
if you would agree to it.

271
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:11,740
Go on.

272
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,340
I want to put all my money

273
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,220
in your care.

274
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,860
But

275
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,940
how can I do that?

276
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,660
I'm being serious.

277
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,620
Every single expense of Canteen

278
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,540
will be in your charge.

279
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,580
You manage everything clearly.

280
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,140
You're not joking,

281
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,900
are you?

282
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,820
I may have many things,

283
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,580
but I lack a sense of humor.

284
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,140
So, do you agree?

285
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,220
Since you trust me so much,

286
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,700
of course I'm willing to.

287
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,460
Alright. Come on.

288
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,900
Minister of Finance!

289
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,380
What is it?

290
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,260
Here.

291
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,940
I have to do my homework even here?

292
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,980
No.

293
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,620
I'm giving you a new task.

294
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,740
Every day,

295
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,940
record the feelings and thoughts

296
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,020
of our staff and customers.

297
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,420
One for the staff,

298
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,860
and the other for the customers.

299
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,500
Why should I?

300
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,820
Isn't this a waste of time?

301
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,820
If I hadn't promised your dad.

302
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,020
I wouldn't have bothered with you.

303
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,460
Then teach me something real.

304
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,780
I'm teaching you.

305
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,740
If you do this well,

306
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,860
it'll benefit you for a lifetime.

307
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,820
Am I really your apprentice?

308
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,900
I think I'm more like your secretary.

309
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,660
Alright then.

310
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,620
Zhou Chong,

311
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,700
tell me.

312
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,220
What do you think

313
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,060
is most important

314
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,900
to a restaurant

315
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,060
or a company?

316
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,540
The food you make.

317
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,420
Who would eat the food?

318
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,380
The customers, right?

319
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,980
Your family is in real estate.

320
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,060
Ask your dad

321
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,540
how many financial and human resources

322
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,220
they invest in market research.

323
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,900
That's true.

324
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,700
They seem to outsource that

325
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,980
to other companies.

326
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,860
So,

327
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,260
even if my cooking skills are the best,

328
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,540
and the food I make is delicious,

329
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,860
I still need to figure out customers'
thoughts and feelings.

330
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,220
I don't have the energy for this.

331
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,540
So you'll handle

332
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,900
this important task.

333
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,300
Constantly record
the feelings and thoughts

334
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,140
of our customers.

335
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,700
From ordering to waiting in line,

336
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,020
and from dining to checkout.

337
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,060
Take note of everything clearly.

338
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,180
Report to me promptly

339
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,380
which parts they are satisfied with,

340
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,180
and which parts they are not.

341
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,460
But

342
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,740
it's impossible

343
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,100
to please all the customers.

344
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,260
That's just your excuse.

345
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,580
Great service is something

346
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,700
everyone can appreciate.

347
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,780
And delicious food?

348
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,820
Well, absolutely everyone

349
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,140
will love it!

350
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,100
But

351
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,140
why should I

352
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,020
record the employees'…

353
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,380
I get it now!

354
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
They face the customers directly.

355
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,340
Not bad!

356
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,860
Whether it's a company

357
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,620
or real estate,

358
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,700
they're pretty much alike.

359
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,380
To understand the market and your users,

360
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,300
and make good use of your employees.

361
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,780
This is what management is all about.

362
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,820
In the future,

363
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,460
whether you're managing the Canteen

364
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,700
or taking over your father's business,

365
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,180
you'll be able to stand
on your own two feet.

366
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,940
Understand.

367
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,500
It's break time now.

368
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,340
I'm going to go around

369
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,500
and ask our neighbors.

370
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,380
Okay.

371
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,580
Learning to apply what you've learned!

372
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,820
I won't let you down.

373
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,860
Mr. Zhan,

374
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,460
it's been a long time.

375
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,140
I ground and made this cappuccino
for you.

376
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,460
Just like always,

377
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,220
this one is on the house for you.

378
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,020
Thank you.

379
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
[Tonight's grand show
has been arranged]

380
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,820
Madam, what would you like to drink?

381
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,700
A cup of coffee, please.

382
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
And a dessert.

383
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,020
No. I'll be leaving shortly.

384
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,900
You're already leaving?

385
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,540
Why are you in such a hurry?

386
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,140
I came to ask you what's going on.

387
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,340
This person named Han Bin

388
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,540
is your good friend, right?

389
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,980
Not exactly.

390
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,020
Just an ordinary friend.

391
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,900
What was he doing?

392
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,420
What did he leave at the door?

393
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,380
A photo that slanders Rushuang.

394
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,860
A photo that slanders Rushuang?

395
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,780
Does he even know her?

396
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,140
Why would he bother?

397
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,340
I don't know.

398
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,420
I'm still looking into it.

399
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,860
But pass a message on to him.

400
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,860
If he dares to harass my family again,

401
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,660
I will not let him off the hook.

402
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,260
There must've been a misunderstanding.

403
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,020
Look,

404
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,940
when I see him,

405
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,260
I'll get the whole story straight.

406
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,700
If he did it,

407
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,020
I'll take care of him for you.

408
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,620
Please calm down.

409
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,820
I thought you came today

410
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,140
to talk about the Canteen.

411
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,380
The Canteen?

412
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,060
What's wrong with that?

413
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,500
Did you go

414
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,740
to a food show producer,

415
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,140
hoping he could do

416
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,900
a feature on the Canteen?

417
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,660
Yes.

418
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,420
He told you all about it?

419
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,420
I recommended

420
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,180
Mr. Huang to you.

421
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,860
So he would have to let me know.

422
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,860
You also know

423
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,060
Huaixiang Group has been cutting
its budget these past two years,

424
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,980
but Baiwei Group

425
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,900
is their major client.

426
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,660
You've helped me a lot over the years.

427
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,100
I'm very grateful to you.

428
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,340
But I'm in the real world now

429
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,780
and can handle some things.

430
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,220
Don't bother with my appointment
with Mr. Huang.

431
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,500
Okay.

432
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,580
Of course, I hope you can stand

433
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,660
on your own two feet.

434
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,980
A strong woman, right?

435
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,860
But I'm just worried about you.

436
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,180
You're dealing with those old men.

437
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,060
What if you get tricked?

438
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,060
Scheming and fighting against them

439
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,500
can be quite exhausting.

440
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,300
Truly physically and mentally draining.

441
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,700
But I actually want to see

442
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,020
whether I can outmaneuver them.

443
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,300
I gotta go.

444
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,820
Remember to tell your friend.

445
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,180
If it happens again,

446
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,540
I will not let him off the hook.

447
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,260
I'll handle it.

448
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,200
[Han Bin]

449
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,820
Mom,

450
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,500
our restaurant

451
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,180
was leased to Qiao Zhi.

452
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,820
It's renamed Canteen.

453
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,020
It's open for business

454
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,620
with

455
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
pretty good performance.

456
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,140
Right now, I'm helping out

457
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,180
at the shop with him.

458
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,780
You know what, Mom?

459
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,740
From him,

460
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,980
I suddenly understand

461
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,620
why you fell in love with Dad.

462
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,260
A man with a strong sense
of responsibility

463
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,900
is truly so charming.

464
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,980
Uncle.

465
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,100
You've completely disgraced our family.

466
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,060
Do you have any shame?

467
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,260
What are you doing?

468
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,660
This is a hospital.

469
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,500
Make a scene, and I'll call the police.

470
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,300
Who are you?

471
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,340
Mind your own business!

472
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,860
She's our niece.

473
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,020
As her elders, we should educate her.

474
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,180
None of your business.

475
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,580
My elders?

476
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,940
You hit me in public so as to get
the money for my mom's treatment.

477
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,380
I'm warning you.

478
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,300
Don't you ever come to us again.

479
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,020
Oh, my poor brother!

480
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,340
I can't control her

481
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,180
anymore.

482
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,220
Such an unfilial daughter!

483
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,860
She sold the family's

484
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,860
only restaurant.

485
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,780
With the money she got from it,

486
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,340
she lives a life of debauchery.

487
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,340
Her mom was so angry that she got sick.

488
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:43,820
Tell me.

489
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,220
You sold the restaurant
for 200,000 yuan.

490
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,540
Give the money

491
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,220
to your aunt

492
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,260
to hold onto.

493
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,140
You don't take care of your mom, right?

494
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,620
We'll look after her for you.

495
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,500
You'll look after her?

496
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,540
Since my mom got sick,

497
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,380
have you come to see her once?

498
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Did you look after me
for a day growing up?

499
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,500
Or ever give me a piece of candy?

500
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,740
Now that I have money,

501
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,860
you're openly robbing me.

502
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,220
I bet

503
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,180
you rotten gambler

504
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,340
lost all your money again!

505
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,420
Who are you calling a rotten gambler?

506
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:10,860
You!

507
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,740
What's that?

508
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,460
What do you want to do?

509
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,700
I'll beat you to death!

510
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,420
She's spreading lies!

511
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,940
I'll kill you!

I'll kill you, you brat!

Crush you!

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,060
Just look at her!

The only restaurant.

517
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,260
She is just hopeless.

518
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,140
She goes to pubs

519
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,700
every day.

520
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,460
Her mom was so angry that she got sick.

521
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,460
Way to go!

[Huaixiang Restaurant]

523
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Who prepped these ingredients?

524
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Can't even pick out bad leaves?

525
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,060
Are you blind?

Bao,

527
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,980
was it you?

528
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,980
Could you put half that energy

529
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,340
into your actual work?

530
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,020
Got arrogant after your raise, huh?

531
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
If you hate this job, quit already!

532
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,020
You've got some nerve showing attitude!

533
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,460
I know you've always

534
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,740
looked down on me.

535
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,260
For two whole years,

536
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,860
you never gave me a decent look.

537
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,540
Fine.

538
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,980
If you can, prove yourself
with your skills!

539
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,380
I only respect skills.

540
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,420
Play political games and suck up
are all you do.

541
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,060
Don't act like you don't know

542

how you passed the promotion evaluation.

543
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,140
What am I supposed to know?

544
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,260
I wish I were as skillful as you are,

545
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,220
but have you ever taught me?

546
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,860
It's been two years,

547
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,460
two years,

548
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,300
all you've done
is yell at me, belittle me,

549
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,660
and sabotage me behind my back!

550

besides this stove being hot,

554
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,260
is there any warmth among colleagues?

555
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:46,980
Come on.

556
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,340
Can you just grow up?

557
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,780
This is where you work, not your home!

558
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,740
Even demanding warmth.

559
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,100
Just say it already!

560
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,220
Because I sided with Ms. Tao

561
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,860
instead of Tao Rende like you did!

562
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,180

564
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,300
got zero life in it!

565
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,420
Where are you going?

566
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,900
If you leave now, even your uncle
won't be able to save you!

567
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,740
I quit.

568
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,620
Get back here!

569
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,740
Don't you dare come back
after you leave!

570
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,900
What are you staring at?

571
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,740
Get back to work.

572
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,700
[Canteen]
Bao Tong, what brings you here?

573
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,340
I need to see Qiao Zhi.

574
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,420
He is rather busy at the moment.

575
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,420
As you can see,

576
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,540
we're swamped.

577
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,340
Madam, wait.

578
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,660
He asked me to help in the kitchen.

579
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,700
Help?

580
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,100
Oh, thank goodness!

581
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,060
Come in!

582
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,620
He's on the verge

583
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,540
of losing it!

584
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:42,900
Really?

585
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,860
So here I am!

586
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,580
Everyone, hurry up.

587
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,180
Mr. Qiao,

588
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,620
looking flush these days.

589
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,180
What brings you here?

590
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,580
Slammed today, can't host you properly.

591
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,820
It's okay. Do your thing.
Just dropping by.

592
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,060
Boss, 18 female crabs

593
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,260
and the grouper are prepped!

594
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,220
Eighteen female crabs

595
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,500
and the grouper are prepped!

596
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,740
Got it.

597
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,740
Take over my station.

598
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,300
On it.

599
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,900
Female crabs?

600
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,540
Female crabs with a grouper.

601
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,820
What's your plan?

602
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,060
Crab Meat with Egg White.

603
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,060
But classically, it uses

604
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,740
river crabs and crab roe.

605
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,580
Yes.

606
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,540
This is my modified version.

607
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,940
Great.

608
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,580
I'm genuinely floored by your skills!

609
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,180
This seafood and river crab dish
may cost over 1,000.

610
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,220
Right!

611
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,540
Are the dishes ready?

612
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,500
Customers are losing patience!

613
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,700
Stop rushing me!

614
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
The wok is on fire as it is!

615
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,020
Then move faster!

616
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
Boss,

617
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,820
can we get extra hands?

618
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,660
I agree.

619
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,540
We need more support!

620
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,380
Sure.

621
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,740
I'll sort it out later.

622
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,780
Hey bro.

623
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,260
Bro.

624
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,020
If you don't mind,

625
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,220
I could give you a hand.

626
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,900
Awkward much?

627
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,380
What's awkward about it?

628
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,500
One condition though.

629
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,220
I can't handle dishes this expensive,

630
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,860
but I have home-style ones down cold.

631
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,260
Let's roll!

632
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,540
Boss,

633
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,940
him?

634
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,340
Are you sure?

635
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,460
You'll see.

636
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,980
Call him Bao already!

637
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,900
He's a chef at a five-star hotel.

638
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,340
Learn from him! Now!

639
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,340
Bao.

640
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,060
Bao.

641
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,660
Grab him an apron.

642
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,260
A good friend!

643
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,500
He'll make

644
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,460
these two dishes!

645
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,260
Bao,

646
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,220
these two dishes are yours!

647
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,860
Copy that!

648
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,500
Dig in, everyone!

649
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,220
Yes!

650
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,140
Right on!

651
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,300
Right this way.

652
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,340
Whoa!

653
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,420
Business this booming?

654
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,780
Can barely squeeze through!

655
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,380
Good wine needs no signpost.

656
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,460
Gourmet food hides where least expected.

657
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,540
I saw online the other day

658
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,740
that a rich kid smashed a car here.

659
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,540
They're all here for photos
with that kid, I suppose.

660
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,500
Rest assured.

661
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,420
The dishes here are exceptional.

662
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,300
The chef's been prepping specially
for you.

663
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,180
Should be ready any moment now.

664
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,860
Good evening, everyone.

665
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,140
I'm Qiao Zhi,

666
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,700
chef of this establishment.

667
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,340
Serve the dishes.

668
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,980
Allow me to present these dishes.

669
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,220
Tri-flavor Shrimp,

670
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,780
Crispy Walnut Duck,

671
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,020
Fried Lettuce, Asparagus,
and Bamboo Shoots with Mushroom Oil

672
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,700
and

673
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,980
Shahe Fish Head.

674
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,300
Well,

675
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,020
they're visually striking.

676
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,700
Indeed.

677
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,220
What a jarring contrast
to these surroundings.

678
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,460
Never expected that.

679
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,060
Then

680
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,540
shall we dig in?

681
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,300
By all means.

682
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,900
Please.

683
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,140
Tastes great!

684
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,500
Promoting traditional Chinese cuisine

685
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,340
is the core philosophy

686
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,180
that resonates deeply with me.

687
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,060
No wonder Xue

688
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,340
insisted on producing

689
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,140
an episode on this restaurant.

690
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,980
Restaurants working with dedication
grow ever rarer.

691
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,140
Media professionals should wield

692
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,540
their influence to safeguard them.

693
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,420
Our deepest gratitude.

694
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:43,980
Hurry, keep pace!

695
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,380
Excuse me for a moment.

696
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,460
Please enjoy your meal.

697
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,620
Have a look.

698
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,420
It's her.

699
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:52,980
It's her.

700
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,420
Look.

701
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,220
This young lady.

702
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:58,940
It's her.

703
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,620
What are you doing?

704
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,220
I was talking about her.

705
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,620
Let go.

706
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,580
Hey!

707
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,220
He hit you?

708
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,900
It's him.

709
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,060
This bully

710
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,660
illegally seized our restaurant

711
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,900
and committed brutal violence!

712
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,100
Your station must demand justice for us!

713
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,220
Broadcast his crimes to the world!

714
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,860
He's the culprit!

715
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,780
We're here to investigate and verify
the situation.

716
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,620
Mr. Zheng said

717
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,060
you occupied this restaurant.

718
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,340
May I ask if this is true?

719
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,380
I transferred it to him.

720
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,260
Nonsense!

721
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,940
I lent money to your parents.

722
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,740
After their accident,

723
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,260
you just

724
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,300
willingly handed over this restaurant.

725
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,900
They repaid every cent long ago.

726
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,500
If not for this IOU,

727
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,900
you'd believe what she said.

728
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,660
Gaze upon this!

729
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,660
250,000 yuan.

730
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,460
In black and white!

731
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,500
This IOU's fake!

732
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,380
Liar.

733
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,700
Let Ding Chan

734
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
examine it herself.

735
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,900
No way!

736
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,900
Listen closely.

737
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,140
Repay the money now!

738
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,940
Or forget your business!

739
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,940
What nonsense?

740
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,180
Forget what?

741
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,180
Your forehead looks dark.

742
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,300
It means bad luck!

743
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,500
Lean back.

744
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,980
Brat, what did you say?

745
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,180
A Slap across the face

746
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,540
will cost me 5,000.

747
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,220
Attacking his ribs

748
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,500
will cost me 50,000.

749
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,780
Attacking his head

750
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,340
will cost me 100,000,

751
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,660
and I'll be criminally liable.

752
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,060
Current

753
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,140
balance insufficient.

754
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,220
Zhou Chong.

755
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,860
Listen.

756

However,

given current circumstances,

00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,660

950
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,780
Cause trouble here?

951
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,980
Don't push your luck.

952
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,580
I'm so scared.

953
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,300
Huo from the food street?

954
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,100
I'm Huo!

955
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,180
Are you kidding me?

956
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,580
Trying to fool me?

957
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,100
Master,

958
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,820
I recognize these punks.

959
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,460
All unemployed locals.

960
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,060
Should we call the police?

961
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,220
Local boys?

962
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,900
Then no need to trouble the police.

963
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,420
I'm offering you a fair shot.

964
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,700
It won't be late

965
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,820
to leave now.

966

967
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,780
Call your backup?

968
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,740
Go ahead.

969
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,460

00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,180
tell nearby households.

971

Missing kids found.

Come fetch them at the Canteen.

973
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,340
You useless layabout!

974

Useless!

975
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,340
And you,

you,

977
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,860

- Dare to target the Canteen?
- Mom.

979
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,180
- How dare you?
- Stop hitting!

980
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,060
I'm sorry!

981
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,620
You ungrateful traitor!

982
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
Mom, stop.

983
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,700
Don't you get it?

984
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,900
We eat their food three meals a day!

985
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,420
Last weekend,

986
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,300
Qiao just comped us.

987
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,260
Apologize now!

988
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,020
Qiao,

989
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,180
sorry.

990

Don't call him like that.

991
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,340
Call him Mr. Qiao.

992
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,220
Mr. Qiao,

993
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,820
I'm wrong.

994
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,660
Mr. Qiao,

995
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,220
I'm wrong.

996
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,220
I dare not do it again.

997
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,420
On your feet.

998
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,580
Mrs. Liu,

999
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,140
they might've acted on impulse.

1000
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,380
Just take them home.

1001
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,100
Apologies for the fuss.

1002
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,060
Come with me now.

1003
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,460
Go.

1004
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,340
Let's go.

1005
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,220
Master's next level!

1006

Zhi,

1007
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,380
I used to wonder

1008
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,380
why you treated our neighbors so well,

1009
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,660
always giving them so many benefits.

1010
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,100
Now I see

1011
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,700
your game theory!

1012
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,140
Wasn't some calculated move.

1013
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,900
These folks

1015
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,860
If I can help, I'll just lend a hand.

1016
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,380
Yes.

1017
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,420
Corporate social responsibility.

1018
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,700
Don't go labeling my kindness.

1019
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,060
Looks like a coordinated attack.

1020
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,460
What's fresh now?

1021
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:35,900
Look at this.

What should we do?

1025
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,980
Do nothing.

1026

Tell everyone not to mind.

I believe that guests

1030

Look!

1031
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,660
The Canteen's rating

1032
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,140
is only one star!

Like our group's public embarrassment!

1035
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,100
Exactly.

1036
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,020

You just won't listen.

1039
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,140
The Canteen is completely unreliable.

1040
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,740
But you wouldn't listen.

1041
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,220

You should deal with the Canteen now.

Otherwise, even if I defeat you,

1047

Yes, indeed.

Well.

Do you like reading?

1081
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,820
My family was poor when I was a kid.

1082
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,780
My dad often

1083
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:05,980
told me

to learn more

1085
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,300
as knowledge can change one's fate.

1086
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,140
You know, the older generation

1087
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,460
always goes in for that sort of thing.

1088
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,220

To resort to any means necessary.

00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,860
is like snatching food
from the jaws of a tiger.

so young,

1110
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,060

over such a big company,

The Baiwei Group

1114

1121
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,700

The Baiwei Group

1123

will buy a portion of your shares,

1127
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,540
Of course,

1128
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,620
this is all based

1129
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,140
on absolute trust

1130
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,260

You did help me a lot in the past.

1138
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,020
But now it seems

1139
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,180
I'm getting to know you better.

1140
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,780
So,

1141
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:26,980
do you understand me

1142
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,300
or not?

1143
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,780
Go ahead, please.

1144
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,500
Okay.

1145
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,220
Then I'll just say it straight out.

1146
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:41,900
Xue,

1147
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,060
from the first time I saw you,

1148
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,820
I fell in love with you.

1149
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,100
If you could be with me,

1150
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,660
I promise

1151
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,620
to fully support your career

1152
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,460
and give you a warm home.

1153
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,620
You're a better businessman
than your father.

1154
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,500
Agree?

1155
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,500
Sorry

1156
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,060
to disappoint you.

1157
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,540
I'm married.

1158
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,620
Are you kidding me?

1159
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,020
Married?

1160
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,060
Who did you marry?

1161
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,820
Can't disclose right now.

1162
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,700
However, please tell your father

1163
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,580
he can forget about the merger.

1164
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,540
I finally understand
what my mother said.

1165
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,060
