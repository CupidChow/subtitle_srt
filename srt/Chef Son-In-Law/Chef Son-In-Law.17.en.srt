193
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,820
Are we missing

194
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,140
an imperial chef
for the scene this afternoon?

195
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,100
Have we found someone?

196
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,100
We have.

197
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,380
But I'm not very satisfied.

198
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
I'm worried about that.

199
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,060
I have a friend
who's incredibly skilled.

200
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,940
If he could come,

201
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,700
it would be a big plus.

202
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,420
Really?

203
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,980
No problem.

204
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:48,780
Okay.

205
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,340
Thank you, sir.

206
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,020
Alright.

207
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,660
By the way,

208
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,060
I've arranged
a family dinner for you tonight.

209
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,500
But you don't have to
lift a finger this time.

210
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,180
I've invited Mr. Xu, the National Chef.

211
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,020
It'll be a good experience
for your competition.

212
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,980
You're really going all out.

213
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,260
Even got a National Chef.

214
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,700
Also,

215
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,140
pick up Mom from the hospital later.

216
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,060
She specifically took time off.

217
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,380
Said she wants to celebrate with you.

218
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,620
Ruxue is indeed thoughtful.

219
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,900
It's Mu Xiao.

220
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:23,980
Mu Xiao.

221
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,020
Why are you calling me?

222
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,860
Mr. Qiao,

223
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,500
isn't it time

224
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,700
to repay that favor?

225
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,740
I'll repay it.

226
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,700
I'll do whatever I can.

227
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,140
We need a chef for a scene

228
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,100
this afternoon.

229
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Can you come help?

230
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,860
Acting?

231
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,660
But I don't know how to act.

232
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,260
Aren't you a chef?

233
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,220
Yes.

234
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,140
Then it's fine.

235
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
Just be yourself.

236
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,100
But...

237
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,700
But what?

238
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,740
Is your wife right there?

239
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,140
Let me talk to her.

240
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,300
Hello, Mu Xiao.

241
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,260
I haven't had a chance to thank you

242
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,540
for your huge help last time.

243
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,180
So, can I borrow him for the afternoon?

244
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,700
As long as he doesn't
cause you any trouble.

245
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,860
Don't worry.

246
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,620
It's just a cameo.

247
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,260
Sure.

248
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,980
But we can't
repay that favor that easily.

249
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,980
How about this?

250
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,860
After you finish shooting,

251
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,060
we'll both treat you to a meal.

252
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,180
Okay. It's a deal.

253
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,980
You agreed?

254
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:29,700
Come on,

255
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,020
we have to repay that favor.

256
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,020
Glare at her if you want.

257
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,540
It was her.

258
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,940
Zhi,

259
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,140
how could you?

260
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,940
Alright. You can go.

261
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,900
She's helped you so many times.

262
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,900
Come right back after shooting.

263
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,660
I'm off.

264
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,180
You're done for.

265
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,820
Ruxue holds a grudge.

266
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,660
And aren't you going to
help calm her down?

267
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,180
I'm doing all this for your sake!

268
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,340
You'd better hope I don't
add fuel to the fire.

269
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,020
What kind of people are these?

270
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,540
They use fake stuff for shooting.

271
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,020
Sir.

272
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,980
Are you here to play the imperial chef?

273
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,380
Here's the thing.

274
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,460
When acting with Ms. Mu,

275
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,580
you'll need to be quick on your feet.

276
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,540
Quick on my feet?

277
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,220
She sometimes improvises.

278
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,900
So you need to

279
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,660
be able to keep up with her.

280
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,100
Did I memorize my lines
for nothing then?

281
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:31,980
Well,

282
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,780
is it too late for me to leave now?

283
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,060
Too late!

284
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,700
Ms. Mu.

285
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,220
I'll let you two alone.

286
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,340
We... We'll go get ready.

287
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
Not bad.

288
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,700
You look quite handsome in costume.

289
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,660
What's this?

290
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,060
These are my family's heirloom
kitchen tools.

291
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,460
I'm here to help you act.

292
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,460
Gotta have my gear ready.

293
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,060
Even though it's a small role,

294
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,460
every scene matters.

295
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,060
Right?

296
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,060
Good.

297
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,420
So everyone uses
formal titles here, right?

298
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,020
Yes,

299
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,860
Mr. Qiao.

300
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,420
Mr. Qiao.

301
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,100
Good.

302
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,340
I heard you love

303
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,140
to improvise?

304
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,260
Let's make a deal.

305
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,540
Try to tone it down a bit.

306
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,900
That

307
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,700
depends on how you perform.

308
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,580
Ms. Mu.

309
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,220
We're ready to shoot.

310
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,980
Okay, sir.

311
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,540
Let's get ready!

312
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,180
Everyone, get ready!

313
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,940
Good luck.

314
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,660
Get ready!

315
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,420
So we're starting now, right?

316
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,940
Here.

317
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,980
Everyone, get ready!

318
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,140
Three, two, one, action!

319
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,260
The Princess arrives!

320
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,780
Greetings, Your Highness.

321
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,380
Mr. Qiao, you may rise.

322
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,140
From now on,

323
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,340
there's no need for such formality.

324
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,980
I

325
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,100
wouldn't dare.

326
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,100
If it weren't for

327
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,620
your dietary therapy
curing my chronic illness,

328
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,180
I probably

329
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,060
wouldn't have been able to get up.

330
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,780
Your Highness,

331
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,020
you're nice...

332
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,180
Wise and kind.

333
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,460
I said it wrong, didn't I?

334
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,140
Cut, cut!

335
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,700
Cut.

336
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,140
Man,

337
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,980
could you...?

338
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,140
He's nervous.

339
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,620
Buddy,

340
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,780
take it slow.

341
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,900
Just go with the flow.

342
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,620
Alright?

343
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,340
Thank you, sir.

344
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,020
Sorry about that.

345
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,420
Everyone, get ready!

346
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,220
We're doing it again?

347
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:37,860
Yeah, like this.

348
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,100
Everyone, get ready!

349
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,940
Three, two, one, action!

350
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,780
Your Highness,

351
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,940
you're wise and kind.

352
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,940
Sir, let's try another take.

353
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,020
Come on.

354
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
Your Highness,

355
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,100
heaven...

356
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,740
Wise and kind.

357
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,580
Again.

358
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,540
I forgot everything.

359
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,540
Your Highness, you're noble...

360
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,180
Your Highness...

361
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,100
Sorry.

362
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,260
My apologies.

363
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,060
Sir, let's go again.

364
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,180
Sorry.

365
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,340
It's fine.

366
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,740
Relax.

367
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,380
Your Highness,

368
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,180
you are wise and kind.

369
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,220
Heaven favors the virtuous.

370
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,380
Mr. Qiao,

371
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,260
then you must be heaven's favor for me.

372
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:29,740
Well...

373
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,180
Cut!

374
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,940
Okay!

375
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,700
Great!

376
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,300
Change the camera angle.

377
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,140
Come on.

378
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,780
Camera, move over there.

379
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,060
Come on.

380
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,620
What does this mean?

381
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,260
Is it over?

382
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,740
So can I...?

383
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,300
No.

384
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,140
Not yet.

385
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,180
Just adjusting the camera angle.

386
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,460
We're still shooting?

387
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,540
Yes.

388
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,740
Your Highness,
what would you like to eat?

389
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,220
I'll make it for you right now.

390
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,580
I came specifically

391
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,180
to learn cooking from you.

392
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,260
The kitchen is smoky and fiery.

393
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,100
You are noble. It wouldn't be suitable.

394
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,140
I knew you wouldn't agree.

395
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,220
Head Chef of the Imperial Kitchen,
heed this decree!

396
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,460
Starting today,

397
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,100
you will teach me how to cook every day.

398
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,860
I expect you

399
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,100
to fulfill your duty

400
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
and impart all your knowledge.

401
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,540
Failure is not an option.

402
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,020
Yes, Your Highness.

403
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,340
Then I'll first turn you

404
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,060
into a dish...

405
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,540
No, I'll first teach you how to cook.

406
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,180
Don't grip the knife

407
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,940
too far forward.

408
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,820
It makes cutting

409
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
difficult.

410
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,100
And of course, don't grip it
too far back either.

411
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,580
That's unstable.

412
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,260
The correct grip

413
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,900
is to hold the handle with your fingers,

414
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,020
the base of your thumb
against the blade.

415
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,900
Your thumb should press
against the flat part of the blade.

416
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,780
When cutting, slice straight down.

417
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,780
The force should focus
on the front part of the blade.

418
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,340
Here.

419
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,540
His knife work is amazing.

420
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,820
His knife work is incredible.

421
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,180
What is Mr. Qiao making?

422
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,300
Is that

423
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,180
the state banquet dish,
Chrysanthemum Tofu?

424
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,620
Using soft tofu.

425
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,540
Trace a circle in the center.

426
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,020
Use a suspended knife technique
for 180 cuts without severing it.

427
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,940
Then make another 180 crosswise cuts.

428
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,740
Truly amazing knife work.

429
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,860
Camera operator.

430
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,660
Handheld.

431
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,700
Get a tight close-up.

432
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,660
Closer! Tighter!

433
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,860
Tight close-up.

434
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,980
Give me a tight close-up!

435
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,540
Truly incredible knife work.

436
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,580
Cut!

437
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,540
Okay!

438
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,140
Get ready!

439
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,060
Three, two, one, action!

440
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,740
Your Highness, please enjoy.

441
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,420
This is so delicious.

442
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,580
Can you

443
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,340
make this for me every day from now on?

444
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,540
If you like it,

445
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,340
it is my duty to oblige.

446
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,940
Why are you standing so far away?

447
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,540
Come closer.

448
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,780
A little closer.

449
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,700
I have something to tell you.

450
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:27,980
Well...

451
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,580
This is improper!

452
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,180
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get me killed?

453
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,740
Sir,

454
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
there's no kiss scene in the script.

455
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,300
Ms. Mu's acting is really good.

456
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,980
Mr. Qiao's performance
was also very authentic and natural.

457
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,460
Alright.

458
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,220
I'll stop teasing you.

459
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,660
I will return to you

460
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,580
at Wei Shi tomorrow.
[*Wei Shi refers to 1-3 PM.]

461
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,700
Cut!

462
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,460
Okay!

463
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,260
Perfect!

464
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,300
Is this scene over?

465
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,980
It's over.

466
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,260
Was that a sudden move

467
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,180
in the script?

468
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,980
The emotion was there.
I couldn't help it.

469
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,540
Your emotion was there, yes.

470
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,060
But if this airs, how can I
show my face again?

471
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,140
It's just acting.
What are you afraid of?

472
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,740
I'm afraid I won't be able to go home.

473
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,300
You will.

474
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,380
Ms. Mu.

475
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,420
That addition to the scene
was brilliant.

476
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,300
Absolutely perfect!

477
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,220
Thank you, sir.

478
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,220
And Mr. Qiao,

479
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,020
your reaction was very natural.

480
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,740
Natural, right?

481
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,580
Could it be anything else?

482
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,420
Good grief,

483
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,660
the princess kissing the chef?

484
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,780
Does he want to keep his head?

485
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,100
Sir,

486
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,940
I think the natural light
in that last shot

487
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,100
wasn't quite enough.

488
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,300
How about this?

489
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,100
We'll do a pickup shot tomorrow.

490
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
Okay.

491
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,980
Mr. Qiao, please stay here
for another day then.

492
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,220
Thank you, sir.

493
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,100
Liu!

494
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,060
Remember to arrange a room.

495
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,300
Mr. Qiao is staying an extra day.

496
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,220
You got it, sir.

497
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,260
Stay another day?

498
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:39,860
What?

499
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,940
You're unwilling

500
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,940
to help just this little bit?

501
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,540
Fine.

502
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,900
In for a penny,

503
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,900
in for a pound.

504
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,780
Come to my room tonight

505
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,100
and cook for me.

506
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,940
You decide

507
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,180
what to eat.

508
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,980
I still have to cook?

509
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,340
What are you working on?

510
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,300
It'll be ready soon.

511
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,020
Go wait.

512
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,220
You sure you don't want some company?

513
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,020
No.

514
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,420
Here.

515
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,300
What's this?

516
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
Xishi Holds the Pearl.

517
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,340
It's a very classic Huaiyang dish.

518
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,580
It's named that

519
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,820
because the dish contains

520
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,580
many shellfish.

521
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,580
These shellfish

522
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,620
have an alternative name,
"Xishi's Tongue."

523
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,100
Hence the name.

524
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,700
I'll dig in then.

525
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,420
Here.

526
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,940
Chewy and springy.

527
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,580
Delicious.

528
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,620
Try the soup.

529
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,740
Three words.

530
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,860
Sweet and fresh.

531
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,300
Canteen is so popular right now.

532
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,700
Why not strike while the iron's hot

533
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,740
and open more branches?

534
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,580
That way, loyal fans like us

535
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,020
can enjoy it elsewhere too.

536
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,540
Actually, traditional franchising

537
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,540
isn't really what I'm aiming for.

538
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,180
But don't worry.

539
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,460
It won't be long now.

540
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,540
You have some too.

541
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,140
Okay.

542
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,020
I'll serve myself.

543
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Speaking of which,

544
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,380
Tao Rushuang is a good actress
with potential.

545
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,620
And she works hard enough.

546
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,860
If I use my resources
to give her a boost,

547
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,380
she's bound to make it big.

548
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,580
Thank you.

549
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,060
But

550
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,420
she's no relation of mine.

551
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,020
Why should I help her?

552
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,140
To be honest,

553
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
what you've done

554
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,420
already goes beyond
what a friend would do.

555
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,860
So

556
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,260
what do you think

557
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,300
I'm after?

558
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,020
I fell for you the first time we met

559
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,460
in Singapore.

560
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,940
You were like a warm ray of sunshine.

561
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,300
Capable of dispelling

562
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,540
all the gloom in my heart.

563
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,420
Two strangers suffering the same plight

564
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,180
need not have been acquainted
before they meet.

565
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,220
You're still awake?

566
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,260
You were spying on him?

567
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,100
I was worried the lamb
had walked into the tiger's den.

568
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,860
Luckily, I know someone on the crew.

569
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,460
I found the most reliable one.

570
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,340
How childish.

571

It's past ten at night.

574
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,940
A man and a woman are alone together
late at night.

575
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,340
How can you be so unconcerned?

576

Aren't you even a little upset?

577
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,300
You were clearly jealous earlier today.

578
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,260
What could I do?

00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,740

There's also that Ellie from Huasheng.

If I can't even handle
this A-list actress,

589
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,420
how could I possibly handle someone
from a global top 100 company?

590
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,220
So what do we do?

591
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,900
You can't just
keep indulging him like this.

592
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,380
He'll get more and more out of hand.

How about...?

594
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,420

Let me tell you,

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,980
I can handle things alone.

601

Am I the kind of person who slacks off?

Just kidding. Don't take it seriously.

Here's the thing.

608
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,460

for that dish from earlier.

761
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,820
You're giving it to me?

762
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,540
No, that...

763
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,380
Well,

764
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
Zhi, I can't accept this.

765
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:08,940
Take it.

766
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,100
No matter how good a dish is,

767
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,220
someone still has to make it.

768
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,060
Look it over.

769
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,540
If you don't understand anything,
just ask me anytime.

770
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,260
[Mandarin Ducks Stewed
with Five Treasures]

771
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,300
If you don't mind,

772
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,620
I can give you a hand.

773
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,580
Him?

774
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,940
Can he do it?

775
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,940
What are you talking about?

776
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,580
Call him Bao.

777
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,420
He worked as a chef
in a five-star hotel.

778
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,060
You all should learn from him. Call him!

779
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,700
Bao!

780
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,380
Bao!

781
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,340
Canteen

782
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,620
opened in a bit of a rush.

783
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,140
It's been even busier

784
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,300
since we opened.

785
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,260
I haven't had time to gather everyone

786
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
for a proper heart-to-heart.

787
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:44,980
I

788
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
started learning to cook

789
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,780
when I was five.

790
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,820
Actually, I think

791
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,900
even the most delicious dish

792
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,580
becomes bland if there's no family

793
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,700
to share it with.

794
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,460
That was my original intention
for opening Canteen.

795
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,420
This is a big family.

796
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,700
We're all family.

797
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,580
I promise I'll deliver on the benefits

798
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,740
I offered you.

799
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
This month's commission

800
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,740
will be split among everyone here.

801
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,620
But don't take too much.

802
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,580
Ding Chan has a record

803
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,860
of how much each person gets.

804
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,100
Here, divide it yourselves!

805
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,020
You're my savior!

806
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,580
I see.

807
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,580
You're saying

808
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,580
Baiwei Group

809
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,220
can also find me an heiress,

810
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,180
open a restaurant for me,

811
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,340
and set me up as the boss?

812
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,580
That's not right.

813
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,420
Your boss doesn't have a daughter.

814
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,780
And I'm not gay.

815
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:47,860
Yes.

816
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,060
Our boss doesn't have a daughter.

817
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,900
But we can find you any kind of woman

818
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,580
you want.

819
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,140
And if you want to open a restaurant,

820
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,620
we can help you open one.

821
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,660
Dong Hao,

822
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,820
are you really this dumb

823
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,500
or just blind?

824
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,740
Can't you see?

825
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,260
Can't you see who's sitting next to me?

826
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,620
I might be average-looking,

827
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,380
but I'm totally loyal.

828
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,580
Betray a friend?

829
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,780
How could I show my face after that?

830
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,100
If you want to try tempting someone,

831
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,980
do your homework first.

832
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,140
If you don't have what it takes,

833
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,260
don't bother with these cheap tricks.

834
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,260
So low.

835
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,740
Don't you think?

836
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:44,900
Yan.

837
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,020
Let's go.

838
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,780
Tell Mr. Zhan

839
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,940
to think bigger.

840
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,580
Dad.

841
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,500
Those two bumpkins

842
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,860
are ungrateful.

843
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,340
Bao Tong is indeed tough to crack.

844
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,420
But Guo Yan's eyes...

845
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,340
What about her eyes?

846
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,420
They show greed.

847
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,700
Go handle it.

848
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,740
Don't disappoint me again.

849
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,260
Don't worry, Dad.

850
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,140
I'll get it done right this time.

851
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:45,980
Yan,

852
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,940
don't take what Dong Hao said

853
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,900
to heart.

854
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,860
It's fine.

855
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,780
Is this

856
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,700
the first time I've held your hand?

857
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,940
So... So soft.

858
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,260
This isn't your first time
holding a woman's hand, is it?

859
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:06,900
What's wrong?

860
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,460
It's just...

861
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,180
I feel we should still
tell Zhi about this.

862
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,580
I have a feeling Zhan Shikun

863
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,460
will try something
at the King of Chefs Championship.

864
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,580
I think it's better

865
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,060
if you don't tell Qiao Zhi
about this for now.

866
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,300
Anyway, you already refused.

867
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,500
And you two

868
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,420
are going to be partners later.

869
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,660
Otherwise, it might be a case

870
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,460
of unintended consequences.

871
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,100
Okay.

872
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,020
I'll listen to you.

873
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,060
So...

874
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,620
Can I

875
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,580
hold your hand again?

876
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Huaixiang Group's business is booming,

877
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,740
driven by its co-branded zone.

878
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,740
This has directly caused our business

879
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,460
to drop by twenty-eight percent!

880
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,820
Our pre-made food sales

881
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,660
have also dropped significantly!

882
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,220
All the new products they launched

883
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,180
are targeted at our star products.

884
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,180
You are all department heads.

885
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,700
What are your thoughts?

886
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,180
Mr. Zhan,

887
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:06,900
it's like this.

888
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,860
Huaixiang Group

889
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,860
has suddenly slowed down
the pace of opening new branches.

890
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,420
But their per-store performance
has suddenly skyrocketed.

891
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,980
I believe it's related

892
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,140
to its internal management optimization.

893
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,700
The Eight Great Restaurants
have clearly rejected

894
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,580
our acquisition plan.

895
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,300
They plan to bundle together for an IPO!

896
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,420
Mr. Liu,

897
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,740
what's your view on Canteen?

898
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,140
I think these dishes

899
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,260
are just hyped up.

900
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,380
Even though they're popular now,

901
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,340
customers will get bored

902
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,260
with the same old feast quickly.

903
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,860
Unless they can continuously innovate.

904
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,820
Of course,

905
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,660
we can't just wait.

906
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,740
We will launch several new dishes soon.

907
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,980
Then I'll leave it to you.

908
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:42,900
Mr. Zhan,

909
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,420
I suggest

910
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,780
we take part in our business

911
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,340
and start cooperating
with Huasheng Group.

912
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,660
Maybe we can

913
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,780
help them open branches.

914
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,900
I've considered it.

915
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:53,860
I'll

916
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,660
take charge of this matter.

917
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,220
Alright.

918
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,300
You can go now.

919
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,220
Let's go.

920
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,060
Mr. Li,

921
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,420
I'm so sorry

922
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,460
I had to head back home

923
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,260
halfway through our trip.

924
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,980
Something unexpected

925
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,780
came up.

926
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,140
Alright.

927
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,660
If it's convenient for you...

928
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,100
Well?

929
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,100
Surprised?

930
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,780
You came?

931
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
What? Can't I?

932
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,780
You actually came to pick me up.

933
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,820
Punch me.

934
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,460
Harder.

935
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
I'm not dreaming.

936
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
You and your smooth talk.

937
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,940
How did it go
with the actress last night?

938
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,340
You can call and ask her.

939
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,300
I didn't do anything.

940
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,220
Really?

941
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,580
I really didn't do anything.

942
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,180
Alright.

943
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,180
I missed you,

944
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,020
so I came to pick you up.

945
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:00,900
Is that not allowed?

946
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,220
It is.

947
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,220
Let's go.

948
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,020
By the way,

949
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,740

She should be discharged soon.

Any plans for today?

952

No plans.

some new clothes.

956

[Xunyang Station]
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?

957
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,300
If you go out dressed like that,

958
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,460
people will think
I don't take care of you.

959
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,900
My clothes are a bit plain.

960
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,460
But I've worn those big brands

they aren't even breathable.

966
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,220
They're really not as comfortable
as the ordinary brands.

I'm talking about style.

You're decent at cooking,

969

but how come you dress like this...

970
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,980
This is actually an improvement for me.

971
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,900
When I was little,
my grandpa picked my clothes.

972
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,940
I always got laughed at.

973
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,020
But thinking about it now,

974
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,700
it's better than having no one
care at all.

975
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,260
What?

976

I don't like it now.

You're in charge outside,

and I'm in charge at home.

983
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,940
That doesn't seem right.

984
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,700
That might make a man
afraid to come home.

Not good.

you're in charge on Tuesday,
Thursday, Saturday,

That sounds exhausting.

Then I'll be in charge
on weekends, okay?

994

We can talk after you're done.

Why the sigh?

1016
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,100
It's all because someone
performed too brilliantly,

1017
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,180
so all these people are coming around.

never showed
