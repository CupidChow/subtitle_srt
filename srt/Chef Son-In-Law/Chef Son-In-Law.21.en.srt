[Episode 21]

34
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,940
Mr. Biao.

35
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,500
Grandpa.

36
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,340
Great.

37
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,100
You're here.

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,220
Have a seat.

39
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,460
Here.

40
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,740
I don't think

41
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,580
we have much to talk about.

42
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,620
Whatever the price
you bought the shares from Rende,

43
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,260
I'll buy them back at that same price.

44
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,420
Then you'll

45
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,860
withdraw from Huaixiang Group.

46
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,460
But those shares are mine now.

47
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,460
Whether or not they get sold

48
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,380
isn't your decision to make.

49
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,740
Mr. Biao,

50
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,060

53
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,820
I'll handle this matter fairly.

54
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,260
I won't favor either party.

55

As you have reached this impasse,

56
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,540
an explanation is needed.

57
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,900
I am here

58
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,340
to serve as a witness today.

59
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,340
Alright.

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,820

Here's how.

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,300
At the King of Chefs Championship,

63
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,940
if you can win first place

64
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,700
and reclaim the title from my father,

65
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,300
we'd be glad to leave Huaixiang Group.

66
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,620
What are you thinking?

67
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,020
Do you take me for a fool?

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,060
You think I don't know how your father

69
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,300
won the title at the past championships?

70
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
The organizing committee
is full of your men,

71
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,380
and all the contestants are plants.

72
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,940
How do you expect Qiao Zhi to win?

73
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,540
You want him to do something impossible.

74
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,780
Do you want to negotiate or not?

75
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,780
How shameless you are!

76
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,820
Who are you calling shameless?

77
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,900
You!

78
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,300
Still setting up schemes and traps?

79
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,980
You're too green.

80
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,100
If you had the skills,

81
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,500
if you could win a world championship

82
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,740
and bring glory to our country,

83
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,660
I'd hand over Huaixiang Group to you.

84
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,940
But can you?

85
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,100
Ms. Tao,

86
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,780
don't lower yourself
to arguing with him.

87
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,180
What am I?

88
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,300
Why would I stoop to his level?

89
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,020
Who is being unreasonable?

90
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,020
You're insisting
on Mr. Biao as a witness.

91
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,780
What's your intention?

92
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,060
Trying to use moral pressure on him?

93
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,220
Mr. Biao,

94
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,260
you've seen it now.

95
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,180
Their conditions

96
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,940
are clearly provocative.

97
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,420
No sincerity in their negotiation.

98
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,820
And they've put you
in an awkward position

99
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,820
where you can't back down.

100
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,460
I didn't mean to.

101
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,340
In my opinion,

102
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,580
you should stay out of this matter.

103
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,620
Throw your vote away and abstain.

104
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,260
Let the Zhan family exit
from Huaixiang Group.

105
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,220
Then we can go our separate ways

106
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,020
and live our own lives.

107
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,460
At least I won't have to work so hard

108
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,540
to nurture the company,

109
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,900
only to support you for free.

110
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,740
Watch your tongue!

111
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,740
What do you mean by for free?

112
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,460
Tell me.

113
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,740
As a shareholder of Huaixiang Group,

114
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,540
what have you done?

115
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,460
I'm being nice by saying that.

116
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,940
If you're a man,

117
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,820
if you have the guts,

118
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,540
why don't you quit right now?

119
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,700
Baiwei Group earns a lot every year.

120
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,340
What's the matter?

121
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,700
Can't they satisfy you?

122
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,740
You're eyeing our money.

123
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,660
How can you be so greedy?

124
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,700
No matter how poor I am,
I don't need you to support me.

125
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,740
Well said.

126
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,420
As a man, quit Huaixiang Group now.

127
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,300
Don't let me support you.

128
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,860
Shikun,

129
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:57,900
sit down.

130
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,100
Zhan Jun?

131
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,900
What Ms. Too said makes sense.

132
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,260
Ms. Tao,

133
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,060
please share your thoughts.

134
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,060
I don't think you would let

135
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,220
the title go to someone else.

136
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,380
We're not aiming

137
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
for the top spot.

138
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,260
Let's settle on a reasonable ranking.

139
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,940
If Qiao Zhi can achieve this ranking,

140
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,700
you'll withdraw your shares.

141
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,220
And every penny I owe you

142
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,580
will be paid in full.

143
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,340
After all,

144
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,460
you bought them with your money.

145
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,940
You've said all the nice words.

146
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,420
Then tell me,

147
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,220
what ranking
would be considered reasonable?

148
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,260
The top three?

149
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,100
Are you blind?

150
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,420
Didn't you see there's a zero here?

151
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,460
The top 30?

152
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,820
You think you can fool me?

153
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,860
What can I do?

154
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,180
This is all the capability I have.

155
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,860
Don't want to negotiate anymore?

156
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,340
Then you can leave.

157
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,180
Grandpa, see this?

158
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
They are going to abstain.

159
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:07,940
Alright then.

160
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,820
Sign the resolution

161
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,380
from our shareholders' meeting

162
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,100
now.

163
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,900
Once you sign it,

164
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,820
I'll come to your house tonight
and cook you a delicious meal.

165
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,100
You…

166
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,660
Top two?

167
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,660
No way.

168
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,460
Top 28.

169
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,700
Top three?

170
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,220
Can the top three work?

171
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,460
Top 23 would be about right.

172
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,220
Top four?

173
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,340
Four is no good either.

174
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,740
At most, at most top 14.

175
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,700
Top five.

176
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,940
What's the difference
between the top four and five?

177
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,860
Top six at least.

178
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,980
Otherwise, let's stop talking.

179
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,220
Alright,

180
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
top six it is.

181
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,660
Grandpa,

182
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,220
look how difficult this is for me.

183
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,100
Say a word for me.

184
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,460
Oh, come on!

185
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,860
Stop complaining.

186
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,060
Bite me if you can!

187
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,620
Alright.

188
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,020
Since

189
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,380
everyone has agreed,

190
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,940
let's follow the old rule.

191
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,340
Tea time.

192
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,300
Well done.

193
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,780
You surprised me.

194
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,180
You said we should talk properly.

195
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,660
I was talking properly.

196
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,820
Alright then.

197
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,020
By the way, Mom,

198
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:19,940
there's something

199
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,780
I need to ask of you.

200
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,460
Go ahead.

201
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,220
The Zhan family will play tricks.

202
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,300
Please help me

203
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,660
stabilize the home front.

204
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
At this point,

205
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,780
they'll pull some ruthless moves

206
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,300
beyond your imagination.

207
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,500
Don't worry.

208
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,860
I have an ace up my sleeve.

209
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,420
Are you really only 25?

210
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,180
Look a bit too mature for my age!

211
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,060
Interesting.

212
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,280
[Mr. Xu]

213
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,020
That's quite a catch!

214
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,700
Why didn't you call me?

215
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,740
I was afraid of startling your fish.

216
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,300
Boss!

217
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,740
Boss!

218
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:31,980
Boss!

219
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,620
Eight hundred!

220
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,380
You're so generous!

221
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,460
Thanks a lot!

222
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:47,980
Keep on fishing!

223
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,060
Alright.

224
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,460
Looks like you've made your money back.

225
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,860
Enjoy the thrill.

226
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,700
Sit down.

227
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,740
I heard

228
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,300
you're participating
in the championship tomorrow.

229
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,340
How are you preparing?

230
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,340
Not bad.

231
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,100
After being kicked out by Nanfang,

232
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,220
besides traveling around

233
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,940
and eating and drinking,

234
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,540
I still enjoy fishing.

235
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,780
In this circle,

236
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,820
there's a game

237
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,380
called fishing pond betting.

238
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,620
Pay to enter the fishpond.

239
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,980
Then, whatever number of fish you catch,

240
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,660
sell them back to the owner

241
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,380
at a certain market price ratio.

242
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,700
I've heard about it.

243
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,460
Later, gradually, people started

244
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,900
marking a price on each fish,

245
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,620
and the amounts kept getting bigger,

246
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,740
turning it into disguised gambling.

247
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,660
But this

248
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,100
is against the law.

249
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,380
I want to remind you

250
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,540
that there's gambling

251
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,820
going on behind the scenes
of the championship.

252
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
So, you mean

253
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,700
I'm tagged.

254
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,220
Anyway, be careful.

255
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,460
When they get so obsessed with gambling

256
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,140
that they'll do anything.

257
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,580
I see.

258
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,300
You specifically called me here

259
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,460
to remind me.

260
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,140
Thank you very much.

261
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,980
You can't afford to lose.

262
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,580
You are this family's hope.

263
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,940
If it weren't for your reminder,

264
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,780
I might have fallen into their trap.

265
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,060
It was just a small favor.

266
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,940
Dad,

267
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,260
come back.

268
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,180
This family needs you.

269
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,380
Having you here is enough.

270
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,780
Dad,

271
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,260
actually,

272
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,260
I think Mom still cares about you.

273
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,020
Only you can cheer her up.

274
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,300
You're still young.

275
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,100
You wouldn't understand yet

276
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,060
what brings true happiness

277
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,420
to a man at his 50s.

278
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,060
Great.

279
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,140
This one is good.

280
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,980
Dad, can I have this fish?

281
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,860
I'll cook it for Mom later.

282
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,980
I...

283
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,140
I was thinking of trading it for a meal.

284
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,900
Choose.

285
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,220
Keep it,

286
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
or let me cook it

287
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,180
so Mom can enjoy something fresh.

288
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,660
Take it away.

289
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
She can't handle pepper!

290
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,060
Alright.

291
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,740
Is there anything else

292
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,580
you'd like me to say to her?

293
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,420
Forget it.

294
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,660
Better not to have you get scolded.

295
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,780
Mr. Zhan,

296
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,940
aren't we going in?

297
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,180
Be patient.

298
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,460
She'll come out soon.

299
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,580
Clothes make the man.

300
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,700
The best way to handle people like this

301
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,260
is to show off our strength.

302
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,020
She's coming out.

303
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,620
Yan!

304
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,660
[Bao Tong]
How's the BMW?

305
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,580
Is it good to drive?

306
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,300
While others drive a BMW 8 Series,

307
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,180
I'm stuck with a 1 Series.

308
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,220
How on earth do you drive?

309
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,060
Sorry!

310
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,700
Do you have any idea how expensive

311
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,540
this custom paint job on my car is?

312
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,980
I didn't mean to, just an accident.

313
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,740
I was in such a rush

314
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,420
that I just …

315
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,900
Ms. Guo.

316
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,420
Mr. Dong.

317
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
Never expected to see you.

318
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,260
Come on,

319
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,460
I'm just an errand boy.

320
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,620
Regarding the car,

321
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,780
ask your boss.

322
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,980
My boss?

323
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,580
Mr. Zhan,

324
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,900
what a coincidence!

325
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,860
Long time no see.

326
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,100
Let's chat in the car.

327
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,140
Please.

328
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,740
Thank you.

329
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,020
I'm sorry about this.

330
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,020
But this car is yours,

331
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,380
and we could work things out.

332
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
How much should I compensate?

333
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,460
Don't care!

334
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,740
Yan,

335
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,180
I heard

336
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,700
you've been doing well with Qiao Zhi.

337
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,860
You flatter me.

338
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,740
I'm making some small money.

339
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,420
Want to work with me

340
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,660
to earn a big sum?

341
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,980
How big?

342
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,820
Enough to achieve financial freedom.

343
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,660
Is that big enough?

344
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,180
If you work with me,

345
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,740
you'll drive even more luxurious cars.

346
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,140
BPA,

347
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,060
whatever you choose.

348
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,100
BBA.

349
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,980
I prefer the BMW 8 Series supercar.

350
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,820
When I said PBA,

351
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,460
I was referring to Bentley,

352
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,460
Porsche,

353
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,140
and Aston Martin!

354
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,660
If that's not enough,

355
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,220
throwing myself in as a bonus?

356
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,180
You're such a joker.

357
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,020
Was I joking?

358
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,460
Yes!

359
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,540
Well done!

360
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,700
You're getting more humorous these days.

361
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,100
What are you sneaking at over there?

362
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,340
Of course, you.

363
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,700
So beautiful. Can't I look?

364
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,900
What does that mean?

365
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,020
You're leaving tomorrow?

366
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,300
We won't see each other for a few days.

367
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,660
So I prepared some food and drinks

368
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,620
to see you off.

369
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,220
Come on,

370
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,100
let's toast

371
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,300
to your immediate success.

372
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,780
Thank you.

373
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,180
Why don't you

374
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,460
come with me?

375
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,580
I'll finish some work
at the company next days.

376
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,220
However,

377
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,940
I will go and cheer for you

378
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,940
before your final match.

379
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,460
A stronger vibe
of a female entrepreneur.

380
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:56,860
Come on,

381
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,900

572
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,820
is getting old,

573
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,260
and his nerves are shot.

574
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,780
If he keeps tiptoeing around like this,

575
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,620
how can he lead
the entire culinary world?

576
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,020
With my combo of moves,

577
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,180
I'll crush Qiao Zhi,

578
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,700
and push Huaixiang Group

579
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,380
into freefall.

580
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,060
I have absolute faith in your methods.

581
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,180
If all of Huaixiang Group's contestants

582
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,540
get knocked out in the first round,

583
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,700
what will the other shareholders think?

584
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,940
They'll try to sell
the original shares to us!

585
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
Don't worry about that.

586
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,260
Three people have contacted me.

587
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,780
They're envious

588
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,660
of Tao Rende's cash-out.

589
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,660
But you know,

590
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,420
acquiring so many shares at once

591
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,820
requires substantial capital.

592
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,220
By the way,

593
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,380
did you summon the person

594
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,580
I asked for?

595
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,620
He's arrived.

596
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,500
At the door.

597
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,860
I'll fetch him?

598
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,700
Let me go.

599

Why?

623
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,740
The more hype we build,

624
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,220
the more disappointment

625
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,580
when they fall short.

626
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,420

668
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,460
that Chinese culinary culture

669
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,580

is to showcase your culinary skills

699

This contestant

705
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,540
seems to have bad luck.

706
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,700
That means

707
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,060
he can't use salt

708
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,340
in his dish.

709
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,140
Seem Qiao Zhi's luck today

710
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,180
is really quite terrible.

711
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,860
His challenge is no salt!

712
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,860
Soy sauce could substitute for salt,

713
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,740
but it'll affect both flavor
and appearance,

714
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,220
inevitably impacting his final score.

715
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,140
Please give special attention

716
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,420

I don't want to see him

718
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,420
in the next round.

719
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,580
Since you've personally requested this,

720
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,540
it will be handled

721
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,740
accordingly.

722
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,540

I now declare
the competition officially begins!

729
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,380
Qiao Zhi uses fish sauce as salt.

730
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,220
Did you see that?

731
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,460
He chose fish sauce!

732
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,100
Indeed,

733
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,620
choosing fish sauce

734
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,740
is a smart move.

735
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,540
He can't use salt,

736
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,860
but he can select

737
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,540
seasonings that naturally carry

738
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,500
their briny flavor.

739
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,700
He shows real ingenuity!

740
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,740
Fish sauce has a strong fishy smell.

741
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,060
In Huaiyang cuisine,

742
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,820
it's not used as a seasoning.

743
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,820
If not handled properly,

744
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,020
the dish

745
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,500
could become unpalatable.

746
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,380
Viewers, we see

747
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,500
Qiao Zhi

748
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,940
has begun preparing his ingredients.

749
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,820
On his workstation

750
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,180
are hilsa herring, saury and pufferfish.

751
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,580
Is he going to make

752
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,100
Three Yangtze Delicacies today?

753
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,820
Removing the fishiness

754
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,220
won't be a problem for Qiao Zhi.

755
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,300
He always manages

756
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,060
to surprise me.

757
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,860
If only

758
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,340
Sihai could be here!

759
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,340
What's the point?

760
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,980
69 points?

761
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,140
Why is it so low?

762
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,780
My challenge is no salt.

763
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,700
I doubt

764
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,780
I'll make it to the next round.

765
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,660
How about you?

766
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,540
My is no oil,

767
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,460
scored 90,

768
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,500
but

769
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,020
not sure if that's enough
for the top eight.

770
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,660
Guess it depends on luck.

771
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,540
These challenges are brutal this time,

772
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,740
no oil or no salt...

773
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,540
Tell me about it.

774
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,620
Is he going

775
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,540
to make Three Yangtze Delicacies?

776
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,700
Exactly.

777
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,220
Saury, hilsa herring, and pufferfish

778
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,380
are the main ingredients
for this famous trio.

779
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,180
As judges here today,

780
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,860
we're setting tough challenges for them

781
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,780
but also

782
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,420
for ourselves.

783
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,620
Risking life for pufferfish?

784
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,500
That's thrilling.

785
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:19,940
Saury boasts

786
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,460
tender, refreshing flesh,

787
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,180
rich yet never cloying.

788
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,660
As recorded
in the Compendium of Materia Medica,

789
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,660
it was used to treat hemorrhoids

790
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,980
and replenish energy
while invigorating blood circulation.

791
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,020
Hilsa herring

792
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,180
is the king of fish.

793
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,820
There's a folk saying:
Braised shad delights both ends;

794
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,820
steamed shad could tempt immortals.

795
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,060
In the Compendium of Materia Medica,
pufferfish is toxic.

796
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,380
Its flavor may be exquisite,

797
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,620
but if improperly prepared, it can kill.

798
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,340
There are three critical steps

799
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,860
to transform pufferfish into edible.

800
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,420
First, properly handle the fresh fish.

801
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,700
Second, precisely control the heat.

802
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,780
Third, strictly separate utensils
during preparation.

803
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,940
Thus, its poison is thoroughly removed.

804
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,660
He won.

805
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,260
How do you know?

806
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,940
I've eaten this dish before.

807
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,380
It was an unforgettable experience.

808
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,060
Did Qiao Zhi make it for you?

809
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,220
When I became a sworn brother
with Sihai,

810
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,860
he personally prepared it.

811
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,220
Three Yangtze Delicacies is ready.

812
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,420
Let's now listen

813
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,740
to what the judges say

814
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,460
after tasting it.

815
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,620
I never imagined that

816
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,180
adding fish sauce to saury

817
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,700
would produce an extraordinary taste.

818
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,980
Melting in the mouth!

819
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,660
This clearly shows that the chef's

820
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,900
mastery of heat control

821
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,020
has reached its peak.

822
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,580
This dish

823
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,100
completely showcases

824
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,500
the strengths of shallow-water fish.

825
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,740
Excellent!

826
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,020
The steamed saury

827
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,740
is truly a masterpiece,

828
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,500
deserving of high marks.

829
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,620
As I chew,

830
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,140
the flavor of the fish scales
gradually unfolds in my mouth.

831
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,340
It's simply astonishing.

832
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,900
Truly exquisite

833
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,620
beyond words!

834
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,780
Judges, please score Qiao Zhi.

835
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,400
[Please score contestant Qiao Zhi]

836

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,340
If these scores are too low,

839
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,820
I'm afraid it won't convince everyone.

[Zhao Zai 23.5 points]

final total score is 97.5 points.

843
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,860
Congratulations!

844
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,140
Thank you, esteemed judges.

845

[Contestant Qiao Zhi's
total score: 97.5 points]

846
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,180
What should we do now?

847
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:50,980
Well.

848
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,300
How to explain this to the company?

849
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,500
It's utterly humiliating!

850
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,700
How'd it go, Hao?

851
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,060
Eliminated

852
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,780
with just 59 points!

853
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,300
Guess

854
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,180
what challenge I got?

855
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,300
No salt!

856
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,860
Two of my metal spatulas broke

857
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,660
during the whole competition.

858
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,580
Can you imagine

859
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,900
how unlucky that makes me?

860
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,340
Could this

861
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,140
be targeted at our group?

862
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,020
Qiao Zhi,

863
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,380
you're now the last hope
of Huaixiang Group.

864
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,300
I admitted

865
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,780
before this,

866
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,380
we had some tension between us.

867
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,460
But please set aside
our past differences

868
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,900
and fight for the honor

869
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,060
of all chefs in this competition!

870
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,580
Please.

871
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,260
Don't be like this.

872
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,300
You just had bad luck.

873
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,060
Competitions

874
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,500
are meant to have winners and losers.

875
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,420
I'll do my best.

876
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,060
Good.

877
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,860
With those words, I can rest easy.

878
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,500
If there's anything you need,

879
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,700
just give us orders.

880
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,740
We'll support you however we can.

881
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:05,860
Thank you.

882
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,340
Ms. Tao,

883
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,860
the preliminary results are in.

884
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:18,780
Go ahead.

885
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,740
We only have Qiao Zhi advancing.

886
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,500
Even Hao Wang got eliminated.

887
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,380
Both of them got

888
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,060
the no salt challenge!

889
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,620
I feel someone targeted us.

890
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,740
They hyped us up beforehand,

891
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,460
only to knock out our contestants now.

892
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,460
Online backlash is fierce right now.

893
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,900
Through challenges alone,

894
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,140
they tried to eliminate us
in the first round.

895
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,380
Seems

896
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,300
they underestimated Qiao Zhi.

897
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,860
You mean

898
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,940
Baiwei Group rigged this?

899
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,220
What do you think?

900
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,220
He made it to the elimination round?

901
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,980
Can you do your job properly?

902
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,140
I gave him the lowest possible score.

903
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
If mine is much lower

904
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,980
than the other judges',

905
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,340
that won't look right.

906
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,620
Loser!

907
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,380
Except for Qiao Zhi,

908
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,300
the rest is roughly as expected.

909
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,860
Wu Linfeng ranked first
in the first round

910
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,900
with 99.5 points,

911
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,300
while Deng Daxian and Shi He

912
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,260
tied for second with 98 points.

913
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,420
Exactly.

914
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,380
Wu Linfeng is the clear front-runner

915
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,020
to win at the moment.

916
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,140
In the semi-final stage,

917
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,460
it'll be the peak
of the odds of an upset.

918
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,420
At all gambling platforms,

919
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,340
80 million

920
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,940
to buy Wu Linfeng out.

921
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:39,780
What?

922
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,860
I thought

923
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,100
he was our seeded champion.

924
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,420
Mr. Zhan's move is controlling the loss.

925
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,180
Controlling loss means winning.

926
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,620
Based on my experience,

927
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,740
Mr. Zhan

928
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,140
has two cards in his hand,

929
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,100
one open and the other hidden.

930
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,300
The open one is Wu Linfeng.

931
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,620
No wonder you're an actuary.

932
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,260
You're extremely knowledgeable.

933
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,140
The gambling platforms

934
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,980
may lose everything.

935
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,340
Hurry and get it done.

936
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,980
You'll get your share.

937
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,860
Okay.

938
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,580
Go.

939
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:26,820
Mr. Jin,

940
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,300
help me one more time.

941
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,020
You shouldn't be calling me now.

942
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,180
You should know

943
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,420
how many eyes

944
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,700
are watching us judges.

945
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,900
At the finals,

946
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,380
help me out.

947
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,660
I can only do my best to help you,

948
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,580
but don't expect me
to cross my bottom line

949
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,500
or betray my integrity.

950
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,340
I heard

951
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,420
your daughter

952
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,780
is studying in Australia, right?

953
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,740
It just occurred to me

954
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,380
that I have an empty property there.

955
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,380
She studies

956
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,820
abroad alone

957
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,500
and must feel

958
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,420
so insecure.

959
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,180
You…

960
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,460
I can send someone

961
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,620
to act as her live-in caretaker

962
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,740
to look after her very well.

963
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,220
What do you say?

964
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,620
Okay.

965
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:15,940
What's the request?

966
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,700
Three Yangtze Delicacies.

967
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,580
Are you pulling my leg

968
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,620
like Qiao Taigong Fishing?

969
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,620
They're bound to come after me.

970
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,500
Only you

971
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,620
can resolve this situation.

972
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,940
After all,

973
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,500
Baiwei Group

974
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,500
was nurtured by your hands.

975
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,220
Though I said it's

976
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,900
a frank discussion today,

977
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,900
must you

978
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,500
be so frank?

979
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,620
Are you here to accuse me?

980
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,260
Of course not.

981
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,620
Even without Baiwei Group

982
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,620
or Zhan Jun,

983
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,940
others would target Canteen.

984
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,700
Capital

985
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:06,980
has no humanity.

986
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,100
You just graduated.

987
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,460
How do you know this?

988
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,940
I worked for Huasheng Group

989
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,420
in Singapore for several years

990
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,940
and saw things there

991
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,860
far more brutal than here.

992
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,380
That's

993
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,140
what you call vile capitalism.

994
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
You're right.

995
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,460
Whether it was me back then

996
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,860
or Zhan Jun now,

997
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,300
we're nothing

998
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,380
more than public faces.

999
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,220
Years ago,

1000
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,900
I pleaded with your grandfather

1001
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,860
to open up Canteen's shares

1002
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,540
and grow the pie bigger.

1003
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,980
Otherwise,

1004
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,900
we were blocking others' path to wealth.

1005
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,140
You know your grandpa well.

1006
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,740
All that's on his mind

1007
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,140
is cooking.

1008
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,060
He's a craftsman.

1009
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,100
Yes.

1010
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,620
For what happened back then,

1011
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,020
while I didn't do it,

1012
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,940
I failed to stop it.

1013
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,060
I intended to bring

1014
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,220
Sihai into my restaurant,

1015
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,380
but unexpectedly,

1016
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,620
he passed away from depression.
