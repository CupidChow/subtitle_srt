Most importantly,

385
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,180
I'm earning more than ever before!

386
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,660
I know!

387
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
I never expected

388
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,260
Canteen to grow this fast.

389
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,140
Right.

390
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,940
When I first met Zhi,

391
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,020
I thought

392
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,460
he was going places.

393
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,420
Honestly, you've got real talent too.

394
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,780
In less than two months,

395
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,180
your cooking skills
have improved incredibly.

396
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,060
Yes.

397
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,020
You know what?

398
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,140
Zhi's incredibly nice to me.

399
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,780
He willingly teaches me

400
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,100
everything he knows unconditionally.

401
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,060
You know what?

402
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,300
In this industry,

403
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,740
everyone guards their trade secrets.

404
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,020
No one reveals their true skills.

405
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,140
No one will share

406
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,220
everything freely

407
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,340
like Zhi does.

408
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,820
Honestly.

409
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,540
He even gave me a bonus!

410
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,540
Made me feel embarrassed!

411
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,180
That's why I said

412
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,460
he is built for greatness.

413
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,420
He is visionary,

414
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,100
right?

415
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,700
Go ahead.

416
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,620
I mean

417
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,220
Zhi is visionary.

418
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,020
But I must add this.

419
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,860
Well.

420
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,300
You need

421
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,820
to strive harder

422
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,180
to elevate the small bites

423
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,100
and desserts

424
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,820
to greater taste perfection.

425
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,460
I feel I'll never reach

426
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,700
your level or Mr. Qiao's.

427
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,060
I just don't have cooking talent.

428
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,420
Look at yourself.

429
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,860
Don't underestimate yourself.

430
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,860
Do you know?

431
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,220
Let's be real.

432
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,220
Take this restaurant for example.

433
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,220
Look,

434
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,940
you've got culinary skills

435
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,140
and resources.

436
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,580
And you

437
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,980
are pretty!

438
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,620
Right?

439
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,300
If you keep learning and working hard,

440
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,420
you'll soar high eventually.

441
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,860
Really?

442
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,140
Absolutely!

443
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,700
See?

444
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,660
Can I have a sip?

445
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,980
You want to drink alcohol?

446
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,220
Have them bring a bottle.

447
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,380
There's none left.

448
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,820
Now, only you're willing to help me.

449
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,220
Yan,

450
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,860
if you don't mind,

451
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,860
let's be bound together for life.

452
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,700
I know you've wanted to settle here.

453
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,620
We'll buy a big villa someday,

454
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,060
living the good life together.

455
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,540
Deal.

456
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,580
Wait, don't laugh. I mean every word!

457
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,820
I,

458
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,180
I can swear an oath!

459
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,220
Heaven above bears witness!

460
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,300
I, Bao Tong, solemnly declare

461
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,860
that every word I spoke to Yan

462
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
came straight from my heart.

463
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,700
If I break this promise,
may I never cook again,

464
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,580
and never see Yan again.

465
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,180
Will you accept?

466
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:23,860
Yes.

467
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,140
Yes.

468
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:26,940
Cheers.

469
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:27,940
Cheers.

470
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,940
This is the one!

471
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:03,980
Careful now.

472
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,660
Here. Hand it to me.

473
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,100
You buried these jars five years ago.

474
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,220
Precisely.

475
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,580
What is in it?

476
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,860
In here

477
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,380
is something delicious.

478
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,540
You're busy.

479
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,940
What brings you all the way for me?

480
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,220
Open it and you'll see.

481
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,900
Did you make this?

482
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
Premium Aged Mustard Greens.

483
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,020
Our family has always made this.

484
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,620
Can't let the tradition die with me.

485
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,700
Premium Aged Mustard Greens

486
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,900
require three rounds
of purification and washing,

487
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,060
followed by three cycles
of salting and pressing.

488
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,740
I knew you must've tasted it!

489
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,980
My grandpa loved making this.

490
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,180
Yes!

491
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,140
Back then,

492
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,260
when I lost my appetite,

493
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,420
eating this with rice porridge

494
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,540
could instantly reignite

495
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,660
my hunger!

496
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,660
It's prepared by hand in ancient ways.

497
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,980
Though labor-intensive,

498
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,980
its flavors

499
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,860
are worlds apart from store-bought!

500
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,660
I want this gift

501
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,020
so badly,

502
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,100
yet I dare not accept.

503
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,420
Don't worry.

504
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,540
Enjoy it.

505
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,140
I guarantee this won't run out again.

506
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,700
I see.

507
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,060
Exactly as I remember.

508
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,380
I missed it so much.

509
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:41,980
Good.

510
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,980
As long as you like it.

511
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,540
By the way,

512
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,700
I noticed you've

513
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,740
made quite a few waves lately.

514
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,660
Your co-branded zone

515
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,020
with Huaixiang Group

516
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,100
has earned you handsome profits.

517
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Even I got a cut of the dividends!

518
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,740
Is what I've done

519
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,300
a bit excessive?

520
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,860
This has cost me several alliances.

521
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,020
I'm considering whether to tone down

522
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,940
for the next competition.

523
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,580
But youth should be excessive.

524
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,740
Go all out!

525
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,060
Never forget

526
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,020
you have me in your corner.

527
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,460
Understood.

528
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,820
I won't bring you shame

529
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
nor cause you trouble.

530
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,060
Your restaurant seems saturated now.

531
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,340
Any expansion plans

532
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,060
or franchising?

533
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,140
Indeed.

534
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,820
Daily revenue hits around 300,000.

535
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,140
We've reached capacity.

536
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,980
My strategy focuses on

537
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,260
having Canteen refine its dishes,

538
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,220
distributing through the Eight Great
Restaurants and pre-made food channels.

539
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,260
Impressive!

540
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,540
Lifting half an industry
toward prosperity!

541
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,740
Wealth shared is wealth multiplied.

542
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,700
Actually,

543
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,620
I want to focus more

544
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,620
on cooking.

545
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,780
You know

546
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,860
business

547
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,540
just isn't my forte.

548
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,260
Boy,

549
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,260
you take after your grandpa.

550
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,900
Yeah,

551
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,300
I even got framed like him.

552
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,220
What do you mean?

553
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,700
During the competition,

554
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,900
someone replaced my meat

555
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,420
with spoiled cuts.

556
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,060
Can you believe the coincidence?

557
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,260
Back in his day,

558
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,180
my grandpa was ruined
by subpar ingredients too.

559
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,260
But it doesn't matter.

560
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,180
Learning from history,

561
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,100
I opened

562
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,180
the Canteen's doors wide.

563
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,620
Even if sabotage comes again,

564
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,740
I've got behind me

565
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,140
the Huaixiang Group,

566
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,180
the Huasheng Group,

567
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:33,980
the Eight Great Restaurants,

568
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,700
Kuaiyin,

569
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,900
and most vitally,

570
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,380
your support.

571
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
There's more to this than words.

572
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:44,900
Very well.

573
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,180
I'll speak with the Zhan family.

574
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,740
I didn't intend

575
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,140
that meaning!

576
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,260

827
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,540

she started bartending after graduation.

855
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,740

857
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,380
And how did you

858
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,860
get mixed up with Mu Xiao?

859
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,780
Do you realize her status?

860
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,780
Why would someone like her

861
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,820

862
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,980
How do you explain?

863
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,140
Mom,

883
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:47,700
Spit it out.

885
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,620
What happened?

886
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,940
I never hurt you in all these years.

887

888
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,380
I don't understand? Am I hurting you?

889
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,420
Cut the act!

890
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,780
You leaked my photos with Qiao Zhi.

891
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,620
And that password I always use.

892

895

902
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,980
Only you could have taken a photo
from that angle.

903

Never mind.

Tell us the truth right now,

912
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,220
or wait for the police to contact you.

913

We've officially opened

914

of stealing a company's
financial password?

918
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,540
I'll say it one more time.

919
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,620
I did not steal your password.

920
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,700
Right.

921
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,860
A best friend would never do that.

922
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,380
I think we're wasting our time

with a person like her.

924

Don't stay in the dorm tonight.

925

I'm worried someone might sneak
a photo of you in bed,

926
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,540
edit it, and frame Master.

Go.

935
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,940
As we were friends,

936
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
I'll give you one last piece of advice.

937
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,460

00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,580
Turns out

959
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,380
he's been pulling dirty tricks behind.

960
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,900
Who knows what the group executives

961
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,820
are thinking in the end?

962
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,540
Sharing the stage with him

963
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,980
is the greatest insult to us!

964
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,620
He should be kicked out of Huaixiang.

965
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,900
He's finished this time.

966
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,940
The group would never send him

967
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,700
to represent them

968
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,620
at the King of Chefs Championship.

969
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,180
Zhi's in trouble!

970
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,340
I already know.

971
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,540
Why are you still sitting here?

972
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,740
Figure this out now!

973
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,580
He would never do such a thing.

974
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,700
Someone's framing him.

975
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,020
Do you believe him?

976
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Of course, I do!

977
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,900
Even if everyone else doesn't,

978
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,940
I will believe him.

979
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,380
You don't believe him?

980
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,180
He is my husband.

981
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,340
Of course, I do!

982
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,340
Clearly, someone tried to stop him
from competing.

983
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,060
I think

984
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,540
Han Bin was behind this.

985
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,980
The photo he took of me matches
the earlier one.

986
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,180
Han Bin?

987
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,060
But wasn't he locked up?

988
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,180
Someone must be behind him.

989
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,500
Hello, Mr. Song.

990
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,500
The executives are heading
to the hospital for Ms. Tao.

991
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,820
They want Qiao Zhi fired.

992
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,980
Got it.

993
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,220
Oh, no.

994
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,980
If Mom finds out, we're finished!

995
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,380
Think they can destroy him

996
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,860
that easily?

[Letter of Protest]

999
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,300
Ms. Tao,

1000
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,820
this is a letter of protest

1001
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,060
from all the chefs
under the Huaixiang Group.

1002
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,460
We unanimously agree
that Qiao Zhi's conduct

1003
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,580
has damaged the company's image.

1004
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,740
He does not deserve to compete.

1005
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,740
Xue is too young.

1006
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,900
Qiao Zhi must have fed her

1007
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,140
some kind of love potion,

1008
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,180
and now she's lost in a daze,

1009
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,140
neglecting her duties!

1010
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,300
If this keeps up,

1011
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,420
our group

1012
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,380

One rotten apple spoils
the whole barrel.

1014
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,580
Now, I won't tell others

1015
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,660
I'm from the Huaixiang Group.

1016
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,940
Yes.

Rumor has it
he's even seeing actresses.

1021
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:34,740
He's become

1022
