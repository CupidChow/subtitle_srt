Could it be

342
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
that he was the one who carved
the Wensi Tofu?

And

369
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,220

it's only a supplementary aspect.

379

While this is a home-cooked dish,

Can you not add tofu
to Minced Pork with Eggplant?

Well, you can.

393
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,060
But adding another ingredient

394
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,340
changes the dish's name.

395
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,700
It could affect the scoring.

it'll hurt his score.

to handle the pork now.

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,140
and the technique
for making the vegetarian meat

749
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,060
was lost.

750
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,500
I've seen many techniques
for making vegetarian meat

751
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,300
from tofu before.

752
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,300
But compared to this dish,

753
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,580
they all lack depth.

754
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,180
Take us actors, for example.

755
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,260
I've eaten a lot of vegetarian meat

756
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,580
to stay in shape.

757
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,300
But they're nowhere near as good

758
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,020
as this dish.

759
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,340
Turning Minced Pork with Eggplant
into a vegetarian dish.

760
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,060
It fits perfectly
with the current weight-loss market.

761
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,060
You have to admit,

762
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,580
Huaixiang Group's marketing department

763
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,980
is very sharp.

764
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,260
They quickly grasped
the essence of this dish.

765
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,260
This will help them
capture the market fast.

766
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,340
It seems Mr. Qiao

767
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,380
always surprises us in different ways.

768
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,460
Huaixiang Group really found a gem.

769
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,820
Speaking of which,
Qiao Zhi owes you such a big favor.

770
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,620
Isn't he going to thank you?

771
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,460
Right!

772
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,700
You just reminded me.

773
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,580
Hello?

774
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,300
Hello, Mr. Qiao.

775
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,700
Are your manners

776
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,740
a bit off?

777
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,060
I did you such a big favor,

778
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,220
and I have to come asking for my reward?

779
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,940
Sorry about that.

780
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,700
I've been busy
with the competition lately.

781
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,340
How about this?

782
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,020
Come to Canteen tomorrow.

783
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,340
My treat, as an apology.

784
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,140
Fine.

785
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,300
Glad you have a conscience.

786
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,100
See you tomorrow.

787
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,580
Was that Mu Xiao?

788
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,220
Are you free tomorrow? Join us.

789
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,580
Okay.

790
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,420
We should indeed thank her properly.

791
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,700
By the way,

792
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,500
you're coming to

793
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,660
pick me up.

794
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,300
Won't my sister get jealous?

795
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,660
She told me to pick you up.

796
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,060
If you're picking me up,

797
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,380
why are you in the passenger seat?

798
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,020
I...

799
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,140
I just don't like driving.

800
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,460
And some men don't like driving?

801
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,740
By the way,

802
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,060
you must have a fair amount
in your accounts now.

803
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,900
Why don't you buy a car?

804
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,500
You're a boss, after all.

805
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,940
Buying a car for appearances
is necessary.

806
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,020
I'm in the start-up phase.

807
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,180
Save where we can.

808
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,140
Besides,

809
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,940
buying a car isn't like buying a house.

810
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,260
Cars depreciate
and are a constant expense.

811
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,580
Then why hasn't the mileage changed

812
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,060
while I was away,

813
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,620
and you had the car?

814
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,140
Why didn't you drive?

815
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,820
I get it now.

816
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,580
It's not that you don't like driving.

817
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,580
You're actually afraid to drive,
aren't you?

818
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,860
Because your skills are terrible?

819
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,980
Am I right?

820
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,340
What do you mean you're right?

821
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,700
I... How could I...?

822
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,300
Fine.

823
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:47,860
I...

824
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,380
I'm afraid to drive.

825
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,220
So what?

826
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,780
Anyway, I always have people
to drive me.

827
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,100
A grown man afraid to drive.

828
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,980
That's rarer than a fear of heights.

829
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,660
Alright.

830
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,580
What kind of person would mock
their own brother-in-law?

831
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,700
Okay, I'll stop laughing.

832
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:06,940
By the way,

833
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,780
did my sister

834
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,420
go to cheer you on at the competition?

835
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,380
No.

836
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,580
Her position is a bit sensitive.

837
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,180
To avoid

838
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,620
gossip.

839
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,900
She's so pretentious.

840
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,260
What's the big deal?

841
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,580
You are her husband.

842
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,500
Alright.

843
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,780
You just focus on driving.

844
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,500
Watch the road.

845
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,580
How have things been
at Shengtang lately?

846
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,740
Not bad.

847
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,300
I heard your business trip is
for recording a variety show?

848
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,940
I think you should
do fewer variety shows.

849
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,180
You moved from influencer to showbiz.

850
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,700
While variety shows bring quick money,

851
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,900
they use up

852
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,100
your novelty value with the audience.

853
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,340
Look at those veteran actors.

854
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
They don't appear in public too often.

855
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,500
You need to learn

856
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,940
to value your own image, just like them.

857
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,900
Do you know how long it's been

858
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,220
since I last updated my short videos?

859
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,420
If I were really just in it
for the money,

860
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,220
I wouldn't have joined Shengtang at all.

861
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,140
I made much more as an influencer

862
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,060
than I do now as an actress!

863
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,900
These variety shows are all the result

864
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,260
of discussions with my company.

865
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,780
Besides,

866
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,500
those veteran actors you mentioned

867
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,940
are only qualified to wait
for the right opportunities

868
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,980
after building up

869
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,260
a certain level of skill and popularity.

870
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,260
If I stayed home

871
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,340
like them,

872
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,300
no one would know me

873
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
or offer me roles.

874
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,260
If you're really embarrassed

875
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,020
that I'm on variety shows,

876
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,860
then

877
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,580
don't tell people I'm your sister
from now on.

878
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,060
That way,

879
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,900
you can protect your glorious,

880
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,700
upstanding image out there!

881
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,820
That's two different things,
Tao Rushuang!

882
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,100
After Mom got sick,

883
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,460
do you have any idea how many people

884
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,100
are eyeing our family's assets?

885
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,500
What are you doing?

886
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,420
Nothing.

887
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,060
I just feel like

888
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,860
such a failure.

889
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,140
What's the use of my
being so good at cooking?

890
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,580
I still can't get you two
to stop bickering.

891
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,660
Try this.

892
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,940
This is a gift
I specially prepared for you.

893
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,420
You bought this just for me?

894
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,580
Yes.

895
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,700
Just for you.

896
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,140
One of a kind.

897
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,580
Lipstick?

898
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,660
Have you ever seen
a grown man use lipstick?

899
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,460
Plenty.

900
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,300
All the guys I know use lipstick.

901
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,820
The men in your circle
are a bit different.

902
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,660
You

903
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
didn't buy this for me, did you?

904
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,860
If I say it's for you now,

905
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,940
then it's for you.

906
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,140
You

907
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,580
should give this
to your sister yourself.

908
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,140
Speaking of which,
you really should thank her properly.

909
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,300
Why should I?

910
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,980
Look at her, so arrogant!

911
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,500
It annoys me just looking at her.

912
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,940
You still don't know, do you?

913
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,420
She...

914
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,460
If you're choking, drink some water.

915
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,620
Even if she coughs,
I'm still going to say it.

916
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,780
For you,

917
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,620
she specifically

918
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,060
went to the Ninghai TV station

919
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,620
to place ads for your show.

920
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,020
Why?

921
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,460
Just so the directors

922
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,140
would give you, a newcomer, more care

923
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,180
and screen time.

924
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,300
Turns out

925
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,260
you performed quite well.

926
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,700
The directors

927
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,260
and senior folks on the show
really liked you.

928
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,020
They said your highlight moments

929
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,300
were too good to cut.

930
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,660
So her ad investment

931
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,700
wasn't in vain.

932
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,260
Don't overthink it.

933
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,780
