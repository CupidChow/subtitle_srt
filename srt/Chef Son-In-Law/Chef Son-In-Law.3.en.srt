Here to visit Mr. Xu.

38
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,420
Fine.

39
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,620
Stop crying over spilled milk.

to the ingredients or not,

A shady establishment
like Huaixiang Restaurant

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,380
ought to be shut down for good.

Let me tell you something.

51
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
Don't make

52
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,860

I think

62
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,700
this is a scam

63
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,500
to smear Huaixiang Group.

64
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,700
How can you be so unreasonable?

65
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,740
Mr. Xu fell ill after eating your food,

66
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,140
yet you accuse us of scamming.

67
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,980
He's had epilepsy for long

68
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,220
and should avoid many foods.

69
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,060
I'm sure he knows this best.

70
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,260
He knowingly ate foods
he should have avoided.

71
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,860
Isn't this a scam?

72
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,500
Alright, let's get back to basics.

73
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,420
Mr. Xu definitely knows

74
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,700
what he must avoid eating.

75
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,260
If this wasn't a staged scam,

76
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,940
there'll be only one explanation.

77
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,340
He was overwhelmed by his craving!

78
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,860
And that'll make

79
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,140
perfect sense though.

80
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,740
No wonder folks in the industry

81
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,820
call him Food Fanatic.

Don't push your luck!

83
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,620
Even if he was overwhelmed by cravings,

84
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,220
he wouldn't risk his own life.

85
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,180
Now get lost!

86
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,500
No shouting.

87
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,220
Quiet please. This is a hospital.

89
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,220

97
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,620

106
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,940
Still here?

107
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,380
How lively!

108
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,980
Mr. Chen,

109
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,140
what brings you here?

110
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,620
To conduct a consultation
for Xu Hexiang.

111
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,180
He is a giant among TCM experts.

112
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,300
Who is family of Xu Hexiang?

113
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,580
I'm his assistant.

114
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,820
Qiao, let's go together!

115
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,740
Mr. Chen,

116
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,900
she came with me.

117
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,420
Who are you?

118
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,260
Mr. Chen,

119
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,420
I'm Zhan Shikun from Baiwei Group.

120
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,100
Don't know you.

121
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,620
Non-staff aren't allowed
to loiter at the hospital.

122
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,380
Get out.

123
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,980
Still here?

124
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,220
Mr. Zhu,

125
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,340
this sudden?

126
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,820
In Vol. 24, Qianjin Yaofang
of Sun Simiao,

127
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,580
and other works
specifically discussing diet therapy

128
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,660
recorded some medicinal foods

129
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,820
and medicinal diet prescriptions.

130
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,820
TCM has always emphasized

131
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,300
treatment with medicine pales

132
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,620
before diet therapy.

133
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,740
Qiao,

134
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,940
sounds like

135
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,420
you've figured out why the patient

136
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,300
took a sudden turn for the worse.

137
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,820
Why not

138
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,500
share your thoughts with us?

139
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,980
What could he say?

140
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,620
Probably nonsense.

141
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,540
Mr. Chen,

142
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,020
as a giant among TCM experts,

143
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,860
don't be fooled by a layman's wild talk.

144
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,380
Hear him out.

145
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,900
It won't hurt.

146
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,980
Moreover,

147
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,940
he isn't a layman.

148
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,940
We've exchanged ideas repeatedly.

149
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,860
Turns out he's an expert.

150
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,300
Okay.

151
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,900
Epilepsy is also known
as a seizure disorder.

152
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,260
Its patients should avoid many foods,

153
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,260
and one of them is mutton.

154
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,380
Mr. Xu

155
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,740
can't be unaware of this fact.

156
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,020
According to today's order sheet,

157
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
he requested

158
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,940
dock mutton soup,

159
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,420
today's main course.

160
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,140
The soup stands
among China's Four Great Mutton Dishes.

161
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,780
It's our signature specialty.

162
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,100
Mr. Xu

163
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,900
devoured two bowls of it.

164
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Indeed, mutton is recognized

165
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,980
as a potential trigger for epilepsy.

166
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,540
If you're content

167
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,540
to sit here listening to his nonsense,

168
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,500
there'll be nothing more I can do.

169
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,860
But Mr. Xu remains unconscious.

170
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,060
If your hospital

171
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
can't bring him back to health,

172
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,660
we

173
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,340
have to transfer him elsewhere.

174
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,340
Even if God

175
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,540
couldn't wake someone
who's feigning sleep.

176
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,860
What do you mean?

177
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,540
Epilepsy is hard to cure completely.

178
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,380
He'll have recurrences.

179
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,020
Whether to continue

180
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,180
rehabilitation here at our facility,

181
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,740
we'll decide after he fully

182
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,580
regains consciousness.

183
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,860
Qiao, let's go.

184
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,060
Mr. Chen.

185
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,100
What's going on?

186
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,820
This hospital is just unprofessional!

187
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,980
What a mess.

188
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,780
I'm contacting

189
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,220
the best facility in Xunyang right away.

190
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,100
Don't bother.

191
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,260
The doctor just said

Nothing will change wherever we go.

194

Mr. Xu, you're awake!

195
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,020
Let me help you up.

196
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,060

Xu Hui,

201
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,180
step outside for a moment.

202
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,780
I need to talk with Du Gang.

203
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,220
Fine.

204
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,420
Should've seen this coming.

205
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,740
You approached her
with ulterior motives.

206
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,580
I've done everything you asked，

207
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,060
so hand over her photos.

208
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,020
Mr. Xu,

209
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,820
this isn't over yet.

210
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,780
Stay here for a few more days.

211
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,340
You promised

212
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,020
not to let her know the truth

213
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,380
and never harm here again.

214
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,300
Mr. Xu,

215
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,340
you sure do take care of her,

217
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,500
like shadows.

218
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,340
Outsiders would never guess

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
you two are just meal pal!

220
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,540
Among all the people in the world,

221
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,060
how rare it is to find someone
who shares

222
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,660
your taste buds and rhythm of life.

223
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,060
No wonder you're called Food Fanatic!

Baiwei Group asked you

225
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,740
to use me to slander Huaixiang?

226
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,860
Don't trouble yourself about that.

230
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,660
I'm so sorry.

[Outpatient Building]
Whether you were right or not,

232
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,900
our chance of reconciling

233
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,140
with him is completely dead.

234
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,260
Honestly, at your age,

235
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,420
how can you still be so naive?

236
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,580
They clearly set us up.

237
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,020
No way they'd make peace with you.

238
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,220
As a giant in his industry,

239
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,940
he'd never stoop to scam us.

240
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,140
Of course not.

241
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,340
But that man beside him seemed flustered

242
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,420
after I hit the nail on the head.

243
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,780
I guess next he'll

244
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,620
sow discord between them.

245
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,140
Stop being so self-righteous!

Never expected that.

Why such a massive drop in sales?

255
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,220
Lately there's been chatter online

I asked the media
to take down those articles,

260
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,140
but they flatly refused.

261
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,380
Mr. Song,

262
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,180
I'm convinced someone

263
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,900
is sabotaging behind the scenes.

264
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,980
Just now when I arrived at the hospital,

265
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,620
a pack of reporters ambushed me.

266
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,420
And they already knew

267
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,820
I'd just become Acting CEO.

268
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,540
You suspect

269
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,540
there's a mole inside?

270
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,580
Every executive and shareholder

271

272
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,140
Can't blame them really.

273

Who wouldn't jump at cashing out?

274
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,500
But as my mom changed her mind,

275
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,860

Xu Hexiang to be so protective
of Xu Hui

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,340
that he was fooled by a few nude photos.

Let me tell you,

306
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,260
Xu Hui is in her 30s,

307

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,060
I'm afraid Xu Hexiang is too old
to enjoy her.

310
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,140
He definitely can't compare with you.

Mr. Xu was coerced by Du Gang
and the others.

As long as he testifies for us,

334
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,180
we won't hold him accountable.

335
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,340
Additionally,

But

339
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,580
I'm very curious about

340
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,460
how you discovered Du Gang.

341
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,900
It was Qiao Zhi.

343
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,260
Yes.

344
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,340
He waited for me at the hospital gate

345
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,220
and told me

346
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,980
Du Gang and his crew
would celebrate tonight.

347
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,860
So I secretly followed them to the bar.

since you have to avoid many foods,

00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,700
Here's your prize.

571
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,260
Take it please.

572
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,380
Quickly now.

573
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,860
If I ever see you again,

574
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,980
I won't let you go.

575
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,100
Yes, deal with him next time.

576
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,460
Alright, please stop staring.

577
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,620
Form a queue
and it'll be your turn soon.

578
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,700
Did he make

579
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,300
that Wensi tofu?

580
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,100
But he has no reason to help me.

581
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,320
[Huaixiang Group]

582
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,820
The event was quite successful!

583
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,380
Indeed.

584
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,180
No one saw this coming.

585
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,060
Truly impressive.

586
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,940
Welcome!

587
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,220
Please have a seat.

588
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,940
This event

589
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,180
absolutely smashed it.

590
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,380
Who would've guessed?

591
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,180
Young Ms. Tao is so experienced

592
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,860
in handling this matter.

593
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,860
Yes.

594
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,220
Thanks to our Brand department,

595
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,980
they pulled all-nighters
to ensure it went so smoothly.

596
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,900
Honestly,

597
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,420
you gave significant help.

598
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,300
Heavy smell of liquor.

599
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,300
Must've drunk a lot
at the bar last night.

600
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,580
Mr. Song,

601
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,980
once Du Gang's confession comes out,

602
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,580
make sure to back it up.

603
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,060
We've arranged for it.

604
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:47,860
Right,

605
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,340
how's supplier switching going?

606
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,460
Among the listed suppliers,

607
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,660
we've contacted five or six so far,

608
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,140
but none agreed on acceptable pricing.

609
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,500
Only Baiwei Group

610
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,660
is willing to cooperate.

611
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,100
[Singapore Huasheng International Group]

612
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,780
This is a well-known global supplier

613
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,420
called Huasheng Group.

614
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,100
Everyone here

615
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,140
might not be familiar with them.

616
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,380
But this group

617
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,020
focuses on the catering industry

618
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,060
across Southeast Asia,
Europe and America,

619
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,020
supplying all kinds of ingredients.

620
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,700
I do know Huasheng Group.

621
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,020
The founder is of Chinese descent.

622
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,020
Their ingredients are top-notch.

623
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,580
Many high-end hotels abroad work

624
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,980
with them for this reason.

625
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,460
However, their prices

626
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,860
are notoriously high.

627
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,420
I heard they recently established

628
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,140
a subsidiary in China.

629
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,900
Perhaps we could try working with them?

630
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,700
Forget about foreign companies.

631
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,500
It'll take at least a year or two
to finalize.

632
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,740
I think we should give it a shot;

633
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,740
there's always a chance!

634
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,860
But Mr. Tao is right.

635
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,140
Instead of wasting time on that,

636
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,100
we'd better focus on domestic suppliers.

637
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:48,740
Don't you agree?

638
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,260
Absolutely.

639
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,500
No one is willing to do it, right?

640
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,300
Alright then.

641
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,740
I'll take care of the negotiations.

642
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,580
Shikun,

643
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,940
impressive.

644
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,460
Living up to your title
as the Ballad Prince.

645
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:02,940
Thanks!

646
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,260
Shikun is still young.

647
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,900
As his senior,

648
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,100
you shouldn't praise him like that.

649
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,260
Who knows?

650
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,780
We might end up as a family someday.

651
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,500
Yes, you're right.

652
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,340
But I don't think

653
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,700
Xue is quite good enough for him.

654
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,780
Look! Shikun

655
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,140
is a fine young man!

656
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,940
You flatter him too much.

657
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,580
I fell head over heels

658
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,260
for Tao Ruxue the moment we met.

659
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,180
It was truly love at first sight.

660
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,980
No one could change his mind.

661
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,340
Now that he's grown up,

662
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,340
it's time

663
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,740
we stop meddling.

664
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,060
Right!

665
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,580
Nanfang

666
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,620
once agreed to the merger deal.

667
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,100
How could she suddenly back out?

668
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,700
If not for that,

669
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,260
we'd have been family by now!

670
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,300
Look.

671
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,020
Dong Hao

672
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,700
is riding high these days!

673
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,700
Part of me admires him,

674
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,740
part envies him.

675
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,780
All thanks to Mr. Zhan's support.

676
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,580
Now I finally understand what they mean

677
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,060
by great trees are good for shade.

678
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,500
Hao is my junior apprentice.

679
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,500
We're

680
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,900
already like family!

681
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,900
Naturally,

682
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,580
we also hope that someday

683
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,500
we could become true kin with you.

684
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,780
Fingers crossed!

685
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,820
Here's to it!

686
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,820
Cheers!

687
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:13,860
Let's toast!

688
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,020
In a while,

689
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,380
I'll be heading abroad
for overseas operations.

690
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,500
For domestic matters,

691
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,380
Hao,

692
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,620
please lend Shikun a hand.

693
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,620
Don't worry.

694
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,100
Dad,

695
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,420
where are you going?

696
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,940
The CEO of Huasheng Group

697
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,940
invited me to join his inspection tour.

698
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,900
I believe

699
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,340
this is a good chance for us
to expand into overseas markets.

700
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,340
But Huasheng Group

701
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,340
is our competitor though.

702
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,500
In business,

703
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,020
there are no competitors,

704
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,580
only shared interests.

705
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,220
Shikun,

706
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,660
always remember

707
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
never to act unilaterally
without consultation.

708
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,980
When challenges arise,

709
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,700
discuss them with the board.

710
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,780
You've said this repeatedly.

711
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,060
Ever since I was young,

712
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,740
I've always followed your guidance.

713
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,580
Don't rush to prove yourself.

714
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,420
We're on a large scale now.

715
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,260
Everything

716
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,460
must follow my standards.

717
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,620
Understood.

718
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,180
I'll report directly to you.

719
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,580
I believe Shikun is absolutely fine.

720
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,620
For so many years,

721
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,620
he's been on the front lines.

722
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,780
Why is Tao Nanfang so confident?

723
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,140
Her daughter

724
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,900
studied broadcasting and hosting.

725
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,820
Can she really manage

726
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,420
such a large enterprise?

727
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,500
Who wouldn't agree?

728
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,660
But I think

729
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,620
she won't be flaunting her power
for much longer.

730
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,660
Because several key departments

731
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,140
report to me.

732
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,620
And the chef is also one of my own men.

733
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,580
after we replace that supplier,

734
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,060
she'll be completely sidelined.

735
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,940
By then,

736
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,780
she'll be begging her mom

737
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,100
to let her quit management.

738
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,580
Mr. Tao,

739
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,180
are you sure

740
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,660
Huasheng Group

741
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,740
won't partner with her?

742
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,180
Yes.

743
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,100
Rest assured.

744
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,900
I'll set them up

745
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,300
to ruin their deal.

746
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,620
Huasheng Group is very powerful,

747
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,980
but to return to the domestic market,

748
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,340
they'll have to beg us.

749
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,660
However,

750
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,900
the competition in ingredients

751
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,060
and pre-made products is indeed intense.

752
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,620
This is our major source of income.

753
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,260
Don't worry, Dad.

754
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,740
I've arranged to visit their company

755
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,060
and scheduled a meeting with Allie,
their CEO's daughter.

756
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,740
Let Hao go with you.

757
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,380
Figure them out completely.

758
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,420
You're always so cautious.

759
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,300
No wonder you've achieved so much!

760
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,860
Oh,

761
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,820
got something for you.

762
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,900
All the other suppliers' bids are here.

763
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,340
Mr. Tao,

764
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,020
I must drink a bottle of fine liquor!

765
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,820
My pleasure.

766
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,260
You did all the heavy lifting anyway.

767
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,740
Cheers to our deal going smoothly!

00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:06,260
[Xunyang North District First People's Hospital]

769
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
Gourmet Xu Hexiang clarified

770
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,380
the poisoning incident.

771
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,660
This is

772
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,060
an authentic

773
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,860
Huaiyang cuisine

774
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,140
establishment.

775
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,660
Its foods deserve

776
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,140
our confidence.

777
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,020
Of course, while enjoying delicacies…

778
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:20,860
Serves you right!

779
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,740
A translucent peony.

780
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,780
So delicate!

781
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,340
What's its name?

782
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,700
Heavenly Beauty.

783
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,660
Incredibly lifelike.

784
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,020
Even the veins
on each petal are crystal clear.

785
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,260
Now comes

786
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,780
the real magic.

787
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,700
Absolutely astounding!

788
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,860
How fascinating!

789
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,380
So are we drinking soup?

790
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:09,940
Yes.

791
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,420
Seafood soup.

792
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,100
What's this flower made from?

793
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,260
Fish gelatin!

794
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,140
Simmered with several types of seafood.

795
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,660
Delicious!

796
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,220
You put your heart into this.

797
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,820
Is this

798
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,660
also from Jingui Recipes?

799
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,820
As long as you enjoy it.

800
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:45,900
It tastes wonderful!

801
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,260
Women

802
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,700
never resist the allure of flowers.

803
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,340
You look radiant,

804
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,980
clearly recovering beautifully.

805
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,580
Yes, even Mr. Chen mentioned the same.

806
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,500
Your diet therapy

807
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,140
seems to be working!

808
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,460
Just supportive measures.

809
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,660
Should cooperate with medical treatment.

810
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,940
I know.

811
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,460
You've mentioned this countless times.

812
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,260
I understand perfectly.

813
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,820
With cancer,

814
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,380
good spirits make all the difference.

815
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,860
These past few weeks

816
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,300
have been tough on you,

817
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,900
going through all this trouble

818
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,020
just to prepare meals for me.

819
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,260
We're family,

820
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,460
so of course,

821
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,900
I hope you recover soon.

822
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,900
You've had such a hard life,

823
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,580
losing your parents and Grandpa early.

824
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,020
Qiao Zhi,

825
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,580
if you don't mind,

826
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,660
the Tao residence
will always be your home.

827
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,180
Back when I was little,

828
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,500
I didn't understand.

829
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,060
Only after losing them
do I cherish them.

830
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,260
But actually,

831
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,420
I should thank you instead.

832
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,940
You helped me find family again.

833
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,300
How

834
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,860
are things going with Xue lately?

835
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,700
You know her temper

836
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,100
better than anyone.

837
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,780
Come on, man, take initiative.

838
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,940
You want me to tell you how?

839
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,740
Hold on, Mom.

840
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,380
Forcing love never works.

841
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,820
Relationships are built on conquest.

842
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,900
Don't be so hesitant.

843
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,700
If you two have a kid,

844
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,660
you'll get closer to each other.

845
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,300
You're actually playing matchmaker here?

846
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,780
You're legally married already!

847
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,260
Keep pushing forward.

848
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,180
With my health like this,

849
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,700
who knows what comes next.

850
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,100
I want to hold my grandkid someday.

851
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,740
Get cracking on it!

852
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,260
So

853
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,140
does that count as part of KPI?

854
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:54,940
Yep.

855
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,220
Got a problem?

856
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,220
Fine by me.

857
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,820
I'll figure out how to make it happen.

858
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,300
By the way, Mom.

859
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,660
what do you think

860
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,140
about how we handled
Xu Hexiang's situation?

861
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,980
Song told me.

862
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,100
You did great.

863
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,140
Right?

864
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,020
Plus, the restaurant's packed lately.

865
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,100
Our kitchen staff is running nonstop!

866
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,820
What were you getting at?

867
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,900
Here is the thing.

868
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,020
I've executed both tasks

869
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,460
you instructed fully.

870
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,060
So

871
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,380
could we finally move the plan

872
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,620
to invest 10 million
to reopen onto the agenda?

873
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,060
Rest assured.

874
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,220
This is purely an investment sum.

875
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,700
We'll recoup the equity stake rapidly.

876
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,500
Frankly, within one year…

877
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,620
Qiao,

878
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,340
look.

879
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,180
Due to my current health condition,

880
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,220
I've

881
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,500
handed over the company to Ruxue.

882
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,700
So, about the investment in the Canteen,

883
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,740
go discuss it with Ruxue.

884
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:53,940
No.

885
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,060
Wait, Mom!

886
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,300
You can't do this.

887
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,500
Isn't this setting me up?

888
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,580
It sounds so awful!

889
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,180
As a family,

890
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,300
we'll never do that.

891
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,860
Besides,

892
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,340
it's easier for you two

893
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,100
to discuss things as a couple.

894
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,180
Alright.

895
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,420
Seems the soup I made

896
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,980
still lacks enough flavor.

897
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,300
I didn't eat your food for nothing.

898
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,580
The meal fees.

899
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,380
I've found out about the Ding family
as you told me.

900
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,580
Really?

901
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,860
As for Ding Heng,

902
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,220
after buying the Canteen,

903
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,140
he got involved
in some contract disputes.

904
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,500
[Investigative File on Ding Heng]
Now serving a prison sentence.

905
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,220
His wife was so furious that she had
a stroke and was hospitalized.

906
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,900
His daughter now works

907
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,020
at this bar pouring drinks.

908
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,300
Got it.

909
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:42,820
Alright.

910
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,740
Thanks, Mom.

911
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,580
Then I'll head off now.

912
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,580
Why are you so happy?

913
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,140
Is it about Mr. Xu?

914
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,340
Don't mention him to me.

915
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,300
Hasn't come back yet at eleven o'clock.

916
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,060
Xue,

917
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:49,980
don't you

918
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,860
plan to consider partnering

919
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,180
with Baiwei Group?

920
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,980
You know my mom's temper.

921
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,900
Let me try talking her into it again.

922
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,940
Xue,

923
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,220
those are matters between our parents.

924
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:00,980
They don't concern me.

925
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,860
As long as

926
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,460
nothing comes between our relationship.

927
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,780
Thanks so much

928
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,780
for your help today,

929
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,500
so I can meet Mr. Tian

930
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,340
and have such an expensive meal.

931
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,380
I really owe you one.

932
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,380
Still chatting?

933
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,340
You're being too formal with me now.

934
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,460
No more of this, okay?

935
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,980

936
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,300

00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,500
our competitor though,

938
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,660
our high-end restaurants

939
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,660
do collaborate

940
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,460
with them.

941
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,060
Got it, don't worry.

942
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,940
Who is he?

943
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,820
He's my…

944
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,820
Getting a chair for Miss Tao.

945
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,740
I'm worried her old injury might act up

946
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,700
if she stands too long.

947
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:53,900
Bodyguard?

948
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,940
You were also

949
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,740
at the hospital last time?

950
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,220
You held her hand

951
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,820
last time, right?

952
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,700
At first, I thought you were some creep

953
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,100
and almost kicked you!

954
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,900
A bodyguard

955
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,260
ought to do what you should do.

956
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,980
So when it happens again,

957
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,740
go ahead and do it.

958
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,180
Alright, nothing else matters now.

959
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,740
Go back.

960
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,740
No.

961
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,220
Ms. Tao instructed me

962
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,020
to keep an eye on her

963
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,700
and be vigilant against any men

964
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,980
who come into contact with her.

965
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,220
Don't worry. Go back first.

966
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,260
Got it!

967
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:30,860
Miss Tao,

968
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,500
call me if anything happens.

969
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,420
I'll rush over right away.

970
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,180
See you.

971
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,860
He's really meticulous.

972
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,220
By the way, where was I?

973
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,860
Oh right,

974
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,020
Huasheng Group.

975
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,980
Their quality is undeniably reliable,

976
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,340
but their prices are just too steep.

977
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,620
Baiwei Group

978
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,820
isn't the small workshop
my dad ran back then.

979
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,060
Later, could you talk

980
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:51,980
to Mom…

981
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,820
No,

982
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,260
to your mom.

983
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,860
Ask her to drop

984
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,580
her prejudice against me.

985
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,420
Okay, I see.

986
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,260
Xue,

987
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,500
actually I wanted

988
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,100
to tell you…

989
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,020
Miss Tao,

990
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,660
Ms. Chen's asking

991
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,580
how many cloves
of garlic to add to the noodles later.

992
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,580
Two.

993
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,780
Two.

994
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,660
Got it!

995
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,500
See you.

996
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,380
Hey,

997
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,180
aren't you hot in that?

998
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,180
Wait!

999
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,060
Are you a bodyguard or a nanny?

1000
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,860
Micromanaging everything like this?

1001
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,900
Go ahead. The door is open.

1002
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,780
You decent?

1003
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,900
Mind if I pop in?

1004
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,740
Seriously?

1005
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,740
I am a creep?

1006
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,580
Of course I'm clothed!

1007
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,980
You mentioned noodles earlier,

1008
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,580
but Ms. Chen never made them.

1009
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,060
You were just eating.

1010
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,380
That was work-related business!

1011
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,620
You may miss it
as you're in the kitchen.

1012
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,660
Our regular suppliers just hiked

1013
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,620
up their rates overnight.

1014
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,140
I'm trying to find alternatives,

1015
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,980
but not including Baiwei Group.

1016
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:33,980
It's your family business.

1017
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:34,980
You don't owe me an explanation.

1018
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,860
But I had to say something,

1019
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,180
so you wouldn't jump to conclusions.

1020
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,660
He's trying to connect me

1021
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,580
with the big shot from a Top 500!

1022
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,620
I should show my gratitude.

1023
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:47,940
But

1024
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,220
where was your thank-you to me?

1025
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,020
That day…

1026
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,460
