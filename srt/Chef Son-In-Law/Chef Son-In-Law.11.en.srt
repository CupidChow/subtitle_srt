To make something better than expected,

35
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,340
you have to inject
something fresh into it.

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,780
I don't quite get it.

37
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,780
If I just did my usual thing

38
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,700
and cooked a few of my signature dishes,

39
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,140
Mu Xiao might say a few nice words.

40
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,860

41
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,260

00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:39,820
Go on.

193
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,420
You know Guo Yan who runs
the barbecue place across the street.

194
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,300
Let's help her out.

195
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,620
Bao,

196
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,020
she works for Baiwei Group.

197
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
Yeah, I know.

198
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,260
But you don't know her full situation.

199
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,660
She was forced by Baiwei Group

200
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,740
into this dirty work.

201
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,220
She...

202
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,620
no,

203
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:57,980
ugh,

204
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,620
that came out wrong.

205
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,780
Guo Yan was forced.

206
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,220
Here's what happened.

207
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,700
Baiwei Group tried
to buy out her restaurant,

208
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,340
so she had no choice but to agree.

209
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,860
She's from out of town.

210
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,100
She lost her husband early

211
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,620
and has been raising her kid alone.

212
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,780
She's got no support

213
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,020
in this city.

214
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,060
So I thought we could lend her a hand.

215
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,820
I can teach her to make
some desserts, snacks,

216
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,220
and basic dishes,

217
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,660
and we can share some
of our customers with her.

218
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,580
That way,

219
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,620
we get another source of revenue.

220
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,620
We can just take a cut of the profit.

221
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,060
Hey, don't look at me like that.

222
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,740
You're the boss.

223
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,820
I'm just bringing it up.

224
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,580
Plus,

225
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,220
I'm helping her

226
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,340
purely

227
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,380
out of kindness.

228
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,420
Are you sure about this?

229
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,060
Yes.

230
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,220
Don't worry.

231
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,460
I'll handle her training.

232
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,860
If anything happens, it's on me.

233
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,540
All right.

234
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,180
Master.

235
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,300
Bao.

236
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,260
We've got guests in the private room.

237
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,420
No reservation.

238
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,540
It's late. Didn't you tell them

239
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,580
we're closing?

240
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,020
I did.

241
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,100
They even ordered a dish.

242
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,380
Boiled Cabbage.

243
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,100
Is that even on the menu?

244
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,740
Of course not.

245
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,020
Just tell them we don't have it

246
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,620
and let them go.

247
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:14,580
I…

248
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,900
I can't ask them to leave.

249

Master.

250
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,340
Looks like I didn't make
the abalone trio

251
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,540
for nothing.

252
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,940
- Huh?
- What?

253
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,700
Abalone?

254
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,100
What abalone?

255
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,860
Stop asking questions.

256
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,540
Prep the ingredients. We've got experts.

257
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,220
Hurry!

258
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,900

met before?

your grandfather and I

295
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,620
actually picked your name

296
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,380
together.

Qiao Zhi?

298
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,060
I've always wondered

299
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,540
about the original meaning
behind my name.

300
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,300
Back then,

301
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,860
we were

302
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,220
a bit fond of foreign things.

303
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,180
It just sounded

304
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,460
stylish.

305
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,500
It does.

306
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,580
What was the backup name again?

307
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,700
Oh, right.

308
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
It's Fuxing.

309
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,700
Qiao Fuxing.

310
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Not bad.

Both sound great.

I used to be a Sichuan cuisine chef,

313
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,580
but in my whole life,

314
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,700
on Sichuan cuisine,

315
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,900
I only lost once

316
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,300
to your grandfather's Boiled Cabbage.

317
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,860
We became

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,420

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,620

all these years.

Mr. Biao,

326
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,180
since you have no children,

327
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,420
what do you think

328
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,860

Mr. Biao,

330
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,780
since I was young,

331
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,380
I've vowed to carry on
my grandfather's legacy

332
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,180
and promote Chinese cuisine.

333
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,020
He

334
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,140
taught me a lot.

335
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,180
He taught me how to cook

336
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,100
and how to be a good person.

337
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,580
But when I finally had
the ability to repay him,

338
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,460
he had left me forever.

00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,660

saw that your father
didn't carry on with cooking,

372

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,100
Thank you, Grandpa.

383
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,900
But

384
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,300
what is this pin?

385
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,140
Wherever you go

386
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,900
in the future,

387
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,860
with this pin,

388
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,700
you'll always earn yourself a meal.

389
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:20,900
Then...

390
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,980
thank you, Grandpa.

391
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,620
Wow, these knives.

392
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,740
Do you really have to act like that?

393
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,180
Your drool's about to drip.

394
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,220
Can you stop pretending?

395
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,020
Don't tell me
you don't know what this is.

396
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,620
Of course I know.

397
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,740
It's...

398
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,860
a pin.

399
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,940
That's all you can say, huh?

400
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,900
Looks like a peony to me.

401
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,580
Bao, tell us about it.

402
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,300
All right.

403
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,340
Let me give you

404
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,620
a quick lesson.

405
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,180
First, the peony

406
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,380
is our national flower.

407
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,300
The idiom
"national grace and heavenly fragrance"

408
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,660
refers to the peony.

409
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,260
And it's also the symbol
of Tianxiang Rankings.

410
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,580
The Tianxiang Rankings

411
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,540
not only rates restaurants

412
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,700
but also evaluates and certifies

413
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,260
Chinese cuisine chefs from time to time.

414
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,300
So now,

415
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,980
Zhi is a one-star chef
of Tianxiang Rankings.

416
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,740
Only one star?

417
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,980
What's the highest rating?

418
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,180
Only one star?

419
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,900
Is she that clueless?

420
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,540
Girl,

421
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,700
in the entire country,
there are only 100 one-star chefs,

422
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,180
30 two-star chefs,

423
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,660
and 10 three-star chefs.

424
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,380
You know?

425
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,540
With this one star,

426
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,580
you can be a head chef anywhere.

427
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,500
That sounds amazing.

428
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,220
What kind of big shot did you meet?

429
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,500
Just

430
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,660
an old friend of my grandpa's.

431
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,660
Then can you ask
this friend of your grandpa

432
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,460
to get me one too?

433
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:55,900
I mean,

434
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,020
get our restaurant certified.

435
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,580
Then our business

436
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,260
will blow up.

437
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,100
How unbelievable.

438
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,140
Tianxiang Rankings was smearing us

439
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,340
not long ago.

440
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,380
And now they suddenly turn friendly.

441
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,540
Yeah.

442
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,540
That's a smart move, though.

443
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,940
A platform that loses credibility

444
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:13,860
will collapse.

445
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,420
Looks like that livestream
really paid off.

446
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,780
You done talking?

447
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,900
Well,

448
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,500
Zhi,

449
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,500
here's the thing.

450
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,580
Um,

451
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,300
can I borrow that for a second?
Just to try it on.

452
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,500
I'll just take a quick photo, okay?

453
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,260
I...

454
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,860
I've only seen one of these

455
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,140
at Huaixiang Restaurant

456
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,220
from afar.

457
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,220
Just one glance.

458
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,060
Let me wear it just once.

459
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,500
This?

460
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,900
This thing...

461
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,100
Dream on.

462
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,300
Let me try it on too!

463
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,580
[Canteen]

464
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,660
Mr. Qiao.

465
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,340
Ms. Guo.

466
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,180
Still up this late?

467
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,940
Yeah.

468
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,180
I've been waiting for you.

469
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,540
Me?

470
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,140
I have something important

471
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,300
to discuss with you.

472
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,980
Can we go in and sit down?

473
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,420
Bao told me everything.

474
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,700
Thank you

475
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,900
for letting me share some business.

476
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,020
This is what it's about?

477
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,740
Not just that.

478
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,900
Let's have a drink.

479
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,940
I'll skip the alcohol.

480
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,100
I have to get up early tomorrow.

481
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,780
So I probably shouldn't drink.

482
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,340
Let me

483
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,500
drink tea instead.

484
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,860
Always so proper, Mr. Qiao.

485
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,020
Here.

486
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,620
Cheers.

487
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,140
Here.

488
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,820
The second cup

489
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,860
is my toast to you.

490
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,140
What for?

491
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,660
To honor your generosity

492
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,660
and for not holding a grudge against me.

493
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,980
My apologies

494
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,380
for what I did.

495
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,140
Sorry.

496
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,620
No fights, no friendship, right?

497
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,060
Here.

498
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,540
And the third cup

499
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,540
is to destiny.

500
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,860
Hope we both make big money.

501
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,820
Meeting is destiny.

502
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,300
Ms. Guo, are you feeling warm?

503
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,060
Should I turn on the AC for you?

504
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,180
It's fine.

505
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,500
That's quite sweet of you.

506
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,780
Business seemed good today.

507
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,820
Why

508
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,220
the sigh?

509
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,460
It's about the important thing
I mentioned.

510
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,260
Okay.

511
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,940
Please go ahead.

512
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,980
I married here a few years ago.

513
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,820
I had just given birth,

514
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,260
and my useless husband died.

515
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,980
He left me only this restaurant.

516
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,500
I've been holding on alone
all these years.

517
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,940
It's exhausting, you know?

518
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,060
Very.

519
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,220
Every time I wanted to give up,

520
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,700
I told myself

521
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,820
I couldn't.

522
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,460
I had to keep going.

523
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,260
But do you know how hard it is

524
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,140
for a woman to work

525
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,620
in a strange city?

526
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
It can't be easy.

527
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,660
I understand.

528
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,660
Perseverance is hard,

529
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,980
but it always brings rewards.

530
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,340
But ever since you appeared,

531
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,220
I feel like

532
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,620
I've found stability,

533
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,380
you know?

534
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,060
Maybe this is the reward
for perseverance.

535
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,900
Am I right?

536
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,180
Wait,

537
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,900
that's not what I meant.

538
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,020
That regard...

539
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,060
not exactly.

540
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
I think it is.

541
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,780
There's no water left.

542
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
I'll get you some.

543
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,260
Here, have some fruit.

544
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,060
Sorry,

545
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,140
I didn't mean to.

546
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,060
Let me wipe it for you.

547
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:24,580
No.

548
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,500
It's fine.

549
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,580
It's not wet.

550
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,260
You're pretty quick, Mr. Qiao.

551
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,340
Um...

552
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,060
Let me get you another cup.

553
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,300
Thanks,

554
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
but I've got things to do.

555
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,100
Let's

556
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,940
meet another day.

557
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,420
Next time.

558
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,140
It's okay, I can get you one more cup.

559
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,780
No, I'm good.

560
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,260
Thanks.

561
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,140
Dense.

562
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,500
Mr. Biao.

563
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,460
I'm sorry.

564
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,980
Yes.

565
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,660
I promise

566
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,100
I'll never have it in for Canteen again.

567
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,420
Yes.

568
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:58,940
Please calm down.

569
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,620
What was that?

570
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,460
How did Mr. Biao get involved?

571
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,220
That old guy

572
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
acknowledged Qiao Zhi
as his sworn grandson.

573
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,540

so much money over the years,

576
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,820
and now he's threatening me?

577
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,660
Still,

578
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,820

579
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,860
We can't offend him.

How's it going with Tao Rende?

584
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,820

before Tao Ruxue takes over the company.

591
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,420
Got it.

592
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,860
I'll buy Tao Rende's shares

593
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,100
and handle this myself.

I never understood.

What's the point

600
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,020
of targeting Tao Rushuang?

601
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,140

609

611
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,460
That's why you're the clever one.

612

Only you could think
of something so ruthless.

615
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,940
Isn't she quite something?

616
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:33,980
Indeed.

Is this really Roasted Gosling
in a Whole Lamb?

620
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,620
Many have tried stuffing a gosling

621
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,460
into a lamb's belly.

622
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,860
But the results were never satisfactory.

630
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,060
So just by looking at this dish,

631
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,580
we can't confirm

632
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,980

00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,260
Ever since I went to France,

953
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,660
I've realized

954
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,540
that eating

955
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,660
is actually a way to enjoy life.

956
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,980
A French meal

957
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,140
can go on from noon till night.

958
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,540
One course at a time.

959
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,420
Dishes are served one by one

960
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,020
in strict order.

961
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,340
It's refined

962
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,460
and elegant.

963
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,860
So,

964
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,980
ever since then,

965
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,460
I've hardly had Chinese cuisine.

966
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,020
French food

967
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,860
is great,

968
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,940
but

969
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,180
it lacks variety.

970
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,180
I do like Chinese food too,

971
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,540
but

972
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,660
mostly Southern Cantonese dishes.

973
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,700
The rest

974
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,500
feel a bit too rough

975
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,260
for my taste.

976
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:05,900
How is it?

977
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,940
Does it taste bad?

978
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,780
George,

979
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,740
this tastes different

980
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,900
from what I'm used to.

981
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,940
How did you

982
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,860
get the ribs so soft?

983
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,340
This is

984
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,980
one of my new creations.

985
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,460
I call it Ribs with Real Flair.

986
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,580
The cooking is actually quite simple.

987
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,780
You start by coating the ribs
with red yeast liquid,

988
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,860
then deep-fry them until golden brown.

989
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,900
Place them in a pot

990
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
with water to simmer.

991
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,860
Add rice wine, sugar, salt,

992
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,620
fruit vinegar, dried chili,
bay leaves, black cardamom,

993
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,820
spring onions, and ginger,

994
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,700
and cook until the ribs become tender.

995
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,900
Meanwhile, boil the noodles

996
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,180
with oil until soft and plate them.

997
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,500
Place the ribs on top of the noodles

998
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,500
and pour over the stewed sauce.

999
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,540
Heat clear oil in a pan,

1000
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,180
drizzle it over garlic,
and pour that oil over the ribs.

1001
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,820
Finally, add a splash
of fresh lemon juice.

1002
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,020
This gives the dish

1003
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,060
a more layered texture.

1004
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,860
Is it really that good?

1005
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,340
Let me try.

1006
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,700
The lemon-diluted aroma of the meat

1007
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,900
quickly fills the mouth,

1008
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,420
tasting not greasy

1009
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,620
but uniquely refreshing.

1010
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,860
It's pork ribs,

1011
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,940
yet it has a sticky, gelatinous texture.

1012
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,180
It's overturning
my understanding of ribs.

1013
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,140
With your cooking skills,

1014
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,660
why open a canteen?

1015
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,620
You could easily run a great restaurant.

1016
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,380
It would be a huge success.

1017
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,980
The canteen George runs does very well.

1018
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,620
It's reservation-only,

1019
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,580
and people travel
from all over the country

1020
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,940
just to get a taste.

1021
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,540
What's this called?

1022
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,420
How do you make it?

1023
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,980
It's called

1024
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,220
Butterfly for Your Stomach.

1025
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
It's actually

1026
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,940
a signature Huainan dish.

1027
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,060
Made with

1028
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,140
perilla-infused oil,

1029
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,580
it's bright red,

1030
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,580
fragrant, and not spicy.

1031
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,500
The sausage used is sheath sausage

1032
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
with triple-layered casing,

1033
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,540
also known as nested sausage.

1034
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,100
Finally,

1035
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,580
the liver and sausage
are fried and braised respectively

1036
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,260
before being combined
into a single dish.

1037
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,900
Who'd have thought

1038
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,420
such a dish had so much behind it?

1039
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,860
We should never judge a book
by its cover.

1040
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,420
Well done,

1041
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,700
young man.

1042
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,660
China's vast land

1043
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,140
breeds vast and profound cuisine.

1044
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
My dishes here are

1045
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,940
but small tricks.

1046
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,540
Glad you enjoyed it.

1047
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,650
But I do think,

1048
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,780
compared to three-star Michelin dishes,

1049
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,260
these ingredients may be simpler,

1050
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,660
but the flavor and creativity

1051
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,340
should be no worse.

1052
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,340
Thanks for the meal.

1053
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,980
We have something urgent to attend to,

1054
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,140
so we'll get going.

1055
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,300
I haven't tried this one.

1056
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,100
No rush.

1057
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,860
We're leaving.

1058
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,900
Leaving already?

1059
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,900
Let me see you off.

1060
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,020
I knew

1061
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,540
you were using me.

1062
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,420
Thank you.

1063
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,380
I fulfilled my wish today.

1064
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,140
It was just one meal,

1065
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,020
but I'm really happy.

1066
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:46,900
Ellie,

1067
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,700
actually, I...

1068
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,460
It's okay.

1069
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,180
I'll wait for you
to accomplish your goal

1070
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,540
before giving you that letter.

1071
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,380
Please do take it

1072
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
when I do.

1073
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,900
[Huaixiang Group]

1074
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,500
The North District
managed by Ms. Tao Junior

1075
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,580
has surpassed the South District
in terms of revenue by 6.5%.

1076
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,460
According to the agreement,

1077
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,420
all businesses
previously managed by Tao Rende

1078
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,060
are now under the charge
of Ms. Tao Junior.

1079
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,300
You really nailed it, Ms. Tao Junior.

1080
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,300
This is what they call

1081
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,060
"the student surpasses the master."

1082
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,500
The numbers speak for themselves.

1083
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,940
We've got nothing to say.

1084
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,460
Yes, indeed.

1085
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,140
I agree.

1086
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,420
Exactly.

1087
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,220
From now on,

1088
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,140
all South District restaurants
will follow

1089
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,180
the rules and standards
of the North District.

1090
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,100
All chefs and managers

1091
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,940
will also be assessed
under the North District's system.

1092
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,380
Anyone who fails to meet the standards
will be dismissed.

1093
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,180
Any objections?

1094
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,540
No objections here.

1095
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,500
We'll follow your lead.

1096
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,220
No objections here either.
