[Adapted from Yandou Laoge's novel,
The Great Nation's Master Chef]

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,940
[Episode 24]

34
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,380
Do you know why I don't make that dish?

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,500
That is white teatfish,

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,860
not sea cucumber.

37
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,220
I mean it.

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,380
Without enough time to rehydrate it,

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,900
the texture will be compromised.

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,740
If I were you, I'd make boiled cabbage.

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,140
I've made it for Mr. Biao before,

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,060
and he loved it.

43
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,020
As Mr. Biao's chief disciple,

44
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,380
you're making a Fujian dish

45
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,900
right in front of him.

46
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,420
Isn't that a bit like betraying
your master?

47
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,060
Just shut your mouth

48
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,180
and mind your own business.

49
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,300
What's your problem now?

50
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,660
There is pig trotter hair!

51
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,980
Are you out of your mind?

52
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,060
This is mine.

53
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,500
This is also mine.

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,260
And this.

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,300
Wait.

56
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,020
Don't be such a cheapskate!

57
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,980
Give me two of them.

58
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,700
Stick to your bullfrog dish.

59
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,900
Why do you want abalone?

60
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,940
I'm making a creative dish!

61
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,900
Take the eggs

62
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,180
and the abalone is mine!

63
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,020
That won't work.

64
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,300
For my creativity,

65
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,460
bullfrog, abalone, and eggs

66
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,300
are all essential!

67
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,700
What is the creativity

68
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,060
that needs them?

69
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,900
My creativity is this.

70
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,020
A bullfrog stepping on an abalone,

71
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,100
while the abalone spits out eggs!

72
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,180
I…

73
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,900
Give me that one.

74
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,420
No!

75
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,340
- Hand it over!
- Hand it over!

76
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:43,940
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

77
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,380
- I've got this!
- I've got this!

78
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,500
You even snatched it?

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,300
Are you really King of Chefs?

80
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,060
So narrow-minded!

81
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,180
You…

82
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,060
- Don't!
- Give me that one!

83
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,380
Listen, you can't have this!

84
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,460
You've got so much!

85
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,420
This one is mine!

86
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:53,900
Give me that one!

87
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,660
How can you…

88
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,420
Give it to me!

89
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,740
Look at you!

90
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,660
Do your dish!

91
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,300
Hand it over!

92
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,180
You're disrupting me!

93
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,180
Let go!

94
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,100
Can't give it to you!

95
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
Not giving it to you!
Can't believe that!

96
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,900
Painful to watch this.

97
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,580
Is this a competition

98
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,620
or a produce market?

99
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,540
Let go already!

100
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,780
I said no!

101
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,900
They're even pulling hair!

102
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,300
I think this is great.

103
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,780
Leverage your persona and take charge!

104
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,380
After all, ingredient selection

105
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,300
is part of the competition.

106
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,380
Whoever seizes

107
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,500
the initiative first wins.

108
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,940
As the CEO of a listed company

109
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,260
and King of Chefs,

110
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,940
Zhan Jun

111
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,540
shouldn't be stooping

112
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,260
to this level

113
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,740
with a junior.

114
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,340
Clearly, this time

115
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,420
he's lost his composure.

116
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,860
You two really know

117
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,740
how to flatter him!

118
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,420
Sometimes, I admit

119
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,220
his shamelessly audacious act

120
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,500
actually works.

121
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,140
Now, let's hand things over

122
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,580
to Zhan Jun, King of Chefs.

123
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,500
His knife skills are truly masterful!

124
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,780
These carvings look so lifelike

125
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,660
and so vividly realistic!

126
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,980
What is this rock-hard thing?

127
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,740
Could you ease up a bit?

128
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,020
Whoops, my bad.

129
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,940
This stuff is really tough!

130
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,180
A true King of Chefs indeed!

131
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,700
Such professionalism!

132
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,260
His knife skills reach

133
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,780
a whole new level of zen.

134
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,860
Don't you eyeball me!

135
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,460
Stop, or I'll slap you!

136
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,180
Hey, Judge!

137
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,580
I demand this lunatic

138
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,660
be told to ease up!

139
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,860
Qiao Zhi!

140
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,500
Knock it off

141
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,660
and stop distracting your opponent!

142
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,740
It takes about three years

143
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,340
to master fire control
and wok techniques,

144
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,580
but over a decade

145
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,940
to fully master knife skills.

146
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,220
This must be the Three Immortals,

147
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,980
a creative evolution
from Southern Cantonese cuisine.

148
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,660
What does that gesture

149
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,340
contestant Qiao Zhi made mean?

150
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,580
Is he going to make three dishes?

151
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,780
Now Mr. Zhan Jun

152
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,980
has picked up speed!

153
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,300
Brilliant innovation.

154
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,300
This is an evolution of Fujian cuisine!

155
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,060
Southern Cantonese cuisine
and Fujian cuisine

156
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,180
have always shared deep roots.

157
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,700
I thought he'd lost

158
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,060
his touch over the years,

159
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,180
but it seems

160
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,220
my worries were unfounded!

161
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,420
The real test now

162
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,820
is how his final dishes will taste.

163
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,300
Contestant Qiao Zhi

164
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,020
is starting his second dish.

165
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,340
This must be Soft-belly Eel

166
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,100
from the Huaiyang Eel banquet!

167
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,060
Is he using ancient techniques?

168
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,220
After all, he's the grandson
of Qiao Sihai.

169
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,140
True mastery runs in the blood.

170
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,140
He is effective.

171
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,860
Is he preparing a third dish?

172
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,780
Compared to Zhan Jun's dramatic carvings

173
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,340
all about grandeur,

174
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,140
Qiao Zhi's knife work

175
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,460
is precise, seamless,

176
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,940
intricate,

177
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,980
and delicate.

178
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,660
Surgical in its precision.

179
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,340
To achieve this level of mastery

180
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,020
at such a young age.

181
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,060
Marvelous!

182
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,340
What a stunning Cicada Playing
with Pearl!

183
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,820
When you examine

184
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,020
these three dishes together,

185
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,220
they form a pastoral poem

186
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
with land, water, and sky.

187
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,020
Such wild, untamed elegance!

188
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,220
Is he about to pour broth

189
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,740
to carve a flowing river?

190
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,300
To craft cuisine
with such poetic vision,

191
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,260
he's a prodigy!

192
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,700
Seems

193
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,940
Zhan Jun is losing this race
against time.

194
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:06,700
Oh no!

195
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,140
Contestant Qiao Zhi just had

196
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,980
a last-minute disaster!

197
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,020
But this is a competition.

198
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,180
Luck is part of the game, after all.

199
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,940
Only ten minutes left now.

200
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,820
He may not finish another dish
at this point.

201
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:39,500
- Committee, a fix!
- Committee, a fix!

202
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,020
Perfect!

203
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,780
Well done.

204
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,660
He had me scared there for a second!

205
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,140
I thought he wouldn't use that pot!

206
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
That's fate for you.

207
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,500
Mr. Zhan,

208
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,700
is our move getting

209
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,460
a little too obvious?

210
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,100
Results matter

211
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,820
more than anything.

212
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,420
My dad wins,

213
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,980
and cash flows straight

214
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,780
into our pockets.

215
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,180
That's what counts in the end.

216
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,620
As for these fans?

217
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,660
Let them curse all they want.

218
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,260
A bunch of underdogs!

219
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,660
This must be their dirty work again!

220
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,660
Ms. Tao

221
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,780
can't just stand for this!

222
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,380
We must file a formal protest!

223
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,180
We've withdrawn from the competition.

224
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,220
What leverage do we have left?

225
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:18,980
You…

226
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,540
Ruxue,

227
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,540
make the Brand Department

228
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,340
redesign all advertising materials now.

229
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,860
Mom,

230
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,860
the competition isn't over yet.

231
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,900
Get a grip!

232
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,220
Only ten minutes left!

233
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,380
He can't possibly finish another dish.

234
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,300
We bought so many ad slots,

235
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,700
but we can't cancel them.

236
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,340
All we can do is revamp our ads

237
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,100
to minimize losses.

238
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,060
Alright.

239
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:43,740
Come on!

240
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,940
What kind of amateur operation is this?

241
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,260
A pot breaks mid-cooking?

242
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,500
There must be a fix going on!

243
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,900
I knew he couldn't handle losing!

244
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,620
But honestly,

245
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
what's the point of ranting now?

246
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,900
We're out of time.

247
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,740
Wait. Don't panic!

248
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,860
Not yet.

249
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,180
Master hasn't given up!

250
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,380
Only ten minutes left!

251
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,260
What could he possibly make now?

252
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,020
Chopped cucumber salad?

253
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,780
No!

254
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
I believe in Qiao Zhi!

255
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,540
When he focuses, he'll pull through!

256
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,100
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

257
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,860
Don't shout!

258
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,580
Attention contestants.

259
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,220
Eight minutes remain

260
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,300
until the deadline.

261
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,900
Mr. Zhan Jun has completed his dish.

262
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,100
He's making his move!

263
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,020
- Go! Qiao Zhi!
- Go! Qiao Zhi!

264
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,940
- Go! Qiao Zhi!
- Go! Qiao Zhi!

265
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,180
He just cracked

266
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,180
multiple eggs.

267
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,540
What could he be whipping up?

268
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,180
Is it the fried egg?

269
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,500
Now this is real skill!

270
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,260
Matches the Left-Right Conflict

271
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,420
martial art from novels!

272
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,540
Finally,

273
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,020
he's unleashing his true potential!

274
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,020
Guess what he's about to do next?

275
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,740
I couldn't tell what dish,

276
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,340
but mark my words,

277
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,620
he's turning eggs

278
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,340
into meat floss right before our eyes!

279
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,500
This is next-level difficulty!

280
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,940
Even for national-level chefs,

281
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,580
this technique

282
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,140
usually requires two people!

283
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,420
Look at those egg threads

284
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
with perfectly uniform thickness.

285
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,020
Truly remarkable!

286
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,940
Wait!

287
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,060
Is he

288
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,740
using his failed dish as an ingredient?

289
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,540
Fried rice.

290
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,540
Yangzhou Fried Rice!

291
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,900
He's making

292
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,700
Yangzhou Fried Rice!

293
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,620
But can Yangzhou Fried Rice

294
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,620
really outshine

295
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,580
King Zhan Jun's Three Immortals?

296
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,620
No seasoning added.

297
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,980
Brilliant!

298
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,700
The earlier ingredients

299
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,100
are already soaked in rich broth,

300
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,100
already packed with flavor.

301
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
By balancing them
with rice, eggs, and veggies,

302
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,340
this dish needs

303
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,020
no extra seasoning.

304
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,780
Delicate and refined.

305
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,780
Pure ingenuity!

306
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,780
Qiao Zhi actually pulled it off

307
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,540
at the last second!

308
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,700
Unbelievable!

309
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,660
- Great.
- Great.

310
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:00,940
Alright.

311
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,580
Both contestants' dishes

312
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,580
are complete.

313
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,060
Jury,

314
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,020
please first taste

315
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,940
Mr. Zhan Jun's Three Immortals.

316
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,580
[Mei Ling, Mu Xiao]

317
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,140
Let's see what it tastes like.

318
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
No wonder he is the King of Chefs!

319
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,780
This dish

320
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,860
is absolutely first-class

321
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,700
both in artistic vision

322
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,300
and flavor profile.

323
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,540
Especially
this Buddha Jumps Over The Wall!

324
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,140
We all thought

325
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,140
that with limited time,

326
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,420
perfection would be impossible.

327
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,740
How on earth did he pull it off?

328
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,100
Truly remarkable.

329
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,980
A two-hour version matching

330
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,100
full-time mastery!

331
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,980
Next, judges,

332
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,700
please cleanse your palate

333
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,780
and then taste

334
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,700
Qiao Zhi's Yangzhou Fried Rice.

335
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,820
Remarkable!

336
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,180
You didn't add seasoning?

337
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,940
Exactly.

338
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,460
Using stir-fried ingredients

339
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,540
to balance flavors?

340
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,580
I don't buy it.

341
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,180
You had a master guiding you every step

342
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,620
and got every recipe,

343
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,460
every ingredient, at your fingertips.

344
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,580
I had none of that.

345
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,900
Cut the crap!

346
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,300
Everyone knows

347
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,500
about your grandpa's skills.

348
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,340
Want to know

349
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,540
how he taught me to cook?

350
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,100
My ingredients

351
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,100
are only leftovers

352
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,140
from canteen customers.

353
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,380
Grandpa always said,

354
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,100
during those years of famine,

355
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,020
not a grain was left uneaten.

356
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,460
Even grasshoppers

357
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,300
vanished from fields.

358
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,660
Now we live in plenty,

359
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,700
yet we've forgotten

360
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,380
how to cherish it.

361
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,380
So

362
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,140
before I turned twelve,

363
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,260
every single meal

364
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,820
came from processing

365
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,900
leftovers.

366
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,500
What a coincidence!

367
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,740
Today's challenge

368
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,860
is my grandpa's exact teaching.

369
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,700
Call it fate. Wouldn't you,

370
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,940
King of Chefs?

371
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,860
Bravo!

372
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,520
[King of Chefs Championship]

373
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,040
[PK]

374
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,340
So moving.

375
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,380
Now we see

376
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,580
how Master's skills were forged.

377
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,700
Take it with a grain of salt.

378
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,900
Don't you know

379
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,340
he's a master showman?

380
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,820
You mean this was all made up?

381
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,180
Well. not exactly.

382
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,220
His skills

383
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,900
can't come from stir-frying leftovers?

384
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,020
Let me tell you straight.

385
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,020
During the competition,

386
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,460
as he fell behind,

387
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,380
he played

388
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,500
the emotional card

389
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,500
for sympathy points.

390
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,540
That's why we say

391
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,580
no one tops Mr. Qiao, right?

392
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,020
The man owns the screen!

393
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,260
Still my champion, Qiao Zhi!

394
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Give it up for him!

395
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,140
Clap!

396
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:05,900
Great.

397
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,940
It's just fried rice.

398
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,700
No matter how emotional it is,

399
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,580
it can't touch the Three Immortals.

400
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,940
Hao.

401
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,460
This is in the bag.

402
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:20,980
Absolutely.

403
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,900
And no trick up his sleeve

404
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,020
can fix his dish's fatal flaw.

405
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:26,980
What flaw?

406
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
Now it's time for our head judge panel

407
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,580
to evaluate

408
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,100
both dishes.

409
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,820
Regarding Qiao Zhi's fried rice,

410
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,300
from visual appeal,

411
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,500
technique

412
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,300
to flavor profile,

413
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,300
it qualifies as top-tier execution.

414
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,980
However, the ingredient flaw

415
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,140
is insurmountable.

416
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,380
As no overnight rice

417
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,620
is provided

418
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,420
at the site,

419
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,180
that's a fatal blow

420
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
for fried rice.

421
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,300
Zhan Jun's

422
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,500
Three Immortals

423
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,860
truly surpassed my imagination,

424
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,580
a feast for both palate and eyes,

425
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,740
undoubtedly representing

426
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,620
our craft's highest echelon.

427
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,780
But

428
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,220
what I can't fathom is this.

429
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,300
How did you

430
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,820
condense

431
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,940
a three-day process

432
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,260
into just two hours?

433
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,020
Master,

434
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,380
I'll approach you privately later

435

please control your emotions.

Cooperate.

Please.

461
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,420
He's cheating!

462
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,900
Are you insane?

463
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,060
I said you're cheating.

464
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,020
You're shameless!

465
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,980
You're cheating!

Everyone,

468
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,180
this substance that looks like starch?

469
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,500
It's not starch at all.

470
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,020
It's xanthan gum

471
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,220
used to thicken soups!

472
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,700
Now I get why your soup

473
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,500
went from zero to perfect

474

in just two hours!

475
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,300
And

476
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,260
this

477
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,900
isn't sesame oil.

478
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,900
It's a seafood flavoring oil

479
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,220
used to boost umami.

480
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:28,980
Right?

481
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,620
Then this

482
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,140
what looks like MSG

483
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,460
also fake!

484
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,380
It's called soup boost powder.

485
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,260
Its main ingredient

486
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,820
is disodium 5'-ribonucleotides.

487
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,500
It's like the great-grandfather of MSG.

488
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,620
Nonsense!

489
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,460
