192
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,220
What are you talking about?

193
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,380
He only owns a small restaurant,

194
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,820
but the two Ms. Taos

195
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,620
care about him so much,

196
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,220
and both of them want to take him home.

197
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,740
Right?

198
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,100
Who can enjoy

199
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,580
such good treatment?

200
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:05,980
Think.

201
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,380
You see?

202
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,100
Hu...

203
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,260
hu... hu...

204
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,300
husband.

205
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,300
Yes.

206
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,420
But whose husband is he? Not sure.

207
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,620
Is it good?

208
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,900
Pretty good.

209
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,900
Are you sober now?

210
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,420
Yeah.

211
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,140
Last night,

212
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,300
you gave us such a big cake.

213
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,140
I had to cook a meal
to return the favor.

214
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,260
Only one meal?

215
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,820
What else did you expect?

216
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,620
Well...

217
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,660
if you keep acting nice.

218
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
Hey, smug guy.

219
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,220
You take a mile when given an inch.

220
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,340
Shouldn't life be like this?

221
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,500
Look, if you smile more,

222
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,140
and I smile more,

223
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,980
won't our little life

224
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,660
get more prosperous?

225
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,980
I didn't say yes to "our".

226
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,700
Oh, right,

227
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,100
are you

228
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,180
available today?

229
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,300
I'd like

230
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,260
to take you out on a date.

231
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,660
You look

232
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,780
a little weird today.

233
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,100
This is a sincere invitation.

234
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,500
Enough joking.

235
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,820
We've got the spot
for the King of Chefs Championship.

236
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,940
I'll go through the procedures
for you today.

237
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,820
Ms. Tao Junior,

238
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,820
you keep your word.

239
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,860
Really appreciated.

240
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,460
So many dishes.

241
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,020
Have something before you go.

242
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,580
Come on.

243
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,420
Have a dumpling.

244
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,820
This tastes nice.

245
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,460
Delicious indeed.

246
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,660
I'll pass.

247
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,220
SOS from the company.

248
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,180
Leaving already?

249
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,380
It's alright.

250
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,140
Enjoy.

251
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,420
Zhi,

252
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,620
organic vegetables taste much better

253
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,820
than those that are not.

254
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,020
I barely noticed it before.

255
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,980
You're right.

256
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,060
Spring water is another key.

257
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,700
The combination gives your dishes

258
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,380
a richer flavor.

259
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,220
Yet, they will cost a few times more

260
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,300
than the ordinary ingredients.

261
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,660
That's why most restaurants

262
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,740
don't use them.

263
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,460
Indeed.

around our door,

I can't handle them.

you'll take the lead
in setting up a customer service center,

288
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,460
which is specifically responsible
for online reservations

289
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,380
and overall coordination.

please tell the leaders
of the university

that we need more students

293

for the part-time positions.

294
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,180

This restaurant is prospering

301
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,900
thanks to you.

302
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,780
Now that our restaurant's business

303
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,740
is booming,

304
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,780
I think

305
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,820
the workload is too heavy

306
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,780
for you and Bao.

307
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,420
I suggest

308
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,100
we hire a few more chefs.

309
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,820
Right?

310
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,220
Yeah.

311
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,420
But

312
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,300
there's something more important.

313
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,220
What is it?

314
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,940

But that competition...

317
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,260
You can't get in
simply with cooking skills.

318
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,100
However,

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,020

I told you before

322
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,300
your master is no ordinary chef.

323
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,380
Yeah, right.

324
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,100

No worries.

332

An influencer and small restaurant owner

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,940
I don't agree.

340
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,580

His fame was earned
through marketing operations.

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,100
He representing us

349
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,620

really has what it takes.

385
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,620
For another,

386
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,140
we can select a group of talents

387
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,340
in a fair and just manner.

388
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,460
Everyone,

389
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,260
what do you think?

390
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,700
Good idea.

391
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,500
Cooking skills speak for themselves.

392
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,740
I agree.

393
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,060
Same here.

394
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,380
I agree.

395
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,340
-I agree.
-I agree.

396
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,940
Alright, then Ruxue will decide

397
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,060
on the competition schedule
and the judges.

398
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,100
OK.

399
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,700
We'll do it as you said.

401
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,460
Look at your designer clothes.

402
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,220
You must have made
a lot of money lately.

403
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,500
I owe you everything I have.

404
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,060
Say, how many years
have we known each other?

405
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,420
At least six years, right?

406
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,500
Six years and four months.

407
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,660
I met you at a bar

408
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,300
on Christmas.

409
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,660
Yes.

410
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,380
Now I remember.

411
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,620
You were slipping
knock-out drops to a girl.

412
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,380
If it weren't for me,

413
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,020
you'd still be rotting in jail

414
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,740
right now.

415
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,860
You're like my savior!

416
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,500
Without your arrangement,

417
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,740
I wouldn't be working
at that pharmaceutical company.

418
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,860
You know what I value most about you?

419
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,220
Obedience?

420
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,580
That wild streak of yours.

421
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,060
After all these years
in a tailored suit,

422
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,460
you really think
you're a gentleman, huh?

423
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,420
Just trying not to embarrass you.

424
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,540
Han Bin,

425
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,460
I still prefer

426
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,700
the unruly version of you.

427
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,820
Look at you now.

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,860
Dressed in designer clothes,

429
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,380
you can't even handle
an internet celebrity.

430
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,020
Do you think

431
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,580
you're worthy of these fancy things?

432
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,460
Kun, last time was an accident.

433
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,740
This time, just tell me what to do.

434
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,860
I'll definitely

435
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,180
get it done properly.

436
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,780
I don't care what method you use.

437

Slipping drugs,

438
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,220
getting her blacklisted…

439
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,020
I want nude photos,
videos, and pictures.

440
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,020
Kun,

441
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,020
are we going so far regarding this?

442
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,340
If you do this right,

443
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,820
I'll hook you up
with a few more big deals.

444
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,620
Really?

445
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Rest assured.

446
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,140
I'll definitely

447
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,420
get this done for you.

448
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,260
Remember,

449
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,820

Mr. Biao,

452
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,100
please have some tea.

453
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,140
How are you feeling?

454
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,260
Thank you for asking.

455
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,780
I'm recovering well.

456
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,100
That's good.

457
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,060
Look at you.

458
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,740
Even people of your generation
are getting sick now.

459
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,660
An old guy like me

460
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,140
is still meddling in things.

461
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,100
That's so inappropriate.

462
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,380
Don't say that.

463
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,460
You're not old at all.

464
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,860

I visited Canteen.

470
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,020
Not bad.

471
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,460
Your comment

472
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,980
is a great honor for him.

474
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,940
were you planning
to keep me in the dark?

475
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,700
Do you mean Qiao Zhi?

476
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,700
I didn't introduce him to you

477
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,060
because I thought he wasn't ready.

478
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,140
I planned

479
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,420
to wait until he competed
in the King of Chefs Championship

480
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,780
and achieved something.

481
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,220
Then I'd share the good news with you.

482
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,940
You backed out
on the merger with Baiwei Group

483
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,500
because of him, right?

484
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,100
I don't mean to blame you.

485
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,460
Back then, I stepped up
to take charge of the situation

486
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,420
in the hope of maximizing
the interests of both sides.

487

have had a huge impact on Baiwei Group.

492
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,300
Tell him to be more careful

493
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,140
not to fall into any traps.

494
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,340

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,340
I don't believe it.

760
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,820
Sing to me, prove that you can sing.

761
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,220
Believe it or not.

762
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,500
You're obviously favoring her.

763
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,460
Do you know what time it is?

764
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,260
How about this?

765
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,740
Rain check.

766
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,820
Rain check.

767
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,300
Honestly, tell me what's going on?

768
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,500
Nothing.

769
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,220
Seeing that you're so successful now

770
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,900
makes me feel bad about myself.

771
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
I don't believe you.

772
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,540
I mean it.

773
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,580
If one day,

774
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,180
I quit what I'm doing

775
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,700
and run Canteen with you,

776
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,260
will you take me in?

777
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,220
Sure.

778
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,820
You're one of Canteen's shareholders.

779
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,180
Canteen is your second home.

780
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,980
Come whenever you like.

781
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,780
You said it yourself.

782
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,220
I did.

783
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,620
But I thought your dream

784
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,660
was to be an actress.

785
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,540
What?

786
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,140
Are you giving up?

787
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,020
Nothing.

788
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,780
I need to sleep.

789
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,620
Good night.

790
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,540
Come to me whenever you want to talk.

791
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,100
Can we talk now?

792
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,380
10 AM tomorrow.

793
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,900
Port at Ziwei Park.

794
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,300
Sorry, I'm late.

795
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,380
Do you enjoy making people wait for you

796
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,740
just to make yourself look important?

797
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,860
Can't help it.

798
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,820
I've got piles of meetings to deal with.

799
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,380
People with nothing better to do
like you

800
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,940
will never understand that.

801
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,940
Just say what you have to say.

802
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,780
Yesterday was just the first step.

803
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,980
Every day from now on,

804
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,180
I'll double down on the punishment.

805
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,780
I knew it was you behind this!

806
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,540
But you can't do anything to me.

807
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
It feels so good!

808
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,220
Listen to something fun.

809
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,820
Bin,

810
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,240
[From Mr. Sun]
I've taken care

811
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,500
[From Mr. Sun]
of the thing you told me to do.

812
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,180
Why?

813
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,620
Was this internet celebrity
hard to deal with?

814
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,220
I talked to my dad,

815
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,540
and we've canceled
the collaborations with her.

816
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,940
Any other orders,

817
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,660
Bin?

818
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,660
There's more.

819
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,260
The internet celebrity circle is small.

820
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,260
Taking down
a small-time celebrity like her?

821
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,620
One word from you, Bin,

822
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,660
and I'll get it done in a minute.

823
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,500
Crying already?

824
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,060
But that's not even the best part.

825
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,900
This one just reached me.

826
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,660
[From boss of the marketing company]

827
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,980
OK. I see what you mean.

828
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,460
We'll bench her.

829
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,260
You said you'd make up for it
with extra ads?

830
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,500
No need for that.

831
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,660
Let's take this as a chance
for us to be friends.

832
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,900
Your boss is so sophisticated.

833
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,580
What?

834
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,860
Trying to grab my phone as evidence?

835
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,840
[Delete]

836
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,020
Gone.

837
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,020
Fine, I'll quit this job. Happy now?

838
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,740
Sure,

839
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,500
no problem.

840
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,060
You've got a rich family

841
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,140
to support you.

842
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,820
But don't let me catch you

843
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,900
working there again.

844
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,100
I'll make you rot at home
for the rest of your life.

845
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,100
Of course,

846
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,780
you've got another choice:

847
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,620
Come see me at ten tonight.

848
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,860
I'll send you the address.

849
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,100
You just need to keep me company

850
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,500
for one night.

851
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,220
After that, I'm afraid

852
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,060
I won't even have
the slightest interest in you anymore.

853
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,660
In your dreams!

854
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,180
Keep you company?

855
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,540
I'd rather slap you to death!

856
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,980
This isn't a negotiation.

857
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,300
Oh, right.

858
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,300
You've got

859
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,700
that so-called "brother" of yours.

860
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,820
He can't help you this time.

861
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,300
Is this him, your brother?

862
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,180
This has nothing to do with him!

863
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,780
I'll definitely get back at him

864
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,380
for kicking me.

865
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,540
A chef, huh?

866
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,500
I'm definitely going to break his hands.

867
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,100
If you don't show up tonight,

868
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,140
just wait and see what I do to him.

869
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,620
What's wrong with you lately?

870
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,180
All the clients are unhappy
with the footage you shot.

871
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,340
Do you even realize

872
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,220
this

873
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,500
could lead to breach of contracts?

874
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,460
And you'll have to pay

875
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,980
the penalty fee yourself.

876
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,540
It's over three million yuan!

877
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,620
Even if your family is rich,

878
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,540
you can't treat your work like this.

879
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,100
Please, show me a way out.

880
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,180
That's just

881
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,180
how society works.

882
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,780
You can't avoid

883
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,020
social connections.

884
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,940
You need to learn to be flexible.

885
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,020
When you get on good terms
with the upper class,

886
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,940
looking back,

887
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,700
you'll see

888
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,100
all these things are actually easy.

889
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,500
Just say it straight.

890
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,460
Do you want me to sleep with Han Bin?

891
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,580
I never said that.

892
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,900
You caused this trouble.

893
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,780
You solve it yourself.

894
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,260
I'm really disappointed in you.

895
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,700
Do you remember what you said

896
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,380
when we first met?

897
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,180
You talked about your dream.

898
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,100
You said you'd treat everyone
in the company

899
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,460
like family.

900
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,220
That's why I signed with you,

901
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,780
a newly founded company.

902
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,940
Is this how you treat your "family"?

903
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,860
I did give you the best resources,

904
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,980
didn't I?

905
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,300
Knock it off.

906
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,700
Haven't I made money for you?

907
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,100
Now I'm in trouble,

908
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,740
this is how you treat me?

909
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,660
Rushuang,

910
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,820
this is just a small company
I built from scratch.

911
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,740
I don't have a choice.

912
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,140
Come on. Hurry.

913
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,500
[Canteen]
Hello, please come in.

914
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,140
Thanks.

915
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,740
Hello.

916
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,860
What a crowd.

917
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,060
One moment, please.

918
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,420
Miss Shareholder, what brings you here?

919
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,580
Just call me Rushuang.

920
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,100
Where is Qiao Zhi?

921
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,500
Master is preparing
the ingredients inside.

922
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,140
OK. I'll go inside to him.

923
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,500
Sure.

924
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,020
Let's continue.

925
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,380
Mom.

926
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,100
Why are you here?

927
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,060
I was just about to ask you.

928
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,620
Who did you offend recently?

929
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,140
I told you

930
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,140
it was a crazy fan,

931
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,180
and you said I "deserved it
for being an internet celebrity".

932
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,140
You're not a kid anymore.

933
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,260
Do you ever use your head
when you do things?

934
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,780
With you acting so recklessly,

935
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,780
even your brother-in-law
was dragged into your mess.

936
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,180
What happened to you?

937
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,300
It's nothing.

938
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,540
Just got a threatening call.

939
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,860
We can't be sure about anything yet.

940
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,380
How is it "nothing"?

941
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,540
You're a chef.

942
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,980
Your hands are your livelihood!

943
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,420
If something happens to them,

944
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,940
you won't be able to compete

945
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,300
in the upcoming tournament.

946
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,060
I'm sorry, Qiao Zhi.

947
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,900
I'm fine, aren't I?

948
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,060
Besides, we're family.

949
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,740
You don't have to apologize.

950
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,260
But that person who keeps harassing you?

951
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,500
We have to teach him a lesson.

952
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,980
You don't need to worry about this.

953
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,100
Focus on the competition.

954
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,380
Use your cooking skills

955
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,980
to win back your grandfather's honor.

956
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:35,820
Got it.

957
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,060
And you.

958
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,700
I talked to you earnestly before,

959
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,820
but you wouldn't listen.

960
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,820
Being an internet celebrity
was your own choice.

961
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,020
You'll run into problems
like this often.

962
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,580
From now on,
clean your own mess, OK?

963
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,140
OK.

964
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,420
I don't need any of you to help.

965
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,660
Are you really going
to let her face this alone?

966
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,900
Do you not worry?

967
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,780
It's fine.

968
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,020
Just focus on your own business.

[Mr. Song]
Rushuang's commercial deals got canceled,

972
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,420
and she's been benched.

973
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,580
You've met Mr. Biao, right?

974
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,580
Do you know who Mr. Biao is?

975
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,020
Chairman of the Culinary Association.

976
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,500
The whole industry follows his lead.

977
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,500
I thought you didn't have a clue.

978
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,100
Turns out you've found out
much by yourself.

979
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,100
You need to maintain

980
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,780
such an important connection.

981
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,340
I will.

982
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,500
After all,

he's my sworn grandfather now.

984
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,460
I respect him
from the bottom of my heart.

985

What?

986
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,860
He acknowledged you as his...

987
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:54,980
Yes.

988
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,740
And

989
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,220
he granted me the one-star chef title

However, besides me,

So you finally decided to contact me?

1004
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
You're such a big star.

1005
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
I can't call you for no reason, can I?

1006
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,660
So does that mean
you have something to ask me now?

1007
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,620
I need a favor from you, indeed.

1008
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,860
How practical.

1009
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,500
Aren't you afraid
of losing me as a friend?

1010
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,180
No.

1011
00:38:59,340 --> 00:38:59,900
Because you're not

1012
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,340

Alright.

She has always dreamed
of joining the show business.

1019
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,260
I wonder if you can give her a chance,

1020

I will tell you, I swear.
