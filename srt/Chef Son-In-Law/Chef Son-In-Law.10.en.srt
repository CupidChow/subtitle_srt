763
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,500
Tao Rende

764
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,660
was bullying you,

765
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,660
limiting your reach

766
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,900
and leaving bad reviews.

767
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,220
So, confront him!

768
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,740
No wonder you're suddenly so confident.

769
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,260
Were you moved to tears?

770
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,140
Quit being so cheeky.

771
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,860
Keep up the good work.

772
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,820
I'll step up the marketing for you.

773
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,500
Is that all the thanks I get?

774
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,180
At least peel this for me!

775
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,380
Just a moment.
Mr. Huang will be here very soon.

776
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:12,860
Okay.

777
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,100
Qiao Zhi,

778
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,620
sorry to have kept you waiting so long.

779
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,220
I heard you arrived,

780
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,700
so I came right over from my meeting.

781
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,700
No problem at all.

782
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,300
As the CEO of such a large corporation,

783
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,140
you must be incredibly busy.

784
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,820
I can wait.

785
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,660
Don't give me that.

786
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,580
I'm well-informed.

787
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,700
You're a total rising star!

788
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,980
Your time is very valuable.

789
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,820
Sit down.

790
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,180
What I do

791
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,180
is just messing around.

792
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,580
A bit of entertainment for the masses.

793
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,420
By the way,

794
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,860
here

795
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,900
is Cistanche and Lamb Kidney Soup.

796
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,740
It has remarkable effects.

797
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,740
And this

798
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,820
is the menu for this week.

799
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,700
It was specially

800
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,620
put together just for you.

801
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,540
To be honest,

802
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,740
I really need this.

803
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
But I feel bad

804
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,860
about making you deliver it in person.

805
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,460
How about this?

806
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,020
Send me the recipe later.

807
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,220
I can have someone else make it for me.

808
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,540
Diet therapy and TCM
are of the same source,

809
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,420
so too much diet therapy

810
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,620
can be bad for your health.

811
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,420
Otherwise,

812
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,700
tell your assistant

813
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,380
to add me on WeChat,

814
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,180
so he can pick things up from me.

815
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,380
You are busy every day,

816
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,300
yet you have to manage my daily diet.

817
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,940
I don't know how I can repay this favor.

818
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,540
Let's first see
if it can solve the problem.

819
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,740
If it really works,

820
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,540
you can

821
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,580
repay me then.

822
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,260
Okay.

823
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,340
By the way,

824
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,140
when drinking this soup,

825
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,180
do I need

826
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,300
to abstain from smoking and drinking?

827
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,100
In moderation.

828
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,180
But

829
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,100
must not stay up late.

830
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:43,860
And

831
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,260
a good mood is very important.

832
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,100
With you taking care of my diet,

833
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,700
I'll always be happy.

834
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,220
We chefs love hearing things like that.

835
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,220
By the way,

836
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,020
I heard you and Mu Xiao

837
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,540
are doing a livestream over a meal.

838
00:28:59,460 --> 00:28:59,940
Well,

839
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,380
have you decided on the platform yet?

840
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,660
As you know,

841
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,540
there's some misunderstanding

842
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,340
between me and the Tianxiang Rankings.

843
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,260
I was hoping to use this livestream

844
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,940
to clear things up.

845
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,900
After all, the restaurant business
can't avoid them.

846
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,860
That might not be the case.

847
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,260
You have to understand,

848
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,620
the biggest traffic reach
for any platform

849
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,940
is right here now.

850
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,180
What do you say?

851
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,900
Think about it.

852
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,020
I can give an extra push.

853
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,540
Well, that would depend

854
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,900
on how big a push.

855
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,100
An entire army of them!

856
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:31,900
Oh,

857
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,620
one more thing.

858
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,260
What is this?

859
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,500
One tablet before bed.

860
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,700
You really...

861
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,420
Alright.

862
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,180
You've given me the full treatment.

863
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,260
Come here.

864
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,940
Put this over here.

865
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,820
Arrange a few more.

866
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,780
[Mu Xiao Time]
Hi everyone, I'm Mu Xiao.

867
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,660
A while ago, I unexpectedly discovered

868
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,620
a delicious restaurant called Canteen.

869
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,620
It was so incredibly great

870
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,620
that I couldn't resist

871
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,900
sharing it with you.

872
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,980
I never expected it would go viral.

873
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,460
So you love delicacies as much as I do,

874
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,500
today I'll explore the place

875
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,980
with all of you.

876
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,340
Mu Xiao,

877
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
these flowers are for you.

878
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,940
Thank you!

879
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,580
I saw on your livestream before

880
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,900
that tulips are your favorite.

881
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,740
You are so sweet!

882
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,620
May we have the dishes served now?

883
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,460
No problem.

884
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,180
Okay.

885
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,860
I wonder what delicious food

886
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,460
I'll be eating today!

887
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,420
Your master is quite sly.

888
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,060
Even prepared flowers
and had Ding Chan deliver them!

889
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,340
You're one to talk!

890
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,180
You're the slyest.

891
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,820
No.

892
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,300
I'm smart.

893
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,340
Do you realize?

894
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,220
I'm not like you.

895
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,140
A live stream on all platforms today.

896
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,820
The platform pulls this stunt today.

897
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,660
Hello, viewers!

898
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,740
Can it really work?

899
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,820
Pulling this kind of show?

900
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,460
No, I mean.

901
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,780
After working so hard for so long,

902
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,180
we just ended

903
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,420
up with this?

904
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,660
So this is

905
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,460
the delicacy you prepared for me today?

906
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,060
Yes.

907
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,260
Just...

908
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,820
one dish?

909
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,340
Just one single dish!

910
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,100
Every time,

911
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,860
you manage to surprise me differently.

912
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,500
Everyone,

913
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,580
[How stingy! Trying to get rid
of Xiao with just one dish!]

914
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:35,740
you saw that.

915
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,300
Mr. Qiao only prepared one dish

916
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,740
for me today.

917
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,500
I haven't eaten anything all day

918
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,140
before coming here today.

919
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,580
But he seems

920
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,020
pretty confident about it.

921
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,940
I believe

922
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,020
it will be delicious.

923
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,620
However,

924
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,060
this dish looks like

925
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,260
an ordinary braised goose.

926
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,300
Perhaps there's a hidden trick to it.

927
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,660
Mr. Qiao,

928
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,900
why don't you introduce us

929
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,700
to how it's eaten?

930
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,420
Just use your hands and dig in.

931
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,060
With

932
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,060
my hands?

933
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,420
What on earth is he doing?

934
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,260
Why is he acting so strange today?

935
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,220
Want a top celebrity
to eat with bare hands?

936
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,820
Have the promotional resources
been arranged?

937
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,580
Don't worry.

938
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,300
Kuaiyin's traffic boost is maxed out.

939
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,900
This is a huge event.

940
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,260
We need to give it our all.

941
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,780
Are you tricking me?

942
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,020
Before I came,

943
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,700
you told the staff

944
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,660
to set me up?

945
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:33,980
Of course not!

946
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,620
When serving a big star,

947
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,020
I won't serve an ordinary dish.

948
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,100
Actually, this dish

949
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,540
is called Roasted Gosling in a Whole Lamb.

950
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,420
It's a long-lost, legendary dish.

951
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,020
Taste it.

952
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,220
I'll trust you just this once.

953
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,820
If you set me up,

954
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,260
the reputation of your Canteen

955
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,460
will be ruined!

956
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,660
What's wrong? You seem to be so intently.

957
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,460
I'm fine.

958
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,020
This dish that Qiao Zhi made

959
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:57,900
is…

960
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,420
This is truly
Roasted Gosling in a Whole Lamb.

961
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,380
What? So tongue-twisting!

962
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:05,980
You wouldn't understand.

963
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,620
This famous dish was lost for ages.

964
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,620
I never thought he could make it.

965
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,740
He

966
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,220
really did it!

967
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,140
Right now, I'm just dying

968
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,740
to go over and take a bite.

969
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,700
Just one bite.

970
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,560
[Could it be an act? After all,
Xiao can make anything look real.]

971
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,880
[An act, my foot! If she were acting,
she won't look like that?]

972
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,840
[Definitely not an act.
It looks so incredibly delicious!]

973
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,320
[The boss is full of hidden talents!
Xiao seems really satisfied.]

974
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,740
You seemed to have known this?

975
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,940
Your understanding

976
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,100
of your master

977
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,260
is too superficial.

978
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,980
But you were quite flustered just now.

979
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,820
That was acting!

980
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,620
Bro,

981
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,700
acting! Get it?

982
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,100
Do you understand what acting is?

983
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,500
Foreign actors like Francis, blah blah.

984
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,700
Those who like him.

985
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,220
Don't get it.

986
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,580
Look at them!

987
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,380
Don't get it.

988
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,260
So delicious, everyone!

989
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,650
[Xiao's recommendations are top-notch!]

990
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,780
[Is anyone go eat there together?]
Now I know why he

991
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,810
[Do I need a reservation?
I really want to try it.]

992
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,500
prepared just one dish for me today.

993
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,300
Because after eating this,

994
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,300
other dishes are simply

995
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,340
hard to swallow.

996
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,300
How can I describe

997
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,540
the taste of this dish?

998
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:42,940
Unique.

999
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,540
It clearly looks

1000
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,700
like ordinary braised goose,

1001
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,580
but it doesn't have the taste of goose.

1002
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,860
Instead, it tastes like…

1003
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:51,780
Mutton.

1004
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:52,500
Yes!

1005
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,140
The flavor of mutton.

1006
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:55,780
Not bad.

1007
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,970
[This is Roasted Gosling in a Whole Lamb,
a legendary lost dish!]

1008
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,500
The main ingredients for this dish

1009
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,140
are a young goose and mutton.

1010
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,380
Although the ingredients are simple,

1011
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,660
it's complicated to prepare it.

1012
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:05,820
First,

1013
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,420
the sheep and goose are butchered,

1014
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,740
and their innards are removed.

1015
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,340
Then, minced meat

1016
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,020
and glutinous rice are stuffed

1017
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,860
inside the goose's belly.

1018
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,460
This mixture is seasoned
with various spices and condiments.

1019
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,860
After that, the young goose is placed

1020
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,020
into the belly of the sheep.

1021
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,540
Once sewn shut,

1022
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,580
it is roasted in a special way.

1023
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,060
When the sheep is almost cooked,

1024
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,700
the young goose inside
is taken out to be served.

1025
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,580
This way,

1026
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
all the essence

1027
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,980
is concentrated within the young goose.

1028
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,820
I believe the process

1029
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,500
is far from as simple as
you make it sound.

1030
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,100
Otherwise, this dish

1031
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
wouldn't have become a lost art.

1032
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,220
Canteen

1033
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,580
has more

1034
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,380
of the lost Chinese delicacies

1035
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,940
Through the long Chinese history,

1036
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,990
[That sounds great.
I must check Canteen out!]

1037
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,620
the wisdom accumulated by our ancestors.

1038
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,860
[Learned something new!
Mr. Qiao is a chef with real passion.]

1039
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,420
far exceeded everyone's expectations.

1040
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,820
But in recent years,

1041
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,100
as the economy has developed,

1042
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,260
our pace of life

1043
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,100
has become faster.

1044
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,340
So,

1045
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,700
many complex craftsmanship techniques

1046
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,980
have gradually faded from view.

1047
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,780
Canteen

1048
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,500
is precisely about letting fine cuisine

1049
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
return to its true essence.

1050
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,460
If you're willing to come often,

1051
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,780

[Excellent.
I'll eat there if I get the chance!]

1054
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,540
Mr. Qiao,

1055
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,780
can I

A chef's hands

1070
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,820
are like a second life.

No wonder you're an actress.

You didn't flinch before the camera.

1110

1111
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,580
when you added me on WeChat,

1112
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,540
your act was so fake.

Oh.

1117
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,340
I'm not a professional.

1118
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,780
I should stick to cooking.
