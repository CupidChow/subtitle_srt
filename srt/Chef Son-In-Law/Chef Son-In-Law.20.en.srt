244
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,340
I have a question.

245
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,780
Are we opening a branch

246
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,940
or going into the delivery business?

247
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,580
Neither.

A goddess has to be paired with a BMW.

382
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,140
Do you like it?

383
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,300
You're quite thoughtful.

384
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,140
Of course.

385
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,420
The key.

386
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,060
Congratulations to Ms. Guo

387
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,700
on becoming the distinguished owner
of a BMW.

388
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,340
May the vast blue sky and white clouds…

389
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,420
May the vast…

390
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,540
May…

391
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,060
May the vast blue sky and white clouds

392
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,540
embrace your beauty and aspirations.

393
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,860
May your journey ahead

394
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,980
be smooth.

395
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,860
Show it!

396
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,180
It's not a sports car.

397
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,380
No.

398
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:51,940
Well,

399
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,740
we have to go step by step.

400
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,020
Give me a little more time.

401
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,500
Okay.

402
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,660
Thank you.

403
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,100
Let's go.

404
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,940
Where to?

405
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,220
For a drive!

406
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,420
Yes, a drive!

407
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,460
Still showing off, huh?

408
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,380
Careful!

409
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,140
You're playing quite well.

410
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,980
Stop going easy on me

411
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,500
and play at your true level.

412
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,180
This has always been my true level.

413
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,940
Alright then.

414
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:50,980
Let's start.

415
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,140
Come on.

416
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,060
Start already!

417
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,180
Are you okay?

418
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,660
How are you feeling now?

419
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,860
I'm fine, let's go again.

420
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,620
No!

421
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,740
Let me see.

422
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,940
You've sprained your ankle.

423
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,940
How can you go again?

424
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,500
We're done for today.

425
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,780
I'll carry you.

426
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,380
You're quite light.

427
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,900
You must be under 60kg, right?

428
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,260
Nonsense!

429
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,220
I'm clearly only 45kg.

430
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:43,780
No way.

431
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,220
You must have set your scale
to a lower sensitivity.

432
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,220
You're too weak.

433
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,060
If you can't carry me, I'll walk.

434
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,180
Listen.

435
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,020
You won't get off easily.

436
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,620
Let's go.

437
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,460
Be careful.

438
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,020
Today,

439
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,020
I guess I was like Pigsy
carrying his wife.

440
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,820
Look at you!

441
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,060
Even uglier than Pigsy.

442
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,820
So be it.

443
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,700
Although Pigsy was ugly,

444
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,580
he had great luck with the ladies.

445
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,020
In heaven,

446
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,740
he was making eyes at Chang'e.

447
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,700
And on earth,

448
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,660
he fell for the beautiful Gao Cuilan.

449
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,140
Moreover, Pigsy,

450
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,260
despite his ugliness,

451
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,380
was exceptionally

452
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,780
gentle and attentive

453
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,980
towards women.

454
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,900
So you're emulating Pigsy,

455
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,780
knowing full well she is a female demon,

456
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,500
still offering yourself up.

457
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,220
What demon?

458
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,540
She might be hiding in some cave.

459
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,300
You're talking nonsense!

460
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,740
I'll get you some medicine.

461
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:01,980
Here.

462
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,860
Be careful.

463
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,420
Gently now.

464
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,100
Bear with it.

465
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,380
Gently.

466
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,020
Are you feeling any better?

467
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,540
It can't get better that quickly!

468
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,380
By the way,

469
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,900
Mom is getting discharged
the day after tomorrow.

470
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,940
What should we do
about what she asked us to do?

471
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,580
I think

472
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,060
we can't hide it forever.

473
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,860
Just do what needs to be done.

474
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,620
Seems you have a plan.

475
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,020
There's nothing wrong for us

476
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,020
to do that, right?

477
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,820
Qiao Zhi!

478
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:08,860
What are you doing?

479
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,420
Want to bite me?

480
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,220
What if I bite you?

481
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,220
Don't. You...

482
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:13,980
I…

483
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,140
I can bite, too.

484
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,420
Come on then.

485
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,380
Fine.

Okay.

501
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,580
Alright, I'm on my way.

502
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,700
Sorry.

503
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,860
That was

504
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,860
an accident.

505
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,460
It was.

506
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,860
We've agreed

507
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,020
not to have a baby for now.

508
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,380
We agreed.

509
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,500
What if you can't hold it back?

510
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,420
Well...

511
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,380
Theoretically,

512
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,740
that possibility exists.

513
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,260
Because…

514
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:28,900
After all

515
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,180
I'm

516
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
a normal man.

517
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,620
Then

518
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,420
we need

519
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,580
to take precautions.

520
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,940
What?

521
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,220
Precautions!

522
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,100
Remember to buy some
before Mom gets back.

523
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,620
I, I'll buy them.

524
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
I'll buy them.

525
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,500
The co-branded zones again!

526
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,740
The Eight Great Restaurants
at the same time!

527
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,020
Qiao Zhi,

528
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,780
I underestimated you.

529
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,540
Dad,

530
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,220
it's just a co-branded zone.

531
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,940
Why should you get so angry?

532
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,620
The Eight Great Restaurants
have expanded their co-branded zones.

533
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,900
They have announced

534
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,100
their goal is to go public.

535
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,420
They are rebelling against me.

536
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,060
Don't you understand?

537
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,700
But we hold shares in Huaixiang.

538
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,860
Right now, most shareholders

539
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,420
among the Huaixiang board of directors

540
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,740
have sided with Tao Nanfang.

541
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,820
Once she is discharged,

542
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,100
she'll first

543
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,620
force out our shares.

544
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,180
Can she just do what she wants?

545
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,500
You are worrying too much, Dad.

546
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,780
Worrying too much?

547
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,740
I'm taking precautions!

548
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,140
What if Qiao Zhi's co-branded zones
are established nationwide,

549
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,380
and he wins a place in the championship

550
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,900
for the Huaixiang Group?

551
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,300
Have you considered the consequences?

552
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,260
Sit down first.

553
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,980
I'll make sure

554
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,180
he doesn't get a place.

555
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,820
Just make him no longer part
of the Huaixiang Group.

556
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,660
That would solve it.

557
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,380
Go on.

558
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,980
This is what I'm thinking.

559
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,540
Don't get your hands dirty.

560
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,380
I'll start with his team at Canteen

561
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,540
and completely

562
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,180
destroy Qiao Zhi's life's work.

563
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,180
First,

564
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,980
I'll throw him into chaos.

565
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,860
Second,

566
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,220
I'll make him touch
Tao Nanfang's sore spot

567
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,060
and prove that he's having an affair.

568
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,700
That way,

569
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,700
he'll be kicked out.

570
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:40,900
In the end,

571
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,220
he'll be nothing more than a stray dog.

572
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,420
By that time,

573
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,300
Mr. Biao, who has no children,

574
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,300
will be completely disappointed.

575
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,820
Then his assets

576
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,540
can only be taken over by us.

577
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,740
Once Huaixiang is in chaos,

578
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,820
the boss

579
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,940
of the Eight Great Restaurants

580
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,580
will still be you.

581
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,500
You have my drive from back in the day.

582
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,500
Tomorrow, come with me to see Mr. Biao.

583
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,500
Got it.

584
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,140
Dad,

585
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,580
can we agree

586
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,380
you won't slap me in the face?

587
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,360
[Canteen]

588
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,260
These so-called viral dishes
are disgusting!

589
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,420
Get your manager over here!

590
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,260
Sorry.

591
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,500
I'll get you new ones right away.

592
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,460
Hello,

593
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,700
I'm the manager.

594
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,900
Is there a problem?

595
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,940
We drove here for three hours,

596
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,940
and you served us these?

597
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,700
Try them yourself.

598
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,220
Yeah,

599
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,780
try them.

600
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,860
The presentation looks fine.

601
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,940
They may look pretty good

602
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,020
but taste worse
than a street vendor's food.

603
00:24:59,340 --> 00:24:59,860
I'm sorry,

604
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,700
let me have a taste.

605
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,860
How is it?

606
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,540
What do you think?

607
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm terribly sorry.

608
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,260
You two came all this way,

609
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,020
and we won't let you leave disappointed.

610
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,020
How about this?

611
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,700
First, we will refund you for the dishes

612
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,300
and prepare new ones for you.

613
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
We will also give you some coupons.

614
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,540
Would that be okay with you?

615
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:31,940
What's wrong?

616
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,420
Bao's dishes got a complaint.

617
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,660
Another complaint?

618
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,060
The customers said
they didn't taste as good as before.

619
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,180
Bao has training sessions

620
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,900
and needs to help Guo Yan.

621
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,420
Alright, I got it.

622
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,260
Don't worry about it.

623
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,700
Bao,

624
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,180
it's done.

625
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,660
You're here just in time, Zhi.

626
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,020
Try them while they're fresh.

627
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:00,940
Okay.

628
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,300
Who made this?

629
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,820
Mr. Zhou.

630
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,220
Clearly,

631
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,060
we can see

632
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
your knife work

633
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,180
is quite delicate,

634
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,860
but you were too forceful with it.

635
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,660
The meat has been diced too finely,

636
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,060
which disrupts its texture

637
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,140
and affects the mouthfeel.

638
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,980
You made these?

639
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,860
Yes.

640
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,060
These three

641
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,260
are excellent.

642
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,940
Tender and fresh.

643
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:55,980
They've passed.

644
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
Thank you, Mr. Qiao.

645
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,540
Alright,

646
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,420
chefs,

647
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,900
if there's a problem with your dish,

648
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,180
please optimize it

649
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,780
according to Mr. Qiao's requirements.

650
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,620
There are limited qualification
and opportunities

651
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,620
to be a chef
for our co-branded dishes.

652
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,900
If next time, you still fail to meet

653
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,180
Mr. Qiao's standards,

654
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,660
I'll have to revoke your qualification

655
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,380
as a chef for these special dishes.

656
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,420
Of course,

657
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,460
after you become a chef
for co-branded dishes,

658
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,940
Mr. Qiao will not be stingy

659
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,260
with your salary and benefits.

660
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,380
Understand?

661
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:27,940
Yes.

662
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,820
So you

663
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,100
can go back.

664
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,540
Okay.

665
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,420
Thank you.

666
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,660
Bye, Mr. Qiao.

667
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,540
Bao,

668
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,820
stay behind tonight.

669
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,660
I need to talk with you.

670
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,180
Madam.

671
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,140
You came back in advance.

672
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,140
Is everything at home okay?

673
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:58,900
Everything is fine.

674
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,300
Is Ruxue not home?

675
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,420
She went to work.

676
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,700
Is she still sleeping alone?

677
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,460
Then where does Qiao Zhi sleep?

678
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,860
The empty room downstairs.

679
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,700
Move his things up here.

680
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,380
No one is staying in that room
from now on.

681
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,260
Then where will he stay?

682
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,180
Of course, with his wife!

683
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,180
On the same bed!

684
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,500
If they sleep together,

685
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,940
won't they fight?

686
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,140
They can fight,

687
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,380
but fight on the same bed.

688
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,460
Then you'll have a grandchild soon!

689
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,340
Enough talk.

690
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,140
Pack his things.

691
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,500
Remember to lock that door tight!

692
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:56,980
Yes.

693
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,060
Oh no!

694
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,020
Mom,

695
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,660
you didn't tell anyone
you were getting discharged.

696
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,460
I would have picked you up!

697
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,940
You are a legal couple.

698
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,500
How long are you going to sleep
in separate beds?

699
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,620
I've been too busy with work lately.

700
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,380
I completely forgot.

701
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,700
He has been sleeping here
yet hasn't moved in.

702
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,740
Well, that's perfect.

703
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,300
I've packed his things here.

704
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,020
You're

705
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,340
too stubborn.

706
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,180
I know you have your own reasons,

707
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,580
but on this matter,

708
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,740
you must listen to me.

709
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,860
I managed to get through this ordeal,

710
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,340
but who knows

711
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,260
what will happen next.

712
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,660
I hope that in my lifetime,

713
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,660
I can arrange everything for you.

714
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,940
Then even if I'm gone,

715
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,500
I won't have any regrets.

716
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,380
Oh, Mom.

717
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,220
What are you talking about?

718
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,220
The doctor said

719
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,340
you've fully recovered now,

720
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,740
and the chance of relapse is very low.

721
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,860
Come on,

722
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,380
just grant

723
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,820
this dying person's wish.

724
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,980
Get along well with Qiao Zhi,

725
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,300
start a family and give birth to a baby.

726
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,340
You've been married for so long

727
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,100
and still have no kids.

728
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,820
People will start talking about it.

729
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,700
Mom!

730
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,420
Whether I have children or not

731
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,460
is none of their business!

732
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,820
It's my business.

733
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,180
Starting today,
Qiao Zhi will be staying here.

734
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,780
Don't push me like this.

735
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,740
Alright,

736
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,260
hand it over.

737
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,340
What?

738
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,860
Your phone.

739
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:45,940
Give it to me.

740
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,620
Why?

741
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,100
Don't think about tipping anyone off!

742
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,720
[Canteen]

743
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,780
Zhi.

744
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,540
What's wrong?

745
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,860
Why wait until everyone's gone?

746
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,660
Bao,

747
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,100
your dishes have

748
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,140
been complained about three times.

749
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,060
Rest assured.

750
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,380
There won't be a fourth time.

751
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,220
You can't help Guo Yan

752
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,060
with cooking your whole life.

753
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,500
You already know.

754
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,260
Well,

755
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,380
recently,

756
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,340
things have

757
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,220
been too busy,

758
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,660
and I haven't managed to handle it.

759
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,380
Bro,

760
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,140
our team will keep moving forward.

761
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,460
