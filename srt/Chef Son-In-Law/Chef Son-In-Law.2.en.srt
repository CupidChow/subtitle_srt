Mom didn't ask you
to have a child right now.

190
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,120
Mom has a lot of time.

191
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,720
Am I right, Mom?

192
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,880
Yes.

193
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,680
As long as you get on well,

194
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
I can wait until that day.

195
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,560
Xue.

196
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,560
You should discuss

197
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,680
the matters of the company together.

198
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,200
Qiao Zhi will definitely be of help.

199
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,800
And also,

200
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,560
your uncle has won over
many shareholders and chefs.

201
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,760
As far as I know,

202
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
he still keeps in touch

203
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,480
with the Zhan family.

204
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,160
Both of you

205
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,720
should beware of him.

206
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,920
Got it, Mom.

207
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,680
Good.

208
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,440
That's nice.

209
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,880
Good.

210
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,240
[Outpatient Building]

211
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,320
Good for you.

212
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,280
You called my mom so naturally.

213
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,560
That's no big deal.

214
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,000
If I can't even bear this,

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,540
how can I obtain your family's wealth?

216
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
In your dreams.

217
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,860
My mom is not that stupid.

218
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,460
Really?

219
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,740
Your mother likes me very much.

220
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,580
Otherwise, how would she have let you

221
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,700
marry me, who can only rely on you?

222
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,740
Nonsense.

223
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,780
Impressive.

224
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,180

Thank you so much.

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,700
Everyone, that's all

237
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,620
for today.

238
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,500
Good night.

239
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,860
Bye-bye.

240
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,020
Who is it?

241
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,420
Who is it?

242
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,980
Who are you?

243
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,980
Are you crazy?

244
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,060
Can you pay first?

245
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,900
Sir, wait a minute.

246
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,140
This is the place.

247
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,740
That's right.

248
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,700
What's wrong with you?

249
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,820
Excuse me, I'd like to ask

250
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,100
who you are.

251
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,980
Are you a housekeeper?

252
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,300
Of course not! Who are you?

253
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,980
I may have come to the wrong place.

255
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,980
I'm looking for Tao Ruxue.

256
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,860
Sorry.

257
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,060
Come back.

258
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,620
Why are you looking for Tao Ruxue?

259
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,580
I...

260
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,300
To go to our home.

261
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,180
Go to your home?

262
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,420
What's Tao Ruxue to you?

263
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,540
What does it have to do with you?

264
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,540
What's your relationship with her?

265
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,740
Why should I tell you?

266
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,500
Alright then.

267
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,580
Then let's say it together.

268
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,580
- She's my wife.
- She's my sister.

269
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,260
My sister-in-law?

270
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,820
How come I have a brother-in-law?

271
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,020
I have to go back
to find other passengers!

272
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,260
Coming right away, sir!

273
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,100
My sister-in-law.

274
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,020
May I have your QR code for now?

275
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,060
I'll pay the fare.

276
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,580
Why can't you even afford the fare?

277
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,780
I can't believe my sister married you!

278
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,500
Sir.

279
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,860
Sir.

280
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,260
Here, scan it.

281
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,940
OK.

282
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,020
Alright.

283
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,780
Open the trunk.

284
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,900
Thank you.

285
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,580
You are welcome.

286
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,700
Who asked you to come?

287
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,860
It's Mom.

288
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,660
She called the hotel
and checked out for me.

289
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,380
I planned to pay it
when I received my salary.

290
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,340
Now that she checked me out,

291
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,220
all the money in my card
went to the hotel.

292
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,140
That's right.

293
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,060
I actually paid for his taxi.

294
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,980
Poor him.

295
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,660
You won't drive him away, will you?

296
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,140
Drive me away?

297
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,340
That's fine.

298
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,060
Give me the money you promised me,

299
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,860
and I'll go now.

300
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,860
Money?

301
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,580
What money? How much is it?

302
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,940
So you don't know it yet?

303
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,140
Your sister and I...

304
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,780
Enough. Tao Rushuang,

305
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,380
it has nothing to do with you here.

306
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,980
Mind your own business.

307
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,460
Why would it have nothing to do with me?

308
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,900
After all, he's my brother-in-law.

309
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,020
Let me tell you,

310
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,500
if my sister doesn't give you money,

311
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,780
just tell me, and I'll give it to you.

312
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,860
Tao Rushuang,

313
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,180
do you enjoy watching me
make a fool of myself?

314
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,420
And all of your stuff.

315
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,180
I told you not to do livestreams
at home so many times.

316
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,260
Do it outside if you must.

317
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,580
This is also my home.

318
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,500
Leave me alone.

319
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,460
There, there.

320
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,020
There's no need to quarrel.

321
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,380
We are family.

322
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,580
No, we are not!

323
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,060
Alright.

324
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,140
We are not family.

325
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,340
Then give me the money,

326
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,100
and I'll go now.

327
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,700
I don't have it now.

328
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,620
Wait a few days.

329
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,340
Where should I live then?

330
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,460
Should I sleep on an overpass

331
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,420
or in a bridge hole?

332
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,380
Sleep in a bridge hole?

333
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,500
How do you know that?

334
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,500
Have you done it before?

335
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,420
Sure.

336
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
When I was studying abroad...

337
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,180
Enough! Why are you even talking?

338
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,980
Ms. Chen's room is vacant now.

339
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,660
You'll sleep in her room.

340
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,100
Ruxue.

341
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,260
How can you let him
sleep in the housekeeper's room?

342
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,700
It's too much.

343
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,460
Mom is not here.

344
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,660
So I have the final say in this family.

345
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,100
If you don't want to stay, just go.

346
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,140
And you,

347
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,380
don't tell anyone about it.

348
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,220
I can actually stay anywhere.

349
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,580
Does your sister

350
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,740
usually behave like this?

351
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,460
She's got such a temper.

352
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,660
That's true.

353
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,900
She always loses her temper.

354
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,060
That's why she looks old.

355
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,900
Lower your voice, or she might hear it.

356
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,740
I've already heard it.

357
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,740
Sorry.

358
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,940
We'll lower our voices.

359
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,460
Zhi.

360
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,820
You're quite interesting.

361
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,820
Is it a fake marriage to deceive my mom?

362
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,060
Keep pretending.
I guessed it right, didn't I?

363
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,260
Since when have you been so close
to Zhan Shikun?

364
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,620
Stay away from him.

365
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,620
Why?

366
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,340
Why can't I contact Zhan Shikun?

367
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,780
There are a lot of things

368
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,180
you don't know

369
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,220
as you were little back then.

370
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,300
Do you remember the Canteen

371
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,820
your grandpa ran with Mr. Qiao?

372
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,540
Yes.

373
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,540
Wasn't it closed
due to poor management?

374
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,860
It's not poor management at all.

375
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,980

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,260
That's right.

565
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,340
Ms. Tao Junior.

566
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,660
You are still inexperienced.

567
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,820
It's your first day of work.

568
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,820
You should listen to your uncle

569
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,100
on these matters.

570
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,140
It will work.

571
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,140
Mr. Tao.

572
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,380
I think your suggestion might work.

573
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,140
Right.

574
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,100
I suggested it a few years ago.

575
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,620
If we had cooperated at that time,

576
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,580
we could have already earned a lot

577
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,900
over these years.

578
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,100
That's right.

579
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,860
That's a great loss.

580
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,420
That's right.

581
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,700
Everyone, be quiet.

582
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,620
We lost so much profit!

583
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,580
Everyone, be quiet.

584
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,340
The suppliers have gone so far.

585
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,060
Yes.

586
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,500
And now a little girl is in charge.

587
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:37,940
Yes.

588
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,820
How can that work?

589
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,300
A little girl running
such a big company?

590
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,180
Ms. Tao Junior.

591
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,500
You are still inexperienced.

592
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,380
It's your first day of work.

593
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,700
You should listen to your uncle
on these matters.

594
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,580
Too hasty.

595
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,620
She should start with the basic work.

596
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,500
That's quite right.

597
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,420
How can she be in this position

598
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,540
from the start?

599
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,100
This is not a responsible decision.

600
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,420
She can't convince us at all.

601
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,980
This is not a joke!

602
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,780
We can't get loans for the project.

603
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,660
Be quiet!

604
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,820
This is the company.

605
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,220
We are all employees
of the Huaixiang Group.

606
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,700
I'm sure all of you know

607
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,900
the basic guidelines for employees well.

608
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,860
As the assistant CEO,

609
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,660
I'll announce a new rule.

610
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,780
If anyone talks about matters

611
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,980
beyond the business

612
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,300
in the conference room,

613
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,980
just go through the resignation
procedures in the HR Department.

614
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:23,900
OK.

615
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
I will inform the HR Department

616
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,020
to add this rule

617
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,180
to the new regulation.

618
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,140
We can change the suppliers,

619
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,380
but we should strictly follow
the company's bidding process.

620
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,900
It must be completed within two months.

621
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,540
I will fully cooperate.

622
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,060
Next topic.

623
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,780
Huaixiang Restaurant

624
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,740
is the flagship store
of Huaixiang Catering Group.

625
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,860
It is famous for its authentic

626
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,700
and long-standing Huaiyang cuisine.

627
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,700
As it's the leader
of the eight major cuisines,

628
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,020
the chefs

629
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,340
working here

630
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,180
are all someone else.

631
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,620
You are late on your first day at work.

632
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,340
That's not proper at all.

633
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,400
[Bao Tong, junior chef]

634
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,380
Excuse me.

635
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,100
I won't be late

636
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,020
again.

637
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,300
What's your name?

638
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,260
Qiao Zhi.
[*Same as the transliteration of George]

639
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,020
Chinese name.

640
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,620
Just...

641
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,780
My surname is Qiao.

642
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,700
My first name is Zhi.

643
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,460
You're surnamed Qiao,
and you are Qiao Zhi?

644
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,660
Why do you have such a name?

645
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,100
You should go to a Western restaurant.

646
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,060
So here's the thing.

647
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,460
According to the rules,

648
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,660
offer the tea to me, your master.

649
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,860
Let me explain it.

650
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,660
I already have a master.

651
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,980
According to the rules from my master,

652
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,460
I can't be anyone else's apprentice.

653
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,540
But

654
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,300
I can call you my senior.

655
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,340
So I'm not qualified?

656
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:43,900
That's not it.

657
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,460
How about this?

658
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,980
I'll show you my skills.

659
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,900
Then you can decide
whose apprentice you'll be,

660
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,820
alright?

661
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,380
Come on.

662
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,620
Everyone, come here.

663
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,500
Today, we have a special guest,

664
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,300
the famous gourmet,

665
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,300
Xu Hexiang.

666
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,180
Who will prepare the dishes

667
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,060
for him?

668
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,780
Xu Hexiang is a well-known food fanatic.

669
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,220
He's strict with food.

670
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,380
Boss.

671
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,740
Why don't you do it?

672
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,700
I'll make the dock mutton soup

673
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,660
he ordered.

674
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,780
He also ordered the Wensi tofu.

675
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,900
Who will do it?

676
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,260
Alright.

677
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,220
Bao.

678
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,380
Is he your apprentice?

679
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:37,900
No.

680
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,620
Both of you will make the Wensi tofu.

681
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,580
Alright.

682
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,620
Get back to work, everyone.

683
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,020
Go.

684
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,180
Hurry up.

685
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,620
Don't keep Mr. Xu waiting.

686
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,660
Why did you raise your hand?

687
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,060
That's Xu Hexiang.

688
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,340
It's an honor for us

689
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,220
to have him comment on our dishes.

690
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,180
I...

691
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,900
Now it's my misfortune
to have you with me.

692
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,140
Fetch the tofu!

693
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,060
Here.

694
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,540
Watch carefully.

695
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,940
I'll teach you only once.

696
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,540
The threads of Wensi tofu

697
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,620
must be fine enough

698
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,180
so that they melt in your mouth.

699
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,860
You are dazzled, aren't you?

700
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,500
It'd take you years

701
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,380
to master such cutting skills.

702
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,180
Are you okay?

703
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,500
I'm used to it.

704
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,020
I got used to it.

705
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,380
You cut this?

706
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,140
You are quite good at bluffing.

707
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,340
They are as thick as chopsticks.

708
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,540
Can you even cook this stuff?

709
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,700
Well...

710
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,380
Chao, wasn't it always like this before?

711
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,220
I'm teaching my apprentice.
Don't make me look bad.

712
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,300
Why haven't you made any progress
in the past few years?

713
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,940
If you mess it up,

714
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,380
even your uncle can't protect you.

715
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,900
Cut it again!

716
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,660
Well...

717
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,540
Chao is a national chef,

718
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,100
so he has high standards.

719
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:37,900
Am I right?

720
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,660
Well...

721
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,820
I'll show you again.

722
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,100
Why isn't the Wensi tofu
Mr. Xu ordered ready yet?

723
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,740
Our guest has been urging us
for a long time.

724
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,380
It will be in no time. I'm cutting it.

725
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,300
Hurry up!

726
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,380
If you offend Mr. Xu,

727
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,380
forget about your future
in the industry.

728
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,340
I...

729
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,740
A nepo baby, she is.

730
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,740
I'll show you again.

731
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,660
I'm not in a good state today.

732
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,580
Well...

733
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,260
Qiao Zhi, right?

734
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,540
I'll go to the restroom.

735
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,980
Well, try to understand it by yourself.

736
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Keep an eye on it here.

737
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,180
When the tofu is used up,

738
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,980
get a new piece.

739
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,260
He totally wasted it.

740
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,500
Why are you standing still?
Where's the tofu?

741
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,100
I... Well...

742
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,460
Something went wrong!

743
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,940
After Mr. Xu ate the Wensi tofu,

744
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,020
he fainted!

745
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,900
Wensi tofu?

746
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,620
Bao Tong.

747
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,500
What's going on?

748
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,700
[Kuangyu Room]
Mr. Xu!

749
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,660
Hurry...

750
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,820
Someone has food poisoning

751
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,740

00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,780
You know, all of us are close.

939
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,700
Would it be possible

940
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,980
for you to give us an exception

941
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,700
and make

942
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,500
a fake proof?

943
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:10,940
I will try to treat

944
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,100
his disease,

945
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,380
but I will never fake a proof.

946
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,540
Mr. Chen.

947
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,740
Speaking of which,

948
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,460
I haven't thanked you yet.

949
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,620
If it weren't for you,

950
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,700
my grandpa

951
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,060
wouldn't have lasted so long back then.

952
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,420
Speaking of which,

953
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,460
I should thank your grandpa instead.

954
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,340
Over those five years,

955
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,620
he taught me

956
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,220
more than I had ever learned.

957
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,260
Fate is unpredictable.

958
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,740
I hadn't even made it to pay him back,

959
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,460
but he...

960
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,660
In fact, my grandpa enjoyed

961
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,900
his last five years.

962
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,340
He always told me
he met a soulmate in his late years.

963
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,500
Every time he came back
from the hospital, he told me

964
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,300
how you two discussed diet therapies.

965
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,660
He did?

966
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,980
He really said so?

967
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,780
Sure.

968
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,580
By the way,

969
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,060
his diary

970
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
ended up

971
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,220
with the last time you two
discussed the diet therapy.

972
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,180
Right.

973
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,980
It's exactly the discussion.

974
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,420
Every word of it.

975
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,340
Back then,

976
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,900
I thought your grandpa looked down on me

977
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,900
because he argued with me every day.

978
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,580
That old guy was really tough.

979
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,620
My grandpa

980
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,060
had thus changed several of his recipes.

981
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,020
I asked him back then,

982
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,980
but he just wouldn't say it.

983
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,700
Turns out

984
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,740
it was because of you.

985
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,700
That's right.

986
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,260
Qiao.

987
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,740
Thank you for visiting me

988
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,860
with your grandpa's diary.

989
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,860
Although I'm about to retire,

990
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,740
I am still the vice president
of the People's Hospital.

991
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,340
Just take me as your grandpa

992
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,300
and come to me if you ever need my help.

993
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,460
Here you are.

994
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,940
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

995
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,060
Actually,

996
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,380
I indeed need your help

997
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,620
today.

998
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,460
The director said it was epilepsy.

999
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,300
Then it has nothing
to do with food safety.

1000
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,460
We should talk about it with Xu Hexiang

1001
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,820
and give him some compensation.

1002
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,900
I think Mr. Xu would go easy on us.

1003
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,420
After all,

1004
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,820
my dad is close to him.

1005
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,500
This can indeed
stop the negative opinion.

1006
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,620
But we still need to find out
the cause as soon as possible.

1007
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,020
I believe there is no problem

1008
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,660
with the ingredients in our restaurant.

1009
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,660
My mom has attached great importance

1010
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,980
to this matter over the years.

1011
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:18,860
Rest assured.

1012
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,540
I'll definitely find it out.

1013
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,860
- Ms. Tao.
- Over there.

1014
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,620
Over there.

1015
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,420
Ms. Tao.

1016
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,860
You have just become the assistant CEO,

1017
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,180
and such a serious accident happened.

1018
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,700
Do you have anything to say about this?

1019
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,340
Right.

1020
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,220
Please respond to this matter.

1021
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,700
Sorry.

1022
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,740
There is nothing to say.

1023
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,380
Are you Mr. Zhan Shikun, the CEO

1024
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,420
of Baiwei Group?

1025
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,380
Why are you here?

1026
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,340
May I ask about your relationship
with Ms. Tao?

1027
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,940
Are you two dating?

1028
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,980
Rumor has it

1029
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,500
that Baiwei Group wants
to acquire Huaixiang Group.

1030
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,780
Is this true?

1031
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,700
Please don't make up rumors.

1032
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,980
We are not having any interviews today.

1033
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,740
Stop filming.

1034
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,100
Someone complained that
the procurement staff of Huaixiang Group

1035
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,620
received rebates from the suppliers,

1036
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,140
and this caused problems
with the ingredients.

1037
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,180
Is this true?

1038
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,340
Huaixiang Group

1039
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,500
will give you a reasonable explanation

1040
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,060
of the truth of the matter
in the future.

1041
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,220
Ms. Tao.

1042
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,420
May I have two minutes?

1043
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,340
Ms. Tao.

1044
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,260
Ms. Tao, please say a few words

1045
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,140
Ms. Tao.

1046
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,780
Say a few words.

1047
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,460
Hold on, Ms. Tao.

1048
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,020
Xu Hexiang is discharged!

1049
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,780
He lied! Don't let him go!

1050
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,580
Hurry!

1051
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,460
Come on.

1052
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,660
Ms. Tao!

1053
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,820
Ms. Tao, don't go!

1054
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,820
Ms. Tao!

1055
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:33,900
Ms. Tao!

1056
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,620
Please respond to it!

1057
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,100
Let's go over there.

1058
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,540
This way.

1059
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,860
I guess we lost them.

1060
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,100
Why are you here?

1061
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,940
It's not over yet, so I mustn't leave.

1062
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,780
Have you seen the attending physician?

1063
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,540
How's it going?

1064
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,780
He's out of danger.

1065
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,420
It's confirmed that it is epilepsy.

1066
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
It all depends on whether his family
is willing to accept a settlement.

1067
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
I'll go with you.

1068
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,020
After all, I cooked
the last dish he ate.

1069
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,180
Hey, you.

1070
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,340
If you can't handle it,

1071
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,980
you shouldn't have made that dish
for such an important guest.

1072
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,220
But Wensi tofu can't induce epilepsy.

1073
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,820
It's clearly ruining my reputation.

1074
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,020
You should go back.

1075
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,060
Don't let them see you.

1076
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,500
Otherwise, you'll be beaten up.

1077
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,460
It's okay.

1078
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,340
I've seen the list.

1079
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,660
I think I got the reason.

1080
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:27,860
Let's go.

1081
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,500
Who are you?

1082
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,900
I'm Tao Ruxue,

1083
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,220
the person in charge of Huaixiang Group.

1084
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,580
I'm here to visit Mr. Xu.

1085
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,340
Stop it.

1086
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,340
We have decided

1087
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,980
not to accept any compensation.

1088
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,180
Such an unethical restaurant

1089
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,820
like Huaixiang Restaurant

1090
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,340
