would need over a year to go
through procedures.

193
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,500
After all, we're merely a branch office

194
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,140
without independent
decision-making rights.

195
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,700
Among Chinese restaurants nationwide,

196
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,660
we boast the largest number of outlets.

197
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,580
Given our immense demand

198
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,860
for ingredients,

199
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,340
we can fully assist Huasheng Group

200
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,700
in expanding in China.

201
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,820
I know what you've mentioned.

202
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,420
To be frank with you,

203
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,980
Mr. Tao Rende from your company

204
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,940
had reached out to us.

205
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,420
He has contacted you?

206
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,580
But

207
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,140
his offer

208
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,500
was three percentage points
higher than yours.

209
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,540
All these are documented internally.

210
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,980
If I submit this report upward,

211
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,340
how would the headquarters

212
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,100
perceive my judgment?

213
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,740
I thought you came today

214
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,220
with a surprise,

215
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,100
offering me a more reasonable

216
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,780
and favorable quote.

217
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,220
How outrageous!

218
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,500
This is deliberately undermining me.

219
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:06,900
What?

220
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,300
I'm coming!

221
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,740
Would you

222
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,780
excuse me, please?

223
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,860
What happened?

224
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,820
Likely, a senior executive has arrived.

225
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,860
Rende holds all client connections.

226
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,260
If we can't close the deal
with Huasheng Group today,

227
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
we'll likely have to accept his instead.

228
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,060
Who knows how much profit he will get?

229
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,980
We should

230
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,940
discuss it with your mother.

231
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,940
After all,

232
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,180
ingredients are no small matter.

233
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,460
I told her about it.

234
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,300
But she always claims she has a headache

235
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,820
and asks me to discuss with Qiao Zhi.

236
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,980
Mr. Song, I just don't get it.

237
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,860
What's so great about him?

238
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,300
Why does Mom favor him so much?

239
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,540
I'm not sure,

240
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,660
but I trust her judgment

241
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,940
when it comes to evaluating people.

242
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,420
Go take a look.

243
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,060
A young lady.

244
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,540
Appears to be about your age.

245
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,180
- Qiao Zhi?
- Qiao Zhi?

246
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,780
What is he doing here?

247
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,980
And she's

248
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,260
practically fawning over him!

249
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,100
Miss, this way please.

250
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,060
Taking him by the arm!

251
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,980
You know what?

252
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,620
I never thought I'd taste it again
in this lifetime.

253
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,340
Once my canteen opens,

254
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,300
feel free to come by anytime.

255
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,380
Right.

256
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,740
I'm a shareholder,

257
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,220
albeit a minority one.

258
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,900
Not going to move on?

259
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,260
My father told me

260
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,180
to hold controlling shares
when investing,

261
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,220
but you're an exception.

262
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,180
Then thank your father.

263
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,580
You're welcome.

264
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,860
This gives us a starting point

265
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,620
to compete with Baiwei Group.

266
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,620
Besides, this is my decision.

267
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,660
Then thank you.

268
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,580
I'm leaving.

269
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,620
No need for the car.

270
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,380
I can go by myself.

271
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,260
You should go back early.

272
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,340
If anything comes up, I'll call you.

273
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,420
Alright, goodbye!

274
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,900
Crazy? Do you know how to drive?

275
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,180
Tao Ruxue,

276
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,420
no need to go this far
over just one million.

277
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,140
What's your relationship

278
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,980
with that young lady?

279
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,140
Why should I tell you?

280
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,300
I didn't ask about yours
with Zhan Shikun!

281

282

something highly significant

283
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,260
to the future of Huaixiang Group.

284
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,340
She's my college classmate.

285
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,380
That's all?

College classmate?

287

She took you by the arm.

288
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,740
You never pull your hand away
when others hold it.

289
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
What does that even mean?

290
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,300
Qiao,

291
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,100
why don't you get in the car?

292
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,300
Where are you heading?

293
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,300
We can give you a ride.

294
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,220
I'm going to cook for Mom.

295
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,860
After Xu Hexiang's incident,

296

Mr. Chen secretly suggested

297
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,020
preparing therapeutic meals for her.

298

Come on!

Isn't she your mom?

302
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,300
Yeah, so I agreed to do it!

303
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,540
Is Huaixiang Group a family affair?

304
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,180
Two different things.

305
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,140
You've forgotten our agreement?

306
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,540
If there's nothing else,

307

00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,540
Is this how someone asks for help?

Well.

383
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,900
Rushuang.

384
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,740
Pretty fast, huh?

385
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,940
What do you mean?

386
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,260
Scum!

387
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,420
What are you doing! Are you crazy?

388
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,380
What am I doing?

389
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,900
How dare you ask me that!

390
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,780
Don't you even know

391
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,060
what you have done?

392
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,340
I haven't done anything!

393
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,100
I just saw

394
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,980
you helping that girl into the room.

395
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,420
I filmed the whole thing on video.

396
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,380
You can explain it to Ruxue later!

397
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,220
Beat you first to vent my anger.

398
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,420
Why?

399
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,460
Wait. You...

400
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,380
Let go of me, you pervert!

401
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,580
Fine.

402
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,020
Since you're Ruxue's sister,

403
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,060
I'll explain myself once.

404
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,260
Never seen that lady before.

405
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,020
She was too drunk and some creep
was taking advantage of her.

406
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,740
I stepped in to help.
That's heroic behavior!

407
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,340
Her home is nearby.

408
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,420
She's passed out now,

409
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,140
so I have to take her
to the nearest hotel.

410
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,660
Now you get it?

411
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,620
What you men say is all nonsense.

412
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,100
Ruxue's been praying for an excuse
to divorce you.

413
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,900
Just wait! You'll leave with nothing.

414
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,420
Don't trust me? Suit yourself.

415
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:51,980
Sure thing.

416
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,820
If you want me to trust you,

417
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,140
take me inside to check.

418
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,060
If you took advantage of her,

419
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,900
Ruxue will divorce you

420
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,060
and I'll press charges.
You'll rot in jail.

421
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,140
Fine.

422
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,660
Keep your voice down.

423
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,580
Alright, I'll show you.

424
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,100
Come on. Let's go look.

425
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,340
Want to run away?

426
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,940
Fetching the room key.

427
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
Come and see for yourself.

428
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,220
Look how peacefully she's sleeping.

429
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,780
All her clothes are taken off.

430
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,460
This is what you call heroic behavior?

431
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,780
She was wearing it
and took it off herself.

432
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,980
Still making excuses.

433
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,980
She wasn't wearing anything
when I came in.

434
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,140
She drank too much

435
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
and was warm,

436
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,540
so she took off her clothes.

437
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,460
Perhaps

438
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,660
she likes sleeping naked.

439
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,180
Right?

440
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,620
You stayed in here

441
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,180
for a full minute

442
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,020
and even let out an oh sound.

443
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,940
What does one minute prove?

444
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,340
Are you seriously doubting me?

445
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,620
What are you doing?

446
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,540
This is evidence.

447
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,140
I'm taking it to Ruxue.

448
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,180
No recording.
It's a violation of privacy!

449
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,220
You two are even caring
about your privacy.

450
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,660
Stop messing around!

451
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,540
I don't even know her.

452
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,580
No connection between us!

453
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,980
Don't you believe it? Ask her

454
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,940
when she wakes up tomorrow.

455
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,820
See?

456
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,100
If you don't listen,

457
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,420
I'll pour all of these into your mouth.

458
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,540
Hand back my phone!

459
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,260
Stop messing around.

460
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,940
You claimed she got harassed

461
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,940
outside the bar

462
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,740
and you played the hero.

463
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,700
Yes! I'm completely in the right.

464
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,340
Great.

465
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,860
Let's go to the police station

466
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,460
to check the surveillance footage.

467
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,980
Wait! I don't think

468
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,100
this warrants police attention.

469
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,580
Obviously got something to hide.

470
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,660
You were trying to harass her

471
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,860
at the entrance of the bar.

472
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,420
Fine, let's go.

473
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,460
Let's go now.

474
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,060
Go.

475
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,060
Go.

476
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,820
My car is nearby.

477
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,100
Go get the car first.

478
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,040
[Qiao Zhi]

479
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,020
Here.

480
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
Thank you for your cooperation.

481
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,980
Such things happen frequently lately.

482
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,820
If it weren't for you,

483
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,980
I'm afraid that young lady...

484
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,900
This is my duty.

485
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,060
How I wish

486
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,620
everyone shared your vigilance.

487
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,180
Your girlfriend is so beautiful.

488
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,340
Should be more careful when you are out.

489
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,540
Sir,

490
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,780
I'm not his girlfriend.

491
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,700
Oh.

492
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,860
I'm talking nonsense.

493
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,900
Never mind. If that's all, we'll leave.

494
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,020
You may go now.

495
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,660
What never mind?

496
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,020
I need to make things clear!

497
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,060
What? Trying to take advantage of me?

498
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:50,940
Tell me.

499
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,740
[Public Security]
Why didn't you explain clearly?

500
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,540
Trying to take advantage of me?

501
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,780
Speak up!

502
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,900
Must you dwell on this?

503
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,700
Just a minor misunderstanding,

504
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
affects nothing at all.

505
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,100
No need for explanation.

506
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,620
Besides, we've already

507
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,420
got the task done.

508
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,260
Don't waste time on explanation.

509
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,900
This is the police station.

510
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,340
You think it's that fun or appealing?

511
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,060
Go explain it. I'm out!

512
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,540
What's more,

513
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,580
you're much more uglier than Ruxue.

514
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,540
Why should I take advantage of you?

515
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,860
You narcissist!

516
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,460
You!

517
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
How can you say that?

518
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,660
Do you believe?
I'll beat you to death here

519
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,980
and turn myself in.

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
Watch your tongue!

Apologize right now!

Sorry.

Sorry, I was wrong.

Never see again unless necessary.

Aren't you getting in the car?

Offending you, I dare not.

Mr. Qiao,

550
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,460
you should have told me.

I could've made it for you.

It's fine.

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,980
Actually...

572
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,460
Hello,

573
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,380
Mom,

574
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,700
how are you feeling?

575
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,020
Pretty good.

576
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,980
The doctor said I'm recovering well.

577
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,140
Qiao Zhi prepares therapeutic meals
for you?

578
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
You knew it?

579
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,260
Mr. Chen told me

580
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,060
he navigates the hospital better
than I do!

581
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,380
He's eyeing our family fortune,

582
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,620
so he has to stay extra eager!

583
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,540
Xue,

584
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,860
it's been some time
since you two got married.

585
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,460
What do you think of him?

586
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,660
Unreliable.

587
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,340
I'm asking you seriously.

588
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,300
I don't know either.

589
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,660
Truth is, I can't really figure him out.

590
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,340
He's different

591
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,620
from all the other men I've met before.

592
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,780
Let me tell you.

593
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,620
When you can't read him,

594
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,460
he's on a higher level than you are.

595
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,260
He's on a higher level?

596
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
He even called me ugly!

597
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,700
He said you're ugly?

598
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,460
Alright then.

599
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,900
I did curse him out too.

600
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,020
Anyway,

601
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,100
he is a man…

602
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,700
Good to be straightforward.

603
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,260
Much better than your loser dad.

604
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,820
Back then,

605
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,420
right after giving birth to Rushuang,

606
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,980
I was still in the startup phase.

607
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,020
Such tough times!

608
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,380
He failed to lend a hand

609
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,300
and was out there with shady women,

610
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,340
partying recklessly

611
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,420
and shirking his responsibilities.

612
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,020
This kind of man is unreliable.

613
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,220
But Mom,

614
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,300
who is my dad?

615
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,100
Don't I even deserve

616
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,700
to know his name?

617
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,740
He doesn't deserve it.

618
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,620
Let me tell you, Xue.

619
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,660
Qiao Zhi is truly talented.

620
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,260
You'll support each other
and grow together.

621
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,460
Mom,

622
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,220
I know Grandpa wronged their family.

623
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,340
We've compensated them with money.

624
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,620
We don't owe him anything.

625
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,460
Xue,

626
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,300
someday you'll know

627
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,220
why I say he is talented.

628
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:12,940
He...

629
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,180
Still awake?

630
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,300
Talk with him.

631
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,420
I'm heading off to rest now.

632
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,180
Goodnight!

633
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,340
Long day. Get some early sleep.

634
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,340
Daughter of the CEO of Huasheng Group?

635
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,660
I helped them before,

636
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,700
so they treat me quite well.

637
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,460
This time…

638
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,940
You break out in pimples.

639
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,060
Are you firing up lately?

640
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,940
You're firing up.

641
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,220
Let me make some soup
to cool down the heat.

642
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,700
Don't bother.

643
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,420
Why did she suddenly get angry?

644
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,560
[Ensure inclusiveness
and multiculturalism]

645
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,220
One million

646
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,900

no matter how I calculate it.

647
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,580
Spend the money where it counts.

648
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,660
To pay for my mom's medical treatment,

649
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,260
I have to sell alcohol.

650
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,660
I understand.

651
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,420
I went through the same thing

652
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,780
because of my father.

653
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,660
How much

654
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,900
are her medical expenses?

655
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,100
She's now in a vegetative state.

656
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,580
Just monthly care

657
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,820
costs over 10,000 yuan.

658
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,900
To transfer her to a better hospital now

659
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,820
will require at least 200,000 yuan.

660
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,820
People seldom visit the food street

661
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,060
where your canteen is located, right?

662
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,700
Yes.

663
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,980
That's why we bought the house
at a low price.

664
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,780
Later, we could make money by takeout.

665
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,300
In fact, that property

666
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,140
used to belong to our family.

667
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,180
Really?

668
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,380
You mean Canteen.

669
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,860
This is what I think.

670
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,620
I want to buy it back

671
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,860
and reopen it.

672
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,620
Would this work?

673
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,860
I'll give you 200,000 as a down payment,

674
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,140
enough to cover
your mom's medical expenses.

675
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,180
Although I badly need the money,

676
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,620
I have to remind you.

677
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,780
Food street has

678
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,300
high property prices

679
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,420
despite low foot traffic.

680
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,380
Previously I estimated
at least seven million.

681
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,860
Wanting to brush me off
with just 200,000 now?

682
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,940
Seven million?

683
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:34,940
Okay.

684
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,100
I can give you the money,

685
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,420
But

686
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,260
I'll need a year to pay it off in full.

687
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,220
The down payment remains 200,000.

688
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,300
I don't struggle to sell it.

689
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,380
So why should I sell it to you?

690
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,220
If you don't,

691
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,780
you wouldn't have worked at a bar.

692
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,900
Besides,
that place isn't suitable for living.

693
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,100
My parents aren't there.

694
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,620
I can only lease it out.

695
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,300
I can't sell it.

696
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,300
Alright then.

697
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,460
I'll rent it for now

698
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,300
with 200,000 yuan.

699
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,420

702
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:16,540
Yes.

All from famous brands.

704
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,780
Then

705
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,700
let's consider it included.

706
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,980
Okay.

707
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,940
We'll sign the contract tomorrow.

708
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,020

00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,540
is made with lean meat,

Let's not talk about it.

00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,060
I understand.

760
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,620
After all,

761
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,060
it led to people avoiding

762
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,180
this food street altogether.

763
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:36,980
Mrs. Liu,

764
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,580
I'm back this time

765
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,260
to reopen Canteen.

766
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,780
Would you help me?

767
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,660
You…

768
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,460
You want to reopen Canteen?

769
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,460
Just wonderful!

770
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,220
The food street has been declining
for far too long.

771
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,140
Only that barbecue seller,

772
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:52,980
the widow,

773
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,180
has decent business.

774
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,700
We're utterly failing here.

775
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,460
Widow?

776
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,980
Yes, her.

777
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,740
Don't get involved with her.

778
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,180
When it comes to business,

779
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,420
she shows no mercy to anyone.

780
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,860
Qiao,

781
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,540
we're counting on you from now on.

782
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:09,820
You,

783
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,020
just like your grandfather,

784
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,260
will lead us back to prosperous days.

785
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,460
Let's go

786
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,100
to meet the director.

787
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,620
He still remembers you.

788
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:17,860
Go.

789
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:21,740
Alright then.

790
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,140
By the way,

791
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,660
how'd the exam go today?

792
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,300
Got the report?

793
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,380
Decent score, actually.

794
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,940
No wonder good moods make a difference.

795
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,540
By the way, Qiao Zhi,

796
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,140
guess what I found?

797
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,780
What is it?

798
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,780
A photo of you and Ruxue
from when you were kids.

799
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,980
I remembered you two
had taken one together.

800
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,860
It took me ages to dig it up.

801
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,940
Really?

802
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,900
I don't even remember it.

803
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,300
When you were ten years old.

804
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,380
You really don't recall?

805
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,860
I'll send it to you via WeChat.

806
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,340
I've scanned the file.

807
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:51,900

Wagyu?

00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,780
At such a low price?

892
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,580
Wait.

893
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,740
These are all organic vegetables.

894
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,340
Why are the prices so low?

895
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,060
What's your secret?

896
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,980
That's why I went to Huasheng Group.

897
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,460
I went there also for business.

898
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,300
No way!

899
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,020
This is even 30% lower

900
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,260
than the quote they gave me!

901
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,300
At this price,

902
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,580
they're losing money.

903
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:20,580
No way.

904
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,660
At worst,

905
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,220
they make no profit on my order,

906
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,460
or skim less margin.

907
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,500
Why?

908
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,420
What's your relationship with Ellie?

909
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,020
Nothing special. You saw it.

910

She trusts me.

911
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,420
Plus, Huasheng Group

912
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,580
invests in my Canteen,

913
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,340
but as a minority shareholder
with only 5%.

914
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,020
They invested in your venture,

915
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,380
as a minority shareholder?

916
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,780
Huaixiang Group holds
a much larger stake.

917
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,900

919
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,380

921
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,340

00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260

No physical contact!

925
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,220
I negotiated with two companies today.

926
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,020
Their prices are higher than Baiwei's.

927
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,060
They supply 40%

928
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,820
of restaurants nationwide,

929
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,740
so their pricing is lower.

930
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,100

to work with them,

931
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,580
right?

932
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,900
