for about 40%
of the restaurants nationwide.

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,980
Of course their price is lower.

37

We received a report

381
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,140
that recently, your restaurant

382
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,700
purchased some smuggled beef.

383
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,500
The beef is not legit.

384
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm done.

385
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,780
You played well.

386
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,340
Man,

387
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,900
it's just badminton.

388
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,620
You don't have to be brutal.

389
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,620
I'm sorry.

390
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,380
Come on.

391
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,860
I guess being a lender is not that bad.

392
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,940
You are cooking for me now.

393
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,660
Your sister made it.

394
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,140
That's why it is horrible.

395
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,780
Is she a different person?

396
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,180
Let me tell you.

397
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,020
I'm not going to borrow your money
for nothing.

398
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,900
I will get that pervert for you.

399
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,260
You?

400
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,660
What's the problem?

401
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,500
I mean...

402
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,340
You see,

403
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,860
you lent me one hundred thousand,

404
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,140
and I will not only
pay it back to you with interest,

405
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,540
but also get that pervert for you.

406
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,260
Think about it.

407
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,900
Don't you think it's a great deal?

408
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,020
Look at your body.

409
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,340
You want to be my bodyguard?

410
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,660
If anything happens,

411
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,180
perhaps I will be the one saving you.

412
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,460
Frankly,

413
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,300
even if you're not lending me the money,

414
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,820
I will help you anyway.

415
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,580
What?

416
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,220
How can I just let someone else

417
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,180
harass you?

[Canteen]

419
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,300
Alright.

420
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,740
There's a lot to be done.

421
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,020
Let's do it.

422

423
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,060

Ms. Chen.

426

How dare you come back?

427
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,460
When are we going to get

428
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,340
the salary your father owed us?

429

If you don't give us some answers today,

430
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,620
we won't allow this restaurant to open.

431
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,340
That's right.

432
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,460
It was our life-saving money.

433
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,580
Pay us back!

434

Pay us back!

435
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,940
What's the noise outside?

436
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,660
I got a little present
for the neighbor across the street.

437
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,060
Across the street?

438
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,220
I thought you already took it down.

439
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,940
Is someone else taking it over?

The owner's name is Qiao Zhi.

441
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,060
It seems like he used to live
in this food street

Whoever he is,

443
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,940
if he wants to compete with me,

444
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,060
he is my enemy.

I suggest that you give up
on your dirty thought.

my father owes you the salary.

455
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,180
When I have the money,

456
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,740
I will definitely pay it back to you.

457
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,220
He is new here. He doesn't know you.

458
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,140
Please don't make it difficult for him.

you are a good girl,

461

but all of us

462
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,900
need to support our family.

463
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,300
We worked for your father
for half a year,

464
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,620
but we didn't get a penny.

465
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,140
How are we going to make a living?

466
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,900
It's been about half a year.

467

It's been a long time.

468
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,180
This is the new owner, right?

469
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,340
You must have

470
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,420
signed a contract.

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,540
Then you should have get
some money from him.

473
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,300
how about this?

474
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,500
Give us that money.

475

We will share it

476

and leave.

477
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,060
Otherwise,

00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,260
your restaurant

479
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,020
is not going to work.

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,460
That's the only option.

481
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,540
That's right.

482
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,020
I do have some money,

483
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,260
but it's to save my mother.

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,260
I understand.
I should pay for my father's debt,

485
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,180
but I really have no money now.

486
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,780
Could you please
give me a bit more time?

487
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,660
It's the same for us.

488
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,820
Both of us need the money.

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,260
Whenever we ask, the answer is no.

490
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,620
What should we do?

491
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,180
We all need money.

492
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:35,980
Everyone,

493
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,100
please listen to me.

494
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,660
I have two ideas,

495
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,940
and I want to share them with you.

496
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,220
First,

497
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,780
when the restaurant is open,

498
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,420
we will need staff.

499
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,900
If any of you

500
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,180
needs a job,

501
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,940
I'm willing to choose from you.

502
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:50,940
Second,

503
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,380
I've taken over this restaurant

504
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,500
from Ding Chan,

505
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,540
but she still works for this restaurant,

506
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,300
and she is a shareholder.

507
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:58,780
So,

508
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,940
I'm willing to vouch for her.

509
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,980
She will pay you back

510
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,380
in half a year.

511
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,220
Half a year?

512
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,860
Really?

513
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,980
You are trying to buy more time.

514
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,020
If half a year later,
you run away again.

515
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,020
Where are we going to get the money?

516
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,620
That's right.

517
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,820
Well, Ding Chan,

518
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,460
you are going to be in charge
of the recruitment.

519
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,540
Set the salary

520
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,340
based on the standards of the market.

521
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,300
In addition,

522
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,900
half of the profit
of the restaurant each month

523
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,820
will be shared

524
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,940
by the staff.

525
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,420
Mr. Qiao, what are you talking about?

526
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,460
I'm saying

527
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,860
that half of the profit
of the restaurant each month

528
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,620
will be used as bonus

529
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,900
for our staff.

530
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,940
I promise.

531
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,940
You have to take responsibility
for your word.

532
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,100
You can join us and find out yourself.

533
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,540
I also think

534
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,380
that it's never easy
to work in the catering industry.

535
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,340
You have to get up early
and work till late.

536
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,060
So, if you work for me,

537
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,860
you will get

538
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,460
three and a half days off each week.

539
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,660
Three days off?

540
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
Mr. Qiao,

541
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,780
you are going to ruin your business.

542
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,940
Are you running a restaurant
for the first time?

543
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,180
This is

544
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,300
not going to work.

545
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,780
Well, then you will

546
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,500
have to find another job.

547
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,100
He seems to be a good boss.

548
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,300
It sounds good.

549
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,740

tomorrow,

551
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,780
you can
sign the contract with Ding Chan.

552
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,060
Deal. We will do it!

553
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,860
You are a good man.

554
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,780
We will work for you.

555

Then tomorrow,
I will bring everyone here to sign.

Thank you, Mr. Qiao.

Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Qiao.

You don't have enough money

It's fine.

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,220
About the money,

564
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,420
I will figure it out.

[Guizong Food Street]

What are you thinking?

567
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,580
This is not the way to do business.

568
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,100
How do you know without trying it?

569
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,700
You are giving too many benefits
to the staff.

570
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,140
Plenty of benefits

571
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,660
and a good attitude

572
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,140
allow them to give our customers

573
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,500
excellent service and experience.

574
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,420
Good food is not enough
for a restaurant.

575
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,460
Service is essential as well.

576
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,220
Plus, they all once hit rock bottom.

577
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,140
They‘ll cherish the opportunity better.

578
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,660
Someone came for the debt?

579
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,460
Perhaps I can help?

580
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,780
You must be here to make fun of me.

581
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,900
How's that possible?

582
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,420
I'm here to help.

583
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,780
You need money, right?

584
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,340
As long as you can be my girlfriend,

585
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,580
I can give you
as much money as you want.

586
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,380
To pursue someone,

587
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,540
you have to respect her first.

588
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,060
Excuse me.

589
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
I don't know anything about respect.

590
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,340
If I can't get it,

591
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,020
I will ruin it.

592
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,100
I mean, are you

593
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,820
watching too many dramas
with a macho hero?

594
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,380
That's right.

595
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,340
Ding Chan likes me being a macho man.

596
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,420
Does your restaurant need some money?

597
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,060
Say some nice words

598
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,780
and I will help you.

599
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,020
Chong...

600
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,540
It's fine.

601
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,020
I...

602
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,140
Let's go.

603
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,700
Mr. Qiao.

604
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,700
Mr. Qiao.

605
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,540
Why did you stop me?

606
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,620
This amount of money
means nothing to him,

607
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
and he will
leave us alone in the future.

608
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,580
Didn't you say

609
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,300
that you would rather die
than taking his money?

610
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,700
But for you

611
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,580
and for Canteen,

612
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,180
I can do it.

613
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,780
No.

614
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,980
Listen to me, Ding Chan.

615
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,100
From now on,

616
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,980
don't put up with anything
for anyone else.

617
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,220
You are the employee of Canteen

618
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,180
and my business partner.

619
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,420
I won't let anyone bully you.

620
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,300
Hey, George.

621
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:37,820
Ellie.

622
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,620
Zhan Shikun asked me for dinner tonight.

623
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,580
Great.

624
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,140
Are you ready?

625
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,940
Of course.

626
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,300
It's so easy for me,

627
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,180
but

628
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,820
are you sure about it?

629
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,700
Of course.

630
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,620
Baiwei Group

631
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,500
is getting most of their profit
from pre-made food.

632
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,980
They are also the biggest threat

633
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,740
for Huasheng Group
to enter this country.

634
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,660
This is a tough game.

635
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,380
We are not going to win

636
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,700
without some scheme.

637
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,700
Got it.

638
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,900
I won't let you down.

639
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,020
It's our pleasure to visit

640
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,060
the base of Huasheng Group today.

641
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,820
It was really impressive.

642
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,060
Huasheng Group is

643
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,740
one of the world's top 500 enterprises.

644
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,820
You have

645
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,100
top-quality ingredients.

646
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,140
I'm amazed.

647
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
The base has just been established.

648
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,740
If we have a chance, we could invite you

649
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,220
to Singapore.

650
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,740
It will be our honor.

651
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,500
You are so young

652
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,060
and can deal

653
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
with this enterprise

654
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,820
so successfully.

655
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,660
You are so young

656
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,820
and can deal

657
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,140
with this enterprise

658
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,220
so successfully.

659
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,180
Thanks for the compliment.

660
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,340
70% of the restaurants

661
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,460
are owned by Baiwei Group.

662
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
We very much admire Mr. Zhan

663
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,820
and hope to have more opportunities
to collaborate in the future.

664
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,460
We also look forward to providing

665
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,460
top-quality ingredients
for Baiwei Group.

666
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,820
Is Huasheng Group only interested

667
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,340
in the production

668
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,940
of ingredients in this country?

669
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,220
I heard you are also involved

670
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,060
in the production
of pre-made food, aren't you?

671
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,820
Semi-finished products do not line up
with our high-end concept.

672
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,340
You know,

673
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,860
the local development
has been getting better.

674
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,180
And everyone's consuming capacity
is generally increasing.

675
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,060
Actually, I have inspected

676
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,700
the Japanese cuisine,

677
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,420
supermarkets, and shopping malls here.

678
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,020
I found the higher class
are willing to pay.

679
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,180
Semi-finished products are not selling.

680
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,700
So, I choose to only

681
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,500
manufacture the top-notch products.

682
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,420
But I've seen the production

683
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,620
in the guided tour today.

684
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,140
We visited the factory today.

685
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,220
Stupid! Who's letting you
make the decision?

686
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,180
Pardon, Ma'am.
It's my dereliction of duty.

687
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,300
Stop the production right now,

688
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,620
or you will be fired.

689
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,860
Be fired?

690
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,180
This is too much.

691
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,660
Is she mad?

692
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,620
Yes.

693
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,020
In fact, I told her about it before.

694
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,020
She probably forgot about it.

695
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,260
You made her lose face,

696
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,340
so she wants to shut it down
immediately.

697
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,420
It's a rushed decision.

698
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,940
She's reckless.

699
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,660
What are they saying?

700
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,660
They are complimenting
that you have a business mind

701
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,940
and a clear understanding
of the market so quickly.

702
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,180
So your business here

703
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,700
is mainly

704
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,460
a practice

705
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,860
for her, right?

706
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,500
A practice?

707
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,740
She is here for holiday.

708
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,420
I thought she would get bored and leave,

709
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,340
but do you know what she said?

710
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,500
She told me that the nightclubs here

711
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,820
are better than the rest.

712
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,620
Well,

713
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,300
you can take her with you.

714
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,300
Let us

715
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,380
have a toast.

716
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,500
Let's hope

717
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,820
that Ellie can run

718
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,020
her semi-product factory

719
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,340
successfully!

720
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:18,940
Cheers.

721
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,940
Cheers.

722
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,340
I know exactly what you said.

723
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,020
[Guizong Food Street]

724
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,220
Maybe you should
take some money from me.

725
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,460
No way.

726
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,180
It's the life-saving money
for your mother.

727
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,060
I will make some calls
and figure out something.

728
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,900
Two hundred and fifty thousand?

729
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,180
I think the architect would punch us

730
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,540
the second when we say that number.

731
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,100
Punch who?

732
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,180
I can do it for you.

733
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,380
Why are you here?

734
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
It's my day off.

735
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,580
I was passing by

736
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,500
and wanted to come in
and see if I can help with anything.

737
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,060
No.

738
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,980
Well,

739
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,140
do you have
all the utensils and furniture?

740
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,260
A friend of mine is specialized
in the catering industry.

741
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,100
I already have everything.

742
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,020
Then

743
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,340
how about the ingredients?

744
00:30:59,500 --> 00:30:59,860
Let me tell you.

745
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
The price from one of my neighbors...

746
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,500
It's not necessary.

747
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,700
Tell me what you want.

748
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,900
Nothing important.

749
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,820
It's about the tofu you made last time.

750
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,220
You were the one who made it,

751
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,420
so I feel like I owe you.

752
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,500
It's not right.

753
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:14,900
It's okay.

754
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,580
I don't work there anymore.

755
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,260
Still,

756
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,860
I'm working there,

757
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,620
and I'm not that kind of person,

758
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,460
you know?

759
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,580
How about this?

760
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,820
When your restaurant is open,

761
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,940
I will consider this my home.

762
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,820
Let me know whenever you need me.

763
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,780
I can help with anything.

764
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:32,860
Thank you.

765
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,140
No problem.

766
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,300
Mr. Qiao!

767
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,340
It's good to see you.

768
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,540
What do you think

769
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,860
about the design last time?

770
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,300
I've checked it out,

771
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,740
but

772
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,260
about the price,

773
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,220
could you make it lower?

774
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,980
I'm especially here to tell you

775
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,260
that the headquarters
has given an exception for your case.

776
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,780
You can get it for 400,000.

777
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,940
Well, mate,

778
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,900
there was

779
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,300
an emergency,

780
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,940
and I only have 250,000 in my account.

781
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,020
What do you think?

782
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,620
Of course,

783
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,420
we can get rid

784
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,820
of some details.

785
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,420
Mr. Qiao, you are making it difficult.

786
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,380
No architecture firm

787
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,540
will accept that price.

788
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,300
Well,

789
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,100
mate, I'm sorry

790
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,860
to interrupt.

791
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,420
Do you trust me?

792
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:13,900
If you do,

793
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,940
I can do it for you

794
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,700
with 10,000.

795
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,660
Really?

796
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,780
Of course.

797
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,140
With some low-quality materials, yes.

798
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,460
Mr. Qiao,

799
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,340
this is a restaurant.

800
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,340
If anything happens

801
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,260
to your customers,

802
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,260
it will be very serious.

803
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,820
Alright, man.

804
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,700
Listen to me.

805
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,540
When I was working
in the building industry,

806
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,340
you are not even born,

807
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,060
you know?

808
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,140
I'm saving you the hassle.

809
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,180
We can do it ourselves.

810
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,220
See you. Goodbye.

811
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:35,740
Bye.

812
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,500
Off you go.

813
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,740
I'm leaving anyway.

814
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:38,700
Wait,

815
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,820
are you serious?

816
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
I'm serious.

817
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,940
I got it,

818
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,140
and rest assured,
all safe and green materials.

819
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,940
A lot of my friends work in this line.

820
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,020
Plus, this is a renovation,

821
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,020
not a makeover,

822
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,660
right?

823
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,660
And it happens that I don't need to work
these two days.

824
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,140
My friends and I will do it for you.

825
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,540
It will be amazing if it's possible.

826
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,220
Don't be strangers!

827
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,780
This is Ding Chan. She works here, too.

828
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,180
Hello.

829
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,020
Hello.

830
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,740
Well,

831
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,900
tell me about it.

832
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,780
It's basically like this.

833
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,820
Look.

834
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,500
We can still follow this.

835
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,940
But in fact, her hair is bad.

836
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,540
It looks good though.

837
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,180
There are a lot of split ends.

838
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,780
Really?

839
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,180
I think it's okay.

840
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,540
Jessie, what's wrong?

841
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,140
Nothing.

842
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,260
I feel like someone
was secretly taking photos

843
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,420
of us.

844
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,620
It's so common

845
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,060
for what we do.

846
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,180
Perhaps I'm too sensitive.

847
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,220
I need some coffee to wake me up.

848
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,020
I still have more than ten outfits.

849
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,220
You are working so hard.

850
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,300
I'm done.

851
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,300
You have a date?

852
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,500
It's enough.

853
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,660
Stop being lovey-dovey.

854
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,700
Hey,

855
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,380
I'm off. Pick me up.

856
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,220
I remember you can walk, right?

857
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,660
We had a deal.

858
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,700
You are going to be my bodyguard.

859
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,180
I've sent you the location.

860
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,580
See you on the B2 parking lot.

861
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,860
I'm your bodyguard, not your driver.

862
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,460
I saw that pervert this afternoon.

863
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,660
He was taking photos of me,

864
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,900
and he had a huge bag with him.

865
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,380
I'm worried

866
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,700
that he has a weapon.

867
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,100
Are you being too sensitive?

868
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,700
I'm working on the renovation.
I'm busy.

869
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,580
Pay me back then.

870
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,860
Give the one hundred thousand
back to me.

871
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,540
What? Why do you bring this up again?

872
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,500
I've spent it.

873
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,180
Then

874
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,540
I'm going to take your life!

875
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,100
I got this.

876
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Where is he?

877
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,900
I know I can't trust any man.

878
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,420
Why there's no signal?

879
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,980
Stop!

880
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,780
Useless.

881
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,820
What is he doing?

882
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,860
Qiao Zhi!

883
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,660
Qiao Zhi,

884
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,420
how are you?

885
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,580
Don't die.

886
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,820
I'm not taking your life anymore.

887
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,940
I won't ask for
the one hundred thousand either.

888
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,660
Please, hang on.

889
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,940
I'm fine.

890
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,100
I don't see any gut. I won't die.

891
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,420
This is not the time to joke!

892
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,780
Call 120...

893
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,980
120!

894
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,660
Alright, alright.

895
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,840
[Outpatients]

896
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,960
[Operating Room]

897
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,060
How is he?

898
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,140
I don't know.

899
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,780
The doctor is not out yet.

900
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,940
But he lost a lot of blood.

901
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,980
Why were you with him?

902
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,140
I don't want to explain it.

903
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,260
You should go.

904
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,580
I can stay here.

905
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,380
No.

906
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,220
He got injured because of me.

907
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,700
When have you become friends with him?

908
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,900
Something happened,

909
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,140
and he was willing
to save me with his life.

910
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,900
If it were you, you wouldn't do that.

911
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,460
Did you call the police?

912
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,340
I did.

913
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,220
The police has collected the evidence

914
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,060
and started investigating
with all their efforts.

915
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,540
Is there any other leads?

916
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,500
Yes.

917
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,580
What?

918
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,380
There's a pervert
pretending to be my fan in my live.

919
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,380
He sent me a lot of money

920
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,460
and wanted to sleep with me.

921
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,220
I blocked him.

922
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,020
This is huge.

923
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,380
Why didn't you tell me or mom?

924
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,740
Because you always look down on my job,

925
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,700
and you never listen to my words!

926
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,180
Except Qiao Zhi,

927
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,860
no one in this family cares about me!

928
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,460
You ruined

929
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,540
my savior plan!

930
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,900
I asked you to scare her,
not to stab anyone!

931
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,340
You didn't tell me there would be a man.

932
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,340
He was tough.

933
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,940
If I didn't stab him,
I would get caught.

934
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,460
You should have shown up earlier.

935
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,620
I didn't expect anyone else either.

936
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,300
Anyway,

937
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,540
you should hide for a few days.

938
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,540
Bin,

939
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
will I be put in jail?

940
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,020
Don't worry.

941
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,700
His wound is not that bad.

942
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,060
Alright.

943
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,340
