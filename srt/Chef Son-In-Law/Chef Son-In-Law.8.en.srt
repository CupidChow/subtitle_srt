00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,180
I said I'm not hungry.

194
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,500
Why are you being so distant?

195
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,140
Qiao Zhi is a good man.

196
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,500
Don't regret it if he leaves.

197
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,940
Yet you asked him to have a fight.

198
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,540
Didn't you know
that he was not fully recovered?

199
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,780
Would you win it if I called you?

200
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,140
All you and Mom want

201
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
is to see me fail.

202
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,220
Other than Qiao Zhi,

203
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,020
no one in this family will help me.

204
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,100
Did you ask?

205
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,100
How do you know I'm going to lose?

206
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,060
Think about your attitude
whenever I talk to you.

207
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,700
You should think about your own problem.

208
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,900
The gossip
between you and Zhan Shikun lately

209
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,700
is everywhere.

210
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,060
Do you think Qiao Zhi is in the dark?

211
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,940
Why did he ask me, instead of you,

212
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,100
for the money to start his business?

213
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,540
Think about it.

214
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,300
If you don't want this,
just get a divorce.

215
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,100
It's better for both you and him.

216
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,940
It's my own business.

217
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,940
I just can't stand it.

218
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,340
Why did he ask me, instead of you,

219
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,820
for the money to start his business?

220
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,220
Think about it.

221

If you don't want this,
just get a divorce.

You are back.

How's the first day?

225
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,860
I sent it to your email.

226
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,620
I checked it,

227
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,140
but it's just alright.

228
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,340
That's why I want to talk to you.

229
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,660
Huaixiang Group

230
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,700
invested in Canteen
under a lot of pressure

231
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,020
from the shareholders.

232
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,620
Running a restaurant is like cooking.

233
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,260
A watched pot never boils.

234
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,140
You need to do some marketing.

235
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,260
The food street
has been forgotten for years.

236
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,100
No one knows, no matter how good it is.

237
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,380
What's wrong?

238
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,460
Are the shareholders
giving you pressure again?

239
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,660
You should have some pressure.

240
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,140
Don't get carried away

241
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,500
just because you are a boss now.

242
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,860
My money is for you
to run the restaurant,

243
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,420
not to mess around
with your female staff

244
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
and ruin the business.

245
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,220
Female staff?

246
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,700
Are you talking about Ding Chan?

247
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,180
She's my colleague.

248
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,300
I took over the restaurant

249
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,060
from her parents.

250
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,980
Their family was in a bit of trouble.

251
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,180
Is there any problem?

252
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,380
My point is
you need to focus on the business.

253
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,820
Why do I feel like

254
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,340
she is the point?

255
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,740
You got it wrong.

256

Hello?

We are living in the same house.

Why are you calling me?

259
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,500
I was in the restroom

260
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,060
and overheard your fight with my sister.

261
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,540
There must be some misunderstanding.

262
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,020
It was the most peaceful talk

263
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,500
between your sister and me.

264
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,900
You have some misunderstanding.

265
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,140
Didn't you notice
that my sister was jealous?

266

Jealous?

267
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,860
That's right.

268
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,380
Otherwise, why would she

269
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,220
ask about Ding Chan?

270
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,420
So what are you going to do?

Nothing. Let her be.

Yes.

Yes.

289

He was arrogant,

so I exposed him.

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,860
to have the video deleted?

380
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,780
You misunderstood.

381
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,180
Since the video has already been posted,

382
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,940
no one can wipe it out completely.

383
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,060
Then you want to...

384
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,900
I want him

385
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,340
to be your apprentice

386
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,780
and

387
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,500
work in this restaurant.

388
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,860
Shut up.

389
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,500
Be quiet.

390
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,980
This is actually a good idea.

391
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,780
Most people

392
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,420
are biased against the rich heirs.

393
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,620
Intervention is a better strategy.

394
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,940
To ease the situation,

395
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,100
we have to alter

396
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,340
his image in people's minds.

397
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,620
That's right.

398
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,340
Everyone wants to see

399
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,700
the miserable life of a rich heir

400
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,140
who hits rock bottom.

401
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,260
So, please help him, Mr. Qiao.

402
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,620
Mr. Zhou,

403
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,900
I'm so sorry.

404
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,540
The restaurant was just opened.

405
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,660
We ask for high-standard service.

406
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,220
I'm afraid that your son

407
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
is going to bring a negative influence

408
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,300
to the experience of the customers.

409
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,540
Seriously? How dare you...

410
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,780
Mr. Qiao,

411
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,740
don't worry.

412
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,860
I will make sure
that he follows the rules.

413
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,060
Well,

414
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,740
I will discuss with my partner,

415
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,220
okay?

416
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,620
Ding Chan,

417
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,260
follow me.

418
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,500
No, Dad. Please don't do that.

419
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,980
What do you

420
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,140
think about this?

421
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,820
What do I think?

422
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,060
You are the boss. It's your decision.

423
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,980
I can see

424
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,340
that you feel sorry for him.

425
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,020
That's not true.

426
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,620
Being cyberbullied is hard though,

427
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,780
and we were classmates.

428
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,860
He is annoying,

429
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,260
but he is not a bad person.

430
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,340
Maybe

431
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,980
we should help him.

432
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,780
Honestly,

433
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,020
if he were not so egocentric
and arrogant,

434
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,420
would you like him a bit?

435
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,180
That's nonsense.

436
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,780
I don't like him at all.

437
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,140
I like...

438
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,460
Never mind.

439
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,300
You men just don't

440
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,780
understand girls.

441
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:55,940
Alright.

442
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,580
I didn't want to say yes,

443
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,660
but you are my partner.

444
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,860
I respect your opinion.

445
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,540
Thank you, Qiao Zhi.

446
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,340
But

447
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,500
how do we make sure
he's not going to make trouble?

448
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,700
It's easy.

449
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,860
Let his father

450
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,500
freeze all his debit cards,

451
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,500
credit cards, and digital cards.

452
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,860
That's cruel.

453
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,420
That's the only way.

454
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,220
When he knows how to behave,

455
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,180
he will get them back.

456
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:26,860
Alright.

457
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,980
Let's do that.

458
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:28,900
Shall I

459
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,820
tell them now?

460
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,380
No.

461
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,140
I will do it.

462
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,140
I like

463
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,340
being the bad guy.

464
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,540
Dad, are you

465
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,460
seriously asking me
to work in this slum?

466
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,260
And that man.

467
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,700
Who is he? How can he be my master?

468
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,620
Son,

469
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,980
you have to pick yourself up
from where you fall.

470
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,620
But I...

471
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,220
Mr. Zhou.

472
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,940
We can do that.

473
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,020
I can be his master,

474
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,380
but

475
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,220
you have to freeze all his cards

476
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,420
until he becomes a better man.

477
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,260
Are you crazy?

478
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,820
Shut up.

479
00:16:59,460 --> 00:16:59,980
No problem.

480
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,540
Move out from your apartment, too.

481
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,300
I will give you some time to pack
and move back to your dorm.

482
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,180
It's easier for you to come to work.

483
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,900
Wait a second.

484
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,460
Dad,

485
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,740
I was wrong.

486
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,660
I...

487
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,700
I will work hard,

488
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,340
alright?

489
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,660
Don't freeze my cards...

490
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,620

497
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,940
learn from Mr. Qiao properly.

498
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,260
You are a grown-up now.

499
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,500
You will

500
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,260
need to be independent in this world.

501
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,460
Mr. Qiao,

502
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,940
thank you in advance.

503
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,580
Dad...

504
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,460
I admit

505
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,860
I went a bit too far yesterday,

506
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,140
but do you have to do this to me?

507
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,740
If you want to work here,

508
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,300
you have to earn the money yourself.

509
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,860
If you do well,

510
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,740
I can actually teach you something.

511
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,580
You want me to listen to you?

512
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,620
In your dreams!

513
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,540
It's okay,

514
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,060
but if you want your father
to unfreeze the cards,

515
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,860
you must get my approval.

516
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,060
You can do it.

517
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,260
By the way,

518
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,180
maybe one day when I'm in a good mood,

519
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,780
you will get your cards back.

520
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,220
I know you like Ding Chan.

521
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,820
Now you are my apprentice,

522
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,340
you can spend
all the time together, right?

523
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,780
You can't win

524
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,020
every lady over with money.

525
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,700
Do you understand?

526
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,420
That's despicable.

527
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,580
I'm trying to help!

528
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,260
People can easily forget the past

529
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
of a redeemed rogue.

530
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,900
And you are a handsome guy.

531
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,700
Probably a lot of girls
will fall in love with you.

532
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,700
Are you using me to get popular?

533
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,300
Your father brought this up, not me.

534
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,260
You started this,

535
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,860
so you have to solve it.

536
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:01,980
Alright.

537
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,820
Fine.

538
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,780
Come back!

539
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,220

540
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,900

541
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,820
Bow and call me master.

542
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,580
What are you talking about?

543
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,020
It's the 20th century now. Bow?

544
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,100
Are you out of your mind?

545

Do it for them.

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,860
Netizens?

548
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,060
You are doing it for yourself!

549
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,340
Ding Chan.

550
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,940
Master, this is the tea for you.

551
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,060
Thank you.

552
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,940
Stand up, please.

553
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:38,780
Look at the camera.

554
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,340

Xue, about the Canteen you invested in,

half of its turnover for the first day

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,100

00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,940
that was not a shill?

to have a restaurant
with this kind of performance

568
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,860
under its name!

569
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,780
Let me tell you.

570
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,420
If it goes on like this,

571
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,500
the restaurant will close

572
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,780
in less than three months.

573
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,860
The Canteen is the pilot project
in the North District.

574
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,220
It makes
this quarter's financial growth

575
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,060
possible.

576
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,020
After all,

577
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,260
the turnover of the South District

578
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,940
has been dropping for two quarters.

579
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,140
The North District
needs to figure something out.

580
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,900
Are you saying I'm messing things up?

581
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,180
Of course not, Uncle.

582
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,500
All I hope
is that you can do something about it.

583
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,460
You want to have a competition, right?

584
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,540
No problem.

585
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,620
Let's do it.

586
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,580
This quarter

587
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,820
has one month left.

588
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,060
I'm going to see

589
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,780
which one will win, your North District

590
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,180
or my South District.

591
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
We are family.

592
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,340
It's not necessary.

593
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,460
Everyone knows

594
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,780
that we don't get along well.

595
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,540
Let's settle it down.

596
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,940
If you lose,

597
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,780
withdraw the money
from the shabby Canteen.

598
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,780
It's a liability.

599
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,420
What if I win?

600
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,100
If you win,

601
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,580
you can get

602
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,220
what you want.

603
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,820
I will hand you
the South District's business.

604
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,780
Uncle,

605
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,940
you've been working

606
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,380
in the catering industry for 20 years.

607
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,020
I just graduated. I'm new to this.

608
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,380
How can I possibly compete with you?

609
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,340
Are you provoking me?

610
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm telling you.

611
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,500
I don't need to use

612
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,140
my personal connections to beat you.

613
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,540
Alright.

614
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,300
Let's have
a fair and transparent competition.

615
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,660
No extra help.

616
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,420
Sure. No problem.

617
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,060
Lower.

618
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,940
Stand up, please.

619
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,420
What a good young man.

620
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,460
Oh my god.

621
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,300
It's such good content.

622
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,540
You ruined it.

623
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,220
Check it out yourself.

624
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,380
You have very low views.

625
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,780
That's why I'm calling you.

626
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,780
You can beg me.

627
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:06,900
Well,

628
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,140
I'm begging you.

629
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,300
I mean,

630
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,140
can you say something nice?

631
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,340
What should I say?

632
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,100
I'm begging you, gorgeous.

633
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,500
This is terrible.

634
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,980
With your EQ,

635
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,340
how can you fight against Zhan Shikun?

636
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,820
He is so eloquent and sweet.

637
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,980
And you?

638
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,140
You are so mean and judgy.

639
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,820
You are our shareholder.

640
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,660
Oh, thank you.

641
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,580
I hope my sister will kick you out soon!

642
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,160
[Helen]

643
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,580
Follow the Canteen's account.

644
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,180
They posted a video
of taking in an apprentice.

645
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,020
Edit it and post it on my account.

646
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,460
How much is the advertising fee?

647
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,140
I need to report it to the company.

648
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,460
Nothing.

649
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,860
It's a follow-up
of the car-smashing rich heir.

650
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Use it properly,

651
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
and it should work.

652
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,140
I tried a few of these before,

653
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,660
but this one tastes very different.

654
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,660
Perhaps

655
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,060
you are in a different mood now.

656
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,860
How are you doing?

657
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,860
The Canteen is doing well, right?

658
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,980
It's okay.

659
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,660
I will

660
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,380
keep it up.

661
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,820
Qiao.

662
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,620
In the catering industry,

663
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,980
you need to cook well,

664
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,260
and you also

665
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,820
need to manage things well.

666
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,980
Don't worry, Mom.

667
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,300
My major in university

668
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,460
was business management.

669
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,460
Young man,

670
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,860
society is the best university.

671
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,260
Ms. Tao.

672
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,180
Song.

673
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,700
Alright.

674
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,820
Song and I

675
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,740
have something to discuss.

676
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,500
You can get back to work.

677
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:46,820
Sure.

678
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,140
I'm leaving.

679
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,060
What's wrong?

680
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,500
Take a seat.

681
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,420
Canteen is completely viral
on the Internet.

682
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,220
It gets over one million points
of attention,

683
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,980
and it remains
at the top of the trending list.

684
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,460
How did it happen?

685
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,980
On the opening day,

686
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,740
a rich heir smashed a car.

687
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,660
It got so many criticisms online.

688
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:09,900
Later,

689
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,300
he somehow managed

690
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
to make that kid kneel
and call him master.

691
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,500
Now,

692
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,260
he is a waiter in the restaurant.

693
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,980
Nowadays,

694
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,300
are these tricks

695
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,620
driving the trend?

696
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,660
Ms. Tao,

697
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,820
you can't

698
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,620
underestimate the power of the Internet.

699
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,540
These trending restaurants

700
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,500
are the biggest enemies

701
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,860
of traditional restaurants.

702
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,820
This is the performance
of a few local trending restaurants.

703
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,380
Their turnovers exceeded

704
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,980
a million within a short period of time.

705
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,780
How long exactly?

706
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,740
One month

707
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,100
or two.

708
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,100
It's difficult to predict
the performance

709
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,900
of these trending restaurants.

710
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,900
It comes quick,

711
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,300
but the only problem

712
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,380
is that

713
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,980
it won't last long.

714
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,180
When the trend is over,

715
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,340
the business will drop, too.

716
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,780
You are saying

717
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,820
that once the heat is over,

718
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,580
Canteen will be over?

719
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,940
That's what happens
to most of these restaurants.

720
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,260
No.

721
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,260
He's different.

722
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,180
With the food he makes,

723
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,420
as long as he can attract people,

724
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,300
he will make them stay.

725
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,380
I'm back.

726
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,860
Playing games?

727
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,460
Just spit it out, men.

728
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,700
I mean,

729
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,500
mate,

730
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,540
you are famous again!

731
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,740
So you've changed.

732
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,460
You apologized personally
at the Canteen,

733
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,100
and you became an apprentice
of the owner.

734
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,660
It's been on top
of the trending list for a while.

735
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,460
Nobody wants to kick a man
when he's down.

736
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:06,980
Am I right?

737
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,820
But mate,

738
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,260
I'm impressed.

739
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,820
If I were you,

740
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,980
I would never do it.

741
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,100
That's right.

742
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,420
I don't know about others,

743
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,300
but we got you.

744
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,740
You were a bit arrogant,

745
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,700
but you donated five thousand

746
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,540
when Zhang was sick, right?

747
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,660
I knew you would be a good friend
back then.

748
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,020
And the student counselor.

749
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,300
You did

750
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,620
hit him a bit too hard,

751
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,340
but he was not worth pitying.

752
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,540
He kept flirting with girls

753
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,620
using the advantage of his position.

754
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,980
I'd been sick of him for a long time,

755
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,100
but

756
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460

That's right, Ellie.

00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,260

Alright.

I will make sure they meet your needs.

768
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,580
It's a good idea
that you made it a trending restaurant.

769
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,220
My father knows about it too.

770
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,300
He's happy.

that I'm sorry.

and do the dishes.

we can only serve three dishes.

920
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,580
Alright.

921
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,820
We will have three.

922
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,460
Let's have

923
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,700
two meat dishes and one veggie.

924
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,580
Make it quick.

925
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,460
Sure. I will be back soon.

926
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,140
This is terrible,

927
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,580
especially after the long queue.

928
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,700
You will know after you try it.

929
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,580
Please enjoy.

930
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,100

Braised fish,

00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,220
beef with cabbage,

933
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,420
and vegetable soup?

934
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,300
It's really expensive

935
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,100
for these three dishes.

936
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,500
Try it first.

937
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:47,780
Here you go.

938
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,620
Is this braised fish?

939
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,260
How does he manage

940
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,300
to keep

941
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,780
the original flavor of the fish?

942
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,380
That's not possible

943
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,420
since there's seasoning.

944
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,540
It's normal to use organic vegetables
for its price,

945
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,060
but how can he keep

946
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,700

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,380
Mr. Qiao would hold

982
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,740
