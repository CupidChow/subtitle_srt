00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,620
That way.

377
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,500
Excuse me.

378
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,860
How's it going?

379
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,740
Did you see him?

380
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,940
[Song Hengde]

381
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,060
I saw him,

382
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,660
but he didn't want to talk to me at all.

383
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,020
It's okay. I will wait a bit longer.

384
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,920
[Chairman of the board]

385
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,480
[Li Hua]

386
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,820
Good morning, Sir.

387
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,020
Good morning, Mr. Li.

388
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,380
I'm Tao Ruxue from Huaixiang Group.

389
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,860
May I ask

390
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,100
why our cooperation is suspended?

391
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,660
There must be some misunderstandings.

392
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,740
Could you please give me a chance

393
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
to explain everything?

394
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,180
I don't work
with dishonest people or companies.

395
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,940
Please leave.

396
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,260
We didn't do anything deceitful.

397
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,860
Even if the cooperation is canceled,

398
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,260
we should be clear about what happened.

399
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,620
Mr. Li.

400
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:55,860
Mr. Li.

401
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:56,900
Mr. Li!

402
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,020
Please leave, Ms. Tao.

403
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,740
Xue.

404
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:06,980
Xue.

405
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,380
Why are you here?

406
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,700
Are you representing
Huaixiang Group or Baiwei Group?

407
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,780
Baiwei Group, of course.

408
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm only a shareholder of your company.

409
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,820
What's going on?

410
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,660
Something went wrong
with your cooperation?

411
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
You knew it, right?

412
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,580
What do you mean?

413
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,260
Know about what?

414
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,700
Mr. Li asked me
to come for cooperation today.

415
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,180
Is there any trouble?

416
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,700
Tell me.

417
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,100
I can fix it for you.

418
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,460
Could you please tell Mr. Li

419
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,900
to give me five minutes?

420
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,780
Xue,

421
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,660
Mr. Li is running a huge business.

422
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,740
His schedule
is completely full every day.

423
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,900
He doesn't even have a spare minute,

424
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,060
let alone five.

425
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,140
How about this?

426
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,140
I'm going to meet Mr. Li tonight

427
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:01,980
to eat and drink.

428
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,500
You can be our company.

429
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,780
We can have a talk

430
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,780
on the table.

431
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,500
What do you think?

432
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,380
Good?

433
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,980
I will let you know the address tonight.

434
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,420
That way, right?

435
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,860
For Six-Shrimp Noodles,

436
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,180
the key is the shrimp roe.

437
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,300
You have to stir-fry it with a low fire

438
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,700
and do it for one hour.

439
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,940
It's done when it's like sand.

440
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,380
For the fried shrimp head,
filter it carefully

441
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,260
so that you can get clear shrimp oil.

442
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,060
Making noodles
with shrimp powder and flour.

443
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,140
I've never seen

444
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,220
anything like this before.

445
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,940
Are some spring onions
going to add extra flavor?

446
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,940
You can put them on a small plate.

447
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,780
The customers

448
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,580
can choose for themselves.

449
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,460
This dish takes three hours.

450
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,020
It costs money and our time and energy.

451
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,740
It's true.

452
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,900
That's why many things

453
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,140
from our ancestors

454
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,460
are gradually dying out.

455
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,780
The pace of life nowadays is fast.

456
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,380
No one is willing to wait for that long

457
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,500
for merely a dish right now.

458
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,180
Get back to work.

459
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:11,940
Yes, Mr. Song.

460
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,260
What's wrong, Mr. Song?

461
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,620
It's probably something

462
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,420
that Xue didn't tell you.

463
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,780
What's wrong?

464
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,100
Huasheng Group

465
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,500
unilaterally terminated

466
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,580
the cooperation with Huaixiang.

467
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,020
Our guess

468
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
is that

469
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,380
it's because of her post
about your marriage.

470
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,260
Yesterday, I suggest Xue to tell you

471
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,060
and let you do the talk,

472
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,780
but I guess

473
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,180
she didn't want to trouble you.

474
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,180
So,

475
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,420
she is at Huasheng Group now?

476
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,460
Yes, for an entire day,

477
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,220
but she didn't see anyone.

478
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,060
Mr. Li immediately asked the Zhan family
for cooperation.

479
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
Now they are having dinner.

480
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,260
Xue is going there, too.

481
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,580
The Zhan family again.

482
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,740
I'm worried
that Xue will be at a disadvantage.

483
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,020
You are

484
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,300
the only one who can help.

485
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,060
Right. I will go now.

486
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,260
Send the address to me.

487
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,020
First,

488
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,060
I'm grateful for your trust
to our company.

489
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,500
I believe

490
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,140
that the cooperation
of two powerful families like us

491
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,460
allows us to dominate the Asian market.

492
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,700
Come on.

493
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,700
Cheers.

494
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,980
For the cooperation of the two families,

495
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,140
Xue

496
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,900
contributed most.

497
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,860
Xue,

498
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,900
this is

499
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,220
to you alone.

500
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,180
Mr. Zhan, you are exaggerating.

501
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,700
Mr. Li,

502
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
about the misunderstanding
between Huasheng Group and us,

503
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,660
I would like
to explain to you specifically.

504
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,220
This one

505
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,140
is to you.

506
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,180
Ms. Tao,

507
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,780
you should drink

508
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,260
with Mr. Zhan Junior first.

509
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,500
Thank you, Mr. Zhan.

510
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,700
Alright.

511
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,580
Let's dig in.

512
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,380
We can talk as we eat.

513
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,860
Mr. Li,

514
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,180
I didn't mean to hide

515
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,860
the marriage of Qiao Zhi and I.

516
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,380
My mother is very sick.

517
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,060
I couldn't go against her wish,

518
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,660
so I have to say yes
to the marriage agreement with Qiao Zhi.

519
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
I didn't mean to hide it

520
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
from you or Ellie on purpose.

521
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,300
I don't care

522
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,740
about your marriage

523
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,660
or your agreement.

524
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,980
When I decided to work with Qiao Zhi,

525
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
there was one condition.

526
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,620
As long as my daughter, Ellie,
was upset,

527
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,820
I would terminate all the cooperation.

528
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,580
The thing is

529
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,780
when you said that,

530
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,180
Qiao Zhi and I had been married.

531
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,380
I don't care.

532
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,220
All I care is if my daughter

533
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,980
is happy.

534
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,460
You can get a divorce

535
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,020
to apologize to Mr. Li's daughter.

536
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,660
That's not possible.

537
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:20,780
Mr. Li,

538
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,020
you can make any offer.

539
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,220
I will try my best.

540
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,780
But if you don't say anything

541
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,780
about the existing issue,

542
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,620
it will only get worse.

543
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,700
It won't be fixed.

544
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,220
Mr. Li,

545
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,860
I have an idea

546
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,900
for you.

547
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,700
After these three glasses,

548
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,300
Mr. Li might be in the mood

549
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,460
for a proper conversation.

550
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,020
Mr. Li,

551
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,500
I will drink them as amends

552
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,060
to show my sincerity.

553
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,380
You are just like your mother.

554
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,460
Tao Nanfang

555
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,700
will a good successor.

556
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,580
I'm different from my mom.

557
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
She is by herself,

558
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,300
but I'm not.

559
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,460
Mr. Li,

560
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,100
can we talk now?

561
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,060
Ruxue,

562
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,060
I'm here. When are you done?

563
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,260
[Ellie]
Tao Ruxue overdrank because of Zhan Jun.

564
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,780
She's in Room Changjiang.

565
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,940
You should go to pick her up.

566
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,420
Didn't you say that her daughter

567
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,300
is fond of you?

568
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,220
That's right.

569
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,660
She admires me.

570
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,500
I got her the job at the TV station.

571
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,260
Xue,

572
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,540
from the first time I saw you,

573
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,420
I fell in love with you.

574
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,220
If you could be with me,

575
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,740
I promise

576
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,620
to fully support your career

577
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,020
and give you a warm home.

578
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,820
Sorry

579
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,300
to disappoint you.

580
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,060
I'm married.

581
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,540
May I ask about your relationship
with Ms. Tao?

582
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,900
Are you two dating?

583
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,740
You held her hand

584
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,260
last time, right?

585
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,300
At first, I thought you were some creep

586
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,740
and almost kicked you!

587
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,700
Xue, actually I wanted to tell you…

588
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,780
Miss Tao!

589
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,140
What do you like

590
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,380
about Qiao Zhi?

591
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,220
Do you agree that knowledge
can change your fate?

592
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,660
Cognition,

593
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,860
ability,

594
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,060
and opportunity

595
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,740
are all indispensable.

596
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,820
One more thing.

597
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,620
What?

598
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,980
To resort to any means necessary.

599
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,180
You've helped me a lot over the years.

600
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,540
I'm very grateful to you.

601
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,460
But I'm in the real world now

602
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,100
and can handle some things.

603
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,900
Don't bother with my appointment
with Mr. Huang.

604
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,260
Because of our work,

605
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,180
I decided to keep it from the public
after we got married.

606
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,580
As his wife,

607
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,380
I trust Qiao Zhi as a person.

608
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,300
The rumors about Qiao Zhi online

609
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,060
are totally made up.

610
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,540
We will take legal action

611
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,580
against the rumormongers.

612
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,980
Win it for me.

613
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,980
Of course.

614
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,060
Shikun,

615
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,820
I'm still here.

616
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,020
Take her home before you start.

617
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,740
Who let you in?

618
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,700
What are you doing?

619
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,340
Sop!

620
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,260
Are you out of your mind?

621
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,940
She drank everything voluntarily!

622
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,540
Ruxue.

623
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,140
Come here.

624
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,140
Wait.

625
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,500
Are you leaving just like that
after hitting my son?

626
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,020
Zhan Jun,

627
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,220
I'm telling you.

628
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
About what happened today

629
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,220
and to my grandfather,

630
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,420
I will make you pay double.

631
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,540
Qiao Zhi,

632
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,660
show some respect.

633
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,420
Mind your attitude.

634
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,140
I'm telling you.

635
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,900
We took your grandfather down,

636
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,500
and we will take you down as well.

637
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Go for it.

638
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,500
Zhan Jun,

639
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,540
the title of King of Chefs,

640
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,580
won't be yours for long.

641
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,260
Dad,

642
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,460
just say the word.

643
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,700
Mr. Xu?

644
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,660
Why are you here?

645
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,940
Xue?

646
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,820
Xue?

647
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,260
How are you, Xue?

648
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,700
Who did it?

649
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,740
Who did it?

650
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,980
Who did it?

651
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,940
Mr. Xu.

652
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,660
How is she?

653
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,220
She drank too much,

654
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,580
but she's sleeping now. Don't worry.

655
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,540
You can't

656
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,180
just let this go.

657
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,620
Of course not.

658
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,740
But why are you also there, Mr. Xu?

659
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,460
Song Hengde called me,

660
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,940
and when I got there, I saw you.

661
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,820
Let's get inside.

662
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,820
No.

663
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,900
Fang won't let me in.

664
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,580
Forget about it.

665
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,940
Fang?

666
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,580
You and my mother-in-law are...

667
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,900
What's your relationship?

668
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,980
To be honest,

669
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,260
I am

670
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:31,860
your father-in-law.

671
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,020
Is it too much?

672
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,780
Get used to it.

673
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,220
You... You should come in.

674
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,660
No...

675
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,380
No.

676
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,460
It's okay.

677
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,180
He is truly afraid of my mother-in-law.

678
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,820
She's not home.

679
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,700
It's okay. Come in.

680
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,140
It's okay.

681
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,820
Come in.

682
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,300
Come.

683
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:56,820
It will be fine.

684
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,580
Fang

685
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,380
didn't keep any trace of me

686
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,540
at all.

687
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,580
Mr. Xu,

688
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,380
should I keep calling you Mr. Xu

689
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,700
or...

690
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,540
Mr. Xu is fine.

691
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,660
Alright.

692
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,140
Have some tea, Mr. Xu.

693
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,700
I've never thought

694
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,700
we would meet as family in this way.

695
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,060
How little I know.

696
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,580
Actually,

697
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,540
I noticed it long ago

698
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,980
that you had a special relationship
with Ruxue.

699
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,980
That's why
I've been keeping an eye for you.

700
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,380
Mr. Xu,

701
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,580
do you have anything to say

702
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,860
to your son-in-law?

703
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,220
I...

704
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,140
My words mean nothing.

705
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,860
But...

706
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,500
Why did you leave?

707
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,020
Mom is sick,
but you didn't come to see her.

708
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,380
I...

709
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,940
I was kind of dispensable

710
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,020
in this family anyway.

711
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,020
It's like

712
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,140
I was a slave

713
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,180
at your mother-in-law's beck and call.

714
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,580
She is sick,

715
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,460
and of course

716
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,660
I want to come back and see her,

717
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,460
but, you know,

718
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,660
she might feel better

719
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,260
without seeing me.

720
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,060
You are still taking up

721
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,060
your responsibility as a husband though.

722
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,620
For example, tonight,

723
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,140
you protected your daughter

724
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,420
in your own way.

725
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,500
That was an instinct.

726
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,500
Do you think

727
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,500
I'm a useless man?

728
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,140
I'm so afraid of my wife
that I travel everywhere.

729
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,140
Is it humiliating?

730
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,420
No. Not at all.

731
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,340
All I'm thinking is

732
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,020
it's not so good

733
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,820
that you are always away.

734
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,420
After all, we are family.

735
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,940
Family

736
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,140
should live together.

737
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:52,980
She...

738
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,340
Tao Nanfang

739
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,460
is a typical Iron Lady.

740
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,540
She is the one in charge.

741
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,900
If you go against her words in any ways,

742
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,060
she will be angry with you.

743
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,940
And she holds grudges.

744
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,020
She could mention things

745
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,820
that happened over a decade ago
again and again.

746
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,060
What things?

747
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,580
Well...

748
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,220
things

749
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,660
like food

750
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,860
and women.

751
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,100
I...

752
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,740
I'm obsessed

753
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,500
with food since I was born.

754
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,260
Fang has always been busy with work.

755
