189
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,560
Easy.

190
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,560
Alright, young man.

191
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,600
This is all yours.

192
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,040
It's so good.

193
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,480
Master, this is amazing.

194
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
Teach me, Master.

195
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,600
You want to learn it?

196
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,040
Here you go.

197
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,520
Have a drink with me.

198
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,280
Sure.

199
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,280
It tastes just like what Master made.

200
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,880
I miss him.

201
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,720
I miss him a lot.

202
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,760
I used to see you drinking

203
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
and having this.

204
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,880
Now,

205
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,240
I can drink with you.

206
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,720
Cheers.

207
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,000
What's wrong?

208
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,600
A bad day?

209
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,760
Your Shujue Restaurant

210
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,680
has opened a lot of branches, hasn't it?

211
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,560
Do you know the saying

212
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,920
that the great fish eat up the small?

213
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,920
Master failed back then.

214
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,640
How could I possibly succeed?

215
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,160
They set a trap

216
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,360
and framed me.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,280
I have bad reviews

218
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
and limited exposure.

219
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,640
Now, I have

220
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,320
nothing left.

221
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,320
Do you have any idea
about the debt I have?

222
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,600
It's 50 million.

223
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,600
There is no option for me.

224
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,240
How can I fight against him?

225
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
Since it's a losing battle,

226
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,800
you can just join the other side.

227
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
All they want is your restaurant, right?

228
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,840
Your life is more important
than your face.

229
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,120
Come on.

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,680
Qiao Zhi,

231
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,160
I've tried everything.

232
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,520
The power behind Zhan Jun

233
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,120
is much more terrifying than I expected.

234
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,400
I don't think we can

235
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,680
avenge Master in this lifetime.

236
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,080
[Huaixiang Group]

237
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
Why are the sales
of our new products so bad?

238
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,200
[Tao Rende,
Board Director of Huaixiang Group]

239
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,840
[Tao Nanfang,
President of Huaixiang Group]

240
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Answer me!

241
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,040
It's been three months.

242
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,640
Are you telling me
you can't create even one decent dish?

243
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,960
Who came up
with the idea of Mine Tenderloin?

244
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,200
We only sold 12 of that
in an entire month.

245
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,840
Do you know how many branches we have?

246
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,400
Ms. Tao,

247
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,360
we wanted to attract

248
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,600
more young people.

249
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,280
Do young people
play Minesweeper anymore?

250
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,760
Find another position for yourself.

251
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,280
This is not where you belong.

252
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Without innovation,

253
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,880
Huaixiang Group has no future.

254
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,240
Wait!

255
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,600
Get out!

256
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,240
Stop.

257
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,280
Listen to me!

258
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,880
Just go away!

259
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,480
Hear me out!

260
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm not a salesman.

261
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,280
You can't sell anything here.

262
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm not here to sell anything!

263
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,760
I know Tao Nanfang.

264
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,000
Ms. Tao

265
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,960
is my godmother!

266
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,320
Ms. Tao is your godmother?

267
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,960
That's right.

268
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
Stop talking nonsense.

269
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,760
Ms. Tao? Your godmother?

270
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,360
Is he talking about the Ms. Tao
who makes chili sauce?

271
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,160
It's not her!

272
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,120
I'm talking about your Ms. Tao!

273
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,680
Well...

274
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
You can just call her.

275
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,760
Call her.

276
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,200
I did,

277
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,080
but I don't know her new number.

278
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,520
Well,

279
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,640
Nanfang,

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
the reputation of our restaurants

281
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,840
is indeed dropping

282
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,520
on Tianxiang Food Rankings.

283
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,660
Even the delivery men

284
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,280
are not willing to take our orders.

285
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
You have an appointment
with Zhanjun this afternoon, right?

286
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,960
Talk to him

287
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,360
and try to work with him.

288
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,400
Profit is our priority.

289
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,840
I heard early this morning

290
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,800
that Dong Hao from Shujue Group

291
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,160
has reached out.

292
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,600
Dong Hao?

293
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,840
He wouldn't do that.

294
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,920
I'm telling you.

295
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll have to take measures
if you don't leave now!

296
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,540
Wait.

297
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,320
Wait, sir.

298
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,280
Trust me.

299
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,480
You call Ms. Tao

300
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,360
and tell her it's Qiao Zhi.
She will definitely come downstairs.

301
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Do you have Ms. Tao's number?

302
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
How could I have her number?

303
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:38,720
Leave!

304
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,720
Go!

305
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,240
Go away!

306
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,320
- Wait!
- Leave!

307
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Hello, Ms. Tao.

308
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,080
I told you. You have to trust me.

309
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,920
I really know Ms. Tao.

310
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,600
Go!

311
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,520
Listen to me.

312
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,640
Just one second.

313
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,440
Wait.

314
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,120
No.

315
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,840
Go!

316
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,600
Go away!

317
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,120
Go!

318
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,680
Ms. Tao!

319
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,520
Ms. Tao! Auntie Nanfang!

320
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,400
Auntie Nanfang!

321
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,720
It's me, Auntie Nanfang! It's Qiao Zhi!

322
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,880
Qiao Zhi?

323
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,280
Let go of him.

324
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,160
- Ms. Tao.
- Ms. Tao.

325
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,880
You look different.

326
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,600
You are a grown-up man now.

327
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,720
Auntie Nanfang,

328
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,920
you look exactly the same.

329
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,440
They are still scared of you.

330
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,040
Stop it.

331
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,840
When did you come back?

332
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,400
I thought you were in Singapore.

333
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,040
I was.

334
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,360
I just graduated,

335
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,560
and I feel like
it's better to be around home.

336
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,760
Of course.

337
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,760
By the way,

338
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,200
have you found a job?

339
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,240
Not yet.

340
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,920
Song,

341
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,080
this is my godson.

342
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,920
Check which department has a vacancy.

343
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,080
No.

344
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,720
It's okay.

345
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,160
I'm not here for a job.

346
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,920
Before I came here, I didn't even know

347
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,520
you are running such a big business.

348
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,040
It's not that big.

349
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,000
So you are here to...

350
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,840
It's alright.

351
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,160
Just tell me.

352
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,840
Then I will be straightforward.

353
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,920
I want to

354
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
run the Canteen again.

355
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,600
After all,

356
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,880
it's the last wish of my grandfather.

357
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,280
I understand.

358
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,960
It's your family's ancestral home.

359
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,240
But,

360
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,840
unfortunately,

361
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,960
I have a very important meeting
to attend now.

362
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,640
Take my business card

363
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,760
and come back again tomorrow.

364
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,120
Let's catch up.

365
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,360
It won't take long, Auntie Nanfang.

366
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,000
I can tell you in the car.
I will leave when you get there.

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,360
Wait.

368
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,680
I really can't take you with me today.

369
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,200
This is the car, right?

370
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Auntie Nanfang,

371
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
how are you?

372
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,040
I'm fine.

373
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,920
Why do I smell

374
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,800
some Chinese medicine from you?

375
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,240
And your complexion.

376
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,880
Did you just have an operation?

By the way,

why didn't you

after you went abroad?

Are you still mad at us?

383
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,440
You took care of Grandfather's funeral,

384
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,840
and you supported me
to finish high school.

385
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,920
To be honest,

386
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,180
I owe you a lot.

387
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,060
My father was dwelling on what happened,

388
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,340
and soon after you left the country,
he passed away.

389
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,900
He especially told me

390
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,100
not to tell you.

391
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,580
He was ashamed to see you.

392

Mr. Tao

393
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
was framed as well.

394
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,380
It was not his fault.

395
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
I heard

396
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,340
that Zhan Jun

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,660
was behind everything.

Wait.

399
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,580
You just said

400
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,500
that you wanted to
reopen the restaurant.

401
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,420
Are you trying to take revenge?

402
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,420
Not at all.

403
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,100
What can I do?

I'm just a young man.

How can I fight
against the entire catering industry?

All I want

407
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,980
is to fulfill
my grandfather's last wish

408
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,940
and run the Canteen again.

409
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,420
Back then,
he mortgaged the house for the fine.

I know

411
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,100
it was always
a regret for your grandfather.

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
The Tao family

413
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,780
owes you a lot.

414
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,780
I can get the Canteen back for you,

415
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,740
but as for running it,

416
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,180
you need to listen to me,

417
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,060

418
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,740
Auntie Nanfang,

419
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,140
I'm actually good at cooking.

420
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,740
Perhaps you can try
the food I make first.

421
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,660
It's not about cooking.

422
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,540
Even if you are
as good as your grandfather,

423
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,300
it's a different world now.

424
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,300
But I think

425
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,420
the meaning of cooking

426
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,220
has never changed
since the creation of human beings.

427
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,100
How about this?

428
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,020
I'm attending a cooking contest later.

429

you can go with me,

431
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,980
but you have to promise me

432
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,260
that no matter what happens,

433
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,940
you cannot act on impulse.

434
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,620
Don't worry.

435
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700

Zhan Jun was only a chess piece

your grandfather.

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,700
I failed the trust

749
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,540
of the company.

750
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,460
Ms. Tao,

751
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,180
Qiao Zhi

752
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,260
is the man that Huaixiang Group needs.

753
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,020
You saw it yourself.

754
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:32,980
Young people

755
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,420
really like his dishes.

756
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,180
Innovation

757
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,340
and young consumers

758
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,580
are what we need now.

759
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,940
I admit that I can't do it.

760
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,980
That's why I quit.

761
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,180
Thank you so much

762
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,140
for your help

763
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,260
over these years.

764
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,500
I'm very grateful.

765
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,460
Young man,

766
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,980
I hope

767
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,340
we can cook together again

768
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,740
in the future.

769
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,300
Anytime.

770
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,700
You are good.

771
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,700
It's been so many years,

772
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,740
and you immediately

773
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,860
surprised me.

774
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,820
Take a seat.

775
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,860
Did your grandfather

776
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,300
give you the Jingui Recipes?

777
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,740
What recipes?

778
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,500
I've never heard of it.

779
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,700
Don't hide it from me.

780
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,140
What you just made

781
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,140
is from Jingui Recipes, right?

782
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,940
Without the half of the recipes he has,

783
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,580
Zhan Jun would not
have had the achievement today.

784
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,020
I just

785
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,860
learned a bit from my grandfather.

786
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,460
I'm glad I didn't embarrass you.

787
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,900
You are good.

788
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,980
I mean it.

789
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,620
However, one of my chefs left
because of this.

790
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,140
You need to take some responsibility.

791
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,060
If you invest in the Canteen,

792
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,020
I will be working for you,

793
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,700
right?

794
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,340
I've changed my mind.

795
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,780
Really?

796
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,620
I told you. I can cook.

797
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,340
In fact, it's not a lot of money.

798
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,460
I need to spend over seven million

799
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,180
to get your family house back.

800
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,620
Wait.

801
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,980
You said you would give it to me.

802
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,860
Did I?

803
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,700
You did. You definitely did!

804
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,740
Also, I won the contest for you.

805
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,020
I earned you one hundred million.

806
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,700
Let's say
it's a commission of ten percent.

807
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,780
It's not too much.

808
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,260
There is no one hundred million.

809
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,220
I heard it.

810
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,340
You are going to sell the company,
and he is going to buy it.

811
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,820
If you win, he will give you
an extra one hundred million.

812
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,460
Am I right?

813
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,300
I'm not going to sell the company.

814
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,060
Why?

815
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,060
You were right earlier.

816
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,580
I did have a major operation.

817
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,660
It was cancer.

818
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,860
The chance of relapse is high.

819
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,260
I had no choice

820
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,380
but to sell the company.

821
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,660
Then you should be taking a rest now.

822
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,460
Why are you still working?

823
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,060
It's such a big company.

824
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,780
It's not an option for me to rest.

825
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,580
However,

826
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,340
since you are here now,

827
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,140
I have a new idea.

828
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,260
Me?

829
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,700
What do you mean?

830
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,260
I can invest ten million

831
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,740
in the Canteen for you,

832
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,460
but with two conditions.

833
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,820
First,

834
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,180
you have to work
for Huaixiang Group for a year.

835
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,180
Second,

836
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,660
I want you to marry my daughter

837
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,300
and help her
get a foothold in the company.

838
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,260
Wait a second.

839
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,060
Let's go through it one by one.

840
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,940
Work for you

841
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,180
for a year?

842
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,100
Is there a problem?

843
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,980
Our families have known each other
for a long time.

844
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,260
We've been working together
since the generation

845
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,940
of your great-great-grandfather.

846
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,780
The Tao family is in trouble now.

847
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,980
Are you going to sit aside?

848
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,940
Alright.

849
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,420
I can do that,

850
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,220
but

851
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,100
marrying your daughter?

852
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,460
It's way too much.

853
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,940
We've never seen each other!

854
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,180
Don't you know?

855
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,940
Your grandfather and my father

856
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,820
arranged the marriage for you
when you were kids.

857
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,580
I'm trying to complete their wish.

858
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,820
I heard about it,

859
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,780
but I was only five.

860
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,780
They must have been joking.

861
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,060
Qiao Zhi,

862
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,140
I don't have

863
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,140
much time left.

864
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,100
The only thing in the world

865
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,500
I'm worried about is my daughter.

866
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,540
Of course,

867
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,540
I'm also worried about you.

868
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,420
If you can be together
and support each other,

869
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,260
even if I'm gone,

870
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,220
my mind will be at ease.

871
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,340
You are fine.
Stop saying things like that.

872
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,260
You will be fine.

873
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,820
You will live a long life.

874
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,540
What I mean

875
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,900
is that we don't know each other.

876
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,420
Even if I agree, she might say no.

877
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,220
Great.

878
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,740
I know you will agree.

879
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,420
Wait, that's not what I'm saying.

880
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,420
The elders

881
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,580
would rest in peace

882
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,900
in heaven.

883
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,780
Wait a second, Auntie Nanfang.
I'm saying

884
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
that your daughter might not like me.

885
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,740
No way.

886
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,180
She has seen you.

887
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,540
It's true

888
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,380
that it has been many years,

889
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,660
and you've both changed a bit.

890
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:07,860
Well,

891
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,980
I can set up a meeting for you two.

892
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,820
When you are familiar with each other,

893
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,820
it won't be a problem at all.

894
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,420
Why would anyone
have a blind date at a nightclub?

895
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,060
Is she an alcoholic?

896
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,820
Hi,

897
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,700
may I ask where triple eight is?

898
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,100
You must be Miss Tao's friend.

899
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,220
Follow me. This way.

900
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,020
Sir,

901
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,980
that's triple eight.

902
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,980
That is triple eight?

903
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,740
That's right.

904
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,420
Miss Tao has been
waiting for you for a while.

905
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,180
It's been over ten years, but how
could she have gained so much weight?

906
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
That's why I'm against delivery food.

907
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,300
Let's go.

908
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:46,980
Wait.

909
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,700
Don't drag me, man.

910
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,300
Wait...

911
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,580
Miss Tao.

912
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,620
Miss Tao.

913
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,260
Hi.

914
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,380
Are you Qiao Zhi?

915
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,300
Let's play some games first.

916
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,300
Let's focus on the business.

917
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,220
Here is the thing.

918
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,220
Our families go way back.

919
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,860
Your mother is my godmother.

920
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,580
She must've been too excited
when she saw me,

921
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,060
and that's why she came up
with this crazy idea.

922
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,300
Miss Tao,

923
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,620
you just graduated, right?

924
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,220
You are young.

925
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,780
You still have a lot of time.

926
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,180
You don't need to get married
so early.

927
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,220
We can talk to your mother together

928
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,380
and talk her out of it.

929
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,220
What do you think?

930
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,300
I think my mom
makes good judgments of people.

931
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,740
You are not bad.

932
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,380
Wait.

933
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,020
We don't have to enter

934
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,540
the grave of love at this age.

935
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
Look at him.

936
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:07,980
And him.

937
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,260
And him.

938
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,460
Aren't they a better choice?

939
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,940
I can still have fun after marriage.

940
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,260
Why are you kissing me all of a sudden?

941
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,820
You look down upon me?

942
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,980
That's not true.

943
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,500
I don't mean that.

944
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,940
I mean, we just know each other.

945
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,260
It's not appropriate
to kiss right away.

946
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,660
I know you want my mom's investment.

947
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,660
So, do you want to get the money or not?

948
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,460
In regard to the money,

949
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,420
I will figure it out.

950
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,500
Thank you.

951
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,020
See you.

952
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,220
Sir.

953
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,420
Sir.

954
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,140
Miss Tao wants to see you.

955
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,020
It's okay.

956
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,500
Listen to me.

957
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,060
It's the real Miss Tao.

958
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,180
It's over!

959
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,820
She is showing me her power, isn't she?
