[Episode 23]

34
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,020
Yan is coming too.

35
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,980
Why is she joining you?

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,260
She's got a lot to do in the restaurant.

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,180
She's here to celebrate, of course.

38
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,660
Here's the thing.

39
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,420
Maybe

40
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,020
tonight is the night.

41
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,940
Does that make me the third wheel?

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,020
Mr. Qiao, are you

43
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,380
overestimating yourself?

44
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,500
Let me tell you.

45
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,140
Once you get here,

46
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,220
let's take a bath.

47
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,580

48
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,900

00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,420
You really like bathing.

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,100
Alright.

53
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,660

Good evening. Welcome to Tianzhidao Spa.

57
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,260
Welcome, Mr. Qiao.

58
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm exhausted right now.

59
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,660
Why don't you two have fun?

60
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,500

I know you're tired,

62
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,820
so I chose this place

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,540
to help you unwind a bit.

64
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,820

66
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,540
the best sleep tonight.

67
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,140
I should pass.

68
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,700
I'm serious.

69
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,780
I just came by to remind you.

70
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,100
Be careful not to get trapped.

71
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,180

72

who could trap me?

Don't worry.

75
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,780
We're just getting massages.

76
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,780
What are you imagining?

77
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,460
Really?

78
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,300
What's so funny?

79
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:03,900
Fine.

80
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,140
As long as it's just massages.

81
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,820
I'll wait here for you.

82
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,980
You're being a real buzzkill now.

83
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,700
You know that?

84
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,140
We're already here.

85
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,140

If you don't want to bathe,

87
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,100
I'll arrange to give you a massage.

88
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,380
You're just...

89
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,660
Fine.

90
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,300
Got it.

91
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,740
I'll take care of everything.

92

93
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,780

95
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,780
Absolutely the top-tier room,

96
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,380
and the most professional massage!

97
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,820
Say something.

98
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,020

102
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,580
This way, sir.

103
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,700
Just a shoulder and arm rub for me.

104
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,660
Okay.

105
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,060
Please lie on your back

106
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,260
and give me your arm.

107
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,460
Okay.

108
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,660
Your hand is very stiff.

109
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,540
Have you been under a lot
of work stress lately?

110
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,780
I've been feeling quite tired.

111
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,140
I'll light some aromatherapy

112
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,900
to help you relax.

113
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,700
Alright.

114
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,140
Is there a TV or something like that?

115
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,260
No.

116
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700

117
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,540

118
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,740
Get up!

119
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,380
Get up!

120
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,380
I...

121
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,980
Why is my head so dizzy?

122
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,380

123
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,180
you're back.

124
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:49,700
I...

125
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,420
What's going on?

126
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,900
What's happening?

127
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,420
Guo Yan,

128
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,540
why are you here?

Qiao,

130
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,260
since Bao Tong is here today,

131
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,300
let's get things straight.

132
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,820
Guo Yan,

133
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,820
you're a hypocrite.

134
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,300
Was it Zhan Shikun?

135
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,540
How much did he pay you

136
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,340
to set me up?

137
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,940
Qiao Zhi,

138
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,340
what did you just tell me?

139
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,940
He's right here.

140
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,140
Tell him now!

141
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,020
Bao,

142
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,260
listen to me.

143
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,140
I was framed.

144
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,620
Go away!

145
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,300
Bao!

146
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,780
Bao!

147
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,180
Fine.

148
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,700
He's gone.

149
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,580
You succeeded.

150
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,620
Now you can talk.

151
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,860
I want to know one thing.

152
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:58,900
How much did they pay you

153
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,980
to betray me and Bao?

154
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,500
How much?

155
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,380
How much do you think I'm worth?

156
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,700
I don't know.

157
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,380
But I know

158
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,140
you have my restaurant shares.

159
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,380
Haven't you made enough money off it?

160
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,380
Do you really not know what state

161
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,700
you've put my restaurant in?

162
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,900
Pity me,

163
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,380
so throw me some drinks and desserts?

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,740
Do you know the lowest price

165
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,300
of an apartment in Xunyang?

166
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,820
Two million.

167
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,780
I make at most 20,000 a month.

168
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,660
Right.

169
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,900
That does sound like a lot.

170
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,340
But my monthly expenses

171
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,500
run at least this much.

172
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,700
Did you know that?

173
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,660
How am I supposed to live my life?

174
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,580
Save up and return to the countryside?

175
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,500
My marriage failed once.

176
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:45,900
My life

177
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,740
can't afford another failure.

178
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:49,780
Well.

179
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,380
From some perspectives,

180
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,820
I can understand you.

181
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,420
But from another perspective,

182
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,420
do you realize

183
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,500
you betrayed Bao's trust in you?

184
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,540
Is his trust worth five million?

185
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,740
To you, it's not.

186
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,620
You're talented

187
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,780
and married into a wealthy family.

188
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,380
You could never understand

189
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,340
how we outsiders struggle

190
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,900
to climb up from the bottom,

191
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,580
or what it takes for us to be decent.

192
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,980
Let me tell you something.

193
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,660
I was poor.

Please calm down.

are enormous.

She wants nothing at all.

and hoped you could respect that.

Did Qiao Zhi privately talk to you?

397
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,020
No.

I've been with you for two decades.

494
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,100
Throughout these two decades,

495
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,420
I've remained diligent.

496
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,700

of your hard work.

497
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,100
Back then,

499
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,300
But ever since Qiao Zhi came along,

500
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,420
you started showing him favoritism.

502
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,060
I don't favor him.

503
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,980
But seeing him

504
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,420
reminds me of Qiao Sihai.

Tell me,

506
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,780
I've struggled

507
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,740
most of my life,

508
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,420
but how much wealth is ever enough?

509
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,140
Indeed,

510
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,300
I deeply admire Qiao Sihai.

511
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,540
He devoted

512
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,620
his entire life to cooking

513
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,140
without seeking fame or fortune.

514
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,060
While Qiao Zhi's skills are undeniable,

515
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,940
he's nothing like Qiao Sihai.

516
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,740
He reaps both reputation and wealth.

517
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,180
So he's more remarkable than Qiao Sihai.

518
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,220
Jun,

519
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,460

Meeting Qiao Zhi

523
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,260
made me reflect.

524
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,060
As president
of the Culinary Association,

525
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,980
what have I done
for Chinese cuisine?

526
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,580
Over the years, we've been

527
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,580
engaging in pre-made dishes,

528
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,340
Western cuisine,

529
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,180
and fast food.

530
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,300
When people think of banquets,

531
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,540
they go for Western food.

532
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,660
Western cuisine
is just about the ingredients, right?

533
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,860
The state banquet represents
the highest form of culinary art!

534
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,900
Qiao Zhi

535
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,380
has reignited my hope.

536
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,380
He sparked

537
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,980
a wave of Chinese culinary culture

538
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,500
among the younger generation.

539
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,140
That's why I support him.

540
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,220
This is precisely what I,

541
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,180
as president
of the Culinary Association,

542
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,700
ought to do.

543
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,460
Our Group can do

544
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,420
what Qiao Zhi can achieve.

545
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,940
Canteen

546
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,300
is just a small eatery.

547
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,060
How much influence could it have?

548
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,540
Once Baiwei Group becomes

549
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,980
the leader in the catering industry,

550
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,100
I guarantee

551
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,900
we'll revitalize Chinese cuisine!

552
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,540
And then what?

553
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,620
Can your son handle it?

554
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,020
Shikun may not know how to cook,

555
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,020
but he has a sharp mind

556
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,860
for business.

557
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,260
As for chefs,

558
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,980
we can always train them.

559
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,940
Then why are you afraid of Qiao Zhi,

560
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,700
not daring to confront him head-on?

561
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,100
You think I don't know

562
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,940
what your son's done.

563
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,100
Setting up honey traps

564
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,740
is the so-called sharp mind
for business?

565
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,220
I've spoken to him about this.

566
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,180
He holds

567
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,940
personal grudges against Qiao Zhi.

568
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,700
But Qiao Zhi is young.

569
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,060
He'll have plenty of opportunities.

570
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,620
It doesn't matter if he
can't prove himself this time.

571
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,540
I promise,

572
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,820
from now on,

573
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,420
I'll not target the Tao family
and Qiao Zhi again.

574
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,340
One should seize their opportunities!

575
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,540
Why should Qiao Zhi's

576
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,380
be controlled by you and Shikun?

577
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,420
Master,

578
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,220
for my two decades

579
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,340
of loyal service to you,

580
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,580
for the bond we share,

581
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,620
could you

582
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,140
grant me this favor?

583
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,620
Tao Nanfang has admitted it.

584
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,740
Huaixiang Group has withdrawn
from the competition.

585
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,420
Just pretend you have no idea,

586
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,380
okay?

587
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,060
Please, I beg you.

588
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,700
I'll remind you of one point.

589
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,740
Ask Shikun to quit gambling.

590
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
This is illegal.

591
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,300
No.

592
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:13,980
It can't be.

593
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:14,740
He...

594
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,940
He doesn't need money.

595
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,180
Why would he get involved in that?

596
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
As I can find out,

597
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,020
that means others can.

598
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,660
Tell him to stop.

599
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,500
He's playing with fire this time.

600
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,580
I see.

601
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,660
Okay.

602
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,020
I'll talk to him right now.

603
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,700
Remember,

604
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,580
I'm doing this for you.

605
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,460
Of course.

606
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,340
Thank you, Master.

607
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,120
[Zhan]

608
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:51,820
Dad,

609
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,940
how's Mr. Biao?

610
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,300
He agreed

611
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,260
not to intervene this time.

612
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,100
Good.

613
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,780
I guess he has some regard
for our relationship.

614
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,980
Tell me the truth.

615
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,300
Have you been involved in gambling?

616
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,180
No way.

617
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,380
Who told you that?

618
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,740
Still want to hide it from me?

619
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,380
As Mr. Biao can find out,

620
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,940
others can too.

621
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,780
They're all overseas accounts,

622
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,580
perfectly safe.

623
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,300
They won't trace them.

624
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,260
Pull out of it.

625
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,140
Right now.

626
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,900
Immediately.

627
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,060
Are you kidding me?

628
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,140
You know how much I lost

629
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,140
in the final?

630
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,180
Did I not give you enough,

631
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,900
so you need to earn it through gambling?

632
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,660
Dad,

633
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,700
I've never liked the food industry.

634
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,220
Just look at your company.

635
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,060
You work yourself to the bone

636
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,020
just to make a few measly bucks.

637
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,060
Times have changed now.

638
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,020
Just sit back

639
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,820
and watch how I put on this great show.

640
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,180
Zhan Shikun!

641
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,420
I'm warning you,

642
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,140
this is illegal!

643
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,460
Don't worry.

644
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,420
I'll handle it cleanly.

645
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,740
No evidence will be found.

646
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,460
That won't do.

647
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,500
Get out of it.

648
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,940
As the King of Chefs,

649
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,180
you should focus

650
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,220
on the competition.

651
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,020
You...

652
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,740
Compete properly.

653
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,260
Don't disappoint me.

654
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,080
[Dong Hao]

655
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,060
I told you an hourly report.

656
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,500
Update me every hour.

657
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,380
What are you doing?

658
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,940
I was just about to call you.

659
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,500
Where is he?

660
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,100
The nightclub.

661
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,020
The usual one you go to.

662
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,860
Okay.

663
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,980
Book my VIP booth.

664
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,260
I didn't expect him to be so happy.

665
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,300
I'm on my way.

666
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,140
Okay.

667
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,460
Why sit here?

668
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,260
What about my VIP booth?

669
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,380
Qiao Zhi.

670
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,900
It's Qiao Zhi's now.

671
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,340
Manager,

672
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,140
my usual order, please.

673
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:17,860
Alright.

674
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,500
No need.

675
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,780
Just have a few beers.

676
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,100
Don't want to steal

677
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,700
Mr. Qiao's spotlight.

678
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,540
Got it!

679
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,260
He's really living it up!

680
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,140
Do you think

681
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,540
he's giving up on himself?

682
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,340
That can't be right.

683
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,300
I remember

684
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,700
you telling me

685
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,220
he was a total cheapskate.

686
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,820
So why is he being so generous today?

687
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,940
He sure is a cheapskate.

688
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,940
When he and Ruxue

689
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,860
ate at my restaurant,

690
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,420
he made her pay for everything

691
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,660
and swiped a bunch of discount coupons
before leaving.

692
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,580
Come on!

693
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,220
Come on!

694
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,380
A good show!

695
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,140
Look!

696
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,420
Get out of the way!

697
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,020
Move it!

698
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:09,900
Qiao Zhi,

699
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,420
since you married into my family,

700
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,020
I've provided you
and opened a restaurant for you.

701
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,100
Do you still have a conscience?

702
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,260
How can you do this?

703
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,500
Qiao Zhi.

704
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,100
This freeloader is quite tough.

705
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,220
She actually hit him!

706
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,580
Are you crazy?

707
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,380
Qiao Zhi dared to fight back.

708
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,540
After this, they're getting a divorce.

709
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,740
You have to admit,

710
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,780
he is kind of interesting.

711
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
If I had met him sooner,

712
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,380
maybe

713
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,340
we could have been friends

714
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,100
and left no room for you.

715
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,220
Wanna drink?

716
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,540
Let's see what you'll drink!

717
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,580
Drink!

718
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,260
You are a lunatic!

719
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:53,980
Tao Ruxue!

720
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,780
Come on.

721
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
Let's dance.

722
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,900
This spendthrift.

723
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,220
That's money.

724
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,340
She spoiled it like this.

725
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,220
Boss,

726
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,700
I think Qiao Zhi's finished this time.

727
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,460
That's not important.

728
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,300
Make him

729
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,060
the star of the show tonight.

730
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,580
Bet all the money

731
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,340
on Zhan Jun becoming the king.

732
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,060
Come on!

733
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,380
The whole bill is on me.

734
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,620
Put it under Qiao Zhi's name.

735
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,660
I'm covering it.

736
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,340
[PK]
The Huaixiang Group
has suddenly announced

737
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,940
its withdrawal from the challenge.

738
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,580
Qiao Zhi will be replaced

739
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,820
by Liu Shuo from the Baiwei Group.

740
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,460
Many viewers at the venue

741
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,420
expressed dissatisfaction and protested

742
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,860
against the organizers' arrangements.

743
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,980
Qiao Zhi!

744
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,660
Everyone, please calm down!

745
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,180
Qiao Zhi!

746
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,620
Quiet!

747
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,420
Be quiet!

748
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,220
Explain what is going on.

749
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,860
We received the notice
from the committee

750
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,780
in the early hours of the morning.

751
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,220
We're not clear

752
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,420
on the details either!

753
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,020
The committee
has been targeting Qiao Zhi

754
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,820
from the very beginning.

755
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,940
Now that he's won the championship,

756
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,340
why are you trying to disqualify him?

757
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,300
I think this is a fix.

758
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,820
A complete setup!

759
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,820
Silence!

760
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,260
Committee, a fix!

761
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,220
Committee, a fix!

762
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,660
Committee, a fix!

763
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,260
Committee, a fix!

764
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,180
Committee, a fix!

765
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,700
Director,

766
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,540
are we in the wrong place?

767
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,300
No, this...

768
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,100
This can't be wrong.

769
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,260
I checked

770
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,580
last night.

771
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,700
It clearly said 'Qiao Zhi' up there.

772
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,780
Why is it this person now?

773
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
There must be a fix!

774
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,500
Let's go!

775
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,140
Protest!

776
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,540
Let's go!

777
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,660
Protest!

778
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,060
Committee, a fix!

779
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,900
Stop shouting!

780
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,820
A fix!

781
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,060
Send out your person in charge!

782
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,660
Whoever dares to bully Qiao Zhi

783
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,620
is bullying our entire food street!

784
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,300
That's right!

785
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,060
Bullying our food street!

786
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,180
We, 87 businesses

787
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,300
and 235 local folks,
will never compromise!

788
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,020
No compromise!

789
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,860
Quiet!

790
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,820
No compromise!

791
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,460
No compromise!

792
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,940
Ms. Mei Ling,

793
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,420
the checkpoint
is about to be overwhelmed!

794
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,620
They're here supporting Qiao Zhi.

795
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,100
What's worse, they have tickets!

796
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,260
Once they flood into the venue,

797
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,100
how are we supposed
to control the crowd?

798
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,180
I'm at my wits' end too.

799
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,900
Just proceed as scheduled.

800
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,140
Go.

801
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,700
How to proceed?

802
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,140
It's becoming a laughingstock.

803
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,500
So, what do you want to do?

804
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,100
Forcibly remove Qiao Zhi's fans

805
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,580
who bought a ticket?

806
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,180
This event is under your management.

807
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,500
If you fail to take action,

808
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,260
someone else will run it next year.

809
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,380
Here's what we'll do.

810
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,860
The cameras will avoid the audience

811
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,740
and focus only on the stage.

812
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,100
We'll only pick up audio from the stage.

813
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,100
Are you satisfied now?

814
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,140
Do whatever you think is best.

815
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:45,980
Committee, a fix!

816
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,780
Please be quiet!

817
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,100
Please remain rational.

818
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,260
Dear audience,

819
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,940
I can understand your frustration.

820
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,380
However, this incident is caused

821
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,460
by Huaixiang Group's withdrawal
from the event.

822
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,580
Please keep a composed manner.

823
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,860
And to create

824
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,340
a good atmosphere for the competition,

825
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,100
we ask for your full cooperation.

826
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:12,180
Qiao Zhi!

827
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,140
Don't let them get to you!

828
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,780
Stay at the top of your game!

829
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,140
Welcome Liu Shuo,

830
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,460
challenger from Baiwei Group.

831
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:28,900
Get off the stage, Liu Shuo!

832
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,860
Next, welcome Mr. Zhan Jun,

833
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,660
the two-time reigning King of Chefs!

834
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,340
Welcome!

835
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,700
He is the most acclaimed genius chef

836
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,580
in the culinary world today

837
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,580
and a true innovator.

838
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,500
He is also an inheritor
of Sichuan cuisine culture.

839
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,420
Mr. Zhan Jun.

840
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,020
Both contestants are in position.

841
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,420
Distinguished members
of the committee, judges, and audience,

842
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,100
I am Tao Nanfang,

843
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,340
Chairman of the Huaixiang Group.

844
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,180
Sadly,

845
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,740
- this year's competition
was rigged.
- Ms. Tao.

846
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,380
Ms. Tao!

847
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,380
- The competitor...
- What's going on?

848
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,220
Cut the feed.

849
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,980
Uses extremely despicable means.

850
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,980
System hacked. Restarting it is no use.

851
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,180
They've slandered
and threatened our contestants.

852
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,700
What they've done

853
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,020
is absolutely immoral and unjust,

854
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,580
causing immense psychological harm

855
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,660
to all participants and the audience.

856
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,500
A competition

857
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,260
should be a level playing field

858
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,980
where everyone

859
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,100
has the opportunity

860
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,100
to showcase their talent and skills.

861
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,940
But if it's rigged,

862
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,300
all of this

863
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,940
becomes meaningless.

864
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,540
We condemn

865
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,140
any attempt to achieve victory

866
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,180
through deception, cheating,

867
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,740
or other unethical means.

868
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,220
To protest the injustice of this competition,

869
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,320
[Xu Hexiang]

870
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,380
Huaixiang Group has decided
to withdraw from the event.

871
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,820
Qiao Zhi

872
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,860
will continue to compete on behalf

873
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,660
of Canteen, his own brand.

874
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,420
Cut to Qiao Zhi's photo!

875
00:34:52,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Qiao Zhi!

876
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:22,860
Qiao Zhi!

877
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,580
A close-up!

878
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,540
A close-up on Qiao Zhi!

879
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,900
Camera 1, 2, 3, get on him!

880
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,500
Qiao Zhi!

881
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,100
What does this mean?

882
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,740
Trying to pull a fast one on me?

883
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,340
Tell those on-site

884
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,220
to

885
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,660
crush Qiao Zhi.

886
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:19,940
Zhan,

887
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,820
after Ms. Tao's stunt,

888
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,220
everyone knows there's a fix now.

889
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,700
Is it really wise to…

890
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,540
Why didn't you doubt
when taking my money?

891
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,180
Do as I say.

892
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,140
If it is not handled well,

893
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,900
I'll see them off at the end.

894
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,220
I have to admit,

895
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,620
I'm truly impressed by Qiao Zhi.

896
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,620
The honey trap

897
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,140
was used brilliantly.

898
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,540
But it wasn't that simple.

899
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,700
He's holding something

900
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,380
back from us.

901
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,340
I told him to sue Guo Yan last night,

902
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,700
but he refused.

903
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,500
No.

904
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,980
Guo Yan

905
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,780
must be dealt with.

906
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,140
If he won't, I will.

907
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,700
Mom,

908
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,220
don't you understand yet?

909
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,300
He treats everyone

910
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,980
at the canteen like his own family.

911
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,460
This is a clear sign

912
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,500
of his immaturity and naivety.

913
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,620
Maybe it's for the best.

914
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,340
He'll never grow up

915
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,020
if he hasn't been betrayed.

916
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,220
In that case,

917
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,980
let him handle it himself.

918
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,180
By the way,

919
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,940
at the bar yesterday,

920
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,340
you didn't hit him, right?

921
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,220
Of course I didn't.

922
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,580
We practiced dodging that slap

923
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,820
over twenty or thirty times in private.

924
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,780
He's got

925
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,980
a thousand tricks up his sleeve.

926
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,180
Uh,

927
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:45,860
one more thing.

928
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,860
This is Qiao Zhi's

929
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,380
bar tab from last night.

930
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,060
He said we should

931
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,260
separate business from personal matters

932
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,620
and that we have to cover it.

933
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,260
Wait.

934
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:57,980
What is his deal?

935
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,900
He made so much money

936
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
from us this time,

937
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,540
yet

938
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,100
he wants me to cover his bar tab?

939
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:04,940
Forget it, Mom.

940
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,140
He made us a good chunk of money

941
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,380
with the co-branded zone.

942
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,020
Just consider it our treat for him.

943
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,340
You really spoil him.

944
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,700
Qiao Zhi.

945
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,220
Sorry, you're not on the list
of contestants.

946
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,300
Please leave the venue.

947
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,220
Qiao Zhi!

948
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,340
Everyone,

949
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,100
the Huaixiang Group
withdrew from the event.

950
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,820
What does that have to do with me?

951
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,660
Committee,

952
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,980
give us an explanation!

953
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,780
Fix!

954
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,700
Agree for Qiao Zhi

955
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,540
to continue competing
on behalf of Canteen.

956
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
Cheers!

957
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,420
Come on!

958
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,300
If you have a problem with that,

959
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,380
I don't mind having another match.

960
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,780
This arena has always belonged to you.

961
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,020
I withdraw.

962
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:03,780
Liu Shuo!

963
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,940
Let's begin.

964
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,540
King of Chefs.

965
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,540
Now, let me introduce

966
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,500
our judging panel.

967
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,740
They are Mr. Xu Kang'an,

968
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,700
Vice President
of the Chef Association,

969
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,380
and Mr. Tang Yuanbiao,
President of the Gourmet Society.

970
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,340
In total, there are ten national chefs

971
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,500
who form our esteemed jury.

972
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,020
A big round
of applause for them, please!

973
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,220
The rules for this match
are open-format.

974
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,180
Both chefs may freely select

975
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,620
any ingredients from the pantry area.

976
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,700
You will have two hours

977
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,180
to complete your dishes.

978
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
I now officially declare

979
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,780
the competition underway!

980
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,140
Great.

981
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,460
A competition without rules

982
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,380
is the most difficult kind.

983
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,540
You can use all your time and energy

984
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,900
to perfect a single dish

985
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,540
or divide your focus

986
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,460
to create more of them.

987
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,820
The judges' preferences differ,

988
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,580
so more dishes
mean bigger chances of success.

989
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,860
But that'll compromise
the quality and taste.

990
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,660
I wonder how

991
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,660
Qiao Zhi will choose.

992
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,740
With Qiao Zhi's character,

993
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,020
three dishes

994
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,780
in two hours

995
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,540
should be more

996
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,780
than enough for him.

997
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,380
What do you think, Mr. Xu?

998
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,180
I don't know.

999
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,900
Buddha Jumps Over The Wall?

1000
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,460
But you're the chef for Sichuan cuisine.

1001
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,780
Do you know why I don't make that dish?

1002
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,900
That is white teatfish,

1003
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,220
not sea cucumber.

1004
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,620
I mean it.

1005
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,820
Without enough time to rehydrate it,

1006
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,340
the texture will be compromised.

1007
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,100
If I were you, I'd make boiled cabbage.

1008
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,500
I've made it for Mr. Biao before,

1009
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,420
and he loved it.

1010
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,460
As Mr. Biao's chief disciple,

1011
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,900
you're making a Fujian dish

1012
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,260
right in front of him.

1013
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,780
Isn't that a bit like betraying
your master?

1014
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,540
Just shut your mouth

1015
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,620
and mind your own business.
