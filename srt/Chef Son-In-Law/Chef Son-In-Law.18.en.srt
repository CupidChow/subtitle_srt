00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,620
In the past,

193
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,940
I spoiled him.

194
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,220
His mother died young,

195
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,140
so I wanted to make up

196
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,140
for her absence.

197
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,220
It's understandable.

198
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,740
But lately,

199
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,820
he comes home and talks to me.

200
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,260
He asks about my life

201
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,380
and cares about my health.

202
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,700
It even makes me feel a little sheepish.

203
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,020
Chong,

204
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,260
I want to apologize to you.

205
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,580
Previously,

206
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,380
I neglected your feelings.

207
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,220
Let's get well along

208
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,300
and be honest about everything.

209
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,100
Okay?

210
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,100
Dad,

211
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,660
what's this all about?

212
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,860
Spending years in the business world,

213
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,860
I've got used to being results-oriented.

214
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,380
But family isn't business partners.

215
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,540
I overlooked the importance of family.

216
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,420
Mr. Qiao,

217
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,180
you know what?

218
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,020
When he got his bonus
for the first month,

219
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,020
he bought me a watch.

220
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,660
Oh, come on, Dad.

221
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,020
Sit down.

222
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,340
This is your Master,

223
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,620
not an outsider.

224
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,660
Besides,

225
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,420
my wife gave me a watch

226
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,660
as a token of our love

227
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,420
when we got married.

228
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,060
I didn't bear to replace it.

229
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,100
Even if they offered me
a Patek Philippe,

230
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,340
I wouldn't replace it.

231
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,860
But Chong told me

232
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,420
to let the past be past

233
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,460
and to move on,

234
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,860
so as not to let down

235
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,340
those by my side.

236
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,300
I used to think

237
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,700
it was easy for my dad

238
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,820
to make money,

239
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,580
as if

240
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,420
he had a few drinks,

241
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,100
and the money would just come in.

242
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,340
But when I started working with Master,

243
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,460
I realized how difficult

244
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,580
it is to manage a business.

245
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:13,780
Son,

246
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,340
I was wrong.

247
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,180
From now on,

248
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,980
let's work together
to build up our family.

249
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,740
Okay?

250
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,180
Dad, stop apologizing.

251
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,860
It's not a big deal.

252
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,700
More than that.

253
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,620
I think

254
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,820
I should keep you by my side.

255
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,740
After all,
we fight on the same battlefield!

256
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:33,860
Congratulations!

257
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,940
I told you

258
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,060
as long as you play to your strengths,

259
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,380
whether it's here
or at your dad's company,

260
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,860
you'll have more options.

261
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,900
That's great.

262
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,420
All thanks to your master.

263
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,340
Dad,

264
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,300
I want to stay at Canteen.

265
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,540
That's not what I mean.

266
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,420
I don't

267
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,340
look down on Canteen.

268
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,060
You are my only son, after all.

269
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,420
Besides,

270
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,940
it'll take you
at least four to five years

271
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,660
to do something

272
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,820
before you can achieve something.

273
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,540
Mr. Qiao,

274
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,380
don't you agree?

275
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,820
Indeed.

276
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,180
After four or five years,

277
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,700
you'll just enter the industry.

278
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,100
Of course.

279
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,460
I'm not asking you

280
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,540
to come over right away.

281
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,940
I know

282
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,860
this restaurant is booming,

283
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,620
and Mr. Qiao has to prepare
for the championship.

284
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,740
They need hands here right now.

285
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,660
Focus on your work here.

286
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,700
I can wait for you.

287
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,380
Okay?

288
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,260
Alright, Dad!

289
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,140
Thanks, Dad!

290
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:29,900
Mr. Zhou,

291
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,940
after our new branch closes tonight,

292
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
we're tasting some new dishes.

293
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,900
If you're free, please join us.

294
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,220
Dad, there are new dishes!

295
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:36,900
Come join us!

296
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,260
Mr. Qiao,

297
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,460
I'm so sorry,

298
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,660
but I have plans tonight.

299
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,900
I just took on a new project,

300
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,340
and the leadership's schedule
is incredibly tight.

301
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,260
Let's do it another time,

302
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,860
okay?

303
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,180
Alright.

304
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,020
Oh, right, son.

305
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,340
The leader said

306
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,420
he wants to meet you tonight.

307
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,780
Ask Mr. Qiao for the night off.

308
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,820
Let's go together.

309
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,700
Why does he want to see me?

310
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,420
Just go.

311
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,540
Okay. Go.

312
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,140
It's a good thing.

313
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,060
Let's go.

314
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:58,860
Go.

315
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,220
I'm leaving.

316
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,860
- Okay.
- Mr. Qiao.

317
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:01,540
Let's go.

318
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,860
Take care!

319
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:07,940
Go ahead.

320
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,760
[Rushuang, Ruxue, Mr. Xu,
Mr. Zhang, Zhou Chong]

321
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,280
[Ding Chan, Sworn Grandfather, Honey]

322
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,760
[Xunyang North District
First People's Hospital]

323
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,020
You must

324
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,260
have been working so hard recently.

325
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,860
It's nothing, Mom.

326
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,180
I just

327
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,860
can't sit still.

328
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,540
This way

329
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,420
is good for me.

330
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,820
Qiao Zhi,

331
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,620
I've always wanted to ask you something.

332
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:50,780
Go ahead, Mom.

333
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,900
What are you trying to achieve

334
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,140
by running this restaurant?

335
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,420
You work day and night,

336
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,660
yet give much of the profit
to your employees.

337
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,700
I've been an entrepreneur
for so many years,

338
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,620
but I've never seen anyone like you.

339
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,700
Yeah,

340
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,380
what for?

341
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,900
Let me think.

342
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,380
You know,

343
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,540
my parents passed away

344
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,900
in a car accident.

345
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,100
When I was very young,

346
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,900
my grandpa and I relied on each other

347
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,060
to get by at that place.

348
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,380
When I was a kid,

349
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,460
the very first dish I ever made

350
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,140
made my grandpa throw up.

351
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,620
Really.

352
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,540
I was so nervous back then,

353
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,220
mistaking vinegar for soy sauce.

354
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,220
From that moment on,

355
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,220
I vowed

356
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,780
that I would definitely
make delicious dishes.

357
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,140
So after that,

358
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,900
I practiced for a very long time.

359
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,580
Five years after that,

360
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,460
on my grandpa's birthday,

361
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,660
I cooked a dish for him.

362
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,620
I was cautious that day

363
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,580
and practiced it three times over

364
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,340
before I was finally satisfied with it.

365
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,340
When I brought it to him,

366
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,660
I thought he was sleeping,

367
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,300
so I didn't dare disturb him

368
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,700
and waited beside him.

369
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,900
I waited there

370
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,140
for a very long time

371
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,540
and ended up falling asleep.

372
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,540
When I woke up,

373
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,220
the dish had gone bad.

374
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,100
But he never woke up again.

375
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,580
All I wanted at that moment

376
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,300
was for him to wake up and taste it.

377
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,620
But you've done it now.

378
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,740
Everyone praises your cooking.

379
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,820
But the person I cared about most

380
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,940
is no longer here.

381
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,900
Oh, my dear child.

382
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,980
Now you have me,

383
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,660
Ruxue,

384
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,260
and everyone at Canteen.

385
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,340
None of us will ever leave you.

386
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,820
Yes.

387
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,700
Do you know

388
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,620
why everyone loves the taste

389
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,900
of their mother's cooking?

390
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,300
Because preparing a meal

391
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,820
for her child is the most joyful thing

392
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,540
she can do.

393
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,780
When I see a kid

394
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,380
soaking the rice in the soup,

395
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,460
and eating it up,

396
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,900
that kind

397
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,940
of spontaneous joy,

398
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,660
and that feeling of delight,

399
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,180
are the meaning of cooking.

400
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,300
It's also the meaning of living.

401
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,700
You put

402
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,460
too much pressure on yourself.

403
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
If we set aside money,

404
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,380
love,

405
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,140
career, and honor,

406
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,900
I believe that eating

407
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,580
is the most fundamental aspect of life.

408
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,180
A meal

409
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,940
shouldn't just be good.

410
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,340
It should be shared
with people you care about.

411
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,380
That is its true essence,

412
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,180
not a means for profit or deceit.

413
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,940
The people who dine

414
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,220
at Canteen might

415
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,460
be fleeting passersby,

416
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,860
but it can

417
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,020
provide them

418
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
with the taste a meal should have.

419
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,740
That is what I truly want.

420
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,340
Alright.

421
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,620
Once the last guests
in the private room are gone,

422
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,820
let everyone come for the tasting.

423
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,300
Zhi,

424
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,140
I'm really growing more

425
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,580
and more impressed with your mind.

426
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,220
What on earth is inside there?

427
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,580
How did you think
of preparing a dish like this?

428
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,180
And before long,

429
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,780
we're having another tasting.

430
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,780
Have you got a name yet?

431
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,180
Not yet.

432
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,420
I want to discuss it with you

433
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,740
until you finish eating.

434
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,660
No wonder Mr. Zheng said

435
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,540
I can learn a lot by your side.

436
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,180
I really benefited a lot.

437
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,060
Learn from each other.

438
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,100
Bao,

439
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,580
there are many things

440
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,420
I can learn from you.

441
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,620
How could it be?

442
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,900
Besides this unique temperament,

443
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,740
what else do I have?

444
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,740
What I want to say is

445
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,180
that I admire your skill

446
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,100
in drinking beer.

447
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,140
It's getting boring.

448
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,660
Okay,

449
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,660
if you lose in the finals,

450
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,060
come back and drink a bottle

451
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,580
of Baijiu.

452
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,180
Alright.

453
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,380
Bao,

454
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,780
I really admire you.

455
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,940
Our business is just getting started,

456
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,060
and we'll need

457
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,220
your strong support in the future.

458
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:21,940
Zhi,

459
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,380
this is the most heartwarming thing

460
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,820
I've heard in all my years as a chef.

461
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,820
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

462
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,220
In the finals,

463
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,700
I'll definitely support you well.

464
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,020
Okay,

465
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,380
let's call them over.

466
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,740
Sure!

467
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,100
- Something's wrong!
- What happened?

468
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,980
Someone got drunk and was acting crazy.

469
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,700
He pushed Ms. Chen down.

470
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,900
Let's go!

471
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:01,900
Ms. Chen,

472
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,180
who did this?

473
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,020
The person ran away.

474
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,180
Bao chased after him with our staff.

475
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,020
Ms. Chen,

476
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,220
where do you feel uncomfortable?

477
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,060
Boss, I can't move my leg.

478
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,740
No.

479
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:11,940
Go to the hospital.

480
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,220
We'll take her

481
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,420
to the hospital.

482
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,540
If the police come later,

483
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
someone should be here
to liaise with them.

484
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,220
Okay,

485
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,460
use my car.

486
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,180
Here.

487
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,540
Okay.

488
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,020
Come, slowly now.

489
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,420
Okay.

490
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,620
- Be careful.
- It hurts.

491
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,500
Slowly.

492
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,100
It hurts.

493
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,260
It hurts.

494
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,140
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

495
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,820
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

496
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,780
Blow out the candles.

497
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,300
Okay, happy birthday!

498
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,100
Happy birthday.

499
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,100
[Happy birthday]

500
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,700
Good.

501
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,980
You're one year older now.

502
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,940
Happy birthday to you.

503
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,380
Happy birthday to you.

504
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,000
[Happy birthday]

505
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,900
Surprise?

506
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,220
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

507
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,060
Why are you all here?

508
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,460
Happy birthday, dear.

509
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:54,940
Wait.

510
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,940
How did you know today's my birthday?

511
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,100
We got the marriage certificate, so…

512
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,700
Right.

513
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,140
So

514
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,220
you kept it a secret from me.

515
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,420
You arranged all of this?

516
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,220
Surprise or not?

517
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,180
Surprise!

518
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,980
It's almost becoming frightening.

519
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,980
Don't blame me.

520
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,500
Blame Rushuang.

521
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,340
Her idea.

522
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,340
Tao Rushuang,

523
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
I'll remember this.

524
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,540
Hey!

525
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,340
Tao Ruxue,

526
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,340
you betrayed me!

527
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,460
Zhi,

528
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,100
I gifted you the car,

529
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,300
so there won't be any gift.

530
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,260
But I must warn you.

531
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,020
If you bully Ruxue,

532
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,100
I will perish with you,

533
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,260
so she can marry someone better!

534
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,100
Don't worry,

535
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,380
I won't give her that chance.

536
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,700
You two

537
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,100
are not leaving, right?

538
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,260
Since you've promoted me to manager,

539
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,180
why would I leave?

540
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,820
Master,

541
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,780
my dad asked me to pass on a message.

542
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
This gift

543
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,900
has been delivered.

544
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,900
Tonight

545
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,340
is an occasion for us young people,

546
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,180
so he won't participate.

547
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:54,980
Okay.

548
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,140
Oh?

549
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,140
Your dad can't make it,

550
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,900
but we can join you.

551
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,700
Ms. Tao.

552
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,660
You really...

553
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,580
Not even mentioning your birthday!

554
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,260
If Xue hadn't informed us,

555
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,220
we

556
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,780
would have missed it!

557
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,580
Grandpa,

558
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
I didn't plan to celebrate.

559
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,660
I just wanted everyone in Canteen

560
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,380
to have a casual meal together.

561
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,740
Grandpa, don't listen to him!

562
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,060
He says he doesn't want it,

563
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,580
but deep down, he wants to celebrate
with family.

564
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,780
It's fine not to tell outsiders,

565
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,660
but as insiders,

566
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,860
preparing some gifts

567
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,740
is not troublesome at all.

568
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,900
This

569
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,340
is a gift from me.

570
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,020
This medal from two decades ago

571
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,180
is mine,

572
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,620
and it also belongs to your grandpa.

573
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,420
Is there a story behind this?

576

and disliked these kinds
of competitions.

577

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:16,940
Hello.

950
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,140
This is our gift

951
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,980
for ladies to try.

952
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,140
It's our newly made Beauty Cake.

953
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,980
It looks so pretty!

954
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,260
Try it, the taste is wonderful.

955
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,300
Delicious!

956
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
So soft and fluffy,

957
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,660
like snowflakes.

958
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,460
A rich milky aroma,

959
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,980
with a hint of delicate tea fragrance.

960
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
What is this made of?

961
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:35,900
Semen Euryales.

962
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,740
Semen Euryales?

963
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,500
What is Semen Euryales?

964
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,340
It's more expensive than beef,

965
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,500
and it's very nutritious.

966
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,700
Here, try some too.

967
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,620
What is this?

968
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,780
Can I have one?

969
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,380
Boss, can I get a portion?

970
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,660
Okay.

971
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,940
Alright, everyone gets one.

972
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,460
Master,

973
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,500
I...

974
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,620
Okay, you get one too.

975
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:51,980
Here.

976
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:52,980
Come on,

977
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,340
take it yourself.

978
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,700
What about mine?

979
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,620
Here.

980
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,500
What brings you here,

981
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,020
Ms. Tao?

982
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,180
You're so busy these days.

983
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,660
I'm busy? You're busier.

984
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,300
Did you see that thing?

985
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,820
It's the latest project

986
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,140
from Zhou Chong's research.

987
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,420
To make different pastries every day

988
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,500
for customers to try for free.

989
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,180
You have to admit, it's working well.

990
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,740
I told you he is talented!

991
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,900
His dad tried to poach him,

992
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:23,820
but no way!

993
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,940
Marketing alone isn't enough,

994
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,580
and the product has to be solid.

995
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,260
Let's talk business.

996
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,740
I've thought
of a new collaboration model

997
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,380
that guarantees you can
make money easily.

998
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,500
As soon as you said that,

999
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,260
I knew it was nothing good.

1000
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,180
Come on, would I screw you over?

1001
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,020
My grandpa taught me

1002
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,220
there's no such thing

1003
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,420
as a free lunch.

1004
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,260
So, I made it a habit

1005
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,460
not to seek small advantages.

1006
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,700
Discount cards, promotional offers,

1007
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,900
get them all away from me!

1008
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,940
Okay, I'll get out.

1009
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,740
No!

1010
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,860
Don't go!

1011
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,700
You're an exception!

1012
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,260
Speak then.

1013
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,780
What kind of collaboration model?

1014
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,060
The group is now unhappy

1015
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,900
about the high marketing fees
paid to Canteen.

1016
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,380
To put it bluntly, it's Zhan Shikun.

1017
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,140
I couldn't refute his argument.

1018
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,220
So,

1019
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,860
may you make some sacrifices?

1020
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,660
Consider it mutual support.

1021
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:19,940
Alright.

1022
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,580
How?

1023
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,180
Canteen's short-video ecosystem

1024
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,660
is now in the top tier on Kuaiyin.

1025
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,580
Huaixiang has invested a lot,

1026
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,860
but can't build it up.

1027
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,300
I want you to help me drive traffic.

1028
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,220
That's not a good deal.

1029
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,580
You know how expensive traffic is now?

1030
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,260
You always seem to favor outsiders.

1031
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,300
Can't you stick up for me?

1032
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,420
How could I be siding with outsiders?

1033
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,180
Here's the deal.

1034
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,900
Give me 10% of your profits

1035
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:51,940
from Kuaiyin.

1036
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,140
10%?

1037
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,180
No way, that's too much!

1038
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,020
Two percent!

1039
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,300
Have I been too nice to you lately?

1040
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,060
What's this?

1041
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,900
Open it and you'll know.

1042
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,900
I specifically saved this for you.

1043
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,140
Well.

1044
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,380
Five percent is my final offer.

1045
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,660
Don't need to answer me right away.

1046
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,660
Let's talk after you finish it.

1047
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,220
I can't bear to eat it.

1048
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,980
I have to take a picture with my phone.

1049
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,700
Find the right lighting first.

1050
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,220
Fine, take your time.

1051
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,260
I'll send food to Mom.

1052
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,980
At least you have some conscience.

1053
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,580
Go on then.

1054
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,260
For the sake of how cute it is,

1055
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,740
I'll let you get one over on me.

1056
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,760
[Mr. Song]

1057
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,220
Mr. Song, what's up?

1058
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,620
Something happened.

1059
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,140
The Huasheng Group has unilaterally

1060
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,260
canceled our partnership.

1061
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,020
How could this happen?

1062
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,980
If we don't have their ingredients,

1063
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,260
our co-branded zone project

1064
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,420
can't go forward at all!

1065
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,300
Qiao Zhi is on good terms

1066
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,380
with them.

1067
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,460
What went wrong

1068
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,900
to make them willing to pay the penalty

1069
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,780
to cancel the partnership?

1070
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,860
I know what it is.

1071
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,980
I announced my marriage,

1072
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,260
and Ellie knows that.

1073
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
She has had a secret crush

1074
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,660
on Qiao Zhi since university.

1075
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,900
She chased him all the way back
from abroad.

1076
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,780
So, should we tell Qiao Zhi

1077
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,300
and let him think of something?

1078
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,260
Never mind.

1079
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,500
I'll see what's happening.

1080
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,600
[Ward]

1081
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,820
Mr. Xu?

1082
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,380
You recognize me like this?

1083
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,020
Why are you...?

1084
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,580
It's nothing.

1085
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:09,780
Nothing at all.

1086
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,580
Are you here to see Ms. Tao Nanfang?

1087
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,180
No.

1088
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,220
My friend is being discharged soon,

1089
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,420
so I came by to see her.

1090
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,900
I'm leaving now.

1091
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
The soup is delicious.

1092
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,740
Qiao Zhi,

1093
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,900
you bought the wrong flowers.

1094
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,700
Mom,

1095
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,180
these roses

1096
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,300
were left at the door by Mr. Xu Hexiang.

1097
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,260
He stood there for a long time,

1098
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,620
and he never quite dared to come in.

1099
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,780
Xu Hexiang?

1100
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,420
The wretch has the nerve to come back!

1101
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,100
Wretch?

1102
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,420
It's improper

1103
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,820
to say that.

1104
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,860
Remember, stay away from him.

1105
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,780
Any conflict between you?

1106
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,780
I saw him crying.

1107
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,980
Those are the crocodile tears.

1108
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,020
Don't be deceived by his hypocrisy.

1109
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,500
Qiao Zhi,

1110
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,060
I'm getting discharged next week.

1111
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,300
Ms. Chen told me

1112
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,140
you and Ruxue are sleeping
in separate rooms.

1113
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,140
No.

1114
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,500
Actually,

1115
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,620
it's not her fault.

1116
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,380
She's very busy with her work.

1117
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,900
A lot is going on at Huaixiang Group,

1118
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,820
and she sometimes has to work late
into the night.

1119
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,180
I leave early in the morning.

1120
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,820
So, our schedules

1121
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,100
don't really overlap.

1122
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,060
Sleeping separately

1123
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,820
allows us to get better rest.

1124
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,580
Wait,

1125
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,460
you're a married couple!

1126
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,580
You're newlyweds!

1127
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,460
Hey,

1128
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,500
as a man,

1129
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,140
can you take the initiative?

1130
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,580
At key moments,

1131
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,620
you need to charge forward!

1132
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,660
If anything happens,

1133
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,820
I'll back you up.

1134
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
