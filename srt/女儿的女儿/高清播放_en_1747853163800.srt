1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You

14
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Two pieces of her robe.

15
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think robe is easier to change.

16
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think robe is easier to change.

17
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You may.

18
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We're going to change clothes.

19
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So we're going to change.

20
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No, no, no.

21
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, no, no.

22
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No one is here.

23
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't change here.

24
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Come on.

25
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No, this is easy.

26
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No, this is a corridor.

27
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hey.

28
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is that your mom?

29
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't worry.

30
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's her.

31
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So mad.

32
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No.

33
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't come down.

34
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't move.

35
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You guys are weird.

36
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I really...

37
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Shh.

38
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Grandma.

39
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're finally here.

40
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're all dressed up.

41
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's this for?

42
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's going on?

43
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come to the ward.

44
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What's going on?

45
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There's water leaking in the ward.

46
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll go in after the water is fixed.

47
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Emma and I just got here.

48
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She fell.

49
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Her bones are broken.

50
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And she won't open the door.

51
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why should I open the door?

52
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,120
You can't go to the

53
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Dad.

54
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay?

55
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What should we do?

56
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Mom, the knife.

57
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

58
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What's going on?

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is the situation.

60
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We have to wait for the doctor.

61
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

62
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is the situation.

63
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What should we do?

64
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well...

65
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You...

66
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You are...

68
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hello, I'm Jiayi.

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Zhou Jiayi.

70
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're colleagues, right?

71
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes.

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Colleagues.

73
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's going on?

74
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why are you standing here?

75
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're all...

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're all weird.

77
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No one will ask you...

78
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll go ask.

79
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll go ask about the ward.

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay.

81
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000

00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000

174
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm…

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm…

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm so sorry.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was…

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sorry.

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm so sorry.

180
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
Sorry.

181
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No.

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you, I'm so sorry.

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you.

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Didn't really know what you were thinking.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Sorry, 거울이요.

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Sae Jeder

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's okay.

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll have to thank you guys in the future.

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I didn't do dementia.

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I found out last year that I have a minor stroke.

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I said that I only know how to speak English.

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Just let it be.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It means that the part of his brain that deals with language

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
might be a little bit damaged.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, something like that.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My brother looks pretty good.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Good days and bad days?

199
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Actually, my parents and I are willing to visit him in New York.

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
My mother-in-law and I have known each other for a long time.

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The first meal that my mother-in-law eats in New York is at my father's restaurant.

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Do you know my side of the story?

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I know a little bit.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I thought about it for a long time.

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But I decided to come back to live with you.

206
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
My mother is fine now.

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can take care of my mother-in-law.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You and I are very similar.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What do you mean by that?

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What do you mean by that?

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's just that it's easy to make your mother angry.

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Like really piss her off.

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Hello, Carol.

217
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I heard that the stock price has risen today.

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The 10 stock you bought for me yesterday,

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the one you finally decided to sell, is it 257?

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay, okay.

221
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then you buy 10 stock for me today.

222
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And the price is 268.

223
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay, okay, I'll wait for you to record.

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes.

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Have you eaten yet?

226
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Not yet.

227
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What time did you eat?

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Where are you?

229
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm just out there.

230
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm probably going to buy fried chicken.

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're still eating fried chicken?

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Didn't you say that you had a fever?

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Shouldn't you eat something light?

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Fried chicken in New York is delicious.

235
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Let me eat some.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You always scold me for eating too much.

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm picky.

238
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm picky.

239
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I eat a lot of good food.

240
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay, okay.

241
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So you're not feeling unwell, right?

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You're not feeling unwell, right?

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think I should be.

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What do you mean you should be?

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What else is wrong?

246
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What's wrong?

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Is it true or not?

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What?

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What's wrong?

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What happened?

251
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I miss you.

252
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I miss you too.

253
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I was in front of the counter this morning.

254
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I was playing with my clothes.

255
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't know why I'm crying.

256
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Why are you crying?

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't know.

258
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm sad.

259
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You're sad?

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sad.

261
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sad.

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're not even capable of fighting the cold.

263
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You're even giving birth to a child.

264
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't know.

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't want to talk about it.

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't want to talk about it.

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm asking you.

268
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What should you do with your chi?

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Are you coming back to take care of it?

270
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's all over there.

271
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
She's always angry.

272
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Look at her little mother.

273
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She's so weird.

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay.

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll take care of it.

276
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll take care of it.

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll go back and see her.

278
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay.

279
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Okay.

280
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're a child.

281
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You love me?

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm talking to you.

284
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Don't distract me.

285
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm choosing wine.

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I want to be a child.

287
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I want to be a child.

288
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm not going to hesitate.

289
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm afraid.

290
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm a child.

291
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Are you sure?

292
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Are you crazy?

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're telling me this now?

294
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What's there to be afraid of?

295
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
If you run away,

296
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll raise it myself.

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm not going to run away.

298
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What did he say?

299
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He said he wouldn't run away.

300
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Hurry and choose three bottles.

301
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm so hungry.

302
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What are three bottles?

303
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Are they four bottles?

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Three bottles.

305
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You'll drink one bottle the next day.

306
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You'll choose three bottles.

307
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
One bottle of the successful pregnancy.

308
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
One bottle of the pregnancy-rejected pregnancy.

309
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Then you'll drink one more bottle.

310
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
When you're done, I'll go home.

311
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What are you doing?

312
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm doing the laundry.

313
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Three bottles.

314
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Three bottles.

315
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Three bottles.

316
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Three bottles.

317
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Three bottles.

318
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Three bottles.

319
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Are you going to cry again?

320
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't cry.

321
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Thank you.

322
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay, don't cry.

323
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you.

324
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay.

325
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Hello, Mum?

326
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm going to eat McDonald's tomorrow.

327
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I've already bought a lot of food.

328
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Didn't you say you wanted the left-side and right-side?

329
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm tired from playing the piano today.

330
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Let's play another day.

331
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm going to eat McDonald's.

332
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You can help me with the dishes tomorrow.

333
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Okay.

334
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You can also help me wipe my nail polish.

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's New Year.

336
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Red nail polish?

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yes.

338
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Okay.

339
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Then tomorrow is the day

340
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
for the red nail polish and McDonald's?

341
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes.

342
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Okay.

343
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
As long as you're happy.

344
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Okay, see you tomorrow.

345
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Come on time tomorrow.

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Bye.

347
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Bye.

348
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The first day is on Friday.

349
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
How many days are left?

350
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
How many days?

351
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Today is the 21st.

352
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Today is the 21st.

353
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Mum, can you sit down?

354
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Can you sit down?

355
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
When are you coming to pick me up?

356
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Don't worry about how many days.

357
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll pick you up before New Year's.

358
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Mum, sit down.

359
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Recently, Emma has been calling me.

360
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Be careful.

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Sit down.

362
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What did she say?

363
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
She said I shouldn't go back to New York.

364
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Why don't you go back to New York?

365
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Why should I go back?

366
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm never going back to New York.

367
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Okay.

368
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Then tell her I'll never go back to New York.

369
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How many days are left before New Year's?

370
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
As long as you're happy.

371
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll stay as long as I want.

372
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
My grandma isn't here anyway.

373
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Where did she go?

374
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
She went to New York.

375
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
She went to New York?

376
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Why didn't she take me there?

377
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Didn't you say you wouldn't go back?

378
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Never.

379
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Never?

380
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Never go there.

381
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Never go there.

382
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Never go there.

383
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What did she do there?

384
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
She gave birth to a child.

385
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
A child?

386
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
My hair...

387
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The bangs in the front...

388
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I cut them too short.

389
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Mom, I didn't cut your hair.

390
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm just wiping your hair.

391
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Listen to me.

392
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I've already arranged your things.

393
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The state of affairs is too big.

394
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I can't let you take risks.

395
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I can't let you take risks.

396
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I can't let you take risks.

397
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Do you understand?

398
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Mom.

399
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Mom, are you really stupid now?

400
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Or are you still pretending to be stupid?

401
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Mom.

402
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Mom.

403
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
My hair...

404
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The bangs in the front are too short.

405
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Mom.

406
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Mom.

407
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Who am I?

408
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Who are you?

409
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Who am I to you?

410
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Who am I?

411
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Who am I?

412
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Who are you?

413
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't even know my own daughter.

414
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't even know my own daughter.

415
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Of course you're my daughter.

416
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Who are you?

417
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Who am I?

418
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Who am I?

419
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Who am I?

420
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Who am I?

421
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Who am I?

422
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Who am I?

423
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Who am I?

424
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Who am I?

425
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Who am I?

426
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Who am I?

427
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Who am I?

428
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Who am I?

429
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Who am I?

430
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Who am I?

431
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Who am I?

432
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Who am I?

433
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Who am I?

434
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Who am I?

435
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Who am I?

436
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Mom, I'll take you back to your room.

437
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,480
So long.

438
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,400
Okay.

439
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,520
Okay.

440
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,380
So how many coins do you have today?

441
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,700
Today

442
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,660
it's 21.

443
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,560
This. Tomorrow it's 22.

444
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,100
Okay.

445
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,680
I'll order 23.

446
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,240

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,000

1 2 cha cha cha

466
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,280
how is Zuoen doing?

467
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,180
I don't know

468
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,980
I don't know what he is doing

469
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,880
I only know he is taking needles

470
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,820
he is taking the tablet

471
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,920
it's uncomfortable

472
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,920
I finished it

473
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,580
and

474
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,620
he called me back

475
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,260
he started crying

476
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,560
I don't know why

477
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,860
I changed to the needle

478
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,640
or take medicine

479
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,500
he said he would take the tablet

480
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,640
and wait for the fetus to give birth

481
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,940
and then he can plant

482
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,840
it sounds like planting vegetables

483
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,080
it's boring

484
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,780
he knows a lot about kids

485
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,780
I think it sounds like planting vegetables

486
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,900
my second son is in New York

487
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,300
he asked Zuoen and Zha Yi to have dinner

488
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,800
and you asked Emma

489
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,100
and it's you guess who

490
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,900
who?

491
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,500
Johnny

492
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Johnny

493
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,300
my Johnny

494
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,280
he is going to show up

495
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,840
your son is in New York

496
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,180
no, he is going to New York for a business trip

497
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,560
he wants to ask Zuoen to have dinner with him

498
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,200
it's a wonderful combination

499
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,500
my daughter, your daughter

500
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,800
Johnny's daughter

501
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,700
Johnny's daughter is your daughter

502
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,200
okay

503
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,200
it's a long time ago

504
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,900
hello?

505
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,900
hey

506
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,900
who?

507
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
Johnny

508
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
Johnny

509
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,900
Johnny, we just found you

510
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,900
what are you doing?

511
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
I'm going to the bathroom

512
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
I'm going to the bathroom

513
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,900
what?

514
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,900
when did it happen?

515
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,900
is it serious?

516
00:29:48,900 --> 00:30:06,900
I think I can't come to pick him up during the New Year

517
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,900
I can't come to pick him up during the New Year

518
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,900
I will call him

519
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,900
but please tell him

520
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,900
okay

521
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,900
I will call Miss Wang Li Fen

522
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
okay, Miss Wang Li Fen

523
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,900
I will tell you how to contact her

524
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,900
I will call Miss Wang Li Fen

525
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,900
okay

526
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:28,900
Fanzuo

527
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Fanzuo, answer the phone

528
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
Fanzuo

529
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
Fanzuo

530
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Fanzuo

531
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Fanzuo

532
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Fanzuo

533
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
Fanzuo

534
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,900
Fanzuo

535
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
Fanzuo

536
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,900
Fanzuo

537
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,900
Fanzuo

538
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,900
I don't know what you were talking about

539
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
I really don't know what you were talking about

540
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,900
you can call me

541
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
what did you...

542
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,900
what did you mean by he left me?

543
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,900
I don't know what you were talking about

544
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
why didn't you call me?

545
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
right?

546
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
I told you that you have to call me

547
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
What do you mean?

548
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
What do you mean, Zuo-er has left?

549
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,900
And then, did anyone tell you what happened?

550
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,900
What happened?

551
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
Where is Jiayi?

552
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Did you see them? Did you come to the hospital?

553
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
You made a mistake, right?

554
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,900
They made a mistake. You made a mistake, right?

555
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,900
Listen to me.

556
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,900
Did you see them?

557
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,900
But when I got there, Zuo-er was already in the operating room.

558
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
What do you mean?

559
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
Where is Jiayi? Where is Jiayi?

560
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
Where is Jiayi?

561
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Did you see them?

562
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Jiayi left.

563
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
She and Zuo-er...

564
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Zuo-er was driving the car.

565
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
And then she hit a road.

566
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
You know what?

567
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
What road?

568
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
A road.

569
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
A deer. A deer, you know?

570
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
A road.

571
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
Jiayi left at the scene of the car accident.

572
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,900
They were on their way to Jersey.

573
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,900
And then, we don't know what they did to Jiayi.

574
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,900
At that time, Zuo-er was still unconscious.

575
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,900
But she had severe internal bleeding.

576
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,900
And multiple injuries.

577
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,900
The doctor said that when she left in this state,

578
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,900
she wouldn't be in too much pain.

579
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,900
Mrs. Pan?

580
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Mrs. Pan?

581
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Mrs. Pan.

582
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
I'm very sorry for your loss, but...

583
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,900
I'm afraid there are a few things you need to decide before we...

584
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,900
No. No.

585
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,900
I'm not going to say anything.

586
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,900
I understand it's very difficult.

587
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Where is she? Where is she?

588
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
She's downstairs.

589
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Where is my...

590
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
daughter?

591
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,900
Would you like to see her now?

592
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,900
We can see her now if you'd like.

593
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,900
We can see her now if you'd like.

594
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,900
You'll have to make arrangements with the funeral home first,

595
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,900
and they'll take care of everything.

596
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Okay, I'll take care of that.

597
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,900
So the funeral home people will come in...

598
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,900
They'll transfer her to...

599
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,900
Would you like me to sign?

600
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,900
Here, please. In the box.

601
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
I saw her.

602
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
These are the doors.

603
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,900
Okay.

604
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
Here.

605
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,900
You have a jet lag. You should get some sleep.

606
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
That way you'll have more energy.

607
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,900
Would you like to check in at a hotel?

608
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
You can take a break.

609
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Charlie, could you...

610
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
Could you find a place to park?

611
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
Park?

612
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,900
You can find a place and park right next to it.

613
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
No, no, no. You can do that.

614
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,900
Charlie, what are you doing? We're not there yet.

615
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,900
I know. You can park right next to it.

616
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
No, no. You can do that.

617
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,900
Please. Please.

618
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,900
Calm down first.

619
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,900
I'll park right next to the bridge.

620
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900
It's okay.

621
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
We'll be there soon.

622
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,900
Charlie, can you find a place to park?

623
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
I'll park right next to the bridge.

624
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,900
Okay.

625
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,900
Charlie, could you find a place to park?

626
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,900
I'll park right next to the bridge.

627
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
Okay.

628
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,900
Charlie, could you find a place to park?

629
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,900
I'll park right next to the bridge.

630
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
Okay.

631
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Charlie, could you find a place to park?

632
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,900
I'll park right next to the bridge.

633
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,900
Okay.

634
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:56,900
Half-bent, half-closed, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half-hulled, half

635
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,900
hulled.

636
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Emma, Emma, help.

637
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,900
OK.

638
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
One, two, three, one, two, three.

639
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,900
Hello.

640
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,900
Hello.

641
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,900
Hello.

642
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,900
Emma.

643
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Remember to wipe the floor with a clean cloth.

644
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,900
And the cups and all that.

645
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Take out the water heater first.

646
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Then put the plate back on.

647
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Then check the number of boxes.

648
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
And the candles need to be moved back to the right.

649
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,900
Yes.

650
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,900
I'll show you later.

651
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,900
Is it okay?

652
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
Okay.

653
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,900
Okay.

654
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,900
This is New York.

655
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,900
Try to keep your eyes open.

656
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,900
Next slide.

657
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
What's going on?

658
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Are they jammed on the floor?

659
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,900
Hello?

660
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Hello?

661
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,900
The elevator is stuck.

662
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
Can you send someone to take care of it?

663
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
Okay, okay, okay.

664
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Wait a minute.

665
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,900
Please hurry up.

666
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,900
We need to rush to the clinic.

667
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,900
Okay, okay, okay.

668
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,900
You can do this with an elevator?

669
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,900
Hello?

670
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,900
Hello?

671
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,900
The elevator is stuck.

672
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,900
Can you send someone to take care of it?

673
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,900
Okay, okay, okay.

674
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,900
Wait a minute.

675
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,900
Please hurry up.

676
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,900
We need to rush to the clinic.

677
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,900
Okay, okay, okay.

678
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,900
You can do this with an elevator?

679
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,900
You've already known enough about the disaster in the world.

680
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,900
You still want to get me a child?

681
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Mom, I'm sorry.

682
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,900
I'm sorry.

683
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,900
I'm sorry.

684
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,900
I'm sorry.

685
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,900
I'm sorry.

686
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,900
I'm sorry.

687
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,900
I'm sorry.

688
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,900
I'm sorry.

689
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
I'm sorry.

690
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,900
I'm sorry.

691
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,900
I'm sorry.

692
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,900
I'm sorry.

693
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,900
I'm sorry.

694
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,900
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,900
I'm sorry.

696
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
I'm sorry.

697
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
I'm sorry.

698
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,900
Mom, are you serious?

699
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,900
You're discussing this with me now?

700
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,900
I'm not discussing this with you.

701
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,900
I'm just telling you to stop thinking about it.

702
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,900
I'm already thirty-something years old.

703
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,900
I don't think I have a chance.

704
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,900
And who said I'd succeed?

705
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,900
You're so naive.

706
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,900
You and Jiayi, you two just need to live well.

707
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,900
Why are you having a baby?

708
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,900
Do you know where exactly are we going to?

709
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,900
Yeah.

710
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,900
Yeah.

711
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,900
The yellow one?

712
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,900
The sheet?

713
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,900
Here, here.

714
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,900
Here.

715
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,900
It's best if everyone can raise their kids, okay?

716
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,900
How much did you say to make a baby?

717
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,900
It's not a question of money.

718
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:17,900
It's a question of whether a person's mind is mature enough.

719
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,900
Do you know how this child will face society in the future?

720
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,900
How do you want me to tell everyone?

721
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,900
Do you really think the child is miserable because he was born with the same gender?

722
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,900
Then I ask you, is it more miserable because he was born with the same gender?

723
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,900
Or is it more miserable because he was born with the same gender?

724
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,900
What do you mean by that?

725
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,900
What do you mean?

726
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,900
Who's miserable?

727
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,900
I'm telling you, I'm miserable because I gave birth to you.

728
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,900
You're really miserable.

729
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,900
Everyone is miserable, okay?

730
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,900
Have you finished arguing?

731
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,900
Yes.

732
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,900
Hi, Mrs. Tan.

733
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,900
How are you doing today?

734
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,900
Okay, I'll get started.

735
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,900
So, Zuo Ru and Jia Yi came to us to start IVF procedures.

736
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,900
This might be helpful.

737
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,900
They have a lot of people who are interested in IVF.

738
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,900
They're interested in IVF.

739
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
They're interested in IVF.

740
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,900
They're interested in IVF.

741
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
They're interested in IVF.

742
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,900
They had a successful fertilization of an egg via in vitro techniques.

743
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,900
His egg...

744
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,900
His egg...

745
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,900
I'm so sorry, my Mandarin is not very good.

746
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,900
You can speak English. I understand.

747
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,900
Okay, thank you so much.

748
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,900
So, the next step in the procedure would have been to implant the viable embryo into Jia Yi's uterus.

749
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,900
And then?

750
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,900
The embryo is healthy.

751
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,900
So, it can be used for a long time.

752
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,900
So, the stage...

753
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,900
What is it?

754
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:30,900
So, the stage of procedures that they had reached, they had a viable embryo.

755
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,900
And we tested the embryo.

756
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,900
It was found to be of top quality, AA grade.

757
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,900
It was very healthy, very viable.

758
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,900
It's actually such a pity.

759
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,900
I'm very sorry for your loss.

760
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,900
So...

761
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,900
Mrs. Fan, you are the legal guardian of Zhuo Yi's embryo.

762
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,900
What does that mean?

763
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,900
Zhuo Yi's child is healthy, but the embryo is not.

764
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:12,900
Zhuo Yi's child is healthy, but the embryo is not.

765
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,900
So, you are the guardian of the child.

766
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,900
What child?

767
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,900
Where is the child?

768
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,900
This is just a embryo.

769
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,900
Yes, it's just a embryo.

770
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,900
This is not a child.

771
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,900
Who is going to give birth to this child?

772
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,900
Who is going to give birth to this child?

773
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,900
Let her speak.

774
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,900
So, there are some options going forward, but let me let you know.

775
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,900
What options?

776
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Both of them are dead now.

777
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,900
I know. I'm very sorry.

778
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,900
Who is going to give birth?

779
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,900
Who is going to be responsible for giving birth?

780
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,900
Calm down.

781
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,900
You can't find someone to give birth to.

782
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,900
Who is going to give birth?

783
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,900
So, you do have some options, Mrs. Fan, at this juncture.

784
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,900
You have four options, actually.

785
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,900
First, you could keep freezing the embryo.

786
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,900
Second, you could donate it.

787
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,900
No.

788
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,900
Third, you could...

789
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Donate?

790
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,900
Yes. I'll explain.

791
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,900
What do you mean donate?

792
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,900
I don't know.

793
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,900
I don't know who I'm donating my child to.

794
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,900
I...

795
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,900
I know. I know.

796
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,900
I really don't know what you're talking about.

797
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,900
What is going on?

798
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,900
Let her finish.

799
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,900
I'm so sorry. I'll explain more.

800
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,900
So, your third option would be to get a surrogate.

801
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,900
And lastly, termination.

802
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,900
Oh, no.

803
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,900
So, if you wanted to donate the embryo,

804
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,900
we would help you find a suitable couple to raise the child.

805
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,900
If you wanted to terminate it,

806
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,900
the agency would handle all of that.

807
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,900
And if you're interested in surrogacy,

808
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,900
I have some information here that might prove helpful.

809
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,900
I don't understand.

810
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,900
You mean to say that I should...

811
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,900
I should give my daughter...

812
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,900
I should give my daughter...

813
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,900
I should give her...

814
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,900
I'm so sorry.

815
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,900
I know this is all very confusing.

816
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,900
Dior's contract included one year of embryo storage.

817
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,900
You still have eight months left on that contract.

818
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,900
I don't know about this.

819
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,900
I never knew about this.

820
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,900
I don't know...

821
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
Maybe I'll just...

822
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,900
I understand that you're a resident of Taipei.

823
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,900
And perhaps it would be simplest

824
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,900
if you let us know what direction you'd want to go in,

825
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,900
and then we could get started on the relevant procedures.

826
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,900
I'm just going to go ahead and print out some more information.

827
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,900
I'll get you a drink. I'll be right back.

828
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,900
I'm sorry.

829
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,900
I never knew what I should do to that criminal.

830
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,900
I was too good to him.

831
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,900
And I couldn't get over him.

832
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,900
Actually, I don't like to live well.

833
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,900
I don't...

834
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,900
But after the wedding, I feel like...

835
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,900
I can finally serve someone else.

836
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:29,800
Even if a dead mother has a

837
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,900
But I'm living a very happy life.

838
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,900
I can finally leave this person.

839
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,900
And leave this strange, strange, what, embryo?

840
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,900
Yes, a embryo.

841
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,900
A strange, strange embryo.

842
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,900
Do you have a key?

843
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,900
Do you have a key? Or do you have a password?

844
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,900
This is a lockbox. You need a password.

845
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,900
You open it and there's a key inside.

846
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,900
If there's no key inside, you can't go in.

847
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,900
It's four digits.

848
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,900
Wait a minute.

849
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,900
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Okay, let's see.

850
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,900
Let's see. Poppers.

851
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,900
Okay, kiss the poppers.

852
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,900
What number?

853
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,900
Nine, eight, one.

854
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,900
One.

855
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,900
Two.

856
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,900
Okay.

857
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,900
I'm hungry.

858
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,900
I'm hungry.

859
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,900
My wallet was stolen. I'm trying to get home.

860
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,900
Can you spare a dollar, two dollars?

861
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,900
Like a quarter?

862
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,900
Yeah, my wallet was stolen. I'm trying to...

863
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,900
My wallet was stolen and I'm trying to get home.

864
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,900
And I have a baby coming. Can you please spare one dollar, two dollars?

865
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,900
Hey man, my wallet was stolen and I'm...

866
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,900
My wallet was stolen and I'm trying to get home.

867
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,900
Can you spare ten dollars?

868
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,900
Okay.

869
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,900
Do you know that woman at the door just now is a liar?

870
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,900
I know.

871
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,900
So?

872
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,900
So you still want to give her money?

873
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,900
She asked for ten dollars.

874
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,900
She said I only had two.

875
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,900
Do you want it?

876
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,900
Yes, sure.

877
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,900
What can I do with two dollars now?

878
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,900
You can't do anything?

879
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,900
Then you still want to give her money?

880
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,900
I like...

881
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,900
the feeling of her lying to me.

882
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,900
I like the feeling of being lied to.

883
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,900
It's just...

884
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,900
It's the best if she's been lied to the whole time.

885
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,900
I'm sorry.

886
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,900
I'm sorry.

887
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,900
I'm sorry.

888
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,900
Carrie, you gotta eat.

889
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,900
It's cold. I don't want to eat.

890
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,900
You're the one who's hungry.

891
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,900
You're the one who doesn't want to eat.

892
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,900
I don't know what you want.

893
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,900
Don't touch these things.

894
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,900
You're the one who's supposed to face them.

895
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,900
You're the one who's supposed to face them, right?

896
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,900
K.Y.

897
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,900
Okay, then you go live in a hotel.

898
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,900
You can come back and clean up during the day.

899
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,900
No, I don't want to clean up these things right now.

900
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,900
You're too busy to think about how to deal with it.

901
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,900
These are the things you have to think about.

902
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,900
You have to give us a way.

903
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,900
You know, I'm ready to help.

904
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,900
You'll have to do the paperwork.

905
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,900
What's wrong?

906
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,900
I'm sorry.

907
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,900
Mom?

908
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,900
Huh?

909
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,900
Can you change your angle?

910
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,900
Okay, relax.

911
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,900
Take a deep breath.

912
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
Okay, relax.

913
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,900
Take a deep breath.

914
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,900
Mom, look at this.

915
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,900
This is Zuo's softwrap.

916
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,900
He's a little older now.

917
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,900
So he might not have as much softwrap as he used to.

918
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,900
He might not be as good as a 20-year-old young man.

919
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
Yeah, he's a little older.

920
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,900
So he's not really suitable for having kids.

921
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,900
Right?

922
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,900
Mom?

923
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,900
Yeah?

924
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,900
I told you.

925
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,900
What?

926
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,900
What?

927
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,900
I told you.

928
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,900
I've decided.

929
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:36,360
I've decided to destroy the

930
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,860
I've decided.

931
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,860
I'm going to kill him.

932
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,860
I'm going to kill him.

933
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,860
I'm going to kill him.

934
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,860
I'm going to kill him.

935
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,860
I'm going to kill him.

936
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,860
I'm going to kill him.

937
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,860
I'm going to kill him.

938
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,860
I'm going to kill him.

939
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,860
I'm going to kill him.

940
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,860
I'm going to kill him.

941
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,860
I'm going to kill him.

942
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,860
I'm going to kill him.

943
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,860
I'm going to kill him.

944
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,860
I'm going to kill him.

945
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,820
If it were you,

946
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,820
how would you handle that bag?

947
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,820
I'll give birth to it.

948
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,820
No doubts.

949
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,820
I gave birth to you and Zuer.

950
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,820
But I...

951
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,820
I didn't keep any of them.

952
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,820
Why are you telling me this?

953
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,820
Who else should I tell?

954
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,820
Tell your mom.

955
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,780
Tell her?

956
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,780
It's like I didn't tell her.

957
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,780
Yeah, that's the whole point.

958
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,780
She has dementia, right?

959
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,780
It's a waste to tell her.

960
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,780
I'm going to kill him.

961
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,780
I'm going to kill him.

962
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,780
I'm going to kill him.

963
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,780
I'm going to kill him.

964
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,780
I'm going to kill him.

965
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,780
I'm going to kill him.

966
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,780
I'm going to kill him.

967
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,780
I'm going to kill him.

968
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,780
I'm going to kill him.

969
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,780
I'm going to kill him.

970
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,780
I'm going to kill him.

971
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,780
I'm going to kill him.

972
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,780
I'm going to kill him.

973
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,780
I'm going to kill him.

974
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,780
I'm going to kill him.

975
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,780
Like a mom.

976
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,780
Like a mom.

977
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,780
What are these socks for?

978
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,780
To wash clothes and sew clothes.

979
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,780
No one recognized the socks and hung them here.

980
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,780
Maybe they haven't been found yet.

981
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,780
Oh, ah!

982
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:57,780
You can read.

983
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,780
And you can win.

984
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:08,780
Oh, New York, you broke my heart.

985
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,780
Can you read it?

986
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,780
What did you write yesterday?

987
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:17,780
What?

988
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:19,780
What?

989
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,780
Did it really happen if I can't remember it?

990
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,780
Is it possible?

991
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,780
That person is so weird. He won't write there.

992
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,780
You know I'm different to you two, right?

993
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,780
Of course I'm different.

994
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,780
You're my only mother.

995
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,780
But you have two daughters.

996
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:46,780
I don't want to talk about it.

997
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,780
Actually, I have my own reasons.

998
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,780
I'm not a good mother.

999
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,780
I'm not a good mother.

1000
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,780
I'm not a good mother.

1001
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,780
Actually, I have my reasons.

1002
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,780
He's always been living so far away.

1003
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:07,780
You were born in my womb.

1004
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:08,780
You've been following me.

1005
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,780
That's why I...

1006
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:14,780
That's why I nag you so much.

1007
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,780
I want to know everything about you.

1008
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,780
But...

1009
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,780
I never wanted to know about him.

1010
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,780
I didn't know either.

1011
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,780
I didn't know.

1012
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,780
I was worried...

1013
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,780
if you had money...

1014
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,780
if someone took care of you...

1015
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,780
what would you do when you get old?

1016
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,780
But Emma and I...

1017
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,780
it seems like we have a relationship.

1018
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,780
It seems like we have nothing to do with each other.

1019
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:03,780
Fan Zuer.

1020
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,780
Fan Zuer, do you have to let me talk to you like this?

1021
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:07,780
You're talking so blankly.

1022
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:10,780
Fan Zuer.

1023
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,780
You're so annoying.

1024
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,780
You talk too much.

1025
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,780
Your mouth is dry.

1026
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,780
Choose one.

1027
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,780
My heart.

1028
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:30,780
Yeah?

1029
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,780
You broke my heart.

1030
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:57,780
I'm sorry.

1031
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,780
I'm sorry.

1032
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,780
I almost forgot.

1033
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,780
I'm sorry.

1034
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:11,780
I'm sorry.

1035
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,780
I'm sorry.

1036
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:20,780
I'm sorry.

1037
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,780
I'm sorry.

1038
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,780
I had dinner with Zuo and Zuo-er.

1039
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:32,580
Wang Li-fen's daughter came too.

1040
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,780
They kept praising Zuo-er for her cookies.

1041
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,780
I said, really?

1042
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,780
But Zuo-er really made me a lot of cookies.

1043
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,280
They were really delicious.

1044
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,080
There are only two left.

1045
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,080
Zuo-er made them himself.

1046
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,780
You can keep them.

1047
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,280
Zuo-er.

1048
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,280
Zuo-er.

1049
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,280
Come in, come in.

1050
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,280
It hurts.

1051
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,280
Hi, Jiang Kai.

1052
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,280
Hi, Auntie.

1053
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,780
Come in, come in.

1054
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,280
Wait a minute.

1055
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,280
Would you like to sit down?

1056
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,280
Do you need to take off your shoes?

1057
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,280
No, no, no.

1058
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:09,780
Okay.

1059
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:11,280
I haven't packed my things yet.

1060
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,280
I'm not sure what they are.

1061
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:19,280
Which ones are Zuo-er's and which ones are yours?

1062
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,280
This one is Zuo-er's.

1063
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,780
Is it yours?

1064
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,280
Let me see.

1065
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,780
I think so.

1066
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:37,280
I don't know if it's his red or hers.

1067
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:40,280
I'll give you this box first, okay?

1068
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,280
Okay.

1069
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,280
And the other ones...

1070
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,280
I'll give you the ones back in Taipei, okay?

1071
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,280
Okay.

1072
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,280
Auntie, are you okay?

1073
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,280
I'm sorry.

1074
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,780
I haven't been able to contact you since you came.

1075
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,780
It's okay.

1076
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,780
My mom didn't come.

1077
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,280
I came with my dad.

1078
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,780
Your mom didn't come?

1079
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,780
Yes, she's not feeling well.

1080
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:15,780
Have you done with the hospital's work?

1081
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,780
Is there anything I can help with?

1082
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,780
My big sister...

1083
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:26,280
My mom's time is up.

1084
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,280
My dad wants to take my big sister home.

1085
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,280
When? Tell me.

1086
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,780
I can come.

1087
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,280
Auntie...

1088
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,780
Be careful.

1089
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,280
My dad's condition...

1090
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,780
It's better for him to be alone.

1091
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,280
Yes.

1092
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,280
Then...

1093
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,780
Please tell your dad...

1094
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:01,780
I'm really sorry about this.

1095
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:03,780
We...

1096
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,780
We're really sorry.

1097
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:13,780
When I go back to Taipei, I'll find time to visit them.

1098
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:15,780
Don't say that.

1099
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,280
Tell them that Zuo and my big sister...

1100
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,280
This is all an accident.

1101
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,780
You have to take care of your health.

1102
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:26,280
They'll also hope that we'll be fine.

1103
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,280
Okay, I'll tell them.

1104
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,280
I'll be at the nurse's office. Please help me.

1105
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,280
Yes. Thank you.

1106
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,280
I finally calmed down.

1107
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,280
What are you doing?

1108
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,280
What are you looking for?

1109
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,280
I'm looking for the nurse.

1110
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,280
What for?

1111
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,280
To put her down.

1112
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,280
Or you can keep moving.

1113
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:09,280
But isn't it a good idea to keep moving at your age?

1114
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,280
Okay, you finally remember my age.

1115
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,280
I'm sorry. Please find the nurse.

1116
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,280
What for?

1117
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,280
It's Zuo's child.

1118
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,280
That's not a child.

1119
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,280
Child? No!

1120
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,280
Again?

1121
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,280
Did you really think that way? Isn't that Zuo's child?

1122
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,280
Come on.

1123
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,280
It's good for her and the child.

1124
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,280
My responsibility is to take your grandma away one day.

1125
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:43,280
I want to live a quiet life.

1126
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,280
Don't just think about your own quiet life.

1127
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,280
Look at Zuo's family.

1128
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,280
They worked so hard to get a child.

1129
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,280
They've had so many pills.

1130
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,280
They found them.

1131
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,280
What do you want me to do?

1132
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,280
What do you want me to do?

1133
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,280
Put her down.

1134
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,280
What?

1135
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,280
Let's take her down.

1136
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,280
What?

1137
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,280
Zuo's child.

1138
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,280
Do I have to take another child?

1139
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,280
I'm telling you.

1140
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,280
I might have to take care of the child when he's less than 10.

1141
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,280
What do I do?

1142
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,280
And then I...

1143
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,280
Who will raise him?

1144
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,280
You? Or should we send him to the orphanage?

1145
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,280
I think he's being sent away.

1146
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,280
But I'm not well yet.

1147
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,280
Right?

1148
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,280
I'm warning you.

1149
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,280
I'm on the verge of collapse.

1150
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,280
Please be more careful.

1151
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,280
I just want to say that life has its own path.

1152
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,280
I'm sorry. I won't take that path.

1153
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:52,280
Okay. What if Zuo comes back and gives birth?

1154
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,280
Yeah.

1155
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,280
Oh my god.

1156
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,280
Turns out Zuo is scared of you.

1157
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,280
You're talking nonsense.

1158
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,280
You know what?

1159
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,280
I thought you were a little bit of a mother.

1160
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,280
Because Grandma told me that you were pregnant...

1161
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,280
when you were trying to get pregnant.

1162
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,280
Yeah. Well, maybe I'm wrong.

1163
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,280
You're talking about love.

1164
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,280
No.

1165
01:16:33,280 --> 01:17:01,280
No.

1166
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,280
No.

1167
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:28,280
Yeah.

1168
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,280
Yeah.

1169
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,280
Yeah.

1170
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,280
That's all.

1171
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,280
Right?

1172
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:42,280
It doesn't mean anything. Right?

1173
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,280
Hey.

1174
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,280
White遊ând and I went to la la.

1175
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,280
After.

1176
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,280
When did you get that?

1177
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:16,280
I just found out I was dead.

1178
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,280
We were still alive.

1179
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,280
My real name was Yang Li.

1180
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,280
I'm the father of Zuo when I was convenient.

1181
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,280
Oh my god.

1182
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,280
Why does she have this lot?

1183
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,280
Mom!

1184
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,280
You know, I'm so unhappy every day.

1185
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,280
But this unhappiness is yours.

1186
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,280
My soul is happy.

1187
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,280
You know the feeling of separation?

1188
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,280
It's so scary.

1189
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,280
But congratulations.

1190
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,280
I've got four gold coins in seven boxes.

1191
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,280
Now I'll wait for them to be sent.

1192
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,280
I'm going to the airport.

1193
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,280

01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,280

I'm going to the airport.

1269
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,280
I'm going to the airport.

1270
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,280
I'm going to the airport.

1271
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,280
I'm going to the airport.

1272
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,280
My name is Jin Ai Xia.

1273
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:18,280
I'm 64 years old.

1274
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,280
I'm a stalker.

1275
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:29,280
I have a very healthy child.

1276
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:34,280
Not my own child, but my daughter's.

1277
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:39,280
My daughter's name is Fan Zu'er.

1278
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,280
She's a very cute girl.

1279
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:51,280
Her lover, Zhou Jiayi, is also a very cute girl.

1280
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:56,280
They decided to have a child.

1281
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,280
I'm actually very opposed to it.

1282
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:06,280
But they love each other very much.

1283
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,280
So...

1284
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:17,280
I don't think my father is a very good mother.

1285
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,280
Fan Zu'er is always against me.

1286
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:27,280
Maybe I'm not a very good daughter.

1287
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,280
When I was young, I was always against my mother.

1288
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:35,280
My mother is now a pregnant woman.

1289
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:42,280
When I was young, I also had a child.

1290
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:51,280
In New York, I gave it to a teacher at a sugar-coated restaurant.

1291
01:24:51,280 --> 01:25:00,280
When I returned to Taiwan, I got married again and gave birth to Fan Zu'er.

1292
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:05,280
I was very happy.

1293
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:12,280
I got married again and gave birth to Fan Zu'er.

1294
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:17,280
I got divorced when I was over 40.

1295
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:24,280
I'm a very failed person.

1296
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:32,280
Now that Fan Zu'er is dead, I have a very healthy child.

1297
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:41,280
I want to find a pregnant mother.

1298
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:46,280
My condition is that she must be very healthy.

1299
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:51,280
She must not smoke or drink.

1300
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,280
She must not take medicine.

1301
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:02,280
I hope I can find a pregnant mother.

1302
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:19,280
Don't look at me like that.

1303
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:24,280
I think I can live for another 20 years.

1304
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:28,280
Maybe even shorter.

1305
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:35,280
Even if I want to have another child, I will always fall.

1306
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:41,280
Fan Zu'er is too good at being a mother.

1307
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:53,280
Have you ever thought about me?

1308
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,280
You never thought about me.

1309
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,280
You always tell me to do what I want to do.

1310
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:02,280
I have to do what you want to do.

1311
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:07,280
Have you ever thought that I would be tired?

1312
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:14,280
I'm really tired.

1313
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:25,280
You broke my heart.

1314
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,280
Yeah?

1315
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:32,280
You broke my heart.

1316
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,280
I'm sorry.

1317
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:18,280
Mrs Fan, before we continue, I want to double-check that you've fully read and understood all the terms.

1318
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,280
Okay, let's start.

1319
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:27,280
So I'll need you to initial here and here.

1320
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,280
This initial?

1321
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,280
So...

1322
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:35,280
One more over there.

1323
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,280
Let me see.

1324
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,280
It's too far.

1325
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,280
I'm busy in Taiwan, so...

1326
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:03,280
I'll just live like this.

1327
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:11,280
These years, Emma and I have become closer.

1328
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,280
Maybe we're old.

1329
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:19,280
I like to be with my family.

1330
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,280
What did Emma call you?

1331
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,280
She called me Johnny.

1332
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,280
She didn't call you dad?

1333
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,280
Emma's parents were very nice to her.

1334
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:37,280
When Emma was 12, they officially told her that I was her biological father.

1335
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,280
Actually, Emma knew it a long time ago.

1336
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,280
When she was a kid, she thought she knew nothing.

1337
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,280
She didn't know how to talk.

1338
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:50,280
That year, the first winter was just beginning.

1339
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:53,280
She didn't know how everyone would eat together.

1340
01:29:53,280 --> 01:30:01,280
Anyway, Emma's parents took Emma, and me and your mom, to eat together.

1341
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:07,280
Before the game started, your mom and I had a fight.

1342
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,280
Then, Emma was taken home.

1343
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,280
I never knew about this.

1344
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,280
That's what your mom is like.

1345
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:24,280
Morrison, come back. I'm going to tell you something.

1346
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:28,280
We're going to have dinner with Johnny and this really nice little lady.

1347
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,280
So you have to be a good boy.

1348
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,280
Okay, go get me...

1349
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,280
You want wine?

1350
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:36,280
Let's go.

1351
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,280
I think I put it over here somewhere.

1352
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,280
I got some candy.

1353
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,280
You got candy? Can I have some?

1354
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:50,280
This is the lady I was telling you about. Her name is Olivia.

1355
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,280
Hi, Olivia.

1356
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,280
Hi. What's your name?

1357
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,280
Carson.

1358
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,280
Carson, can you speak Chinese?

1359
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,280
Yes.

1360
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,280
You can speak Chinese?

1361
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,280
Oh, Chinese and English are both good.

1362
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,280
Yes.

1363
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,280
You speak Chinese at home?

1364
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,280
Yes.

1365
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,280
Your mom taught you?

1366
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,280
I taught her too.

1367
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,280
How old is Carson?

1368
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,280
Almost six.

1369
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,280
Wow, so smart.

1370
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,280
Do you want to show Johnny how to play Mario?

1371
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,280
All right.

1372
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,280
Come.

1373
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,280
Are you okay?

1374
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:36,280
I'm sorry. I was out of town and I couldn't get any connections.

1375
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,280
It's okay.

1376
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,280
It's okay.

1377
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:46,280
It's so nice to have dinner with the four of us.

1378
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,280
I'm so happy.

1379
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:52,280
Xiao Ai, are you happy?

1380
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,280
Let's eat.

1381
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,280
You ordered too much.

1382
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,280
It's okay. You can pack it up.

1383
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,280
Sure.

1384
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,280
She loves this.

1385
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,280
You want some too?

1386
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,280
Yes.

1387
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,280
Okay. Thank you.

1388
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,280
Have one too.

1389
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,280
You can remember this for yourself.

1390
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,280
Thank you.

1391
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,280
You can make a taco with this.

1392
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,280
Yeah.

1393
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,280
Onion.

1394
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,280
Banana.

1395
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,280
With the bun on the bun.

1396
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,280
Okay.

1397
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:50,280
Thank you.

1398
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:00,280
This is like when I get really busy, there's like a little breather.

1399
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,280
Carson is so cute.

1400
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,280
Yeah, he's five.

1401
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,280
And...

1402
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,280
And...

1403
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,280
I never got a chance to tell you but...

1404
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,280
Six years ago...

1405
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,280
It was the year I took my mother-in-law home.

1406
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,280
The year you broke your leg.

1407
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,280
I was pregnant.

1408
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,280
Oh.

1409
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,280
I don't know.

1410
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,280
I don't think I've ever told you.

1411
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,280
So you said you had stomachache?

1412
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,280
Yeah.

1413
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,280
Yeah.

1414
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,280
I'm single.

1415
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:52,280
And then when my parents retired, they helped me take care of Carson.

1416
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,280
It's so strange.

1417
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,280
I never had the chance to tell you.

1418
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,280
I'm sorry.

1419
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,280
You believe it?

1420
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,280
Um...

1421
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:19,280
I don't know what I should say to make you feel better.

1422
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,280
It's...

1423
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,280
It's okay.

1424
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,280
I'm sorry.

1425
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,280
Because I thought I could help you with something.

1426
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:34,280
Because Johnny said you wanted to be alone, so I didn't want to bother you.

1427
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,280
Yeah, yeah.

1428
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:39,280
I feel more comfortable being alone.

1429
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,280
Yeah, I get you.

1430
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,280
Mm-hmm.

1431
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,280
Okay.

1432
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,280
Oh, don't worry about me.

1433
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,280
If any time you want anything from here,

1434
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,280
you can tell me. I can ship it to you.

1435
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,280
Mm.

1436
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,280
No, no, no.

1437
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,280
No trouble.

1438
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,280
Okay.

1439
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,280
Okay.

1440
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,280
Yeah. Okay.

1441
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,280
Okay. All right.

1442
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,280
All right.

1443
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,280
Okay.

1444
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,280
I know this may sound really awkward,

1445
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,280
but there's always one thing that I want to know.

1446
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,280
And...

1447
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,280
But it was...

1448
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,280
It's just...

1449
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,280
All I knew was that it was Popo that sent me to the foster parents,

1450
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:08,280
and it's all about Popo.

1451
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,280
So...

1452
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:15,280
What were you thinking when you took me away?

1453
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,280
Um...

1454
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:36,280
Well...

1455
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,280
Emma...

1456
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,280
I was only 16, you know.

1457
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,280
Mm...

1458
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,280
You know how she is.

1459
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:06,280
And...

1460
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,280
I...

1461
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,280
I just...

1462
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,280
I...

1463
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,280
I...

1464
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,280
I didn't know that.

1465
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,280
I just...

1466
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,280
You know, I didn't know that.

1467
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,280
I was just, you know,

1468
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,280
that young girl.

1469
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,280
I didn't know that.

1470
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,280
And she was...

1471
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:30,280
I didn't know that.

1472
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,280
And she was...

1473
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,280
She was...

1474
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:41,280
I thought of the best way.

1475
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,280
He didn't do it for himself.

1476
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:52,280
He did it for me, for his daughter.

1477
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,280
And for you.

1478
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:59,280
So I thought of the best way.

1479
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:05,280
What were you thinking when you gave me away?

1480
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:15,280
I was thinking...

1481
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:34,280
I don't want to work in Taren Street forever.

1482
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,280
I don't want to live a hard life.

1483
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:41,280
I don't want to live a hard life with my children.

1484
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,280
I want to continue...

1485
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,280
continue to study.

1486
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,280
I think...

1487
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:55,280
life could be better.

1488
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:59,280
So I gave you away.

1489
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,280
That moment.

1490
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:07,280
I think I will never see you again.

1491
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,280
Okay. Yeah.

1492
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,280
I'm sorry.

1493
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:32,280
It's okay.

1494
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:35,280
Thank you for giving me a chance.

1495
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,280
Yeah.

1496
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,280
Please take care.

1497
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,280
Yeah, take care.

1498
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,280
Oh, God.

1499
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:28,280
Thank you.

1500
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,280
I'm sorry.

1501
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,280
Okay.

1502
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,280
Oh.

1503
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,280
Grandma will be there.

1504
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,280
She will be waiting for you.

1505
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,280
Let's go home together.

1506
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:58,280
No.

1507
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:28,280
No.

1508
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,280
No.

1509
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,280
No.

1510
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,280
No.

1511
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,280
No.

1512
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,280
No.

1513
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,280
No.

1514
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,280
Please take off all of your jackets.

1515
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,280
Make sure everything's out of your pockets, sir.

1516
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,280
Laptops, things on the other page.

1517
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,280
No hands, no cards.

1518
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:49,280
Everything out of your pockets.

1519
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:51,280
Anything moving.

1520
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,280
Pass off.

1521
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,280
Laptops out.

1522
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,280
Jackets, hats, scarves off.

1523
01:46:57,280 --> 01:46:59,280
Please give me your things.

1524
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:04,280
Jackets, bags, things up here.

1525
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,280
Just give me another tray.

1526
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,280
Thank you.

1527
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,280
Tray up here, please, ma'am.

1528
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,280
Jackets up.

1529
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,280
Anything in your pockets, ma'am?

1530
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,280
Sir, go forward.

1531
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:24,280
Please.

1532
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,280
No way on food.

1533
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,280
Jackets up.

1534
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:30,280
Suitcases up here, too, please.

1535
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:32,280
Nothing in your pockets, ma'am?

1536
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:34,280
Thank you.

1537
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:36,280
Please, please, please, please.

1538
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,280
Get that for you, ma'am.

1539
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:40,280
Excellent.

1540
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:42,280
Good.

1541
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,280
That as well, too, ma'am.

1542
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:46,280
No.

1543
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:48,280
Yeah.

1544
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:50,280
Terribly sorry for your loss, ma'am.

1545
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:52,280
What?

1546
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:54,280
Can I carry through?

1547
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:56,280
This is my daughter.

1548
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:58,280
I understand, but it's part of protocol.

1549
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,280
Please.

1550
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:02,280
Thank you.

1551
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:08,280
Okay.

1552
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:10,280
You may go.

1553
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:22,280
Thank you.

1554
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,280
The beginning of life is the end.

1555
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,280
You're at this point already.

1556
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:56,280
Even Einstein wouldn't dare to say you're dead.

1557
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,280
You'd be dead.

1558
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:22,280
Okay.

1559
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,280
One, two, two, three.

1560
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:54,280
One, two, three.

1561
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:56,280
One, two, three.

1562
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:58,280
One, two, three.

1563
01:49:58,280 --> 01:50:00,280
One, two, three.

1564
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:02,280
One, two, three.

1565
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:04,280
One, two, three.

1566
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,280
One, two, three.

1567
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:08,280
One, two, three.

1568
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,280
One, two, three.

1569
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,280
One, two, three.

1570
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,280
One, two, three.

1571
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:16,280
One, two, three.

1572
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:18,280
One, two, three.

1573
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:20,280
I thought...

1574
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,280
I thought I wouldn't have to learn

1575
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:24,280
at this age.

1576
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,280
You live and learn,

1577
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,280
but you have to learn everything.

1578
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,280
I wouldn't have become like this.

1579
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,280
Me too.

1580
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:34,280
Who's going to suffer?

1581
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,280
You can't leave us.

1582
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:44,280
You have to accept it.

1583
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:46,280
I will.

1584
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,280
When you were young, I didn't love you like this.

1585
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:18,280
Thank you.

1586
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:36,280
Take your time.

1587
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,280
Hi.

1588
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:40,280
Hi.

1589
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:42,280
Thank you.

1590
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,280
Thank you.

1591
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:02,280
Bye-bye.

1592
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,280
The weather is great.

1593
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:20,280
Okay?

1594
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:26,280
Do you smell something?

1595
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,280
What's that smell?

1596
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,280
It smells like

1597
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,280
sulfur or something.

1598
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,280
Let me see your window.

1599
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,280
Do you want to get some air?

1600
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,280
No, don't open the window.

1601
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:42,280
What's that smell?

1602
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,280
It's sulfur.

1603
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:58,280
Xiao-an.

1604
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,280
Let me tell you.

1605
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:04,280
I've been telling you

1606
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,280
that you can't

1607
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:08,280
have kids at this age.

1608
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,280
Listen to me.

1609
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:12,280
Okay?

1610
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:14,280
This is very important.

1611
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:16,280
Because...

1612
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,280
I don't have

1613
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:20,280
anyone else here.

1614
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,280
I've already

1615
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,280
found someone

1616
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:26,280
to adopt the kids.

1617
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,280
They are my

1618
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,280
good friends.

1619
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:32,280
They run a restaurant, but they don't have

1620
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:34,280
their own kids.

1621
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:36,280
So, Mom,

1622
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:38,280
it's a very good idea, right?

1623
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,280
Do you want to go back to New York

1624
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,280
for New Year's?

1625
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:44,280
I'm not going.

1626
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:46,280
Listen to me.

1627
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:48,280
Don't worry.

1628
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,280
I've made the arrangements.

1629
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,280
Wait for Emma in New York.

1630
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,280
Sit properly.

1631
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:00,280
I'll stop in front.

1632
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:14,280
Be careful.

1633
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:38,280
Baby.

1634
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,280
Come, baby.

1635
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:42,280
Come, baby.

1636
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:44,280
Let's go and change.

1637
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,280
No, okay?

1638
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:48,280
Let's go and change.

1639
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:50,280
No.

1640
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,280
Come.

1641
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:54,280
Come, baby.

1642
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:56,280
Wow.

1643
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:58,280
Okay?

1644
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:00,280
Come.

1645
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:02,280
Let's go.

1646
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:08,280
It's cold.

1647
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:12,280
It's cold.

1648
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,280
Come.

1649
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:28,280
Come.

1650
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,280
Come.

1651
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:32,280
Come.

1652
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:34,280
Come.

1653
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:36,280
Come.

1654
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:38,280
Come.

1655
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:40,280
Come.

1656
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:10,280
Come.

1657
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,280
Come.

1658
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:42,280
Come.

1659
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:44,280
Come.

1660
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,280
Come.

1661
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:48,280
Come.

1662
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:50,280
Come.

1663
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:52,280
Come.

1664
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:54,280
Come.

1665
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:56,280
Come.

1666
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:58,280
Come.

1667
01:56:58,280 --> 01:57:00,280
Come.

1668
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:02,280
Come.

1669
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,280
Come.

1670
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:06,280
Come.

1671
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:08,280
Come.

1672
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,280
