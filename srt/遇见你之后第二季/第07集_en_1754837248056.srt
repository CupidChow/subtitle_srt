Timing and Subtitles by the Somewhere over the Rainbow ðŸŒˆ Team @ Viki

2
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,910
I'm sorry to say this, but that is the validity of the Lazulata.

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,650
Everyone, work hard!

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,860
And earn a lot of money!

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,340
And get... the Probe surgery.

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,450
Then you will eternally be in the world of colors.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,770
Thank you.

8
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,460
Have you come to your senses?

9
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,100
Where are we?

10
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,930
This is our dormitory.

11
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,330
Are you okay?

12
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:31,660
Yeah. I never imagined I would see my sister like that.

13
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,060
It was so fascinating that I couldn't stop looking.

14
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,700
My sister in color looked fascinating and unfamiliar.

15
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,950
But how can there be no blankets or pillows here?

16
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,050
Don't you think today was a series of surprises?

17
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,830
Yeah. It was an "additional but optional" experience for me.

18
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,150
- This was your first color rush, right?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,070
- De-coloring, too?
- Obviously.

20
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,230
It's hard to be just fine after experiencing both of them. You're amazing.

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
How cute.

22
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,800
Let's hurry and sleep.

23
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,060
We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,190
We have to sleep early.

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,730
â™«  I look away after staring at you  â™«

26
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,420
â™«  When our eyes meet  â™«

27
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,270
Se Hyun, look at me.

28
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,910
â™«  I know you're mine  â™«

29
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,630
â™«  I guess it's too late to pretend that I didn't know  â™«

30
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,610
Strangely, I feel reassured when I look at you.

31
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,870
Why?

32
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,290
You're suffering because you followed me.

33
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,830
He's being cute again.

34
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,860
I came here for my revenge, too.

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,360
Thanks anyway.

36
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,860
Can I look at you until I fall asleep?

37
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,610
I have trouble sleeping in an unfamiliar place.

38
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,510
I want to sleep as I look at you, the person with whom I'm most familiar.

39
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,170
Just look at me for a short time. You're going to wear out my face.

40
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,090
Okay. Just for a short while.

41
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,200
Then, can I look at you for a little longer?

42
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,650
Yes.

43
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,120
â™«  ...and try to touch up my tangled hair  â™«

44
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,160
You've asked me before...

45
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,660
You're... a Mono?

46
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,090
â™«  I'm worried that you will get lost like me  â™«

47
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,450
How...

48
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,800
did you endure that pain... without showing any of it?

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,660
In the past, I just endured it.

50
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,220
But at some point, I saw you standing in that darkness.

51
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,720
And you shined a light.

52
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,870
A warm and comfortable light that shined softly.

53
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,230
Since then, I wanted to protect you.

54
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:57,650
â™«  What should I really do? Even in the passing wind   â™«

55
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,970
Ah, this food...

56
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,120
What? They even mixed in red pepper paste.

57
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,470
Wow, it's so delicious. Hurry up and try.

58
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,620
What's wrong? Are you okay?

59
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,390
Yeah, I'm okay.

60
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,880
It's a side effect you can experience after de-coloring.

61
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,260
I'm going to get some fresh air.

62
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,760
Let's go together.

63
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,960
If you do, I'm going to be mad. Hurry up and eat. You can't catch a cold.

64
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,870
Come back soon.

65
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,890
Hi.

66
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,750
Hello.

67
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,370
Does your head hurt?

68
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,790
Yes, but I don't know why.

69
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,510
Monos who had a Probe experience headaches as a side effect of an

70
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,850
artificial color rush because they experienced the real one before.

71
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,920
I see.

72
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,930
I had a Probe, too.

73
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,410
Ever since I came here,

74
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,280
I keep wondering every day if that person

75
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,490
is alive or dead.

76
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,790
That person took medicine daily because of their severe depression.

77
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,850
It wasn't normal.

78
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,530
That person could die at any moment.

79
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,390
Surely, they didn't die, right?

80
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,880
Yes.

81
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,960
If your Probe dies, your heart hurts like it's being torn apart.

82
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,740
That's how the Mono and Probe are connected.

83
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,260
Do you feel that way now, Soo Yeon?

84
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,490
No. I think I'm okay.

85
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,360
Then rest assured.

86
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,820
Your Probe is definitely not dead.

87
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,640
But the fact is, they left me.

88
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,020
They told me I was being too obsessive... and to please get lost.

89
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,250
That's why I came here. To get the Probe surgery.

90
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,280
Probe surgery?

91
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,820
Then I won't obsess over that person anymore.

92
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,020
Then I won't have the urge to kill them.

93
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,360
- But still, Probe surgeryâ”€
- I will get it.

94
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,900
You don't know the sadness of losing your Probe.

95
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,260
Is it true...

96
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,070
that your heart feels like it's being torn apart when you're separated from your Probe?

97
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,670
No. It just came to my mind right now.

98
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,630
I was taken aback for no reason.

99
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,250
But...

100
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,370
I did wonder if it really felt like that.

101
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,920
I had a feeling that Go Yoo Han was close to me.

102
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,090
But let's say Go Yoo Han died...

103
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,300
I, too,

104
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,500
don't think it will just end with my heart being torn apart.

105
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,390
Then... it's true.

106
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,700
I mean, wouldn't itâ”€

107
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,390
Why are you making it so complicated?

108
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,130
It's just true.

109
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:11,030
â™«   I'm also afraid of the unfamiliar me  â™«

110
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,470
â™«   I love someone but it's not you â™«

111
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,630
I feel like that, too.

112
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,320
I feel like you and I are connected, too.

113
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,890
If something happens to you, I won't be able to endure it.

114
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,830
It would be better if something happened to me instead.

115
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,070
â™«   ...to hurt you  â™«

116
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,460
â™«   Because I cherish you more than anyone  â™«

117
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,830
â™«   I know how you feel, but my heart  â™«

118
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,760
1428. Work harder.

119
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,920
What does that mean?

120
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,990
It means she tried to scold you, but she gave you a chance because you're handsome.

121
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,400
Wow. How much areâ”€

122
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,360
weâ”€

123
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,300
Hey, hurry it up. Are you crafting something?

124
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,710
Seriously.

125
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,630
Hold on a bit.

126
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,660
Isn't everything supposed to be a scam? The report also said it was.

127
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,390
That's right...

128
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,900
But the Lapis lazuli tea, the Nerve Candy,

129
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,470
and even the Lazulata exist.

130
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,680
That's right.

131
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,560
Then, what exactly did we see?

132
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,330
Optical illusion?

133
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,830
No. It was definitely a color rush,

134
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,930
since we experienced de-coloring, too.

135
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,490
My aunt was wrong. Lapis lazuli is real.

136
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,190
There's one thing I'm sure of.

137
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,700
What is that?

138
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,720
Let's say we were tricked by something else for everything.

139
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,260
But you can't fake the Probe surgery.

140
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,000
You either become a Mono that can actually see colors...

141
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,930
or you die. It's one or the other.

142
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,730
Also, they are... definitely lying about your younger sister.

143
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:57,660
Moon Soo Yeon, the best employee for the fourth quarter, will be getting the Probe surgery tonight.

144
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:03,900
Please give her a round of applause as a show of encouragement that the surgery will be successful. Give her a hand.

145
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,730
Where could it be?

146
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,730
Operating room?

147
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,730
There was no operating room here. Only an infirmary.

148
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,990
Then...

149
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,400
Earlier, I saw a sign that said "Dr. Gupta Lab."

150
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,880
That place seems suspicious.

151
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,840
That's the place. They do Probe surgery there.

152
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,340
Let's go. We'll know when we get there.

153
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,930
Let's go together.

154
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,760
I really need to succeed in this surgery.

155
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,030
Yes. I'll raise it to 350 watts this time.

156
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,490
Do you think it'll work?

157
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,890
Leave.

158
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,870
I need to witness the surgery with my own eyes.

159
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,610
Do you really believe this will work?

160
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,330
She's the 37th person. That quack, Dr. Gupta, is just killing people!

161
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:27,040
It will definitely work. And when it does, it's only a matter of time before we'll be sitting on a pile of money. You know that, don't you?

162
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,240
Honey, please wake up!

163
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,930
The money we spent on this is already a billion won (a million dollars)!

164
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,610
Whether it's one billion or ten billion, please just succeed, Dr. Gupta!

165
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,990
Show us the skill that we saw in India!

166
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,640
Here you go again.

167
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,110
I told you who knows how many times that Gupta scammed us then, but you still won't believe me.

168
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,820
A conman is being conned by another conman. Why can't you see that?

169
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,430
- That's not a surgery.
- This is so frustrating, I'm going mad.

170
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,300
It's merely an experiment meant to fail.

171
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,810
To stimulate the brain with those electrical probes.

172
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,040
They're basically murdering them.

173
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,100
Let's stop them.

174
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,970
Students! You are seeing something you shouldn't be seeing.

175
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,440
