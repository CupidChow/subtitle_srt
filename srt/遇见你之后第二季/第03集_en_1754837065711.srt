2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,080
This is Yoo Yi Ri's son.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,480
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,200
How do these people know Mom?

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,390
Choi Yeon Woo, you're also a Mono?

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,470
Yes.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,570
...also?

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,640
Then... does that mean there is another Mono among these people?

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,080
Then, what about your Probe?

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,790
Ye Won looked up to Yi Ri quite a lot.

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,110
We were all members of an online cafÃ©.

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,730
Those were the days.

13
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,580
- But we couldn't meet up often because I moved to Pohang.
-That's right.

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,630
That's not the problem right now. Shouldn't we prevent Probe surgery from happening?

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,470
What do you all think?

16
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,510
Probe surgery?

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,570
They said it was due to infection.

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,630
Apparently, they open your skull for both insertion and removal of a probe.

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,620
She was so happy about the thought of seeing colors after surgery.

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,000
- But we should have stopped them.
- We should've.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,110
It is rumored that long ago, at a laboratory, a Mono temporarily experienced a color rush

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,430
after an electric stimulation was sent to the brain with a probe.

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:38,080
A surgery that stimulates Mono to recognize colors. That's Probe surgery.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,200
But I can't believe such surgery exists.

25
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,750
Ye Won didn't have a Probe,

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,690
so she was very envious of Yi Ri since she met hers.

27
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,970
I believe she said it was the love of a century or something.

28
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,660
I see...

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,530
She went through a lot of hardship at such a young age because she suddenly became the administrator.

30
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,020
Administrator?

31
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,970
Yes. Ye Won is Dododok, the administrator of our cafÃ©.

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,450
The girl in my dream and in that picture

33
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,630
was the administrator? And she was Dododok?

34
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,490
She went through surgery hoping for a "Probe".

35
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,190
No matter what, Yeon Woo, you shouldn't do it.

36
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,540
Seeing colors isn't as amazing as you think. You understand?

37
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,210
From what I hear, there are unapproved drugs. So don't do the surgery.

38
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,230
Unapproved drugs?

39
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,300
Oh my, look at the time.

40
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,880
- You're not leaving?
- Yes. I'll leave a little later.

41
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,800
Okay, then. We'll leave first.

42
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,800
I'll do this, so take your place.

43
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,170
Thanks.

44
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,390
Why did you pretend not to know me?

45
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:54,350
Just because... I didn't want those people to know that I knew you.

46
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,660
Who were those people?

47
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,700
I didn't call anyone.

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,450
Who would be sad over a Mono's death?

49
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,050
In fact, they would be happy that a risk factor has disappeared.

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,020
But, still...

51
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,420
I notified my younger sister's school

52
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,570
because there might be someone who misses Ye Won.

53
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Her homeroom teacher will probably bring them tomorrow.

54
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,830
I think that's all there is to it.

55
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,590
- What about the pallbearing?
- I can do it alone.

56
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,720
Such bitter words. How can he say he'll do it alone?

57
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,630
Don't tell anyone at school about this.

58
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,710
I don't want them to know about this.

59
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,900
Yeah. I'll leave after helping him with the pallbearing.

60
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,300
I'm all right. Let's talk later. Okay.

61
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,430
There's no need.

62
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,320
I'm not doing it for you.

63
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,900
I'm doing it because your younger sister appeared in my dream.

64
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,220
Why would my younger sister appear in your dream?

65
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,160
If she was to, then she should appear in my dreams.

66
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,560
I'm her older brother. Not you.

67
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,970
Why are you asking me? Ask your sister.

68
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,730
I just find it fascinating... and welcoming.

69
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,670
I didn't know my younger sister would work at a candy factory.

70
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,340
What did you say she said?

71
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,170
She said that she wanted to be the best employee.

72
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,770
The best employee...

73
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,880
I don't know what that means.

74
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,030
I just don't understand.

75
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,680
Why did she appear in your dream and talk nonsense?

76
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,300
What was she trying to say at the end?

77
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,670
Se Hyun's younger sister became a small tree on a hill overlooking the ocean.

78
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,520
Thanks.

79
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,560
Why are you laughing?

80
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,300
I thought there wouldn't be any more ties between you and me.

81
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,380
What's this "between you and me" and "ties"?

82
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,390
I saw you a lot at school.

83
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,220
I wanted to get closer to you, but you would only play with him.

84
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,960
I didn't like how I felt.

85
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,400
What are you suddenly trying to start?

86
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,200
You want to find your mom and Go Yoo Han, right?

87
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,560
Isn't that why you came to the funeral?

88
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,840
My aunt told me to go on her behalf, and you were there.

89
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,580
And you had a meal with "Monowife."

90
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,880
Do you know what that means?

91
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,100
You have become their subject of interest.

92
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,490
What?

93
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,280
You're Yoo Yi Ri's son.

94
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,120
Then, PD Yoo Yi Rang is your aunt.

95
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,350
Is it a crime that my aunt is a PD?

96
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:37,550
I, too, don't really know who they are and what they do.

97
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,880
But I know one thing.

98
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,400
The person they hate most.

99
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,030
The tenacious and persistent person tailing them,

100
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,110
Reporter Yoo Yi Rang of "Searching for the truth." Your aunt.

101
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,370
My aunt... just wants to find my mom.

102
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,450
Your aunt is a PD.

103
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,750
She could destroy them with one broadcast.

104
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,440
It's always like that.

105
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,670
You are Yoo Yi Rang's only weakness,

106
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,460
her one and only nephew,

107
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,020
and a Mono, Choi Yeon Woo.

108
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,730
Yoo Yi Rang probably can't do anything because of you.

109
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,010
Come to think of it, they may have known about you beforehand,

110
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,180
and Go Yoo Han was kidnapped instead of you.

111
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,970
Be careful of what you say. What do you mean, kidnapped instead of me?

112
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,960
You're the first to not get hit for grabbing my collar.

113
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,920
I'm sorry, but

114
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,850
I'm only curious about my mom's and Go Yoo Han's disappearance.

115
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,280
Okay.

116
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,990
Then trust me and keep pushing forward.

117
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,440
I'm going to protect you.

118
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,760
What do you mean?

119
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,320
I used to live here with my grandma.

120
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,280
But after my grandma passed away, my uncle got on a boat saying he was going to make some money

121
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,440
and hasn't come back.

122
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,060
The house owner lives in the city and comes once in a while.

123
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,530
If we get caught, then it's over.

124
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,710
I need to pack immediately.

125
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,170
So that's why we have to sneak in and out.

126
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,380
Then, why are we here?

127
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,630
I'm going to pack a few things.

128
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,740
We didn't know when we would get kicked out, so we each packed a bag.

129
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,330
Give me one. I'll hold it.

130
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,040
Thanks.

131
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,160
Lapis lazuli. It's the real deal.

132
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,870
I heard it used to be quite rare and expensive back then.

133
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:37,320
I didn't know I would see the lapis lazuli that I was supposed to see at Go Yoo Han's house here.

134
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,780
Lapis lazuli is slang for Mono's medicine.

135
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,900
A medicine that lets a Mono see colors even without a Probe.

136
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,270
But my sister, who couldn't buy one because it was too expensive,

137
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,860
received one suddenly

138
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,850
from a handsome oppa with a black mask on.

139
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,040
It was Go Yoo Han.

140
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,220
My sister, who was expecting a blue pill wrapped in a white paper,

141
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,340
was given a stone by an oppa wearing a mask.

142
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,960
To my sister, it was a useless stone.

143
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,110
I saw the disappointment on her face when she came home and told me the story.

144
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,310
It was so funny.

145
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,470
What's funnier is that the oppa wearing the mask

146
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,080
told her to keep it safe until he returned.

147
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,390
Why did those people kidnap Go Yoo Han and not me?

148
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,970
Lapis lazuli is chunggeumsuk.
(T/N: Chunggeumsuk is lapis lazuli in Korean.)

149
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,740
It's not medicine, but a mineral.

150
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,140
Of course, you can extract medicinal ingredients from the mineral, but

151
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,330
it doesn't have much relevance to a medicine's name.

152
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,550
But do you know the reason behind it?

153
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,830
Why?

154
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,180
Because it was so rare and precious,

155
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,330
only the most important person can acquire it.

156
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:37,080
Timing and Subtitles by the Somewhere over the Rainbow ðŸŒˆ Team @ Viki

157
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,460
At that time, my sister told me the only ones who were disappointed that lapis lazuli was a stone

158
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:49,270
were Gray Scale, and that oppa was tailing them.

159
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,370
A stone that only the most important person can acquire because it's so rare and precious.

160
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,840
You can have that stone.

161
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,220
- Really?
- The owner of that lapis lazuli is you.

162
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,860
My sister was only keeping it safe for a bit.

163
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,460
But don't forget my sister.

164
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,530
She put a lot of care into raising that stone, wiping it until it shined so bright every day.

165
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:31,620
Of course. I'm thankful to your sister and I'll cherish it.

166
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,950
Let's go.

167
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,150
But raise a stone?

168
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,540
Yes. There are a lot of people who raise stones.

169
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,280
They don't speak, don't go anywhere,

170
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,870
and are always there.

171
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,810
Okay. I'll try to raise this stone well.

172
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,030
In return,

173
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,850

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,280
I know you're happy about it.

176
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,030
You're fine with it, right?

177
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,470
I don't know.

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,960

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,780
