2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,430
At that time... if I rejected Go Yoo Han when he asked to hang out...

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,630
If I hadn't told Go Yoo Han that I liked him...

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,440
If I wasn't by Go Yoo Han's side...

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,600
If Go Yoo Han didn't find out I was a Mono...

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,790
If Go Yoo Han... wasn't chased out by them,

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,100
he wouldn't have been kidnapped.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,700
â™«   Let me adore you, Let me adore you   â™«

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,710
â™«  I think I might fall in love   â™«

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,540
â™«  I engrave you in my more inclined heart  â™«

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,800
Everything happened so suddenly.

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,710
Half a year ago... on April 1st, my birthday,

13
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,860
Go Yoo Han got kidnapped trying to save me.

14
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,200
I've been friends with Go Yoo Han since elementary school.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,330
Damn... I apologize on his behalf.

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,000
Why would you?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,450
Because he's a thoughtless bastard.

18
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,240
Why would you think that?

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,950
I mean, how could he leave you here, by yourself,

20
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,400
and leave for the U.S. alone.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,410
I know he was forced to go study abroad by the chairman,

22
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,050
but how could he not contact us?

23
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,520
So heartless... Seriously...

24
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,380
Our friends don't know

25
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,800
that Go Yoo Han was kidnapped right before my eyes.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,540
It was weird that they weren't asking for any ransom.

27
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,480
In fact, everyone acts as if nothing happened,

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,470
while they have many people secretly

29
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,050
searching for Go Yoo Han.

30
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,760
Knowing his personality, he'll be back soon.

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,720
He's probably trying to escape as we speak!

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,220
That's probably true.

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,420
I only have two words for you.
(T/N: Literally, he said I only have three characters to say to you.)

34
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,150
Run. A. Way.

35
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,000
Run away?

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,670
Those words are probably from Grandpa Min Jae, right?

37
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,800
Choi Yeon Woo!

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,420
Go Yoo Han?

39
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,910
Can you pass me the ball?

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,400
I don't want to.

41
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,220
[Who kidnapped Go Yoo Han? On that day, he told me he found clues on my mother's disappearance. Did the people associated with my mother's disappearance kidnap Go Yoo Han?

42
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,730
[Who kidnapped Go Yoo Han? On that day, he told me he found clues on my mother's disappearance. Did the people associated with my mother's disappearance kidnap Go Yoo Han?

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,770
Hey. Didn't I tell you Monos aren't allowed to come to school?

44
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,930
Why did you come? So annoying.

45
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,090
Are you rebelling against me?

46
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,170
Who are you to tell me not to come to school?

47
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,230
I have the right to attend school.

48
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,960
Seriously... I guess you'll only learn after we teach you a lesson.

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,160
Hey!

50
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,020
Why are you bullying your friend?

51
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,300
Friend?

52
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,290
She's a Mono. Can't you grasp the situation?

53
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,430
Where do you live? Are you all right?

54
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,440
Let's go.

55
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,220
Hey! Just know that you got lucky today!

56
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,120
We'll see if you're lucky tomorrow, too.

57
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,670
I'm okay.

58
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,480
What's his deal?

59
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,270
Acting like he was going to pick a fight.

60
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,750
Should we grab him?

61
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,550
Forget it. I only beat Monos.

62
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,000
I still haven't found Mom,

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,130
but even Go Yoo Han who was holding my hand has disappeared.

64
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,910
I don't know. I'm not sure.

65
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,330
I was stupid.

66
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,830
I was by my Probe's side even though I'm a Mono. It's all my fault.

67
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,040
I was wrong. It's all my fault. Is Yoo Han okay?

68
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,020
How is Yoo Han? Yoo Han was stabbed with a knife!

69
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,150
Location is Honey Land. Honey Land.

70
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,630
Why are you doing this to me? I said that it was my fault!

71
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,690
I was by my Probe's side, even though I'm a Mono.

72
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,760
I find myself sitting here when I wake up.

73
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,000
There was no one calling to threaten me

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,760
nor asking for ransom.

75
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,530
Where are you now?

76
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,700
Yeon Woo, you're awake?

77
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,160
Are you drinking on an empty stomach again?

78
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,790
Circumstances are the appetizers for soju.

79
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,780
You're going to upset your stomach.

80
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,680
You're being filial, Yeon Woo.

81
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,190
Don't drink too much.

82
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,200
Why are you drinking again today?

83
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,880
I was seriously thinking about whether I should tell you or not.

84
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,450
About what?

85
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,450
You're going through other people's "suseun" again.

86
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,700
Suseun?

87
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,200
SNS. Suseun.

88
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,600
I was amazed you could pronounce SNS like that.

89
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,520
If it was to be pronounced like that, shouldn't it be "sunsu"?

90
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,230
But how did she know I was SNS crawling?

91
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,200
I got a notification about your card usage.

92
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,160
You even bought a "suseun" crawling program.

93
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,800
It's not a program. I bought API and made it.
(T/N: API is application program interface.)

94
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,600
I only gather data that are released.

95
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,940
Oh, isn't our Yeon Woo a genius?

96
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,950
It wasn't the cloud. She caught the public open donation.

97
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,680
I only paid one dollar. How did she catch that?

98
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,900
Since you're a genius,

99
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,170
stop looking for

100
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,990
my sister and Yoo Han.

101
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,890
As an adult, I'll take care of that.

102
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,100
So, please...

103
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,500
please live like a regular student.

104
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,400
If something happens to you too, I'm...

105
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,840
going to die.

106
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,840
I thought she left this information out, which she happened to get from one of her investigations.

107
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,480
But one thing stood out as I was looking over it.

108
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,330
I recognized the name mom used in one glance, Yoo Yi Ri.

109
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,590
Mom didn't hide her unique name and used it.

110
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,950
It seems this list has names from a certain site relating to Monos.

111
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,360
It was reported that some people run a blog or SNS.

112
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,370
But for the rest, there was barely any info.

113
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,550
The common thing they had was "Gray Scale".

114
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,240
It was a Mono community under that name.

115
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,200
What does this mean?

116
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,780
Gray Scale... Drug... Illegal Surgery

117

118
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,190
That's it.

119
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,090
This was a list of all the members who met at the regular coffee shop.

120
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,130
Kim Se Hyun? Why is Se Hyun calling?

121
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,320
What brings you to my house?

122
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,070
I'm not interested if you're here for soccer.

123
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,810
This. Isn't this important to you?

124
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,230
You dropped it earlier.

125
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,490
Did you look inside?

126
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,080
No, I didn't.

127
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,860
â™«   Adore you, even though I tried to hide it  â™«

128
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,740
Why? What's written in it?

129
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,860
â™«   Adore you  â™«

130
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,360
I'm suddenly curious.

131
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,810
â™«   I'm drawing a full painting of you  â™«

132
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,960
Thanks for the notebook. I'll buy you Coolpis tomorrow.
(T/N: Coolpis is an actual Korean drink.)

133
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,690
â™«   My heart is twinkling  â™«

134
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,470
Why?

135
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,360
You don't like Coolpis?

136
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,510
â™«   Let me adore you, let me adore you   â™«

137
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,730
You're looking for it, too. Right?

138
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,080
What?

139
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,300
The truth.

140
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,440
â™«   I think I'll take it out and look at it every day  â™«

141
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,660
â™«   Let me adore you, Let me adore you   â™«
