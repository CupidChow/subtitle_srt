Timing and Subtitles by the Somewhere over the Rainbow ðŸŒˆ Team @ Viki

2
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,220
You're looking for it, too. Right?

3
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,950
- For what?
- The truth.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,880
My younger sister believes it,

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,610
but I don't believe in... any of that stuff.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,790
What's with his younger sister, and what's the truth?

7
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,800
What really stood out at this moment was Se Hyun's pupils.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,900
Inside his exceptionally black pupils,

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,530
lied an even darker darkness.

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,270
A person has three vital points.

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,500
The philtrum, solar plexus, and "sat".

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,230
What's "sat"?

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,620
"Sat" is short for the groin.
(T/N: Groin in Korean is pronounced "sataguni")

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,200
Sat...

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,290
You don't need to hit multiple times.

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,340
Just aim for the vital points.

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,950
Try it.

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,260
Relax your shoulders.

19
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,220
Do you really think that'll stop them?

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,090
Now, think of me as the opponent and try again.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,790
Oh, g-good job.

22
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,870
Don't use it against me, though.

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,250
Did you secretly learn from somewhere else?

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,400
What's the point of being pretty when you're a Mono.

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,590
There is no use being pretty.

26
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,510
Hey. I heard Monos "flirt" with Probes when they see one.
(T/N: The literal translation of the word flirt in Korean is to wag your tail. So, it can be used to degrade someone because it references a dog wagging their tail to get something.)

27
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,660
Do you "flirt" when you see Probes?

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,670
Hey, hey. Don't go near Monos.

29
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,940
You're going to get infected.

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,700
- Give me back my earphones.
- What's wrong?

31
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,550
Answer me.

32
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,680
You are "flirting".

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,070
I think I'll go deaf if I use these earphones that a dirty person like you touched.

34
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,110
Your kind obsesses over your Probes, kidnaps them, and even kills them.

35
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,810
Oh, right. This was even on the news yesterday.

36
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,510
It also involved cannibalism this time, too.

37
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,030
Tell me. Who's the Mono, your mom or dad?

38
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,530
They don't try and kill each other?

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,370
Who's her friend?

40
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,020
She's a total loner.

41
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,500
You. Who's the closest person to you in your class?

42
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,060
Also... where is your guardian?

43
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,380
Why are you sitting here alone?

44
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,520
Where are your parents?

45
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,700
You people seriously have no manners! Even after hitting a person!

46
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,080
Jin Sung's mother. Should I call Ye Won's guardian?

47
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,080
Yes. Please call them right now.

48
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,980
I can't right now because they're in class.

49
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,630
So...

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,720
Her guardian is a teacher?

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,810
No. She has an uncle, but he hasn't returned from the sea.

52
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,810
She has a brother named Kim Se Hyun, who attends SangSang High School across the street.

53
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,620
So, it's a bit difficult right now.

54
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,530
Then at least have the student come here right now.

55
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,220
No, Mom.

56
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,500
Let's just go.

57
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,550
- What?
- Please, let's just go.

58
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,340
Are you serious?

59
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,860
Why are you acting like this? We can't leave without an apology.

60
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,270
No, Mom! I might get killed.

61
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,310
Kim Se Hyun's shadow boxing.

62
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,110
Even the neighborhood bullies avoid him!

63
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,520
What is this kid saying?

64
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,930
Ye Won, I'm sorry.

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,640
I didn't know you're Kim Se Hyun's younger sister.

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,660
You've never talked about your family.

67
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,480
If I knew, I wouldn't have done this. I'm really sorry.

68
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,160
Please don't tell him, okay?

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,310
I'm sorry for making fun of you.

70
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,410
I beg you.

71
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,650
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,340
Hey! You get up right now!

73
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,730
Why are you the one who's on his knees begging?!

74
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,230
- Let's go, please!
- Why are you acting like this?

75
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,630
Let's go, please!

76
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,670
Let's go, Mom.

77
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,320
Since this is a problem between the students,

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,240
I ask you to educate her properly as the homeroom teacher. Do you understand?

79
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,450
Yes, I understand.

80
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,010
Let go!

81
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,840
Go to the nurse's office.

82
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,940
Okay.

83
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,870
Also, about your older brother...

84
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,210
I won't tell.

85
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,610
Class President, did you order the pizza you promised to treat the class?

86
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,420
- Yes. You saw the bill yesterday, right?
- Yeah.

87
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,620
It's expensive with the drinks.

88
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,140
But still, we have to order that much to eat our fill.

89
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,980
Do you... want to join us for soccer?

91
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,570
What?

92
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,720
Joo Haeng and I are going to the library.

93
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,150
There are an odd number of people, so we need one more person.

94
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,910
Is he going to play or not?

95
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,960
He's going to.

96
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,520
Okay.

97
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,640
Let's go. When you have a lot on your mind, playing soccer helps.

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,180
I have a lot of on my mind?

99
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,720
How did he know?

100
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,470
Here. I brought one for you just in case.

101
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,300
Change and come out.

102
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,880
Over here, here, here! Pass, pass!

103
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,350
- Yeon Woo pass!
- Yeon Woo, here! Here!

104
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,840
Here! Here!

105
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,810
What? Why are you so good?

106
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,000
Wow!

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,750
That was pretty cool, Choi Yeon Woo.

108
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,480
- Let's go!
- I didn't know then.

109
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,610
- Let's win this game!
- That I laughed for the first time in half a year.

110
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,130
Strangely, I was sleepy as soon as I got home.

111
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:25,190
Is it because I ran for the first time in a while? I fell asleep when it wasn't even six yet.

112
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,540
Help me. I need to be the best employee.

113
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,420
You're a Mono, right?

114
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,260
Let's make candies together.

115
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,450
You can get the Probe surgery if you make a lot of these.

116
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,800
Probe surgery?

117
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,010
With that, you can see colors without a Probe.

118
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,060
But truthfullyâ€¦

119
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,160
A young girl appeared in my dreams.

120
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,910
A face that I may or may not have seen before.

121
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:39,060
I can see colors without a Probe... What does that mean?

122
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:45,380
The girl's anxiety and fear seemed too realistic for it to be a dream.

123
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,720
This is not the time to think about dreams.

124
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,240
Last night, I searched all the nicknames and IDs on the list

125
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,940
and was able to find a trace.

126
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,590
Traces were left by the user "Monowife" when they were promoting group purchases.

127
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,210
If this person is still using the same number...

128
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,570
Hello?

129
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,670
Hello. My name is Choi Yeon Woo, a second-year at SangSang High School.

130
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,930
High school?

131
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,570
Yes.

132
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,500
By any chance, do you know my mother, Yoo Yi Ri?

133
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,120
Oh, Yoo Yi Ri unnie?

134
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,010
Like I told PD Yoo Yi Rang on the phone,

135
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,900
I have nothing else to tell you. I'm sorry.

136
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,690
If she had already talked with my aunt on the phone, then my aunt knew everything.

137
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,570
Ah, that makes things difficult.

138
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,370
Yeah.

139
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,220
Hey, Choi Yeon Woo.

140
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,050
How did you contact Kim Hyun Joo?

141
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,080
That person's name must've been Kim Hyun Joo.

142
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,550
She seems close to my aunt since she called her soon after we talked.

143
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,640
I told you to stop looking for my sister. Didn't I?

144
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,600
You're not telling me anything.

145
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,120
I'll tell you when everything is done. I promise.

146
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,910
And when will that be?

147
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,760
Do you really want your phone taken away?

148
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,000
It's more of a disadvantage for you, not me, since you can't contact me.

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,510
How can you resemble your mom so much?

150
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,680
Of course, I'll resemble her.

151
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,420
Using someone's affection to threaten them is exactly the same.

152
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,210
Aunt, I'm sorry. It's because I am immature and young.

153
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,350
I know that you worry when you can't reach me.

154
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,230
I spoke harshly because I lost my temper.

155
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,550
I found a mono cafÃ© called Gray Scale.

156
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,370
After finding out that mom was attending a cafÃ© gathering at this location six years ago,

157
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,700
I just wanted to be some help...

158
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
I was being greedy.

159
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,990
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,360
(T/N: She's somewhat okay.)

161
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,320
That's so like her.

162
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,250
â™«   I stare at you and then look away  â™«

163
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,730
Aunt wants me to no longer get involved in this matter

164
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,450
and wait. Like she said, poking my nose in

165
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:01,640
might interfere with her investigation.

166
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:27,960
â™«   There is love, but it's for someone else, not you â™«

167
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,920
It felt like time had stopped.

168
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,440
My time lingered at that day and time.

169
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,500
It was empty, just like those days Go Yoo Han wasn't at the playground.

170
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,940
I could no longer hear his endearing voice that told me what color the sand was.

171
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,130
But I was just lost in thought

172
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,770
of what I can and should do.

173
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,180
Yeah?

174
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,870
Yeon Woo, where are you right now?

175
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,880
I just got home.

176
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,960
If so...

177
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,420
- Can you go to a funeral on my behalf?
- Did you search here?

178
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,010
Can you reach the bereaved family?

179
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,630
Funeral?

180
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,920
Yes. I have to attend, but I don't think I can make it.

181
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,250
Who is it for that I have to go?

182
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,290
Isn't it better if someone else you know goes?

183
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,120
I didn't want to go to a funeral. It was the place I saw my mother...

184
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,570
the most broken for three days after my

185
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,730
sick father passed away.

186
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,520
It's Kim Hyun Joo.

187
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,920
"Monowife"?

188
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,290
Yes. She's a bit upset. So send her my apology and leave after the meal.

189
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,420
The deceased must be associated with my mom's disappearance.

190
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,520
If not, then there is no reason for "Monowife" to appear.

191
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,130
She needs to remain in contact with her, even if she has to send me, so she can question her later.

192
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,290
Who is the deceased? Are they one of the missing people?

193
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,250
Okay, I'll be tactful when I'm there.

194
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,140
I transferred the condolence money to your bank account, and I'll send you the address.

195
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,900
Okay.

196
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,630
There was one phrase that I heard more clearly than the other words. "The bereaved family..."

197
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,890
I was tied to the phrase, "the bereaved family," for a long time, and it made me dwell on it several times.

198
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,870
Goodness. Yoo Yi Ri unnie is pretty and so is her son.

199
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,300
- Hello.
- You are Choi Yeon Woo, right?

200
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,950
Kids these days grow up so fast.

201
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,880
We never met, but she talked as if we met when I was young.

202
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,260
I have no memory of her.

203
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,510
I was worried about you coming on behalf of PD Yoo Yi Rang.

204
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,800
I guess you can't hide your genes. How are you so pretty?

205
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,660
I'm sorry for thoughtlessly calling you back then.

206
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,920
Why are you apologizing for that? I'm all right.

207
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,420
Yeon Woo, have you been to a funeral?

208
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,390
Yes.

209
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,080
There was no need for me to tell her that it was when my father passed away.

210
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,030
It was the girl I saw in my dream.

211
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,390
Ye Won was a bright child,

212
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,920
so she'll be fine in the afterlife.

213
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,100
Yes, thank you.

214
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,170
He's the son of the person whom Ye Won looked up to.

215
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,030
I see.

216
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,900
Thank you for coming.

217
