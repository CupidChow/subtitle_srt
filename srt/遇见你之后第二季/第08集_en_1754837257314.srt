2
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,920
Are you okay?

3
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,390
Se Hyun...

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,990
Se Hyun, wake up!

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,870
Yeon Woo...

6
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,230
I know...

7
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,470
you only have Go Yoo Han

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,140
in your heart.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,740
You'll eventually...

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,070
leave me, right?

11
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:59,110
I... will only remember that I liked you....

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,400
and the fact... that I protected you.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,340
I don't ever want to...

14
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,860
remember that you left me.

15
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,390
Don't say such things. We need to escape this place!

16
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,400
We have to make it out alive!

17
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,600
Open your eyes, huh?

18
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,090
Min Jae,

19
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,230
where is Go Yoo Han?

20
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,450
Near you. But it may also not be Go Yoo Han.

21
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,090
What do you mean?

22
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,000
Aunt.

23
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,640
It's a relief you're alive.

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,920
I'll deal with you when you're better and done with the treatments.

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,420
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,440
Get well soon. Your friend keeps asking for only you.

27
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,020
Yeon Woo, are you okay?

28
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,500
He broke like every part of his body, but he's still acting like that.

29
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,660
Why are there so many guys in this world that care for you?

30
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,230
My goodnes, you guys are making a fuss.

31
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,160
- Ow!
- So. Who. Told. You. To. Do. Such. Dangerous. Things.

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,820
That hurts, Aunt!

33
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,660
- Do you think this is enough to let you get away with it?
- Aunt! Aunt!

34
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,190
It's my fault. Please don't hit him.

35
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,850
I got it, Kim Se Hyun.

36
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,540
Stay still, so your bones can stick together.

37
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,440
Okay.

38
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,430
We found out that Grayscale and Maskun are one after searching Nuv Candy.

39
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,750
The police arrested all the managers there.

40
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,340
What about Lee Sang Jae?

41
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,990
In my opinion, Lee Sang Jae is the mastermind, and Monowife is his accomplice.

42
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,950
We lost both of them.

43
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,710
But it's only a matter of time until they'll be arrested, since they're on the wanted list.

44
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,950
I'm going on an urgent business trip.

45
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,670
It's a place Lee Sang Jae used to run. I don't know what we'll find there, but it's going to be broadcast live.

46
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,380
Let me know if you know anything as you watch,

47
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,290
since you've already been to Nuv Candy.

48
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,430
Okay. I know a lot.

49
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,830
Is that something to be proud of? You shouldn't have gotten hurt. I'm leaving.
- I understand.

50
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,370
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

51
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,200
Ouch.

52
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,280
Se Hyun, are you really okay?

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,280
Yeah. Don't worry. I'm a man of steel.

54
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,160
Hey, stay still.

55
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,800
You'll hurt yourself.

56
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,900
Even though Se Hyun was all bandaged up, I found Se Hyun, who was worried about me, cute.

57
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,900
My friends. Thank you for visiting me at the hospital.

58
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,260
Back then, you both were responsible for the forced broadcast, right?

59
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,600
How did you know?

60
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,040
You two are the only ones among my friends with those skills.

61
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,110
Hi, guys!

62
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,150
What the heck! A mummy?

63
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,380
Can I get some juice, too?

64
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,270
Se Hyun?

65
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,070
A mummy is talking.

66
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,710
It's because it's a Korean mummy.

67
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,570
Egyptian mummies talk well, too. Anck Su Namun.

68
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,730
Give me some juice.

69
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,670
Nobody searches this reservoir because there is no owner.

70
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,670
Recently, many remains have been found here, due to floods caused by heavy rain.

71
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,780
One moment, please.

72
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,630
Are you a villager? One moment, please.

73
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,870
- I don't know anything.
- Wait a moment.

74
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,600
Do you know anything about this reservoir?

75
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,460
I really don't know. All the villagers

76
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,120
don't know, either.

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,410
What aboutâ”€

78
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,080
I really don't know. All the villagers

79
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,490
Oh.

80
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,110
What's up, Yeon Woo?

81
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,640
That voice right now! In the interview! That's Lee Sang Jae. It was Lee Sang Jae's voice!

82
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,400
Hey, Lee Sang Jae!

83
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,260
Stop right there!

84
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,250
- Stay still.
- Let go!

85
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,420
- Let go!
- Stay still!

86
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,740
Let go! Let go!

87
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,880
You are under arrest for murder and fraud.

88
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,910
You have the right to remain silent.

89
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,570
Hey!

90
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,700
This is the reservoir Lee Sang Jae frequently visited.

91
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,120
Lee Sang Jae pretended to be a villager here and occasionally fishedâ”€

92
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,080
She wore a hairband?

93
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,300
Yeah. A yellow hairband.

94
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,770
Did she? I have no memory of it.

95
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,440
You bought it for her.

96
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,120
I did?

97
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,660
What's wrong?

98
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,100
Sis. Sis!

99
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,510
Sis!

100
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Sis.

101
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,670
Sis.

102
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,650
When speculation of what if this happens becomes reality,

103
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,140
surprisingly, I become calm.

104
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,590
Rather than being shocked from my mother's death,

105
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,540
I found comfort in that she's

106
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,930
now resting in a warm place.

107
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,590
I'm going...

108
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,220
to leave this place now.

109
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,740
I'm going to leave...

110
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,090
and your Probe will appear.

111
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,870
You're a Mono...

112
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,240
and so am I.

113
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,100
This is our end.

114
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,640
And...

115
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,600
this is my first...

116
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,590
and last...

117
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,760
gift to you.

118
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,800
What?

119
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:11,610
â™«  I love someone but it's not you  â™«

120
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,320
â™«  It's hard to turn away because I love them that much  â™«

121
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,520
Don't forgive me, who's leaving you.

122
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,170
But...

123
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,210
please remember just this moment.

124
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,130
I will never forget you.

125
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,520
Because... I like you.

126
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,590
â™«  In the mirror, my staggering image is reflected  â™«

127
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:53,680
â™«   and I try to touch up my tangled hair  â™«

128
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,040
What are you doing?

129
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,210
Oh, uh...

130
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,980
I was just...

131
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,760
Let's go back. I'll buy you ramen with rice cake.

132
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,020
Shouldn't you at least buy me jjampong when I've done so much for you?
(T/N: Jjampong is a spicy noodle dish made from either seafood or pork-based broth)

133
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,700
Jjampong?

134
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,750
Deal.

135
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,090
With fried dumplings?

136
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,210
Dumplings are usually on the house, so...

137
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,810
Okay, deal!

138
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,930
Okay. Let's go.

139
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,550
- Hey. Are we never getting tangsuyuk?
- What?
(T/N: Tangsuyuk is a meat dish with sweet and sour sauce.)

140
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,630
Let's go.

141
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,030
â™«   Adore you   â™«

142
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,960
â™«  I draw you without holding anything back  â™«

143
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,080
â™«  This shining heart  â™«

144
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,980
â™«  An uncontrollable feeling  â™«
