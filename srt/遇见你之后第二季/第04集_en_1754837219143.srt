2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,790
What do I say to my aunt?

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,420
She'll probably say, "It was Go Yoo Han last time, and this time, it's another guy?"

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,720
She probably won't believe me, no matter how many times I explain it to her.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,970
What are you doing? Don't you have the keys?

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,230
Just ring the bell. You said your aunt was home.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,610
I have my key.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,350
Let's go inside.

9
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,240
Aunt, I'm home.

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,280
Are you asleep?

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,930
Hello. Kim Se Hyun, Yeon Woo's friend, is also here.

12
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,360
I'm in big trouble!

13
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,950
I'm becoming one with the sofa.

14
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,580
Yeah.

15
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,590
- Where are you?
- Home.

16
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,350
Are you okay?

17
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,510
- Yes.
-   That's good to hear.

18
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,310
I'll probably be here for a couple of days, so if you get bored, have a friend over and hang out.

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,120
It's better than being in a dark room and watching the mantis being eaten.

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,590
If it's an emergency, call me right away, regardless of the time.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,720
Okay.

22
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,810
"If you get bored, have a friend over and hang out."

23
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,930
I heard that clearly.

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,860
Anyway, let's wash up.

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,470
Okay.

26
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,320
O-Okay. You wash up first.

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,320
What are you saying? We can wash up together.

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,350
No, thanks. You wash up first.

29
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,420
I'll prepare some food.

30
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,930
Food?

31
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,260
Wow. Thanks!

32
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,020
Hey, hey, hey! It's not there. Go over there.

33
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,160
- Oh, there?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,770
There's so much stuff here.

35
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,500
Which one's the shampoo and which one's the soap?

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,720
Wow! This one smells like honey!

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,170
Hey! Can I eat this?

38
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,190
Hey! That's shampoo! If you eat it, you'llâ”€

39
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,880
I only went to a funeral once,

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,430
but came back home with trouble.

41
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,450
What are you doing?

42
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,860
Looking to see if there's anyone suspicious.

43
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,840
Do you really have to do that?

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,170
It seems like there aren't any.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Now, we can go to sleep reassured.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,660
What are you doing? Let's go sleep.

47
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,030
Yeah, I'm going to...

48
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,990
You can sleep in my room. I'll sleep in the living room.

49
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,450
We can't do that.

50
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,450
If you sleep in the living room, I'll also sleep in the living room.

51
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,150
If you sleep in the room, I'll also sleep in the room.

52
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,490
Why so?

53
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,290
From now on, I will not be more than ten centimeters apart from you.

54
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,000
- Why?
- If I stay further than that,

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,800
I can't protect you.

56
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,330
10 centimeters, my foot!

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,050
Your aunt's not here. Also, if you were here alone, you would've already been kidnapped.

58
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,870
Don't say such words without evidence.

59
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,870
I don't need evidence.

60
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,090
If I'm apart from you even for a brief moment,

61
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,000
they might come and hurt you anytime.

62
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,380
Is that so?

63
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,150
But sleeping together is troublesome.

64
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,030
So, where will you sleep?

65
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,270
Hurry and choose your location.

66
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,970
Is it your room or the living room?

67
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,490
Your room it is.

68
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,420
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
About what?

70
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,150
Your clothes.

71
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,160
You're treating your guest properly.

72
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,850
Oh, right. Hey, does this neighborhood have a laundromat?

73
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,020
I need to wash all the clothes in that bag.

74
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,360
There is. My aunt is a VIP at that laundromat.

75
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,080
Oh, it smells good. It smells like sunshine.

76
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,700
Se Hyun smiled so brightly when he threw the gym clothes at me.

77
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,410
I didn't know I would be with Se Hyun like this.

78
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,200
My aunt told me it's improper to let the guest sleep on the floor.

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,780
I prefer the floor. I can't sleep on the bed because it's uncomfortable.

80
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,510
If you say so...

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
Are you okay?

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,510
Of course, I'm not. I lost my sister.

83
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,000
That is why I...

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,460
won't ever lose you.

85
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,170
You're the only one who met my sister in a dream.

86
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,370
You and I are connected like that.

87
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,570
What are you doing?

88
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:02,250
Tell her I miss her, the next time you see her.

89
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,400
We will eventually find the truth,

90
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,660
and I'll find the people who made my sister die.

91
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,030
I will gladly sacrifice myself when the time comes.

92
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,280
But you must survive and

93
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,920
leave a record of the truth.

94
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,270
It's not like we're fighting a huge crime syndicate.

95
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,150
Aren't they just people who sell drugs and do illegal surgeries?

96
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,590
Is that so?

97
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,260
I'm more scared of them than any criminal syndicate.

98
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,840
Why?

99
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,410
They don't know when to give up.

100
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,580
"We don't care if the world collapses. We have nothing to lose."

101
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,290
They give off that vibe.

102
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,910
You have exactly that written on your face.

103
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,190
It even dries clothes, too?

104
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,220
Of course.

105
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,150
It must be expensive.

106
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,120
Ta-da! VIP.

107
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,870
VIP!

108
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,690
This is obviously my aunt's though.

109
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,900
So this is why you're always clean.

110
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,480
My aunt sent me a picture as if she's using my phone as her memo pad again.

111
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,570
The name sounded familiar.

112
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,360
It quickly came to mind because his last name was Yeo.

113
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,910
This person went missing.

114
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,220
Here's your morning coffee.

115
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,920
Oh!

116
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,830
Thank you!

117
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,010
You need a lot of money if you want the Probe surgery,

118
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,620
but you don't have money.

119
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,800
Even so, you want to see colors. Right?

120
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,980
There is a way.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,300
Will you become the administrator for Gray Scale?

122
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,320
I believe you will make a great and trustworthy administrator.

123
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,800
Excuse me? How could I...

124
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,330
I can immediately tell

125
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,040
who the good person is and who the bad person is.

126
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,160
What do you mean?

127
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,480
Give it a try, being the administrator.

128
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,340
The person in the highest position in Gray Scale.

129
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,560
What? You don't want to?

130
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,620
No. I'll do it.

131
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,260
I can do well.

132
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,990
As you should.

133
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,970
If you do your best, the lapis lazuli is a given

134
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,760
and you can even receive the Probe surgery.

135
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,080
You definitely can't.

136
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,650
I told you not to believe that person! I told you not to meet him!

137
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,000
Brother!

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,010
Ye Won, listen carefully.

139
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,180
That guy is a fake, and what you believe is an illusion.

140
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,680
There is no such medicine nor that kind of surgery!

141
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,330
You're being deceived.

142
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,180
That was the first time she looked at me like that.

143
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,010
She looked at me as if she would kill me.

144
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,410
You better not meet him.

145
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,300
If you do, I won't stand still for it.

146
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,220
Ye Won!

147
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,090
Why are you so startled?

148
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,380
What?

149
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,700
Come eat.

150
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,150
Okay.

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,740
Aren't you going to school?

152
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,300
No, I don't think I can go because my stomach hurts.

153
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,700
There was enough money to buy a roll of kimbap and a bottle of water.

154
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,830
Make sure you eat.

155
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,930
This was the only thing I could do.

156
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,410
I thought my sister gave it up.

157
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,180
Although she's absent-minded, I thought she somehow managed to attend school.

158
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,510
Brother, I want to go to a world that has color.

159
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,600
And I received an opportunity for working hard.

160
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,200
There are no more chances if I miss this surgery.

161
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,020
I'll come back safely after receiving the surgery.

162
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,070
No.

163
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,890
No!

164
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,920
Did you see Ye Won?

165
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,260
Where is Ye Won's seat?

166
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,460
Teacher! Where is Ye Won's seat?

167
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,290
Ye-Ye Won? You can't behave like this, here.

168
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,140
- Where's Ye Won's?
- We're in the middle of a class, soâ”€

169
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,940
Where's Ye Won's seat?

170
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,970
- Please leave. Please leave.
- Where's Ye Won's seat? Ye Won!

171
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,660
Please leave.

172
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,690
The password is incorrect. Please try again.

173
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,340
Seriously!

174
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,640
In that darkness, not a single phone call came.

175
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,110
An unknown number. Strangely,

176
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,130
I didn't want to answer.

177
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,990
- Hello?
- This is Officer Jung Kyung Soo of the Seobu Police Station.

178
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,230
Is this Kim Ye Won's house?

179
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,820
Yes, it is.

180
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,660
We would like you to come to the autopsy room and confirm her identity.

181
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,660
She returned home dead.

182
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,580
I couldn't tell Yeon Woo about this.

183
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,330
I have no intention of leaving those who killed my sister alone.

186
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,590
On that day...
