00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,680
Who is this guy?

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,790
Hello. I am Kim Se Hyun, Yeon Woo's friend.

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,890
Seriously, Yeon Woo!

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,170
Aunt, we're not what you think.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,330
Then, I'll be heading home now.

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,500
Sit down.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,920
Yes.

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,380
Sit comfortably.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,410
Where is your home?

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,930
Your clothes and stuff are all in Yeon Woo's room. Didn't you pack your stuff and run away from home?

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,590
Aunt, it's not like that. Do you remember when you told me to go to the funeral with Monowife?

13
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,900
Se Hyun is that kid's brother.

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,670
Look me in the eyes.

15
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm a reporter with twelve years of experience. I know with one look

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,130
what you're thinking up here.

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,550
Yes.

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,720
Are you okay?

19
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,520
Yes.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,260
That's good, then.

21
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,690
Go out and buy some jokbal.  Grandma's jokbal. They don't deliver.

22
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,950
Aunt, how can you ask someone you just met toâ”€

23
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,010
It's because I have something to say to you. I also need some soju to drink.

24
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,930
Then, I'll be off.

25
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,360
Okay, and be careful.

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,790
Yes.

27
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,380
Did you watch today's broadcast?

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,600
Yes.

29
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,000
Do you... think my sister is a kind person?

30
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,520
My sister deceived us.

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,300
She was one of the many people who tried buying the illegal drug.

32
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,980
No. My mom was a bright person

33
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,910
and was enduring it well with the colorful memories she had with dad.

34
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,430
She never showed any regrets about not seeing colors. So why?

35
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,750
Her bright persona... was all fake.

36
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,760
In fact, she was in so much pain that she needed to buy that illegal drug.

37
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,330
So in front of us, she acted bright,

38
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,320
but behind us, she did this.

39
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,000
I should've noticed... what state my sister was in and what she was thinking.

40
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,750
It's not your fault.

41
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,960
Only Monos know what Monos are thinking.

42
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,270
You're right.

43
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,650
My sister got herself in the illegal mess,

44
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,080
and that was a trap. So, that's why she's missing.

45
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,620
I'm going to catch whoever's responsible and find her no matter what.

46
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,240
So, Choi Yeon Woo, trust me.

47
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,850
Since the broadcast was aired, things will become complicated.

48
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,320
In this world, there are crazy bastards who enjoy being noticed through other people's sadness and pain.

49
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,800
These bastards either lie or try to destroy other people's lives to satisfy their curiosity.

50
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,380
It'll hurt, but please endure it for a bit.

51
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,360
Just for a little longer.

52
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm asking you.

53
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,890
Okay.

54
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,320
Jokbal has arrived!

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,760
Bean sprout soup was free!

56
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,720
Let's hurry and eat!

57
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,880
Thanks to the broadcast, it's not just a missing person case.

58
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,120
An investigation has opened, so there should be progress.

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,150
Tips are coming in, but nothing special so far.

60
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,240
Your mom... was trying to buy the drugs, right?

61
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,640
Yes.

62
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,870
Let's catch them.

63
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,620
Those bastards... let's catch them no matter what.

64
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,260
I couldn't tell Se Hyun, who said this to me, what my aunt told me.

65
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,410
"Don't cause trouble, since the police are investigating."

66
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,820
Why are you out here?

67
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,420
Aren't you cold?

68
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,980
Don't look.

69
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,940
Why are you acting like this?

70
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,290
I'll clean this up. You go inside.

71
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,970
No. Let's clean this up before my aunt wakes up.

72
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,700
Shouldn't we call the police?

73
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,560
It's okay. This isn't the first time, anyway.

74
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,260
If they really were going to harm us, they would've broken the window, and made a ruckus.

75
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,840
Oh. This is...

76
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,760
What?

77
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,610
This is the flyer I saw at Maskun CafÃ©.

78
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,720
I brought a couple of them from Maskun CafÃ©.

79
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Isn't Nerve Candy the cheap hallucinogen?

80
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,920
This Nerve Candy... Don't you think this may be Maskun's hideout?

81
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,670
Let's go.

82
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,500
What's wrong?

83
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,120
Don't you want to know the truth?

84
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,630
Let's go after letting my aunt know.

85
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,910
Do you really think she'll let us go if she knows? Let's just go.

86
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,840
But...

87
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,350
Yeon Woo!

88
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,040
Water!

89
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,630
Yeon Woo!

90
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,610
I'm sorry, Aunt.

91
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,310
I can't give up like this.

92
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,610
I want to find Mom and Go Yoo Han. More than anything, I want to know the truth.

93
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,680
Don't worry so much, since Se Hyun, who's stronger than the bullies, will go with me.

94
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,140
Breakfast is on the table, so be sure to eat before you leave.

95
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,620
If anything happens, I'll call you and Officer Jung immediately.
- What trouble is he getting into now?

96
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,880
Seriously!

97
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,730
Let me see.

98
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,220
Oh! It's over there.

99
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,050
Let's go.

100
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,970
We... came after seeing this.

101
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,940
Are you still recruiting members?

102
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,310
I have this feeling...

103
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,840
This feeling that this won't be easy.

104
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,190
We'll make it out alive, right?

105
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,460
Welcome!

106
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,830
Everyone, today is the day of the Lazulata event.

107
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,160
Luck is on your side.

108
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,830
Let's go inside.

109
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,830
Did you see how the people's eyes changed?

110
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,230
Yeah.

111
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,270
Isn't Lazulata the beverage we drank at Maskun CafÃ©?

112
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,810
No.

113
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,960
That was Lapis Lazuli tea.

114
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,010
Everyone! I'm in a good mood today.

115
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,420
It's because the best employee was selected this quarter,

116
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,500
and we can open the Lazulata event for you all!

117
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,170
Employee Moon Soo Yeon? Could you stand up for a bit?

118
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,450
She is the fourth quarter's best employee, Ms. Moon Soo Yoon. A round of applause, everyone!

119
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,930
Thank you, Master.

120
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,560
Thank you for appreciating my small efforts.

121
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,460
Oh. It's nothing.

122
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,810
I believe this result was possible because of Ms. Moon Soo Yoon's courage and determination.

123
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,770
Ms. Moon Soo Yoon.

124
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,840
What is that in front of you?

125
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,860
This isâ”€

126
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,050
That's right.

127
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,950
That's not the lazuli tea that helps you see vantablack,

128
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,430
but the Lapis Lazuli, which lets you experience real colors.

129
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,340
Also known as...

130
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,420
Lazulata.

131
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,690
Lapis Lazuli really does exist!

132
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,750
I heard this is very expensive.

133
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,940
This is something you can't buy with money!

134
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,310
- I know, right?
- This is real!

135
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,470
I didn't know they would really give it to us!

136
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,620
Everyone... Quiet!

137
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,160
Ms. Moon Soo Yoon, you may take your seat.

138
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,980
As the community administrator,

139
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,120
Kim Ye Won, here, was selected as the best employee for the first half.

140
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,370
Yes, she received her Probe surgery!

141
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,820
She is now living a new life as a color artist in Canada.

142
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,200
Everybody,

143
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,720
work hard.

144
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,670
And become the best employee. Then the Probe surgery...

145
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,050
is a privilege given to you.

146
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,070
Then, off we go to the colorverse world.

147
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,710
Enjoy.

148
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,770
Uh... What... What is this?

149
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,110
It's a color rush!

150
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,170
Colors!

151
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,150
Goodness! The world is full of color!

152
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,850
De-coloring?

153
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,630
No! No!
