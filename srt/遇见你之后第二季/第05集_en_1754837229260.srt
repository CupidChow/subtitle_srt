2
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,650
What?

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:23,220
On that day... you knew my sister was Dododok, Gray Scale's administrator, right?

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,740
Yeah.

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,110
But then, why aren't you asking me about anything?

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,290
If I ask... will you answer?

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,580
I decided to completely trust Yeon Woo ever since that day.

8
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,170
Yeon Woo, do you know how to crack passwords?

9
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,870
Can you crack this with a program, too?

10
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,660
No.

11
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,290
- This t-shirt...
- I bought it for her.

12
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,350
There's a cheap quality store in Gangnam Station.

13
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,070
Your sister left a signal for you to recognize in case something happened to her.

14
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,770
And I couldn't recognize it, but you could.

15
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,550
They don't ask for a nickname, name, or phone number.

16
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,650
Just the reservation number.

17
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,200
Whatever it is, we'll find out when we get there.

18
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,480
This is...

19
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,810
What about an alley without a sign?

20
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,440
- This is it!
- Here?

21
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,020
I can find the address with the utility pole serial number.

22
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,930
Okay. Let's go.

23
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,590
This is a secret cafÃ©.

24
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,660
If we go without any preparation, we'll probably just get beat up, let alone find a single clue.

25
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,680
No. They're the ones who'll get the beating.

26
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,060
This is my gift to you for finding Maskun.

27
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,610
Hey! What kind of gift is this? Hey!

28
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,360
Number?

29
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,110
1920.

30
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,310
Don't you know the rule? One per person.

31
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,660
3840.

32
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,360
You have a boyfriend?

33
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,130
- Is this place...
- No. If it was, then they wouldn't be here.

34
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,410
That's true.

35
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,150
1920? 3840?

36
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,850
Yes, that's us. How did you know?

37
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,220
Four-digit number means you're a first-time customer. Both of you are Mono, right?

38
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,970
Yes, both of us...

39
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,290
You don't have to speak formally. I'm a second-year in high school, too. Follow me.

40
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,740
I'm a second-year in high school, too?

41
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,620
Then, that means she knows we're second-years.

42
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,410
Doesn't that mean she knows about us?

43
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,770
Oh! How perceptive! By any chance, are you Sherlock?

44
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,200
This is nothing. Conan?

45
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,320
Drink it.

46
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,960
What is it?

47
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,430
Lapis lazuli tea. It's the most popular drink here.

48
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,940
It doesn't have poison or alcohol in it.

49
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,290
I heard this was very expensive and that it was a blue pill.

50
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,390
The pill is expensive, and this just gets you in the mood.

51
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,370
For Level One's, I'll give the first drink for free.

52
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,610
It tastes so good.

53
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,940
Ah... I was a bit thirsty.

54
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,890
Sit down immediately if you're done drinking.

55
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,350
Why?

56
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,310
You'll probably fall if you don't.

57
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,720
What are you talking...

58
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,970
How can Se Hyun see vantablack?

59
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,830
You're... a Mono?

60
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,990
What a turn of events. Se Hyun is also a Mono.

61
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,240
So he was in the darkness without a Probe,

62
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,880
hiding the scary thirst for one

63
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,090
and endured it all alone?

64
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,500
Seeing your sister fall into that temptation, you know how scary it is

65
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,830
and yet... you endured it all on your own?

66
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,020
How...

67
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,530
did you endure that pain...

68
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,510
without showing any of it?

69
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,810
I...

70
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,210
just endured it.

71
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,240
This candy is Mono Nerve Chromat. Also known as Nerve Candy.

72
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,470
It's a medicine that makes you experience vantablack more intensely.

73
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,570
You can fall into a never-ending blackness if you eat this with the lazuli tea.

74
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,300
It's cheap and super addicting.

75
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,130
You'll slowly need more candy.

76
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,600
So, don't you guys ever eat the Nerve Candy.

77
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,110
Who are you... that you know about us and give us information?

78
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,180
I'm just a part-timer at Maskun CafÃ©, and giving guidance is my job.

79
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,720
Get to the point. What do you want from us?

80
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,130
The blue pill you guys talked about earlier...

81
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,100
Lapis lazuli, which lets Monos experience a color rush

82
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,320
is not a medicine you can buy just because you can afford it.

83
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,690
You have to become an official member of Maskun.

84
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,100
And when you become a member...

85
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,780
Members can share all their secrets with each other.

86
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,650
Everything that has to do with Mono and Probe.

87
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,860
Does that mean they can find information about the Monos' disappearance case?

88
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,840
Maskun seems like an offline gathering of Gray Scale.

89
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,450
Recently, there is a drug mentioned online, that is associated with narcotic sales.

90
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,380
Lapis lazuli.

91
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,210
It is a medicine for Monos, who experience neurotic color blindness.

92
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,630
It is called Lapis Lazuli Aven, also known as Lapis Lazuli.

93
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,720
The substance called Lapis Lazuli Aven mentioned in this document does not exist.

94
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,090
The chemical formula is impossible, and everything in this document seems fabricated.

95
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,910
It is one of the scams that have been popular among Monos in these past few years.

96
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,560
It is an illegal drug and has been advertised to help see color when consumed.

97
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,840
However, as you can see, its chemical formula itself is fake, and this drug does not exist.

98
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,330
The people who attempted to buy this medicine have all gone missing.

99
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,030
We are revealing the identities of the missing people with the consent of their families.

100
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,960
Some people have returned to their families, but as cold corpses.

101
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,760
The remains of a man in his 30's were found.

102
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,660
It is reported that the remains had traces of surgery and were disposed of wrapped in plastic.

103
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,650
The remains belong to Yeo Dong Jin, whose name was on the bankbook record.

104
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,570
This is a serial case of the blue pills and Mono's disappearance.

105
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,720
This is not just a simple missing person case,

106
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,500
but a crime using a fake drug to lure, kidnap, and murder.

107
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,790
We'll be waiting for everyone's tips.

108
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,560
Isn't this fake news?

109
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,190
Let's not be fooled. This world is all fake.

110
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,660
We're the real ones.

111
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,700
Se Hyun was right. My aunt blew away

112
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,920
the fantasy behind Lapis lazuli with one broadcast.

113
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,870
Although the Monos here didn't believe it.

114
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,080
This was forcibly broadcasted.

115
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,700
You're right. A music video was playing.

116
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,390
Then "Chase Truth" was broadcasted.

117
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,260
That means someone is controlling the transmission system here.

118
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,500
Who in the world did this?

119
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,390
Let's leave. There's no need to stay here any longer.

120
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,530
That broadcast earlier... it was forced.

121
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,430
This caseâ”€

Timing and Subtitles by the Somewhere over the Rainbow ðŸŒˆ Team @ Viki

123
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,230
Success!

124
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,770
I can't believe I'm using the program that I was going to use on April Fools Day to play a broadcast prank here.

125
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,810
Everyone should be safe now, right?

126
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,500
I hope we can all see each other at school.
