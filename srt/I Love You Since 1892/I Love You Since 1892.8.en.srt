1
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,531
Are you saying you're not
mad at me anymore?

2
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,992
This is the first time
that you'll attend

3
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,411
the birthday celebration of the
Governor General.

4
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,912
Miss Carmelita...

5
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,497
Do not dance provocatively!

6
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,473
Oops!

7
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,750
Miss Carmelita...

8
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,838
May I dance the Cariñosa with you?

9
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,890
Trinidad's family was murdered?

10
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:00,077
I promised Trinidad and Nestor...

11
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,689
That I will not stop until I discover

12
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,191
who had them murdered.

13
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,235
How can you murder
Trinidad's whole family?

14
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,654
I didn't expect my own daughter

15
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,115
to believe the lies made

16
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,825
to ruin her Father's reputation.

17
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,286
The one who will kill Juanito,

18
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,162
is it still the same person?

19
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,539
I'm sure it's still the same people.

20
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,125
People? So there's more than one?

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,823
You must also ensure
the safety of the Montecarlos family.

22
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:41,012
Oh no! I can't fall in
love with Juanito. I can't!

23
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,105
Carmelita is the one destined for Juanito.

24
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:47,208
But I am the one Juanito met.

25
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,064
I mean... this is still my body.

26
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,694
I'm still me, the original Carmela.

27
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,704
How about Helena?

28
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,917
Should I ask Juanito
if he still likes Helena?

29
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,795
But I can't!

30
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,547
No. I can't.

31
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:23,054
Should I still push Juanito
and Helena for each other?

32
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,762
I also can't do that. I
mean, how about Carmelita?

33
00:04:28,787 --> 00:04:31,623
I mean... how about me?

34
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,942
No, that's not important. You know what?

35
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,794
What's more important

36
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:43,458
is how Juanito found
out about my real name?

37
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,161
Did Mother Olivia tell him?

38
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,185
Let go of me.

39
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,231
Miss, what are you doing here?

40
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:34,595
Why are you drinking alcohol?

41
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:37,130
What's it to you if I want to get drunk?

42
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,997
I don't care if you tell my Daddy

43
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:44,442
or cut my allowance, go ahead!

44
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,797
What are you talking about?

45
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:50,657
Hey, wait! That's mine.

46
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:55,915
Did you drink all my wine?

47
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,859
You drank all my wine!

48
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,653
- Miss. That's enough.
- No! Give me that!

49
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,324
Give me wine! Give me more wine!

50
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,591
- I want more wine! Give me more--
- Miss!

51
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:10,659
Be quiet!

52
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:13,979
You'll get reprimanded and
punished by Mother Olivia.

53
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:15,887
Ouch!

54
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,309
Miss Carmelita, let's go.

55
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,839
I don't want to.

56
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,675
- Miss, come. I'll take you to your room.
- I said I don't want to!

57
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,786
- Miss! Miss, please don't!
- Daddy! Daddy, help me!

58
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,919
Miss Carmelita, please don't be too loud.

59
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:33,029
Okay, I won't be loud.

60
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:34,555
Quiet, shh...

61
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,501
Miss, you are too drunk. You need to rest.

62
00:06:38,526 --> 00:06:40,075
Come, let's go.

63
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:42,379
- I said no!
- But Miss...

64
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:47,525
Miss Carmelita, you need
to get some rest. You--

65
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,841
I am not Carmelita.

66
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:55,702
So don't call me Carmelita.

67
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:01,796
Miss Carmelita, you are very drunk. Come.

68
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,214
I'll assist you.

69
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,715
I'll take you to your room...

70
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,583
I said I'm not Carmelita!

71
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,265
I am a humble impostor!

72
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,474
Ouch!

73
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,083
Alright, fine.

74
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,318
You're not Miss Carmelita.

75
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:28,886
Then who are you?

76
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:34,858
Me? I'm Carmela.

77
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:40,247
I think this is some sort of punishment.

78
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:43,734
Because some people say I'm mean

79
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,841
and always gets into fights.

80
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,778
I always disagree with my Dad and siblings.

81
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,184
Carmelita, on the other hand...

82
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,106
She's nice and respectful...

83
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,147
She always gets praised by Doña Soledad

84
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:04,145
and Don Alejandro.

85
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,020
But...

86
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:10,356
It's so exhausting being her.

87
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:13,088
I need to be mindful of her reputation.

88
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,164
Are you saying you're Carmelita

89
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,934
when you're acting refined
around your parents?

90
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,559
And you're Carmela

91
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:29,605
when you're easy-going
whenever you're around me?

92
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,067
It's kind of like that but not really.

93
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:37,098
You should... learn to know
the differences between them.

94
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:40,042
Who do you like better?

95
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,973
If I had to choose...

96
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,731
I like you when you're Carmela because...

97
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,708
Good thing Juanito
misunderstood the whole thing.

98
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:38,661
He thinks that I'm talking
about different personas.

99
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:45,480
He didn't realize that Carmelita and
Carmela are literally two different people.

100
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:48,944
Carmelita, Juanito sent a letter for you.

101
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:54,671
Miss Carmelita, I would like to invite you

102
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,817
to an important trip tomorrow.

103
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,119
- Mr. Pipoy.
- Good morning, Juanito.

104
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:10,481
Do you have news of my wife?

105
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:13,889
I asked my Father for help.

106
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:17,556
The search continues even
without news of her whereabouts.

107
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:24,301
Ladies, this is Mr. Pipoy

108
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:26,950
Sergio introduced me to him a few days ago.

109
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:31,195
My brother is helping
me with my investigation.

110
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:34,614
What are you investigating?

111
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,864
Aside from searching
for Mr. Pipoy's wife...

112
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,223
I'm also shedding light

113
00:10:41,248 --> 00:10:43,747
to the truth behind the
murder of Trinidad's family.

114
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,809
This woman is named Cristeta.

115
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,032
She's the daughter of Trinidad and Nestor.

116
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,951
I've just finished cleaning headstones...

117
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:57,426
When I saw her crying and wounded.

118
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,618
That is why I took her home.

119
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,622
Cristeta, how did you survive?

120
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:11,418
After putting sacks over us,

121
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,737
they took us to a secluded place...

122
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:17,137
A man was supposed to shoot me.

123
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:21,372
But a man wearing black suddenly came.

124
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,856
He said...

125
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:25,989
I'm safe.

126
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:29,602
In return, I have to say that Don
Alejandro was the mastermind.

127
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,950
I cannot do it.

128
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:39,773
I don't want a family to
be ruined because of a lie.

129
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,903
Cristeta...

130
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:48,891
Cristeta?

131
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,216
Are you alright?

132
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,004
- Cristeta!
- What's happening to you?

133
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,593
Write a letter of apology to Father.

134
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:02,776
And if it's alright with you,

135
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,833
I'll accompany Mr. Pipoy
in taking Cristeta home.

136
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:09,755
I also want to pray for her family.

137
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,153
- Cristeta, come on, let's go.
- Cristeta...

138
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,051
Come.

139
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,012
So you can ease your worries.

140
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,309
We're going somewhere.

141
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,528
What are we even doing here?

142
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,030
Isn't reading books one of your hobbies?

143
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:02,004
Oh, I forgot that in
this era I'm Carmelita,

144
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:04,073
a certified bookworm.

145
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:06,517
There's something I want you to read.

146
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,370
To me?

147
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,640
I think...

148
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,856
I'm feeling dizzy.

149
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:17,760
You know, I think I won't be able to read
for a few months...

150
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:19,997
If you need someone to
read for you, I am here.

151
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,450
Don't you worry.

152
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:29,505
Why do you always say that
you're gonna be there for me?

153
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,802
That's not true.

154
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:34,704
You can't accompany
me to every single thing.

155
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:37,065
And there's no such thing as forever.

156
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,989
I mean... nothing lasts forever.

157
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:41,596
I can take care of myself.
Look at my muscles.

158
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,957
You really don't
have to be alone.

159
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:48,321
Because I'd like to be with you.

160
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:52,888
Because I'm happy when we're together.

161
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,918
Oh, really?

162
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,257
Don't look for another book.

163
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:08,372
Here is the greatest book.

164
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:15,379
A collection of songs,
poems, and short stories.

165
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,690
All about love.

166
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,747
Alright, fine.

167
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,692
Why do you want to read
a book about love anyway?

168
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:33,635
You know what I'm
interested in? Things like...

169
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,098
Violence. Shows full of action.

170
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,294
Shows?

171
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:45,255
Do you mean to say... theater plays?

172
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,388
Yes?

173
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:56,856
If that's the case... this Sunday, I'll
ask permission from Mother Olivia.

174
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,356
Let's go to the theater.

175
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,012
I am yours and you are mine.

176
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:08,770
That is what's written in the stars.

177
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:11,978
Clouds may cover the skies.

178
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,518
But no one can ever stop us.

179
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,501
In the rising and setting of the sun.

180
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,713
You are what I dream of.

181
00:15:25,252 --> 00:15:28,005
In the midst of hunger and thirst.

182
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,533
You are what I crave for.

183
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,477
The promise that I swore to you.

184
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,989
to never leave you.

185
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:43,371
Rest assured, my heart is steadfast.

186
00:15:44,714 --> 00:15:46,966
My love for you is more than enough.

187
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:58,122
Beautiful. That was beautiful.

188
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,382
How about you, Miss? What
is your favorite poem or story?

189
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:15,216
I forgot the title, but...

190
00:16:15,964 --> 00:16:22,888
It's about a lady who was
supposed to marry a prince.

191
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,042
But she was pushed into a deep well.

192
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,333
And got transported into another world.

193
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:31,153
There, she met a gentleman.

194
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:34,559
And she slowly fell in love with him.

195
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:41,489
But when the prince who was engaged to her
suddenly came...

196
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:44,559
The lady realized that...

197
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:48,259
Her heart now belongs to somebody else.

198
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,614
What happened in the end?

199
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,349
Did they end up together?

200
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,630
Yeah, but...

201
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:58,240
It's just a show, anyway.

202
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:04,946
They can't be together in real life.

203
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,109
They're from different worlds.

204
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:10,075
They're not for each other.

205
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:13,823
Is someone there?

206
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,708
Do you still feel unwell?

207
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:00,707
I can handle it.

208
00:18:03,111 --> 00:18:04,512
But you're upset.

209
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,173
I was just thinking...

210
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:15,482
Why Juanito didn't even visit me?

211
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:19,759
How will he?

212
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:24,817
He and Carmelita were together in the
Governor-General's party a few days ago.

213
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:27,880
Seems like something's
going on between them.

214
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:33,341
Save your strength.

215
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:36,634
Prepare yourself for a battle.

216
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:45,935
Who's there?

217
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,355
Mr. Valdez.

218
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:52,942
What are you doing here? And...

219
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:56,154
Why are you alone together?

220
00:18:57,488 --> 00:19:00,158
- We're not doing anything wrong!
- You're misunderstanding this.

221
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:06,456
You are...

222
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,126
Carmelita?

223
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:17,008
The daughter of Don Alejandro Montecarlos?

224
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:20,762
You were but a child when I last saw you.

225
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:25,016
I am Valentino Valdez.

226
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:30,188
An old friend and former lawyer
of your departed grandfather,

227
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:31,564
Don Santiago.

228
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:36,778
Ahh...

229
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:41,991
Well then, don't you worry.

230
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:46,942
I will just say that I am
with you here in the library.

231
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:55,348
And there's nothing wrong with that since
you are about to get married.

232
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,757
In February, isn't it?

233
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:04,055
Your mother sent me an invitation.

234
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,571
Why did you return so late?

235
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:26,919
What happened to you?
Why is your face so flushed?

236
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:31,364
I'll go inside.

237
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:48,348
Good evening, Mother Olivia.

238
00:21:21,674 --> 00:21:25,428
Shocks. Juanito is my first kiss.

239
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:27,864
Don't overreact. It's nothing.

240
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:31,976
Our lips just accidentally
touched. That's it!

241
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:35,563
I need to get this out of my head.

242
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:36,856
Wait...

243
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:42,780
I have to write a letter to Don Alejandro.

244
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:53,956
Dear Father, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

245
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,043
That's it.

246
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:01,923
I'll explain it ASAP.

247
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:04,550
Bye.

248
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,011
Tc.

249
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:09,555
Ily.

250
00:22:10,348 --> 00:22:11,641
Imy.

251
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:15,811
More loves, Carmelita.

252
00:22:16,437 --> 00:22:20,608
Your things. You forgot
it in Mother Olivia's room.

253
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:28,407
Where did you and Juanito go to last night
and why were you together?

254
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:32,036
Wait, why would I let
myself be bullied by this girl?

255
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:33,663
Why not?

256
00:22:33,663 --> 00:22:35,247
What did you say?

257
00:22:35,748 --> 00:22:38,834
Easy, Carmela. Don't give
yourself more problems.

258
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:42,338
Why don't we eat and pray?

259
00:22:42,338 --> 00:22:44,632
They're surely waiting
for us. I'll go ahead.

260
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:55,324
Hail Mary, full of grace.

261
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:58,229
The Lord is with you.

262
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:58,938
Blessed are you among women,

263
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:00,606
Lord God.

264
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:04,176
Did you know how many times
I tried to stay away from Juanito.

265
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:08,914
Guide my heart. I
don't want to fall for him.

266
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:12,076
Now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

267
00:23:12,076 --> 00:23:16,914
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with you.

268
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:19,684
Blessed are you among women,

269
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:22,336
and blessed is the fruit
of your womb, Jesus..

270
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,281
Holy Mary, mother of God --

271
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:30,430
Josefina! Josefina! Bring her to her room!

272
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:32,513
Josefina! Take some rest.

273
00:23:33,597 --> 00:23:34,765
Quickly.

274
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:39,270
Mother Olivia...

275
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:43,524
Are you also not feeling well?

276
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,567
Don't worry about me.

277
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:50,809
I just didn't get enough sleep last night.

278
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:55,453
Call a doctor.

279
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,914
Maybe Doctor Hidalgo, is he available?

280
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,501
He went to Paris last week.

281
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,213
What do we do?

282
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:10,801
There isn't a doctor
who could check Josefina

283
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:12,970
How about Juanito?

284
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:17,253
He's studying medicine.
Maybe he can check Josefina?

285
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:25,149
He's not a licensed doctor, Carmelita.

286
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:28,277
Will you risk your sister's life like that?

287
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,585
Josefina has a very high fever.

288
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:51,175
It was Josefina who gave
Helena her food last night.

289
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:58,223
Is it possible she caught
Helena's disease too?

290
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:07,833
Juanito... could you also
check my sister, Helena?

291
00:25:14,615 --> 00:25:16,117
Carmelita.

292
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:20,913
I just want to know my sister's
condition. Please do not worry.

293
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:24,801
Helena also needs Juanito's help.

294
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:29,213
Sure.

295
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,981
Doctor Ramiro already saw Helena yesterday.

296
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,932
He said Helena's already better

297
00:25:39,932 --> 00:25:42,434
and doesn't need to take medication.

298
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:51,610
Thank you, dear boy. For all your help.

299
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:57,199
- Go home and take some rest.
- Yes, Mother Olivia.

300
00:26:00,578 --> 00:26:02,288
Oh, by the way.

301
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:04,206
Mr. Juanito.

302
00:26:04,206 --> 00:26:07,848
Please prescribe the
medicines Josefina needs to take.

303
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:09,712
Give it to Carmelita.

304
00:26:12,882 --> 00:26:14,175
Me?

305
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,044
Ladies...

306
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:26,223
Ignacio.

307
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:29,018
Juanito.

308
00:28:31,228 --> 00:28:33,314
How's Josefina doing?

309
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:35,524
Her fever's quite high.

310
00:28:36,984 --> 00:28:39,862
How about Carmelita?

311
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:41,655
Did you talk to her?

312
00:28:42,948 --> 00:28:43,948
No.

313
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,426
But I left a letter for her.

314
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:43,133
Carmelita, will you let me
take care of Josefina for now?

315
00:29:44,176 --> 00:29:48,222
I want to pay back the
kindness she has given me.

316
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:50,682
Of course.

317
00:29:50,682 --> 00:29:56,313
Juanito gave a list of what
Josefina may or may not eat.

318
00:29:56,313 --> 00:29:58,524
And also the medicines she must take.

319
00:29:58,524 --> 00:29:59,858
The list is over there.

320
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,111
Don't worry.

321
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:06,281
I'll do my best so Josefina
can recover quickly.

322
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,669
I'll go ahead.

323
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:21,296
Carmelita!

324
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:25,259
Did Juanito gave you a letter for me?

325
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,980
He hasn't sent me any letters
since he came back here in Manila.

326
00:30:41,442 --> 00:30:44,945
Maybe... he just got busy with his studies.

327
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:53,662
He has always been busy,

328
00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:55,395
but has never forgotten to write to me.

329
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:05,457
Isn't it very strict in here as well?

330
00:31:06,091 --> 00:31:08,927
Letters couldn't pass through easily,

331
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,346
maybe that's why you haven't received it.

332
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:14,902
Also, everyone knows we're engaged.

333
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:17,478
People might misunderstand.

334
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:22,566
I understand.

335
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:24,943
I am willing to wait.

336
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:31,700
I apologize for acting worried,

337
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,662
but believe me, I don't
have doubts about you.

338
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:42,211
I can see that you don't
have any feelings for Juanito.

339
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:51,528
And I also know how true your
love is for my brother, Leandro

340
00:31:51,553 --> 00:31:52,590
Am I right?

341
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:55,567
Of course.

342
00:31:58,018 --> 00:31:59,228
I'll go ahead, okay?

343
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:41,285
Let's meet at Plaza Santo
Tomas tomorrow afternoon.

344
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:48,664
I already asked Mother Olivia and she gave
her permission for us to go to the theater.

345
00:33:08,964 --> 00:33:12,801
This Sunday, I'll ask
permission from Mother Olivia.

346
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:15,270
Let's go to the theater.

347
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:20,645
I'm sure you'll like the
performances this weekend.

348
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:28,645
I don't know where
and what time we'll meet.

349
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:31,996
But I think he'll fetch me here?

350
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:34,531
Surely he'll come here.

351
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:44,625
Oh no! I don't have that much
accessories here in the dormitory.

352
00:33:57,132 --> 00:34:00,594
I'll just wear this then.
I'm sure I'll be prettier.

353
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:29,613
Don't worry. I have an errand of my own.

354
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:37,386
Why do I feel a little guilty?

355
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:44,426
Carmelita. The one waiting
for you outside is too handsome!

356
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,895
You're such a lucky girl, Carmelita!

357
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:50,020
Oh wow, don't tell me
you're interested in him too?

358
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:52,818
I'm warning you.

359
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:53,819
Of course not!

360
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,781
Alright. I'll go ahead.

361
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:15,674
Good afternoon... Carmelita.

362
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,678
Where is Juanito?

363
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:23,890
What are you doing here?

364
00:35:27,144 --> 00:35:29,813
I feel like melting just from his stare.

365
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:35,569
I wanted to surprise you.

366
00:35:36,278 --> 00:35:40,073
Apologies if I didn't
inform you of my plan.

367
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,078
But... do not worry.

368
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:48,999
Mother Olivia gave me
permission for us to go outside.

369
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:54,379
Gosh... #FeelingBetrayed.

370
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:18,153
It's so pretty in here, don't you think?

371
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:20,113
Just as pretty as you, my love.

372
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:22,699
So they call each other "my love."

373
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:31,416
Carmelita! Mr. Leandro.

374
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:34,461
- Leandro.
- Ignacio.

375
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:36,713
Miss Sonya.

376
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:42,344
What is this? A triple date?

377
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:45,889
Why is Juanito looking at me so sourly?

378
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:49,559
Did he join Natasha in the
Skin-Carmela-Alive Club?

379
00:36:58,177 --> 00:37:01,347
Why didn't you tell me that
you were going out as well?

380
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:06,993
Welcome back, Mr. Leandro.

381
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:10,163
I heard of your return just a few days ago.

382
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:15,418
I meant for my arrival to be a surprise
just for my beloved Carmelita.

383
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:25,512
Is this the first time you saw
one another in seven months?

384
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:29,933
We saw each other a week ago
when I returned to San Alfonso.

385
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:35,772
Gosh! Sonya knows about
Carmelita and Leandro's relationship.

386
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,973
I knew it.

387
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:42,070
That's why you didn't
travel with us to Manila.

388
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,043
It's because you're
waiting for Mr. Leandro.

389
00:37:52,497 --> 00:37:55,709
Helena. You're brother is back now.

390
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:57,676
Yes.

391
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:01,590
Natasha and Helena
visited me earlier today.

392
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:10,351
So, she knew that Leandro
was the one waiting for me.

393
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:13,718
And why is she with Juanito anyway?

394
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:17,898
I wasn't planning on meeting Carmelita yet.

395
00:38:17,898 --> 00:38:19,858
But according to Helena...

396
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,028
My love has been yearning for me.

397
00:38:27,018 --> 00:38:29,867
He called me "my love" in front of Juanito!

398
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:33,371
He's so nonchalant about it.

399
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:36,041
What are you even expecting, Carmela?

400
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:45,231
Here's to your homecoming, Mr. Leandro.

401
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:01,358
Thank you very much, Mr. Ignacio.

402
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:04,903
I also want to extend my warm
congratulations to your wedding.

403
00:39:16,122 --> 00:39:17,791
Mr. Juanito Alfonso.

404
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,961
It's a pleasure meeting you again.

405
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:33,807
And the pleasure's mine as well, Leandro.

406
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:39,145
Do you know my brother, Juanito?

407
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:43,608
We were classmates in our
elementary painting class.

408
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:47,237
Juanito, do you still paint?

409
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:54,577
Why does he keep glancing at me?

410
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:58,873
Not anymore.

411
00:39:58,873 --> 00:40:01,251
My interest in painting already faded.

412
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:15,682
It's funny to think how big Manila is,
but for some reason, you went here too.

413
00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:22,230
My loving husband has been
meaning to take me here for quite awhile.

414
00:40:22,772 --> 00:40:28,737
On the way here, we saw Helena
and Juanito at the Plaza Santo Tomas.

415
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,742
My God, we also didn't know that
they're secretly meeting each other.

416
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:39,497
Ouch! Why did my heart hurt a little bit?

417
00:40:45,545 --> 00:40:48,465
Very well. Let us continue eating.

418
00:41:11,738 --> 00:41:14,866
My love... just look at them.

419
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:19,794
I hope we're as sweet as
them once we get married.

420
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:32,606
Apologies for my behavior.

421
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:36,346
Don't you worry about it, Leandro.

422
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:40,266
We're used to Carmelita's
flirtatious side once in a while.

423
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:45,195
OMG! So Carmelita has a naughty side too!

424
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,140
That explains why Leandro
is so aggressive towards me

425
00:41:48,521 --> 00:41:51,607
since he knows Carmelita is a flirt too.

426
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,626
My love... slow down in
eating. You might choke.

427
00:42:08,336 --> 00:42:09,838
Wait a minute!

428
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:14,092
Who gave you this ring?

429
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:20,083
I'm the one who gave her that ring.

430
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:24,435
It symbolizes my promise
to never be parted with her ever again.

431
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:27,164
And that I will love her for eternity.

432
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:32,068
Why did I wear this ring today?!

433
00:42:41,995 --> 00:42:45,373
Helena, make sure you eat a lot.

434
00:42:48,877 --> 00:42:52,714
Don't mind them, Carmela.
You'll just stress yourself.

435
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:02,940
Helena, when will you say yes to Juanito?

436
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:09,322
The truth is, I really want him to be...

437
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:12,525
Carmelita?

438
00:43:12,525 --> 00:43:14,319
- Water...
- Carmelita?

439
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,445
Here, drink.

440
00:43:19,365 --> 00:43:20,491
Carmelita?

441
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:23,703
Carmelita, are you okay?

442
00:43:29,434 --> 00:43:32,645
So that's why my date
with Juanito didn't happen.

443
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,214
Because he has another date.

444
00:43:34,214 --> 00:43:35,131
Carmelita?

445
00:43:35,131 --> 00:43:37,467
Let me tell you the story
even though you're sleeping.

446
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:40,681
I can't contain this happiness
within me any longer.

447
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:41,804
I hope,

448
00:43:41,804 --> 00:43:44,599
I'll end up with the man
I'm with right now.

449
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:46,059
You don't need to hide.

450
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:47,769
Because no matter where you are,

451
00:43:47,948 --> 00:43:49,199
I will always find you.

452
00:43:50,855 --> 00:43:52,947
You love painting, don't you?

453
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:54,651
You told me

454
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:56,027
it's imposible

455
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:57,779
for a person's interest
to truly disappear.

456
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,864
Then how about you?

457
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:01,616
Before that,
I want to give you something.

458
00:44:01,616 --> 00:44:02,700
I hope you'll like it.

459
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:05,124
What is this for?

460
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:10,843
Helena!

461
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,913
Juanito...

462
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,179
Marry me...

463
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:20,301
Don't bother

464
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:21,469
writing to my Father.

465
00:44:21,469 --> 00:44:23,346
I will deliver the message myself.

466
00:44:23,346 --> 00:44:24,222
So that he'll know

467
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:26,085
that his daughter regained her clarity.
