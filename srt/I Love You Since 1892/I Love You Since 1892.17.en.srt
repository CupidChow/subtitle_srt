1
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:49,403
He has nothing to do

2
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:51,405
with the death of Josefina.

3
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:52,572
I have discovered

4
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:55,283
that they're planning to
execute Juanito.

5
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:57,411
On the 7th of December.

6
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:11,633
Mother Olivia took the fall
for what happened.

7
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,818
And because of that,

8
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:14,344
she was sentenced to death.

9
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,763
I am an angel, Carmela.

10
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:18,223
My name is Faida.

11
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,100
Olivia.

12
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:25,605
What would your father feel...

13
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:28,692
if I send him
your severed head?

14
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:31,316
Mercedes...

15
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,198
Cut off that woman's head!

16
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:36,783
And send it to her father!

17
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:42,166
Juanito!

18
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,707
Just go!

19
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:44,828
Go straight to that path!

20
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,251
- No!
- There's a river there!

21
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:49,171
- The guard's camp is over there!
- I'm not leaving you here, Juanito!

22
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,172
- You must escape!
- I will never leave you!

23
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:51,423
- Go now, Carmela!
- I will never leave you!

24
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,133
I know the truth!

25
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:55,886
You had Josefina killed

26
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:57,429
and you kidnapped Angelito!

27
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:59,674
How could you?!

28
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:01,214
Juanito...

29
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:03,477
I apologize for not
informing you earlier...

30
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:05,061
But Theresita and I are in love.

31
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,898
I'm not afraid
of you anymore, okay?

32
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:08,899
Whoever Juanito loves,

33
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:09,983
I love too.

34
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:11,902
And starting today,

35
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,236
if it's alright with you,

36
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,237
I'll be your mother.

37
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,200
I have been waiting for you,

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,035
but you were not in your room.

39
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:21,244
I already warned you

40
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:24,122
not to hurt my siblings again.

41
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,791
You're lying!

42
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:52,807
Miss.

43
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,287
Did Natasha see you wearing those?

44
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:02,352
So what?

45
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,017
Maybe this is how being
in love really feels like.

46
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:13,866
It's like the world is
filled with happiness.

47
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:28,963
Carmelita.

48
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:30,882
I will explain.

49
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:34,521
- Leandro...
- Let me explain it to you.

50
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,559
Stop it!

51
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:37,379
That's enough!

52
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,016
No matter what you say,

53
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,709
we will never be together!

54
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,750
What happened to you?

55
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:47,919
Carmelita, why did you completely change?

56
00:05:48,837 --> 00:05:49,813
Why does it seem like

57
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:51,756
you’re not the Carmelita I knew?

58
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,369
Huh?

59
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:55,302
No matter what I do

60
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:57,512
and even if I risk my life for you...

61
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,180
Why can't you recognize my love?

62
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:02,508
Until now,

63
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,477
you still can't forgive that time I left?

64
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,154
Is that it?!

65
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:09,091
I left to fulfill my dream.

66
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,609
For the both of us.

67
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,110
It was for the both of us!

68
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:13,945
You are mistaken, Leandro!

69
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:16,948
Even though you got
the position you wanted...

70
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:19,117
Even though you achieved all your dreams...

71
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:22,078
You and me can never
return to what we were.

72
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:24,331
Because everything has changed.

73
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,516
Everything has changed?

74
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,651
Or is it because the one
in your heart has changed?

75
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,127
Tell me the truth.

76
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,052
I said, tell me the truth!

77
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:38,649
Damn it!

78
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:39,922
Leandro!

79
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:41,572
Damn it!

80
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,524
What is my worth to you, Carmelita?

81
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:56,071
Or am I just a shadow from your past?

82
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,908
I loved you with all my honor.

83
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:01,993
And then...

84
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,455
This is how you treat me?!

85
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,715
You made me a fool out of me.

86
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:09,960
You played me.

87
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,179
Made me look stupid.

88
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,822
You played me like a fool!

89
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:17,842
Maybe you thought...

90
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:20,887
You could wrap me
around your fingers forever.

91
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:22,682
Right?

92
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:25,558
General Seleno told me everything.

93
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:28,186
Even though your father paid him

94
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:29,479
to shut his mouth.

95
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,904
That means

96
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:39,406
even before the wedding,

97
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:42,033
Leandro knew about Juanito and I?

98
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:46,830
So that's why he helped me
talk to Mother Olivia in prison.

99
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:49,332
He just wants to make me
fall in back in love with him.

100
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:53,244
Leandro!

101
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:54,352
Stop it!

102
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:56,840
I won't let you and Juanito be happy.

103
00:07:57,382 --> 00:07:58,633
I was the first one you loved.

104
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:01,678
And I will make sure I'm the one you marry.

105
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:03,756
Because you belong to me, Carmelita.

106
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:05,706
You are mine!

107
00:08:10,353 --> 00:08:11,357
Enough!

108
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:37,756
That person is just around here.

109
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,752
They're always watching you

110
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:43,470
and everything you do.

111
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:47,635
What if...

112
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:50,226
It was Leandro who killed Juanito?

113
00:08:58,109 --> 00:08:59,652
I am not afraid of Leandro.

114
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:03,156
And I will fight for you until the end.

115
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:07,494
Don't you believe me?

116
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:11,607
Don't fret.

117
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:14,167
Juanito, I believe in you.

118
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:16,722
The thing is...

119
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,133
Don't ever lose this ever again.

120
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,695
Juanito?

121
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:40,985
That's just the first bullet.

122
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:41,778
Leandro!

123
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:42,987
So that you can't escape.

124
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:44,585
So that you can't escape.Juanito?

125
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:46,741
Juanito, don't leave me here.

126
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,831
Don't die.

127
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,202
Leandro, don't!

128
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:51,800
Did you know that...

129
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:53,540
You're the one who put Juanito in danger?

130
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,626
So don't you dare blame me

131
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:59,170
For what I'm gonna do to him tonight.

132
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,217
Leandro...

133
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:02,857
Don't!

134
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:04,092
[speaks in Spanish]

135
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:05,718
Leandro... don't!

136
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,679
Juanito...

137
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,266
Juanito!

138
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:13,685
Wait, wait! Leandro!

139
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:14,853
Leandro...

140
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,896
Leandro, I'm begging you!

141
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:19,149
Just this once, please.

142
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:20,303
Leandro, don't.

143
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,902
Just this once, Leandro.

144
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,863
Have mercy!

145
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,948
I'm begging you!

146
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,033
Look at me, Leandro.

147
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,451
Leandro, look at me!

148
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:32,078
You're not a murderer, okay?

149
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,680
Just this once.

150
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:41,963
Do you remember?

151
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,593
When I asked you

152
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:49,888
to listen to me explain?

153
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:52,880
Did you listen?

154
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:57,121
Leandro...

155
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:03,943
Leandro, don't.

156
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,297
Leandro, don't.

157
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:12,883
Leandro, don't.

158
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,137
Watch.

159
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:14,954
Leandro!

160
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:16,122
Leandro!

161
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,833
- Wait, no!
- Shoot him.

162
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:21,769
Wait!

163
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:22,811
Juanito!

164
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:24,278
- Leandro!
- Shoot him!

165
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:27,550
Shoot him!

166
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:28,885
Leandro!

167
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:31,596
Leandro!

168
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:32,555
Shoot him!

169
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:33,748
Damn it!

170
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,975
No!

171
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:38,269
Leandro, don't!

172
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,896
- Juanito!
- Damn it!

173
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:40,728
No!

174
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:45,276
- No... don't!
- You son of a bitch!

175
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,488
No!

176
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,544
Juanito!

177
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:40,415
Remember, Carmela.

178
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,585
The moment this diary burns by itself,

179
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,422
that is the sign you failed your mission.

180
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:48,975
That is the sign

181
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:50,883
that Juanito is dead

182
00:12:53,177 --> 00:12:54,679
I failed my mission.

183
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:58,182
I failed to stop the death of my beloved.

184
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:07,483
Miss Carmelita?

185
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:14,948
Who are you?

186
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:17,160
I am Belinda,

187
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:19,412
your new servant.

188
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,458
Esmeralda has been banished

189
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,735
so she couldn't serve you anymore.

190
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,922
Esmeralda was banished

191
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:32,050
because she covered up for Juanito and I.

192
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,260
From this moment on,

193
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:36,679
I have no one on my side.

194
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:39,223
I am truly alone.

195
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:47,440
Miss Carmelita?

196
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:53,321
May I let your guest enter?

197
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:55,687
Alright.

198
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:20,473
Why are you sulking here?

199
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:25,103
We've been waiting for three
days for you to come begging.

200
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:28,940
I will never beg for your mercy.

201
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:32,667
Well, then.

202
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:36,030
It seems like Leandro couldn't do anything

203
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,157
to save you and your family.

204
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,535
Not for long,

205
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:44,580
the rebels will find out that
Juanito died because of you.

206
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,211
Imagine what the jury would think

207
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:53,172
once they discover that a daughter

208
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:56,884
of a prominent government official

209
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:59,470
was in a relationship with a rebel.

210
00:15:01,906 --> 00:15:04,534
Expect that your father
wouldn't be able to do anything

211
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,645
to save you and your
family from their judgment.

212
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,152
That's no problem.

213
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:18,614
But you and Leandro will
pay for Juanito's murder.

214
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:25,872
Juanito was a rebel, Carmelita.

215
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:29,041
And it's Leandro's job

216
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,545
to fight the enemies of the government.

217
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,346
What I just can't accept,

218
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:47,143
is that even though my
brother Leandro is hurting now,

219
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:49,187
you're still on his mind.

220
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:53,649
I don't understand what's
so special about you.

221
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:57,945
Why does this woman hate me so much?

222
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:08,706
Maria!

223
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:10,625
That is beautiful!

224
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:26,724
The winner is Miss Carmelita Montecarlos.

225
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:44,677
Now it's clear to me why
Natasha hates us so intensely.

226
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:47,578
What she went through wasn't so easy.

227
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,920
I don't want Leandro to suffer forever.

228
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,926
That's why I'll help you
and your family survive.

229
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:04,595
On one condition.

230
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:10,059
Marry Leandro.

231
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:17,389
But I will make sure that
your life will be a living hell.

232
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:24,240
Do you really love your brother?

233
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:29,579
Or do you just want to make yourself
feel superior than the rest of us?

234
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:33,960
Who are you to talk to me that way?

235
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:40,654
You know, you shouldn't
have let envy rule your heart.

236
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:44,840
If you know you're smart, kind,

237
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:45,926
and beautiful.

238
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,224
You don't have to compete with all of us.

239
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:57,440
The moment you
compared yourself to others...

240
00:17:58,274 --> 00:17:59,275
You already lost.

241
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,803
Carmelita?

242
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:29,455
Helena?

243
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:32,683
I'm sorry, Carmelita.

244
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:36,228
I stayed silent and went away.

245
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:39,982
To get away from my family's cruelty.

246
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:41,032
Don't feel bad.

247
00:18:44,987 --> 00:18:47,406
Your family's sins are not yours.

248
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:52,787
You don't understand.

249
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,212
I have long known that
Juanito was falling for you.

250
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:08,636
Do you remember that time
before Juanito left for Manila?

251
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,307
I went to your house then

252
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:15,351
and told you I'll accept his proposal.

253
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:22,566
I was wearing his grandmother's necklace.

254
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:29,490
But the truth was...

255
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:35,746
If Sonya didn't ask about that necklace...

256
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:40,501
Juanito wouldn't give it to me as a gift.

257
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:46,642
Maybe he was just pressured to do it.

258
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:50,845
And I am aware that

259
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:53,681
Juanito really wanted to
give this necklace to you.

260
00:20:01,272 --> 00:20:05,609
But I still forced
myself to believe that...

261
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:09,697
Juanito was just worried
for you as a friend.

262
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:17,413
That's why when I learned

263
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:20,750
that my father had executed
Trinidad's whole family...

264
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:24,795
I ran away to tell you everything.

265
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,636
But I was deeply hurt

266
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:36,307
when I saw you and Juanito together.

267
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,145
He gave you an envelope...

268
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:50,029
I read what's written in it.

269
00:21:01,582 --> 00:21:04,210
And then, I learned that it's you he loved.

270
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:15,679
That's why I agreed to
Father and Natasha's plan.

271
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:19,558
To ruin your whole family.

272
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:25,481
But why?

273
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:34,073
Because the Alfonso and Montecarlos
families would be too powerful

274
00:21:34,698 --> 00:21:36,951
once you and Juanito get married.

275
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:47,002
They promised me that I can marry Juanito.

276
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:51,215
So I waited for him

277
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:53,592
at the thanksgiving celebration.

278
00:21:57,805 --> 00:21:59,265
There, he confessed.

279
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:04,854
That you

280
00:22:05,563 --> 00:22:07,273
are the one in his heart.

281
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:12,570
And then, we were caught by your parents.

282
00:22:24,665 --> 00:22:27,668
When you said that
you still love Leandro...

283
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,966
Father decided to sacrifice
Don Mariano and General Sergio.

284
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,970
They wanted to include Juanito.

285
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:41,473
But I begged them not to.

286
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:45,811
In exchange,

287
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,647
I promised to go to Spain.

288
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:55,571
Forgive me, Carmelita.

289
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:01,118
I didn't know your sister
and mother would be killed.

290
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:11,253
I just arrived yesterday.

291
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,799
And I learned that Leandro killed Juanito.

292
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:24,391
Forgive me, Carmelita.

293
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:28,562
I'm sorry...

294
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:34,735
Please forgive me.

295
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:37,029
I'm sorry...

296
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,535
I'm sorry, Carmelita.

297
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:02,846
Now I know that Carmela won't be born.

298
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:06,016
There won't be a Carmela
to be the first-born daughter

299
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:08,310
of Mommy Carmenia and Dad.

300
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:10,688
There won't be a Carmela to be the

301
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:12,731
eldest sister of Jenny and Emily.

302
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:15,234
I'm stuck here now,

303
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:17,861
because I failed my mission.

304
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:22,074
I will forever be Carmelita Montecarlos.

305
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:24,576
But I'm hoping

306
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:26,161
that one day,

307
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:30,040
my true family will learn
what happened to me.

308
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,501
I'm hoping,

309
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:35,045
that through this letter,

310
00:24:35,963 --> 00:24:37,339
they will come to understand

311
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:40,801
why I have decided to end it all.

312
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,762
Perhaps this is where all the

313
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:53,308
joy, sadness, anger, regret, sorrow,

314
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:55,269
and love I've felt finally come to an end.

315
00:26:55,727 --> 00:26:58,730
I leave it all here at the Lake of Tears.

316
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:01,984
Your mission is not over Carmela.

317
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:04,903
You need to return.

318
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:07,322
To save the one you love.

319
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:36,774
Just rest, child.

320
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,313
I'm here to watch over you.

321
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:42,191
Don't leave us.

322
00:28:26,693 --> 00:28:28,904
Even though he committed
a lot of bad things...

323
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,365
I still cannot blame him.

324
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:34,618
I was the reason why
he did all those things

325
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:36,578
that weren't supposed to happen

326
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:39,706
in Carmela and Juanito's original timeline.

327
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:42,876
But because I arrived here...

328
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:44,878
Everything changed.

329
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:54,513
Is there still a chance for me to go home?

330
00:28:55,138 --> 00:28:58,600
Or am I destined to stay
in this timeline forever?

331
00:29:01,144 --> 00:29:02,253
Maria.

332
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:04,650
Maria!

333
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:07,776
My sister...

334
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:10,559
Maria?

335
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,342
She's gone...

336
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,276
Mother is gone.

337
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:31,258
She's already gone.

338
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,100
Maria...

339
00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:44,556
Carmelita...

340
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:48,129
I'm sorry.

341
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:52,404
I'm sorry for not being here.

342
00:29:53,947 --> 00:29:55,574
For not being by your side.

343
00:29:58,827 --> 00:30:01,163
I heard everything from Eduardo.

344
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,252
Even what happened to Juanito.

345
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,469
I know it hurts a lot.

346
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:20,432
And I know it feels like
you don't want to live.

347
00:30:23,143 --> 00:30:24,978
But I thank the Lord...

348
00:30:26,646 --> 00:30:28,106
That you're still here with us.

349
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:31,943
I'm sorry, Maria.

350
00:30:33,612 --> 00:30:34,695
I'm sorry...

351
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,326
It's a good thing

352
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,661
I searched for you immediately.

353
00:30:44,915 --> 00:30:46,500
And when I couldn't find you...

354
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,713
I saw Juanito's necklace in your room.

355
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:55,217
That you've always worn.

356
00:30:58,261 --> 00:30:59,429
That's when I realized

357
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:01,640
that you might have done
something to harm yourself.

358
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,772
Belinda and I saw your
slippers at the Lake of Tears.

359
00:31:10,273 --> 00:31:11,566
I waded through the lake immediately.

360
00:31:13,026 --> 00:31:15,946
And that's when I finally saw you...

361
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:18,532
Slowly sinking into the water.

362
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,912
I thought I was going to lose you as well.

363
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,416
I'm sorry.

364
00:31:34,756 --> 00:31:35,757
I cannot take it anymore.

365
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,052
I give up.

366
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:40,804
I don't want this.

367
00:31:42,055 --> 00:31:43,181
I don't want this.

368
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:49,980
I understand, Carmelita.

369
00:31:53,108 --> 00:31:54,943
We remember everything.

370
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,906
We must continue with our lives.

371
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:04,369
For the people who love us.

372
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:14,421
Mother is gone.

373
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:19,050
As well as Josefina.

374
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:26,141
And I will not survive
if you left me as well.

375
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,193
Father Orlando heard about what happened.

376
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:40,030
And he wants to talk to you.

377
00:32:43,617 --> 00:32:47,913
I suspect the news leaked
because of the servants.

378
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:54,419
I don't want to, Maria.

379
00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:59,716
Just tell him that I'm already repentant.

380
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:11,770
Carmelita...

381
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,399
You must be brave.

382
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:20,987
You must face your problems head-on.

383
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:25,509
Because nothing will
happen if you just continue

384
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:26,660
to run away.

385
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,608
Don't worry, child.

386
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:03,780
The Lord knows that you are
deeply regretting what you did.

387
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:05,574
Stop your tears, child.

388
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:08,159
There's something I'd like to show you.

389
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:46,406
This is me.

390
00:34:48,116 --> 00:34:49,451
Who painted this?

391
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:18,415
Juanito...

392
00:35:32,994 --> 00:35:34,579
I fulfilled my promise.

393
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,334
That no matter what happens...

394
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:42,629
I will stay alive.

395
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:49,552
Bergilio followed me.

396
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,890
When they saw what Leandro did to me,

397
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,600
they informed Catapang right away.

398
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:01,898
They ambushed Leandro

399
00:36:02,273 --> 00:36:04,109
while they were attempting to dump my body.

400
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,407
They took me to Father Orlando

401
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:12,242
and begged him to hide me.

402
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,466
I'm happy you already saw this.

403
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:36,391
Juanito didn't paint Carmelita's portrait.

404
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:39,686
But why did Juanito paint my portrait now?

405
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:53,071
I promise...

406
00:36:54,409 --> 00:36:56,578
We'll see each other again in 10 days.

407
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:20,602
I've been avoiding him for weeks now,

408
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,854
but he still won't give up.

409
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:25,398
If he discovers that Juanito's still alive,

410
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:28,234
Leandro might try to kill him again.

411
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:33,651
Leandro?

412
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:38,369
Good morning, Carmelita.

413
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:41,460
This is for you.

414
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,098
How are you?

415
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,091
I had heard

416
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:54,928
what happened to you at the lake.

417
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:00,266
Carmelita, you need to learn how to swim.

418
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:02,977
So that you can save yourself

419
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:04,312
if you somehow get into the deep.

420
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,193
I visit you everyday

421
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,487
to make sure you're fine.

422
00:38:13,863 --> 00:38:14,923
If...

423
00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:16,533
You wish to bathe in the lake,

424
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,249
I will accompany you.

425
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:20,745
So that I can ensure your safety.

426
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:26,334
Don Alejandro didn't tell him

427
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:28,545
the truth about my drowning.

428
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:35,927
Did you receive my letter?

429
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:40,265
The one I handed to Natasha

430
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:41,764
to give to you?

431
00:38:46,985 --> 00:38:48,273
I hope you'll read it.

432
00:38:52,485 --> 00:38:54,696
You must do something about him, Carmela!

433
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:01,251
How are you?

434
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:06,664
I'm good.

435
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:09,085
Busy at work.

436
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,716
But...

437
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,883
It won't stop me from visiting you.

438
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:19,262
Maybe if he didn't try to kill Juanito,

439
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:21,931
we could still be friends.

440
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:26,394
I did become quite
comfortable in his company.

441
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:40,491
I long for your kiss.

442
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:07,602
Why are you...

443
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:10,313
Pouting your lips?

444
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:14,567
Are you feeling alright?

445
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,447
Shit, that was just my imagination?

446
00:40:21,115 --> 00:40:22,121
It's just...

447
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,910
Do you feel feverish?

448
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:26,201
No, I'm just

449
00:40:26,245 --> 00:40:27,872
thankful to you.

450
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:28,940
That...

451
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,460
You don't take advantage of my weakness.

452
00:40:34,587 --> 00:40:36,464
I have a lot of respect for you, Carmelita.

453
00:40:37,924 --> 00:40:39,926
I am willing to wait no matter how long.

454
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:44,187
And also,

455
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:46,260
I'm the only one who's been talking.

456
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:48,233
It's your turn.

457
00:40:48,726 --> 00:40:50,728
Tell me a story from your childhood.

458
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:52,689
Hmmm...

459
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:57,485
My sister and I used to fight all the time

460
00:40:57,485 --> 00:40:58,820
over simple things.

461
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:00,287
And then

462
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:01,990
Dad would reprimand us -

463
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:04,747
I mean, Father.

464
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:06,633
And then,

465
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:09,414
he will ground us...

466
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:13,042
It means he'll lock us in our room.

467
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,882
Carmelita...

468
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:25,138
I hope we had met when were still young.

469
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:32,020
I'm sure I will keep so much memories...

470
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:34,605
About you, forever.

471
00:41:48,828 --> 00:41:50,663
I grew up in Manila.

472
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:54,292
Because I focused on my studies.

473
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:59,505
I only came home during
Christmas and the Feast.

474
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:00,511
Here in San Alfonso.

475
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:03,801
That's why I don't
know a lot of ladies here.

476
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:09,223
So that means you got to
know a lot of ladies in Manila?

477
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:10,947
Yes.

478
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:14,999
But...

479
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,566
I never fell,

480
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,777
nor courted anyone.

481
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:25,073
How about Helena?

482
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:28,367
As for Helena...

483
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:33,164
During the Thanksgiving to the patron...

484
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:36,334
Sonya was supposed to introduce me to her.

485
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:39,504
But she ran away.

486
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:42,465
That's why when I returned to Manila,

487
00:42:42,465 --> 00:42:44,258
I received a letter from her.

488
00:42:46,094 --> 00:42:48,721
I was only able to reply
maybe once or twice.

489
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:51,390
To her letter.

490
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:56,020
That's why when I came home to San Alfonso,

491
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,438
I wanted to meet her.

492
00:42:58,147 --> 00:42:58,981
And right there...

493
00:43:00,608 --> 00:43:03,903
We were caught by Don
Alejandro and my father together.

494
00:43:06,197 --> 00:43:07,524
That means,

495
00:43:07,657 --> 00:43:11,285
when I saw Juanito looking
at Helena's bedroom window,

496
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:13,621
they still hadn't met one another?

497
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:17,541
I'll admit.

498
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:20,531
I was glad

499
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:24,419
when you helped me
and Helena became closer.

500
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:29,512
But I cannot get you out of my mind.

501
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,767
I am happier when I'm with you.

502
00:43:38,229 --> 00:43:40,815
My heart gets lighter
when I make you smile.

503
00:43:44,277 --> 00:43:45,319
It didn't take long

504
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:48,948
for me to realize

505
00:43:48,948 --> 00:43:50,366
I was falling for you.

506
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,374
I learned that you and
Leandro were lovers before.

507
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:02,545
And I realized then...

508
00:44:03,462 --> 00:44:04,630
That you still love him.

509
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,842
Because you told me

510
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:09,802
that your first love

511
00:44:10,303 --> 00:44:12,054
went somewhere far away.

512
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:15,975
I was talking about James Gilbert!

513
00:44:16,267 --> 00:44:17,333
But ...

514
00:44:18,477 --> 00:44:19,687
what makes me happier

515
00:44:21,765 --> 00:44:23,601
is the fact that in the
end, you still chose me.

516
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,910
And I believe

517
00:44:35,077 --> 00:44:36,621
that no matter what happens,

518
00:44:37,872 --> 00:44:38,915
until the end,

519
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:41,417
you will always choose me.

520
00:45:03,397 --> 00:45:04,540
Carmelita,

521
00:45:04,565 --> 00:45:05,399
please stop!

522
00:45:05,399 --> 00:45:07,443
Juanito, I'm begging you.

523
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:09,237
Please, I beg you...

524
00:45:09,403 --> 00:45:12,240
Even though Helena is the one you love.

525
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,491
Just marry me.

526
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,285
Because I'm so in love with you, Juanito.

527
00:45:16,661 --> 00:45:18,037
I love you very much.

528
00:45:19,121 --> 00:45:20,187
I'm sorry.

529
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,709
I believe you will find
someone else who will love you.

530
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:31,550
What are you saying?!

531
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:33,987
Huh!?

532
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:37,139
I cannot accept this!

533
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:40,518
You will regret this...

534
00:45:41,092 --> 00:45:42,552
You will regret this...

535
00:45:42,895 --> 00:45:44,730
I swear you will regret all of this!

536
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,209
A payment of gold.

537
00:46:12,133 --> 00:46:13,426
Kill Juanito.

538
00:46:14,427 --> 00:46:15,428
But what if I get discovered...

539
00:46:15,428 --> 00:46:18,055
Captain Flores and Natasha already know.

540
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:20,342
It's something between the four of us.

541
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:26,439
I know you desire the position and power
of the Alfonso family.

542
00:46:27,982 --> 00:46:29,317
And the only thing I want...

543
00:46:30,693 --> 00:46:31,944
is the life of Juanito.

544
00:46:33,487 --> 00:46:35,865
Kill him at the end of February.

545
00:46:50,713 --> 00:46:52,048
Miss?

546
00:46:53,007 --> 00:46:54,133
Are you alright?

547
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:55,718
Did you have a nightmare?

548
00:46:56,602 --> 00:46:57,636
Wait,

549
00:46:58,679 --> 00:46:59,680
Belinda,

550
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,015
why is my room a mess?

551
00:47:01,432 --> 00:47:02,446
Miss...

552
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:06,103
You were the one who
hung all of these curtains.

553
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:11,192
You also asked me to buy
you embroidery supplies

554
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:13,611
and you did nothing but that the whole day.

555
00:47:15,613 --> 00:47:17,114
Belinda, what is the date today?

556
00:47:18,648 --> 00:47:20,534
It's the 2nd day of February, Miss.

557
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:23,162
That means,

558
00:47:23,496 --> 00:47:25,623
I was out of it for three days.

559
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:27,317
What happened?

560
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:29,168
Why can't I remember anything?

561
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,932
I am here.

562
00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:51,991
Oh, Lord...

563
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:54,857
It was Carmelita who was
behind Juanito's murder.

564
00:47:55,863 --> 00:47:59,492
How can I do my mission if
Carmelita can control my body?

565
00:48:13,462 --> 00:48:15,297
How can you be sure, Juanito?

566
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:16,799
She has proven time and again,

567
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:18,843
that she does not agree
with her Father's wrongdoings.

568
00:48:18,843 --> 00:48:20,886
She has also
covered for us several times.

569
00:48:21,262 --> 00:48:23,055
He's at the church in San Alfonso.

570
00:48:24,098 --> 00:48:25,975
He is hidden by Father Orlando.

571
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:27,518
Why did you
write a letter to Mr. Caloy?

572
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,896
Father is forcing them to confess

573
00:48:30,896 --> 00:48:32,440
which of them is allied with Catapang.

574
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,650
Most of them
have an X mark on their body.

575
00:48:38,237 --> 00:48:39,238
How do you know that?

576
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:42,283
Which one?

577
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:44,201
Wait!

578
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:45,323
Don't come any closer!

579
00:48:45,453 --> 00:48:46,484
Don't!

580
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:48,556
Don't!

581
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:49,670
Don't!

582
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:52,736
Don't!
