1
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:48,062
Every time I see you,

2
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:50,940
I remember the betrayal
your father did to our family.

3
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:53,442
Just pretend that
we haven't met at all.

4
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:55,403
Juanito! Juanito!

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,342
It's mother!

6
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,407
I didn't think

7
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:02,576
we'll see each other again
after we bid our goodbye in Sugbu.

8
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:04,245
I wanted to

9
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:05,959
fix

10
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:07,248
and get something back here.

11
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:08,833
And I'm hoping...

12
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,584
It's not too late.

13
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,253
I want to show you

14
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:14,004
how pure my intentions are.

15
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,256
Don't worry.

16
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:16,841
I'll tell Father

17
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:18,968
that the wedding
with Leandro will not happen.

18
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:20,350
I am here

19
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,139
to know you.

20
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:24,140
That Carmelita

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,141
has decided

22
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,767
to be a servant of the church.

23
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:29,395
I will give you
more time to think.

24
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:30,538
Carmelita.

25
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:31,564
I'm hoping...

26
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:33,733
You'd still choose
me in the end.

27
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:36,402
I will never forget this night.

28
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:37,319
The night

29
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,613
when the firefly found...

30
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,407
The woman he was dreaming of.

31
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:45,244
Is it true you are marrying
Maria off to Governor Flores?

32
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,290
Carmelita,

33
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,208
ask forgiveness from Father.

34
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:24,445
Esmeralda, I command
you to stop this right now!

35
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:27,489
I apologize, Miss Josefina.

36
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:30,743
I will only follow Don Alejandro.

37
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:32,828
And he specifically told me

38
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:36,290
to watch over Miss Carmelita's punishment.

39
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:41,462
Wait...

40
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,796
Esmeralda!

41
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:44,423
I beg you.

42
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:46,759
Have mercy on Carmelita.

43
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,720
Esmeralda, I beg you.

44
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:07,237
Raise your arms, Miss.

45
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,636
I'm alright, Josefina.

46
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:31,612
I can do it.

47
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:32,613
I can do it.

48
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:33,652
I can do it.

49
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,012
I remember,

50
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:41,313
when Maria and I were kids...

51
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:45,401
The love between Father
and Mother wasn't deep.

52
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:48,362
Because they, too, were
only arranged in marriage.

53
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,157
Even though they had children...

54
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,035
We can really feel

55
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:56,887
that love is lacking.

56
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:01,458
And when Mother gave birth to you...

57
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:04,719
Everything changed.

58
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,341
Because of your

59
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:11,719
joyful and affectionate nature...

60
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:14,563
You pulled them closer.

61
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:17,933
And they learned to love each other.

62
00:06:19,518 --> 00:06:21,103
Because of you,

63
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:25,024
our family became whole.

64
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:30,972
I can sense that,

65
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:34,992
I will be the reason why
the Montecarlos family might fall apart.

66
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,953
I understand.

67
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,747
You are becoming your own woman.

68
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,528
But I hope you won't let
our family fall apart again.

69
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,941
Miss,

70
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:51,467
it was Don Alejandro's strict orders.

71
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,720
You cannot stand up from here

72
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,472
until he says so.

73
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:01,560
Carmelita!

74
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,272
Carmelita.

75
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,025
Carmelita.

76
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:13,405
I will ask Father for forgiveness.

77
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:24,500
Come here, stand up.

78
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:45,187
Father, please have mercy!

79
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:47,314
Father, please have mercy.

80
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,192
Get out of here for now.

81
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:52,402
Didn't I tell you to kneel on salt?!

82
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:54,941
You're disobeying me again, Carmelita!

83
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:57,032
And you, Josefina!

84
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:59,368
You must learn to discipline your sister!

85
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,098
Father,

86
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:04,206
forgive me!

87
00:08:05,207 --> 00:08:08,168
But Carmelita have something to say to you.

88
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,337
I have no time for this! Get out!

89
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,538
Mother, please help us.

90
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:27,104
Stop this insolence!

91
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:32,734
You brought shame into our family!

92
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:38,615
You tainted my name in
front of Gobernadorcillo Flores!

93
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,954
How long will you and Carmelita
keep causing me problems?!

94
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,090
First thing tomorrow,

95
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:57,551
You will have that child aborted.

96
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:00,137
Maria is pregnant?

97
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:03,866
Father, please have mercy...

98
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:08,145
I can't bear to lose this child in my womb.

99
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,402
I can't do it, Father.

100
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:15,071
I can't bear to lose this
child in my womb, Father.

101
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,280
I am begging you, please, Father!

102
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:22,492
I won’t allow your child with that gardener

103
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:23,832
to be born into this world!

104
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:27,623
You will have that child aborted.

105
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:32,085
And you will marry Gobernadorcillo Flores.

106
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:35,714
- Father!
- Maria! Please stand up.

107
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:38,590
Father, just let me
give birth to this child!

108
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:43,155
I will still marry Gobernadorcillo Flores.

109
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,141
Father, I beg you!

110
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:51,396
I won't have a disgraced daughter.

111
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:55,442
And Governor Flores wouldn't accept a wife

112
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:58,153
who has a child with another man!

113
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,367
That is why that child must
die for the sake of our family!

114
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,956
Father! Father, I beg you.

115
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:12,626
Please let Maria's child live.

116
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,797
Don't force her to marry Governor Flores.

117
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,675
I will do it.

118
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,887
Because...

119
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,345
I'm ready to marry Leandro.

120
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,392
Carmelita?

121
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,986
How are you feeling?

122
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:26,658
The herbal medicine you
applied to my knees was effective.

123
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:28,869
The pain was lessened.

124
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,207
How's Maria?

125
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,502
I just came from her bedroom.

126
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:40,130
Father ordered her to stay there

127
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,342
until it's decided when
she'll go to Laguna.

128
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:45,802
To the home of Aunt Rosario.

129
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:48,263
Why is she going to Laguna?

130
00:11:49,264 --> 00:11:52,893
I think Father wants to hide her far away.

131
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,898
It's a great shame if people
find out she's pregnant

132
00:11:58,357 --> 00:11:59,858
without getting married.

133
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:03,153
What if her baby gets aborted?

134
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:06,406
But you promised

135
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:09,451
that you'd get married
to Leandro, didn't you?

136
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,414
Do you remember?

137
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:17,042
When Leandro went to court you?

138
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:20,837
Governor Flores requested

139
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:23,048
to be married to Maria.

140
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:25,342
But it didn't push through.

141
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:28,970
Because he was so focused
on your wedding to Leandro.

142
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,224
But when it was stopped too,

143
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,476
Father couldn't do anything.

144
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:38,397
He has to agree to what
Governor Flores wants.

145
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:40,607
To be married to Maria.

146
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,529
I did the right thing.

147
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:48,365
Maria was put into this situation

148
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,867
because I wanted to be with Juanito.

149
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:52,994
I need to help her.

150
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:21,148
Father, Mother.

151
00:13:21,898 --> 00:13:24,067
I’m one of those chosen by Mother Olivia

152
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,653
to lead the prayer in the plaza.

153
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,905
It's on All Souls’ Day.

154
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:31,908
I am very happy for you, dear.

155
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:37,497
Mother Olivia has chosen well
in giving you that responsibility.

156
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:39,124
Hey, congrats!

157
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,006
I mean, I'm happy for you, Josefina.

158
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:47,728
Alejandro!

159
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,385
What was that?

160
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:51,470
You scum!

161
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:52,705
Get off me!

162
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:54,447
I said get off!

163
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:56,510
Mr. Raul?

164
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,018
Father?

165
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:00,306
Father!

166
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:04,830
They didn't mean for it to
happen, so just let them be!

167
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:07,666
Alejandro!

168
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,280
It's not good for your
heart if you become angry.

169
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:14,826
Have you no shame, Alejandro?

170
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:17,787
What authority do you have
to have my son arrested and imprisoned?

171
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:24,878
Alejandro!

172
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:27,797
Father! Do not hurt Mr. Raul!

173
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:30,634
Father! I'm begging you!

174
00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:32,402
Stand up!

175
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:36,431
You have the nerve to
raise your voice at me?

176
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:40,810
Since you already know
that I will kick you out of here.

177
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,105
Beat him up to make
sure he learned his lesson!

178
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:45,232
No!

179
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:46,441
Please don't, Father!

180
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:47,918
Stop!

181
00:14:47,943 --> 00:14:49,945
Father, I'm begging you!

182
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:52,072
Do not hurt Mr. Raul!

183
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:53,990
- Please, stop!
- Carmelita, be quiet.

184
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:57,160
Your father might get angry at you again.

185
00:14:58,286 --> 00:14:59,371
Call Leandro.

186
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:03,845
We need to help them.

187
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,173
Where's Eduardo?

188
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:09,464
I heard Father had him arrested in town
under General Seleno.

189
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:12,884
And I heard he was accused

190
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:14,978
of planning something
sinister against Maria.

191
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,639
Throw that old man into prison!

192
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,976
I will await Gobernadorcillo Flores' order.

193
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:24,229
On what to do to finish off this scum.

194
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,064
That's enough.

195
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:34,823
- That's enough.
- Remember this!

196
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:36,992
I swear.

197
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,326
I will get my revenge.

198
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:42,914
I will return all of
this to you, Alejandro!

199
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:47,711
Is it how you repay me for
accepting you and your children

200
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,629
here, at our house?

201
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:54,092
I gave you honorable work and a good life!

202
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:59,180
If threats and curses are
your payment for that...

203
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:04,394
Then it is just fitting for me
to take your life as payment!

204
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:06,313
- Father, no!
- Alejandro, that's enough.

205
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:08,773
You only gave us food and shelter!

206
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:10,233
But not once

207
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:13,528
did you ever treat us as equals
nor gave us the right compensation!

208
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:16,698
That is why we owe you nothing!

209
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,962
Take him away!

210
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:47,812
Carmelita,

211
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:51,524
I know you're still thinking about Juanito.

212
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:55,236
Do you want to send him a letter?

213
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:58,615
I can ask Mother Olivia for help.

214
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:04,204
Honestly, Josefina...

215
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:07,332
I still don't know

216
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,126
what to say to him.

217
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:13,171
That’s why I can’t bring
myself to write him a letter.

218
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,467
I can't tell him that

219
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:19,719
I won't be able to fulfill my promise.

220
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:24,226
And if ever we meet...

221
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:28,687
I wouldn't know what to do.

222
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:32,982
I cannot face him anymore.

223
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:36,319
Carmelita,

224
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:38,655
even I’m worried

225
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:42,283
that Juanito might think you
don’t care about him anymore.

226
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:44,869
Even after waiting for you patiently.

227
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:49,290
But I think he also
deserves to know the truth

228
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,710
about what's happening with you.

229
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,630
And why you're doing
it for our family's sake.

230
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:00,677
Avoiding him won't solve the problem.

231
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:04,764
And if you don't clear things up with him,

232
00:18:05,098 --> 00:18:08,643
you might leave him confused.

233
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:12,731
He could be scarred for life.

234
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:17,694
Josefina is right.

235
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:22,741
It will be unfair to Juanito if I just
leave him hanging without any explanation.

236
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:24,701
He doesn't deserve that.

237
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:26,536
He might even curse me.

238
00:18:57,859 --> 00:18:58,902
Maria?

239
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:00,905
Maria?

240
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:03,114
Carmelita?

241
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:05,950
Carmelita, is that you?

242
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:08,061
Yes, it's me.

243
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:11,053
How are you?

244
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:13,917
Carmelita, where is Eduardo?

245
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,920
What did Father do to Mr. Raul?

246
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:22,092
It might affect her baby if I
tell her Eduardo's in prison

247
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:24,677
and that Mr. Raul almost
got beaten to death.

248
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,182
I shouldn't have asked you that.

249
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,186
I know Father won't rest

250
00:19:33,686 --> 00:19:36,189
until they were all punished.

251
00:19:38,358 --> 00:19:39,366
Maria...

252
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:42,225
I'm sorry.

253
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:46,950
If I only agreed to marry Leandro...

254
00:19:48,576 --> 00:19:50,078
Then maybe you wouldn't be -

255
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,998
you wouldn't be arranged to
get married to Governor Flores.

256
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,588
And Father would just
leave you with your child.

257
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:04,259
Because of me...

258
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:10,890
Your child with Eduardo was put in danger.

259
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,920
No.

260
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,185
Carmelita, that's not true.

261
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:15,603
This wasn't your fault.

262
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,024
Eduardo and I are at fault.

263
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:24,988
If only

264
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:27,407
we didn't do something

265
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,659
we would just regret in the end...

266
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,287
It's all my fault.

267
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:35,707
It's all because of me.

268
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,545
Maria, your child with
Eduardo will never be a mistake.

269
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,923
That child is part of our family.

270
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:46,384
My family.

271
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:51,389
Blood of our blood.

272
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,768
And that child will be loved.

273
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:07,989
Keep the faith, Maria.

274
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,490
I will do something about this.

275
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:13,411
Thank you very much, Carmelita.

276
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:19,208
Carmelita!

277
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:20,510
Let's go.

278
00:21:22,462 --> 00:21:23,630
Josefina?

279
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:26,257
Maria!

280
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,484
There's just something
I need to tell Carmelita.

281
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,136
What is it?

282
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,679
- What happened?
- I have some bad news.

283
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:34,682
Father ordered to have Mr. Raul killed.

284
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:35,979
What?!

285
00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:39,954
No!

286
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,397
That can't happen!

287
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:48,893
Maria...

288
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:01,709
Mr. Raul is held at the
back of the hacienda.

289
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:02,995
But tomorrow, he
will be taken to the

290
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,057
mountain to be executed
by the civil guards.

291
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:09,425
Josefina, quickly.

292
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:11,427
Father and Mother might come back soon.

293
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:31,198
The key!

294
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:36,953
Do you think the guards are asleep?

295
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:40,331
I think the sleeping draught
we gave them is effective.

296
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,213
Let's go.

297
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:50,348
How did Raul escape?!

298
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,652
I know somebody helped him!

299
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:54,137
Who's responsible for this?!

300
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:55,252
Is it you?!

301
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:59,225
Forgive me for speaking
my mind, Don Alejandro.

302
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:04,105
But I believe none of your
workers will dare oppose you.

303
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:10,069
And I also know you’re aware

304
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:11,738
that you can’t punish whoever they are.

305
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:17,035
What are you trying to say, Esmeralda?

306
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:20,121
Forgive me, Don Alejandro.

307
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,582
But if we will be objective here...

308
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:27,086
Only Miss Carmelita has
the guts to oppose you

309
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:29,088
and go against your commands.

310
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:31,924
Your child is stubborn.

311
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,969
She rarely listen to your orders.

312
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,805
She doesn't listen to your advice.

313
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:39,573
And most of all,

314
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,174
she's too determined for her own good.

315
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,732
Excuse my intrusion, Esmeralda.

316
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:53,613
You should know your
place in this household.

317
00:23:56,866 --> 00:23:58,284
Carmelita, come over here.

318
00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:08,628
In this case...

319
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:14,133
Disobeying my orders as
the Governor’s right-hand man

320
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,259
carries the same punishment...

321
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:16,744
For everyone.

322
00:24:17,428 --> 00:24:18,955
And even though you are my daughter,

323
00:24:19,222 --> 00:24:21,349
you cannot escape punishment.

324
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:23,451
Father,

325
00:24:23,476 --> 00:24:26,354
it is not fair to blame Carmelita

326
00:24:26,354 --> 00:24:28,523
just because of your
previous misunderstandings.

327
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:33,569
Miss Josefina,

328
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,324
you may be also complicit
in Miss Carmelita's actions.

329
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:42,411
Because you helped Mr. Raul escape.

330
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:44,956
How did that old scum manage to escape you?

331
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:50,795
I didn't have anything to
do with it, Don Alejandro.

332
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:55,341
I do not know who put
sleeping draughts in their food.

333
00:24:57,093 --> 00:25:01,139
Also, I just suddenly saw
the guardia civil unconscious.

334
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,812
So you're saying someone else did it

335
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:10,648
and is making you look guilty instead?

336
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:15,027
Search everywhere!

337
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:16,654
Find the key!

338
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,201
I'm sorry, Esmeralda.

339
00:25:22,577 --> 00:25:26,789
I don't want anyone else to
take the fall for what we did,

340
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,276
but I have to save my future family.

341
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:50,271
Good morning, Carmelita.

342
00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:52,612
This is for you.

343
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:56,377
Thank you.

344
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,460
Your eyes look sad.

345
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:29,979
Are you alright?

346
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:35,409
It's Maria.

347
00:26:37,777 --> 00:26:39,570
I heard of what happened to Maria.

348
00:26:41,072 --> 00:26:42,281
My Father told me.

349
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:47,643
How are you?

350
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:51,791
I have no problems with

351
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,584
the new soldiers we're training.

352
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:55,628
And I am also glad that

353
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:58,088
Natasha is now back from Spain.

354
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:02,009
How about Helena?

355
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:05,304
Helena is still in Spain.

356
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:07,291
There is...

357
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:10,101
A young Spanish man from a prominent family

358
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:11,310
who wants to marry her.

359
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:15,064
I'm quite saddened

360
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,525
that you and Helena's friendship was lost.

361
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:18,793
But,

362
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:19,908
I am hopeful

363
00:27:20,236 --> 00:27:21,696
you two will patch things up.

364
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:23,712
And I hope,

365
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:26,409
our relationship won't get affected.

366
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,040
Relationship?

367
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:36,814
Are we not...

368
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:39,672
Already arranged to get married, Carmelita?

369
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:42,400
Gosh!

370
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:44,760
I'm in a relationship with
both Juanito and Leandro.

371
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:47,888
I'm not even aware that I'm a two-timer.

372
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:52,101
Is that so?

373
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:56,222
Aren't things going too quickly?

374
00:27:58,357 --> 00:27:59,608
Too quick or not,

375
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:02,028
it is still love, isn't it?

376
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:03,697
Also,

377
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:06,032
we quickly became a
couple before, didn't we?

378
00:28:43,277 --> 00:28:44,283
Carmelita...

379
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:46,906
I know you're aware.

380
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,241
Since the start,

381
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:52,870
I have been charmed by your doe eyes...

382
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:55,039
And sweet smiles.

383
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,249
From the beginning,

384
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,502
my heart has already fallen for you.

385
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:02,671
That's why I hope you will accept my love.

386
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:05,716
That I wholeheartedly offer you.

387
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:13,641
I accept your love, Leandro.

388
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:16,852
Is that true, Carmelita?

389
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:19,105
We feel the same way?

390
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:28,212
Can I?

391
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:31,826
Can I embrace you?

392
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:35,431
There's a bug!

393
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,850
My love, I was just kidding.

394
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:39,810
I just want to make you laugh.

395
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,538
Leandro, it wasn't a nice joke!

396
00:30:42,563 --> 00:30:45,274
You know I'm scared of bugs and animals.

397
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:47,107
Forgive me, my love.

398
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:49,254
Don't worry, I won't ever do it again.

399
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:50,442
Come.

400
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:54,762
Sit down.

401
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:58,329
Let me make up to you.

402
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:14,895
Is this?...

403
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:20,226
Your favorite.

404
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:21,477
Pinakbet.

405
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:24,747
Thank you.

406
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:28,734
Once your parents know
about our relationship,

407
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:32,029
I will take you to this
fine restaurant in town.

408
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,658
They have the most delicious
Pinakbet I have ever tasted.

409
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,453
That's a promise?

410
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:40,473
Promise.

411
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:47,168
Carmelita...

412
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:52,049
What kind of life do you want for yourself?

413
00:31:57,471 --> 00:31:59,265
I want a big family.

414
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,104
And I want to see them all play around.

415
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:09,108
I will teach them how to read.

416
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:10,862
While you

417
00:32:11,986 --> 00:32:13,529
will be working nearby.

418
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:14,922
So that in the evening,

419
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:16,365
we will have dinner together.

420
00:32:18,826 --> 00:32:20,327
And when midnight comes,

421
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:22,246
I will kiss your forehead.

422
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:23,956
And I will whisper to your ear,

423
00:32:24,915 --> 00:32:26,041
"Thank you, my love."

424
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:27,425
Because of you,

425
00:32:27,668 --> 00:32:30,087
I was able to live the life I
have always been dreaming of.

426
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,423
I will love you,

427
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:33,841
every hour,

428
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:35,342
every second.

429
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,511
And every tomorrow.

430
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:03,496
Thank you.

431
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:42,826
Carmelita, are you alright?

432
00:33:47,581 --> 00:33:48,707
I'm fine.

433
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:51,710
I'll just take a quick nap.

434
00:33:56,423 --> 00:33:57,478
Careful.

435
00:34:24,952 --> 00:34:26,078
Carmelita, dear.

436
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:29,123
Were you able to talk to General Leandro?

437
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,361
Did he leave already -

438
00:34:31,354 --> 00:34:32,360
Carmelita?

439
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:35,254
Why do you look so pale?

440
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:38,173
Go and rest in your bedroom.

441
00:34:38,507 --> 00:34:40,759
You haven't eaten breakfast too.

442
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:42,261
I will send it up to you.

443
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,285
Carmelita?

444
00:35:06,994 --> 00:35:09,288
You haven't touched your breakfast.

445
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:11,373
You will not recover
your strength that way.

446
00:35:16,837 --> 00:35:18,672
What is happening to you?

447
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:21,494
Your nausea is worse than Maria's.

448
00:35:23,552 --> 00:35:24,619
Wait...

449
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:26,764
Don't tell me you're--

450
00:35:27,306 --> 00:35:28,724
I am not pregnant.

451
00:35:29,308 --> 00:35:31,393
Juanito respects me too much.

452
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:33,103
We can't say for sure.

453
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:34,480
As they say,

454
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,317
when two lovers get
caught up in the moment,

455
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:40,319
nothing could ever stop it!

456
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:43,322
Josefina,

457
00:35:44,073 --> 00:35:45,741
what is Father's plan for Maria?

458
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:49,578
When will he bring Maria to Aunt Rosario?

459
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:51,955
I still don't know.

460
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:53,916
But from what I've heard,

461
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:57,044
Father wants to find Mr. Raul first.

462
00:35:57,336 --> 00:35:59,379
So that he can be punished
together with Eduardo.

463
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:05,969
But first, you must eat.

464
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,698
Your back is drenched in sweat.

465
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:11,683
Can you pass me the wash cloth?

466
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:18,409
Carmelita?

467
00:36:19,024 --> 00:36:20,526
I just noticed this now.

468
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,571
You have a birthmark on your nape?

469
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:27,950
Gosh! Carmelita doesn't
have any birthmarks.

470
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,535
No, that's not a birthmark.

471
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:31,578
It's a scar, Josefina.

472
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:35,249
I was wounded before and...

473
00:36:35,249 --> 00:36:37,709
I scratched it too hard that's
why it turned into a scar.

474
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,138
- Mother.
- So, you're already awake, dear.

475
00:36:51,056 --> 00:36:51,907
Here.

476
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:53,308
I brought you some medicine.

477
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:56,311
This will help you feel better.

478
00:36:56,603 --> 00:36:58,438
And alleviate your nausea.

479
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:02,805
Thank you, Mother.

480
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,403
You are much welcome.

481
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:06,500
By the way,

482
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:09,408
your Father and I will
leave tomorrow night.

483
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:13,136
He was tasked by Gobernadorcillo Flores

484
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:15,622
to check the harvested grain in town.

485
00:37:16,623 --> 00:37:20,794
That might take well into the morning
before we finish checking everything.

486
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:22,993
Please take care.

487
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:25,507
Alright, I'll leave the two of you.

488
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:27,467
Take care of your sister, alright?

489
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:28,821
Yes, Mother.

490
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:35,726
Here. Eat your lunch.

491
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:48,305
Carmelita!

492
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:50,883
Juanito?

493
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:01,414
I'm sorry.

494
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,875
It took me awhile to get here.

495
00:38:03,337 --> 00:38:05,547
Ignacio and I had some
difficulties borrowing a boat

496
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:06,924
to get here in San Alfonso.

497
00:38:07,507 --> 00:38:08,525
Boat?

498
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,801
Why didn't you travel by ship?

499
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:13,221
I'll take you away, Carmelita.

500
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:18,185
Let's elope somewhere
your Father wouldn't find.

501
00:38:20,103 --> 00:38:21,396
When I received your letter,

502
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,107
I didn't hesistate to follow you here.

503
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:28,153
Carmelita, you don't
need to sacrifice anymore.

504
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,323
Ignacio and I found a way.

505
00:38:32,282 --> 00:38:34,409
We will rescue Eduardo tomorrow night.

506
00:38:35,202 --> 00:38:36,912
And we will wait for you and Maria.

507
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:39,122
At the end of the Lake of Tears.

508
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:43,126
Maria and Eduardo will elope too?

509
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:47,881
If we can take Maria
away from Don Alejandro,

510
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:50,467
her baby would be safe.

511
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:53,136
And I won't have to marry Leandro.

512
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:55,514
Are you coming with me, Carmelita?

513
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,479
Just promise me this.

514
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:05,399
That whatever happens...

515
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:08,568
You'll live.

516
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:13,031
And whatever happens,

517
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:15,826
I will never leave you.

518
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:03,707
Thank you, Don Alejandro.

519
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,835
Oh, by the way...

520
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:13,717
I heard the arranged marriage between Maria
and Gobernadorcillo Flores was called off.

521
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:18,180
Gobernadorcillo Flores
actually told me that.

522
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,892
He will be truly grateful

523
00:40:21,892 --> 00:40:24,853
to have a wife like Maria.

524
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:29,941
Gobernadorcillo Flores knows
that my daughter is with child.

525
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:32,736
But he is still willing to
accept her as his bride.

526
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,946
On the condition

527
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:38,158
that the child will be aborted.

528
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:41,547
Do you...

529
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:45,248
Do you know a good midwife?

530
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,045
So, Don Alejandro still
plans to kill Maria's child!

531
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:59,846
My wife... knows a talented midwife.

532
00:41:00,347 --> 00:41:01,390
From the North.

533
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:03,563
When...

534
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:05,477
When do you want to call them?

535
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:07,104
As soon as possible.

536
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:10,273
My daughter has been pregnant for a month.

537
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:13,151
Rest assured, Don Alejandro.

538
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:17,531
I will tell them to go to Laguna next week.

539
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:20,883
Good.

540
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:23,370
Come. Have a bite of food first.

541
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:26,598
Liar!

542
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:28,458
Even if Leandro and I were to get married,

543
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,836
he would still abort Maria's child

544
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:33,421
and marry her off to Governor Flores.

545
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:45,700
My God.

546
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:46,935
That can't be.

547
00:41:46,935 --> 00:41:49,104
We can't wait any longer, Josefina.

548
00:41:49,104 --> 00:41:50,313
You have to help us.

549
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:52,232
Help you with what?

550
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:57,737
Juanito and Eduardo will help
Eduardo escape prison tonight.

551
00:41:58,363 --> 00:42:00,198
Maria and I will come with them.

552
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,367
You're eloping?!

553
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:05,620
That is too dangerous.

554
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,539
Josefina, this is the only way.

555
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:10,083
You are the only one
Father trusts right now.

556
00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:15,750
Alright.

557
00:42:16,256 --> 00:42:18,425
I'll find a way so that

558
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:21,469
Father would allow me to
come inside Maria's room.

559
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:23,763
I will help her escape.

560
00:42:33,523 --> 00:42:37,277
This Wednesday, Aunt Rosario
will come and fetch Maria.

561
00:42:37,861 --> 00:42:40,238
Help her set-up her room there.

562
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:45,199
Ate Maria won’t be going
to Laguna for two more days,

563
00:42:45,285 --> 00:42:47,537
that's why we need to
sneak her out tonight.

564
00:42:49,497 --> 00:42:52,500
I know you both have things to do.

565
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:56,963
Josefina, do your best
at the upcoming prayer for All Souls' Day.

566
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,680
Carmelita.

567
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:05,138
Do your best in preparing
for your upcoming wedding.

568
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:09,017
The agreed date is by the end of December.

569
00:43:36,461 --> 00:43:37,921
Once everything is settled,

570
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:39,798
send me a letter with your address.

571
00:43:39,798 --> 00:43:41,299
I will go there at once.

572
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:43,927
Thank you, Josefina.

573
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:45,695
Take care, both of you.

574
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,181
Go on, before the guards spot you.

575
00:43:48,181 --> 00:43:49,211
Go!

576
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:52,610
Thank you so much, Josefina.

577
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,852
Will you really not stop
with this nonsense?!

578
00:43:57,065 --> 00:43:58,180
Eduardo!

579
00:44:00,443 --> 00:44:02,696
I don't know what to do with you anymore!

580
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,906
If not for Esmeralda,

581
00:44:04,906 --> 00:44:08,994
I wouldn't know you are planning
to elope with these scums!

582
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:11,871
And you, Josefina.

583
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:15,709
I didn't expect you to
condone your sisters!

584
00:44:17,502 --> 00:44:18,579
Father...

585
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:20,505
Please, forgive me.

586
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:23,133
Forgive me, Father.

587
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:24,467
We're sorry, Father.

588
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:26,970
I beg you, please, do not hurt them.

589
00:44:27,721 --> 00:44:29,848
All you bring me is shame.

590
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:30,974
You two,

591
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:35,979
you shouldn't have
step foot into this place!

592
00:44:36,938 --> 00:44:41,943
This transgression warrants death!

593
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:44,279
Take away the sisters from here!

594
00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:45,989
- Father, we are begging you!
- Father...

595
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,149
Let go of me!

596
00:44:47,282 --> 00:44:49,951
Father, please do not hurt them! Eduardo!

597
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:52,899
General Seleno.

598
00:44:53,455 --> 00:44:56,499
Take that Alfonso first. He's
the root of all our problems!

599
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:58,835
Farewell to you,

600
00:44:59,627 --> 00:45:01,838
Juanito Alfonso.

601
00:45:04,424 --> 00:45:05,508
Father!

602
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:07,719
Eduardo!

603
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,112
Juanito!

604
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:45,090
Juanito is dead.

605
00:45:45,465 --> 00:45:46,674
I'm sorry.

606
00:45:46,674 --> 00:45:50,011
I can sense that
Juanito is still alive.

607
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:51,513
There are things

608
00:45:51,513 --> 00:45:53,681
that cannot stay with us.

609
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:55,767
Let Juanito go.

610
00:45:55,975 --> 00:45:57,060
Bad news.

611
00:45:57,477 --> 00:46:01,064
Theresita is here in
San Alfonso with Sonya.

612
00:46:01,064 --> 00:46:02,086
What?

613
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,193
She wants to plead
for Ignacio's case.

614
00:46:05,193 --> 00:46:06,653
We have to stop her.

615
00:46:06,653 --> 00:46:07,904
There is only one way

616
00:46:07,904 --> 00:46:10,198
for you to be with your husband.

617
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,617
And that is death.

618
00:46:12,617 --> 00:46:13,660
Don Alejandro!

619
00:46:15,537 --> 00:46:17,288
The rebels attacked the plaza.

620
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:19,124
Miss Josefina was stabbed.

621
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,168
The mastermind behind all this...

622
00:46:23,044 --> 00:46:24,629
The death of Josefina...

623
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,506
Was Juanito Alfonso.

624
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:29,300
Look at what
you've done, Carmelita!

625
00:46:30,218 --> 00:46:32,512
You helped this scum escape!

626
00:46:32,512 --> 00:46:35,432
You gave them the chance
to hurt your sister!

627
00:46:35,932 --> 00:46:38,476
You need to marry Leandro.

628
00:46:38,476 --> 00:46:43,189
If not, all I worked hard for
will be for nothing.
