1
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,065
I heard the lawyer that
would represent

2
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,358
Don Mariano in court...

3
00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:53,569
Was appointed by
General Seleno himself.

4
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:56,572
I sense that they will
deliberately lose his case.

5
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:57,740
- Sonya? Sonya!
- Wait...

6
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,658
Are you alright?

7
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,451
My wife is pregnant.

8
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,829
I was on my way
to the festivities, Ignacio

9
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:04,580
when Helena
stopped me.

10
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,916
Now I think
she did it on purpose.

11
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:10,002
Don Mariano is
hereby sentenced...

12
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:11,212
To death.

13
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,382
And don't be worried.

14
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,969
I am ready
to face my fate.

15
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:20,555
Remember,
there are battles we lose.

16
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:24,559
But when you fall,
that doesn't mean

17
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:27,311
you won't get back up
again and continue fighting.

18
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,413
I promise.

19
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:31,315
I will never
leave your side.

20
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:34,485
You are summoned
by Judge Valenciano

21
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:35,278
at the town hall.

22
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:37,488
He revealed that
you were the one who schemed

23
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:43,369
The fake news
about Don Mariano

24
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,871
being involved with the rebels.

25
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,539
Your presence is expected.

26
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:58,713
We ask Don Alejandro to
remove his clothes as well...

27
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:03,636
and to prove the statements
made by Captain Corpuz.

28
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:06,053
That it was in fact, Don Alejandro,

29
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,472
who convinced them...

30
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,642
To mark themselves with an X...

31
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,563
As a sign of their settlement.

32
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:03,194
It is true that Mr. Pipoy
is with the rebels.

33
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,821
When I learned that...

34
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,533
I asked help from General Sergio.

35
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:15,175
But...

36
00:05:16,123 --> 00:05:17,917
He raped...

37
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,503
and abused me.

38
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,430
Sergio, defend yourself.

39
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,905
Yes, I admit it.

40
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:51,867
I raped and abused Cristeta.

41
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,384
Captain Pedro Corpuz

42
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:10,886
and General Sergio Alfonso...

43
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,181
are sentenced by this court...

44
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:16,433
To death.

45
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,664
All of them are angry at Don Alejandro.

46
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,501
And maybe, that's how
Juanito feels about me too.

47
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:46,774
Miss, it's been days since
you last ate something.

48
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:49,818
Do you want me to bring you food in here?

49
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,154
I am not hungry.

50
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,243
Teresita...

51
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:04,959
The letters I've sent to Juanito...

52
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:08,128
Did he answer any of them?

53
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:09,588
Even just one?

54
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:13,884
Miss,

55
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:16,387
I'm really sorry, but...

56
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:20,391
Mr. Juanito hasn't replied
to any of your letters.

57
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:24,520
Even after General Sergio

58
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,814
and Captain Corpuz were executed last week,

59
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:31,026
The civil guards are still
closely watching the Alfonso family.

60
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:34,113
No one has been out of their hacienda.

61
00:08:37,992 --> 00:08:40,452
They didn't even see Sergio's body.

62
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:44,164
Even Mr. Ignacio,

63
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,835
He wasn't allowed to see his father's body.

64
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:53,882
They are bound to leave San Alfonso today.

65
00:08:54,341 --> 00:08:56,552
They'll be exiled to a far away place.

66
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,680
No one knows where except the judges.

67
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,852
I need to see Juanito...

68
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,647
Just once...

69
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:10,691
for the last time.

70
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:13,193
Miss...

71
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,867
Even just once.

72
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:32,713
Let the children go to the pier.

73
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:35,799
They just want to bid
farewell to their friends.

74
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,261
No one will leave this house.

75
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:41,430
Anyone who disobeys me

76
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,224
will suffer great consequences.

77
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,949
Please consider your children.

78
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,078
I don't need to consider anyone.

79
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:11,043
Miss, would you like me
to deliver your message

80
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,252
to Mr. Juanito instead?

81
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:14,296
No. I must do it. But...

82
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:17,633
How do we leave when Father's here?

83
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,219
You're always acting like this.

84
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,096
Don't you feel pity for your children?

85
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:23,305
Get out of here.

86
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:24,890
Leave me be.

87
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:28,769
If I'm not mistaken,

88
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,481
before, didn't you leave
the house through the...

89
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:33,440
Window!

90
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,768
Even in the last seconds,

91
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:54,938
I hoped he will turn and see me.

92
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:56,982
But he didn't.

93
00:11:57,608 --> 00:11:59,234
He didn't even look at me.

94
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,724
I won't ever see Juanito again.

95
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:34,770
I didn't even get to say how I truly feel.

96
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,450
Under the orders of the Governor-General,

97
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,912
who represents the empire of Spain...

98
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,956
From this day forward,

99
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,752
14th of October, 1891.

100
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:44,298
The new officer-in-charge
of San Alfonso would be..

101
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:47,759
Governor Vicente Flores.

102
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:55,976
I would still continue

103
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:58,103
the plans and projects of the Alfonsos.

104
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:01,690
After all, they served our
town for quite a long time.

105
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:03,525
In line with this,

106
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,862
I appoint General Seleno Salvacion

107
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:12,200
as head of the peace corps
and leader of the civil guards.

108
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,621
Even though the General couldn't be here...

109
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,666
Due to an important meeting in Manila...

110
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:21,752
Instead let us give a warm welcome

111
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,254
to our new judge.

112
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:27,341
Judge Maximo Rosalejos.

113
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,304
What's happening?

114
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:35,891
I feel like this is all wrong.

115
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,519
And as the newly-appointed governor...

116
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,564
I'd like to give recognition

117
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:47,277
to someone who has
provided jobs and livelihoods.

118
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,363
And has been the reason behind
the booming economy of our town.

119
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:51,255
My fellow citizens,

120
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:53,867
let us give him a round of applause.

121
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:57,245
The one who shall be my right-hand man.

122
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,877
The second most powerful
official in San Alfonso.

123
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:07,547
Don Alejandro Montecarlos.

124
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,425
Thank you, my friend.

125
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:13,053
Thank you, thank you.

126
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,813
Is it possible that they both conspired

127
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:24,981
to bring down the
Alfonso family?

128
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,505
And another thing,

129
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:50,549
There's nothing written in the diary

130
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,718
about Don Alejandro becoming an official

131
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,138
Did destiny really change?

132
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:59,349
I need to talk to Mother Olivia.

133
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:00,492
But...

134
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:03,395
She went somewhere nobody knows where.

135
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:07,607
Carmelita.

136
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:10,743
Maria.

137
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:12,738
Sleep evades me.

138
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:14,196
How about you?

139
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,046
I have a lot on my mind.

140
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:28,044
So much happened one after another.

141
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,922
Changes.

142
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,509
And people we have lost.

143
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,640
I don't know what to feel.

144
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:55,405
I can sense you are worried for Juanito.

145
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:02,579
But you should probably accept

146
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,414
that maybe you're not
meant for one another.

147
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,045
How would you know if
someone is not meant for you?

148
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:17,438
There are many...

149
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,056
Obstacles that can stop two
people from loving each other.

150
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,184
Aside from the strength

151
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:26,686
and resilience of their
affection for one another.

152
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:33,527
Relationships must also depend on destiny.

153
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:37,781
Yes...

154
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:40,492
Juanito loves you.

155
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,496
And that is also how you feel.

156
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,625
But you're separated from each other now.

157
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:53,547
You don't even know where he is.

158
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:58,426
Their family are considered criminals.

159
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,681
And in no circumstance...

160
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:08,353
Will Father ever agree
to let you marry Juanito.

161
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:16,820
Carmelita.

162
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:21,658
What you feel for Juanito...

163
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:27,539
will just bring pain

164
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:29,332
and conflict.

165
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,137
How about you and Eduardo?

166
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:47,058
Do you think you're meant for each other?

167
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:56,443
I knew right from the start,

168
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:59,738
that Eduardo and I aren't
going to end up with each other.

169
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,951
Father will never agree

170
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:06,995
to let me marry someone...

171
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,165
Ordinary.

172
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,461
But I also know that you're aware...

173
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:21,051
The heart doesn't
really listen to the mind.

174
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,514
I still followed what my heart wants.

175
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:33,104
But now...

176
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:38,360
I finally realized that
we're not for each other.

177
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,008
Beautiful, isn't it?

178
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:05,303
Oh no, there's a dead body!

179
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,555
- Good Lord!
- Who could that be?

180
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:12,185
- They found it in the river.
- Who was it? It was found in the river.

181
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:15,271
- Go ahead.
- Yes, General.

182
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:18,108
That poor soul. Who could it be?

183
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:20,652
Good day to you, Miss Carmelita.

184
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:22,654
What happened? Why is there a dead body?

185
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:26,199
The body was found on the riverbank.

186
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,494
General Seleno isn't here right now

187
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,162
that's why I was the one
who received the report.

188
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,751
When did you get promoted to General?

189
00:20:38,545 --> 00:20:40,005
My rank was promoted

190
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,549
when I went to Cavite with General Sergio.

191
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,925
Before he got arrested and...

192
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,219
Taken back here to San Alfonso.

193
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,641
General Leandro! Cristeta's still alive!

194
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,519
It was Cristeta who was found in the river?

195
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:11,911
Miss, I should go.

196
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:13,371
Take her to the hospital!

197
00:21:13,997 --> 00:21:15,055
Quickly!

198
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:20,378
She needs to survive.

199
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,050
She's the only one who can prove that

200
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,094
Don Mariano, Sergio Alfonso,
and Captain Corpuz weren't rebels.

201
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:30,889
In doing so, absolving
Juanito's name as well.

202
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:36,394
I lied.

203
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:41,357
It wasn't true that...

204
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:46,279
Mr. Sergio ever abused me.

205
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,620
We have feelings for each other.

206
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:58,374
And something already happened between us.

207
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,112
But...

208
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,382
When I heard that...

209
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:09,052
He was already arranged...

210
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:11,763
To get married to someone else.

211
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:14,440
That's why...

212
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:19,145
I testified against him.

213
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:27,994
Mr. Maximo promised me a new home,

214
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,490
somewhere far away.

215
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,328
And he also bribed...

216
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,372
Mr. Pipoy

217
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:39,833
to testify

218
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:44,587
against Don Mariano.

219
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,182
But...

220
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:52,220
he murdered

221
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,191
Mr. Pipoy after.

222
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:00,687
I can feel...

223
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:06,568
...that I'll be next.

224
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,280
That's why...

225
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:13,741
I did the act myself.

226
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:24,002
I finally tricked those bastards.

227
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:36,959
Cristeta...

228
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:41,644
Cristeta?

229
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:46,357
Cristeta?

230
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:54,608
Help!

231
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,925
Cristeta?

232
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,868
Help!

233
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,068
Help!

234
00:23:58,411 --> 00:23:59,204
Cristeta!

235
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,121
Cristeta?

236
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,372
Help!

237
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:02,248
Help!

238
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:02,957
Help!

239
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:04,125
Help!

240
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,019
Cristeta!

241
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,100
Cristeta!

242
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:08,796
Cristeta?

243
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,967
Help!

244
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:31,027
Help!

245
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,290
Cristeta...?

246
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:52,465
- Carmelita! Let's talk at home.
- Cristeta?!

247
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:55,276
Come on!

248
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:58,429
- I'm so sorry, Father!
- Alejandro!

249
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,848
- Alejandro! Please stop!
- Father!

250
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:02,016
Stop this, please!

251
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,852
Father, don't! Please!

252
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:08,815
Alejandro! That's enough...

253
00:25:09,816 --> 00:25:12,443
You always go against my word, Carmelita!

254
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,239
What were you doing at the hospital?!

255
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:18,032
And why were you talking to the girl

256
00:25:18,032 --> 00:25:20,702
who testified against the Alfonsos?!

257
00:25:22,745 --> 00:25:24,122
Father...

258
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,542
Why did the mark disappear from your back?

259
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:30,920
Are you saying...

260
00:25:31,212 --> 00:25:34,173
That I had a hand in their
deaths and imprisonment?!

261
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,343
Why did you stay quiet?

262
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,138
When Don Mariano was sentenced, why?

263
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:42,682
Carmelita...

264
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:45,476
Captain Corpuz said that...

265
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,520
You reconciled with them,

266
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,565
and that you all had the mark
in your back at the same time.

267
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:52,025
As a symbol of your friendship.

268
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:53,484
Carmelita!

269
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:56,988
Stop right now! Do not accuse your father!

270
00:25:57,488 --> 00:25:58,656
And now...

271
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:01,951
You're believing Corpuz's
lies more than me?!

272
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,329
That's enough, Alejandro...

273
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,001
There's only one telling the truth, Father.

274
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:14,922
And I have proven now, that you...

275
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:16,841
You're lying.

276
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,803
Father, no! Please don't!

277
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,140
Please have mercy! Stop, Father!

278
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,518
Enough!

279
00:26:27,904 --> 00:26:31,230
Stop hurting your children!

280
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:54,587
General Leandro came here earlier.

281
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,965
He wants to talk to Carmelita.

282
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,635
What did you say?

283
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:03,346
I asked him to leave.

284
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:06,349
I told him this isn't the right time.

285
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,852
But maybe it is time.

286
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,313
If they truly love each other,

287
00:27:12,313 --> 00:27:14,273
why should we stop them?

288
00:27:19,112 --> 00:27:20,363
Alejandro!

289
00:27:22,156 --> 00:27:25,743
I don't know what's happening
to our daughter, but I think..

290
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,122
Marriage with straighten her life out.

291
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:40,716
I miss him already.

292
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:43,136
Maybe if he was here,

293
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:45,513
everything will be easier for me.

294
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:51,436
Everything feels better
whenever I see his smile.

295
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:09,704
For me, that's the most
beautiful poem I have ever read.

296
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,376
Carmelita, my dear.

297
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,087
Please understand your father.

298
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,841
You know he has a very short temper

299
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:23,551
and he has a heart condition.

300
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:27,972
I hope you could understand
that he's human too.

301
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:32,643
He got hurt with your accusations.

302
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:44,489
Mr. Leandro visited earlier, by the way.

303
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,325
I mean, General Leandro.

304
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:51,496
I asked him to return another day.

305
00:28:51,787 --> 00:28:54,499
I know you're still not feeling well.

306
00:28:57,251 --> 00:28:58,753
Dear,

307
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,505
I hope you understand.

308
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:03,424
Your Father and I only wish

309
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:06,702
for the best interests
of you and your sisters,

310
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:09,096
I hope you can open your mind

311
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:13,184
and see that we only wish for your safety.

312
00:29:17,438 --> 00:29:21,067
Your Father and I agreed to
push through with your wedding.

313
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:23,361
My wedding to Juanito will push through?!

314
00:29:24,378 --> 00:29:29,342
So that you may know the
responsibilities of a mother and a parent.

315
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,725
And that your days may be filled with it.

316
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:38,167
I knew you'll be glad to hear that news.

317
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:42,129
Now I'm sure that you do love him.

318
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:46,050
Very well, you rest early.

319
00:29:46,342 --> 00:29:49,971
Tomorrow, General Leandro
and Governor Flores will be back.

320
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,095
What?

321
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,949
I am to be engaged to Leandro?

322
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,276
Carmelita, dear? Wait!

323
00:30:07,613 --> 00:30:08,614
Father.

324
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,242
I do not want to get married.

325
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,702
Please take back your word.

326
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:16,872
And why are you unwilling?

327
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,876
Didn't you scheme with Juanito

328
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:22,878
just so you could stop your wedding?

329
00:30:24,463 --> 00:30:27,300
You also helped him get
closer to Helena Flores...

330
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,261
And you told every single one of us

331
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,306
that it is Leandro you love.

332
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,685
It's true that I didn't want
the wedding to happen

333
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:39,520
for the sake of Juanito.

334
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,440
But I don't have any feelings for Leandro.

335
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:47,737
Answer me.

336
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,782
Why are you opposing this engagement?

337
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:01,292
- Because...
- Carmelita, dear.

338
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:03,919
Please don't take this any further.

339
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:09,002
I really don’t know what
else to do with you, Carmelita.

340
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:14,013
Can't you see?

341
00:31:15,556 --> 00:31:17,016
I did this

342
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:19,560
because I'm trying to look out for you.

343
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,147
Because I want you to be happy.

344
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:27,234
Even though you are filled
with hatred and doubt for me.

345
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:30,696
I still did it because that
is what good fathers do.

346
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,620
Because I want to be a good father to you.

347
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:46,462
But it seems your heart is already set.

348
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,842
Where is my youngest daughter?

349
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,638
Where is my sweet Carmelita?

350
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:57,515
Who was full of affection?

351
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:00,559
Loving and always obedient to me?!

352
00:32:05,606 --> 00:32:06,732
Why?

353
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:11,278
Why does it seem like...

354
00:32:12,822 --> 00:32:15,533
I don’t know the person
I’m looking at anymore?

355
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,327
Why?

356
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,455
I apologize, Father.

357
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,166
I'm still not ready yet.

358
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,419
I don't want to get married.

359
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:48,190
I know that there's
nothing written in the diary.

360
00:32:48,482 --> 00:32:51,986
And Carmelita and Leandro
aren't meant to be married.

361
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:01,611
Miss.

362
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,198
Where are you going?

363
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:04,540
Are you headed somewhere?

364
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,875
You're leaving me too?

365
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,377
What?

366
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:10,546
I wouldn't leave you even if I could, Miss.

367
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,507
Don't worry, it's not
just me who's leaving.

368
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:14,800
You'll be leaving as well!

369
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:18,012
So go ahead and dress
up, so that's we won't be late

370
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:20,097
to the ship heading to Sugbu.

371
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,516
What are you saying?

372
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:26,854
Didn't Miss Maria and
Miss Josefina tell you?

373
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:30,422
Oh, and by the way,

374
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,695
your parents left early with your sisters.

375
00:33:35,362 --> 00:33:39,033
They're attending the
feast of Governor Flores.

376
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:42,703
You were not woken up because
today is also our departure

377
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:44,914
with Mother Olivia to Sugbu.

378
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:45,986
Our departure?

379
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:47,792
Towards Sugbu?

380
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,084
That's right.

381
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:52,963
Last night, Mother Olivia
talked to Don Alejandro.

382
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:56,675
She said you needed more time to think.

383
00:33:56,675 --> 00:33:59,553
Especially after everything
that has happened and,

384
00:33:59,553 --> 00:34:03,140
that you were deeply saddened
when the Alfonsos were exiled.

385
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,975
A family that has become close to you.

386
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:07,686
That's why Don Alejandro
agreed

387
00:34:07,686 --> 00:34:10,356
to let you stay in Sugbu for two weeks.

388
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,400
Before finally setting up a date

389
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,277
for your wedding to General Leandro.

390
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,906
Why are you happy about it?

391
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:25,329
Mother Olivia requested that I join you

392
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,957
so that you won't get too lonely, Miss.

393
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:40,928
I will have our belongings loaded first.

394
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,847
Mother Olivia.

395
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,101
Where have you been?

396
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,271
Why didn't you tell me
where you'll be going?

397
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:51,413
My dear...

398
00:34:51,438 --> 00:34:54,066
I settled an important thing.

399
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:55,734
What's important now...

400
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:59,113
Is that I was able to take you away
from Don Alejandro even just for a while.

401
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,512
We have to do something

402
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,248
to stop your wedding to Leandro Flores

403
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:11,458
What should we do?

404
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,921
I suspect that...

405
00:35:16,255 --> 00:35:18,716
Destiny has already changed its course.

406
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:22,553
I don't know what's gonna happen next.

407
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:26,708
But...

408
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,642
There's one thing I know for sure.

409
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,730
Make sure Juanito lives.

410
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:34,315
That is your mission.

411
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:40,362
The day of his death has changed,

412
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:42,198
and that is what I fear the most.

413
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,462
Mother Ofelia, good day to you.

414
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:57,421
Good day to you as well.

415
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,007
This is Carmelita and Theresita.

416
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:02,718
It's a pleasure meeting
you, Miss Carmelita.

417
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:06,013
And welcome to you as well, little miss.

418
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:12,436
This is Mother Esperanza.

419
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,464
Mother.

420
00:36:15,522 --> 00:36:16,660
Dear...

421
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,109
You are also here to learn.

422
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,278
Don't worry.

423
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:22,655
We won't charge you.

424
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:25,240
Just take care of Carmelita,

425
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:28,494
with all your heart, that will be enough.

426
00:36:29,078 --> 00:36:30,621
Thank you very much.

427
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,958
I will take our belongings
from the carriage.

428
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:34,892
Thank you.

429
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,755
- Mother Esperanza, please help her.
- Of course.

430
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:40,189
Well, I'll call the other nuns to help you.

431
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:41,382
We'll be waiting for them.

432
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,873
You seem to be in good spirits.

433
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,726
Maybe.

434
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:54,728
I might just really need some

435
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:56,772
time and space to not be stressed.

436
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:01,443
Sometimes, dear...

437
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:06,269
The more we take someone out of our mind...

438
00:37:07,873 --> 00:37:10,167
The more we can't forget them.

439
00:37:11,245 --> 00:37:13,122
The best way to solve that is...

440
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,750
Not fighting what you feel.

441
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:22,965
But Juanito and I can't
end up together, right?

442
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,719
You weren't supposed
to fall in love with Juanito.

443
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:30,389
But just like I've said...

444
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,142
Destiny has changed its course.

445
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:37,563
So, does that mean Juanito and I could...?

446
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:40,607
Your mission...

447
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:43,277
Is to save Juanito from dying.

448
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:45,779
So that you can return to your own time.

449
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:49,742
What do you think pushes a person

450
00:37:49,742 --> 00:37:52,202
to continue living?

451
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:56,749
Love?

452
00:38:02,004 --> 00:38:03,464
If you think about it...

453
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:07,676
Love is the reason why...

454
00:38:08,927 --> 00:38:13,223
The Lord Jesus Christ chose to die...

455
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:16,518
In order to save us from our sins.

456
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:20,064
Because He so loved us deeply.

457
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:27,571
That is also the same for people
who is suffering immensely.

458
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:31,075
Why do you think...

459
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:33,243
They fight to live?

460
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:36,121
And hold on to hope?

461
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,045
It's because of all the people
who care and love them truly.

462
00:38:47,216 --> 00:38:48,300
Even though...

463
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:53,097
humans are always making mistakes.

464
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:57,059
The Lord always forgives us.

465
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:01,146
Because the Lord loves us.

466
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:09,613
Now...

467
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:12,324
I truly understand.

468
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:15,911
Why Juanito fell in love with you.

469
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:19,665
Not because you're
pretending to be Carmelita.

470
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,168
But because you...

471
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,334
You...

472
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:26,547
Are Carmela.

473
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:29,133
He fell for the real you.

474
00:39:32,427 --> 00:39:35,305
Just like twins with identical faces...

475
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,060
They still have differences.

476
00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:46,692
In appearance, you may be Carmelita.

477
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:50,487
But when it comes to the heart...

478
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:53,657
And the mind...

479
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:57,035
You are Carmela.

480
00:40:01,123 --> 00:40:02,166
Now...

481
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:06,170
Do you still doubt Juanito's feelings?

482
00:41:24,747 --> 00:41:26,419
- Miss Carmelita,
- Mm?

483
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:28,208
there's something I need to tell you.

484
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:29,975
What is it?

485
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,508
I'm not sure, but...

486
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:40,055
I think I saw Mr. Juanito at
the fish area in the market.

487
00:41:41,056 --> 00:41:42,182
Did he see you?

488
00:41:43,016 --> 00:41:44,476
I don't think so.

489
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:46,895
I wanted to call him but

490
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,981
I was with Mother Ofelia at the time.

491
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:53,193
Maybe it wasn't him.

492
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:56,947
How unlikely it is for us
to see Mr. Juanito here.

493
00:41:58,073 --> 00:41:59,616
Teresita, listen to me.

494
00:42:00,242 --> 00:42:01,994
That was really Juanito.

495
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:04,162
I saw him yesterday.

496
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:08,500
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

497
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:12,296
I wanted to keep it a
secret that he lives here.

498
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:15,048
We have to be careful.

499
00:42:15,424 --> 00:42:19,553
If Father and Mother learn
that he was exiled here...

500
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:23,473
They'll force us back to San Alfonso.

501
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,185
What should we do?

502
00:42:45,912 --> 00:42:50,092
Miss, why don't we just
approach Mr. Juanito?

503
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:51,770
I'm not ready to face him.

504
00:42:52,544 --> 00:42:53,628
Who are you?

505
00:42:53,795 --> 00:42:55,272
And where are you from?

506
00:42:55,297 --> 00:42:57,132
We are not bad people.

507
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:02,763
A Tagalog from a wealthy family.

508
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:05,256
Who are you?

509
00:43:05,474 --> 00:43:06,600
Why are you here?

510
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:12,147
Are you spies?

511
00:43:21,907 --> 00:43:22,908
Father Caloy!

512
00:43:23,575 --> 00:43:26,119
They're daughters of the
family we serve in Bulacan.

513
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:35,045
Please excuse them, Father Caloy.

514
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,881
These ladies are our guests.

515
00:43:42,177 --> 00:43:43,224
Alright then.

516
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,723
Don't let them roam around alone.

517
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,434
They might get into trouble.

518
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,370
I wanted to ask,
General Leandro.

519
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:11,790
Are you and my daughter
really in love with each other?

520
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,250
In love or not,

521
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,211
we all know you need
this engagement more than us.

522
00:44:16,211 --> 00:44:18,130
To clean the
reputation of your daughter.

523
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,172
Juanito!

524
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,217
Can we just talk for a bit?

525
00:44:22,217 --> 00:44:23,844
I don't want to have
anything to do with you.

526
00:44:24,177 --> 00:44:25,053
Every time I see you,

527
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:27,973
I remember the betrayal
your father did to our family.

528
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,642
Just pretend we didn't meet.

529
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,270
Juanito!

530
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,188
It's Mother!

531
00:44:35,188 --> 00:44:36,565
No wedding shall happen

532
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:38,984
between Carmelita and Leandro.

533
00:44:38,984 --> 00:44:41,903
I am here to inform all of you...

534
00:44:41,903 --> 00:44:45,907
That Carmelita decided
to be a servant of the church.

535
00:44:49,578 --> 00:44:50,579
- Father!
- Alejandro!

536
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,205
I hope you promise

537
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:56,626
that the mouse
will never leave his beloved cat.

538
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:57,544
Carmelita,

539
00:44:57,544 --> 00:45:01,006
I hope you will
choose me in the end.
