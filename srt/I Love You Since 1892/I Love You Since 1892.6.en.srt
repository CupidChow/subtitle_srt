1
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:31,234
I have to plan
everything smoothly

2
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:32,901
in order
to stop all of this.

3
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:34,569
Which is actually not that difficult

4
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:36,780
since they already have
feelings for each other.

5
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:40,533
how did you know that
window is the room of Mr. Juanito?

6
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:42,035
In fairness,

7
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:44,871
his room is clean and tidy.

8
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,246
Who are you?!

9
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:47,637
Miss! Wait!

10
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:49,347
Don't you dare look!

11
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:51,753
Juanito.

12
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:56,925
Carmelita promised me.

13
00:00:58,468 --> 00:01:00,261
That she will not push through
with the wedding.

14
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,138
And you believed her?

15
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:03,765
Just don't worry anymore, okay?

16
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,350
I will help you and Helena.

17
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:07,268
On one condition.

18
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:12,023
Promise me,
no matter what happens,

19
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:14,067
you'll survive.

20
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,777
I will make sure

21
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:17,946
from now on

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,699
that no other woman will die
in that lake from now on,

23
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,492
because of love.

24
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:58,975
Seems like you prepared
for this night, Miss.

25
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:03,623
Speak for yourself. You
look much more prepared.

26
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:17,656
You can put your gifts here.

27
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:22,442
I will put mine later.

28
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:27,791
What are you doing here?

29
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:31,169
I'm here to accompany you for a while.

30
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:38,176
Most people here
haven't met each other yet.

31
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:44,710
And some who are lucky might
meet the one destined for them.

32
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:48,026
If you come out often...

33
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:50,753
And go meet more people,

34
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:51,529
I'm sure...

35
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,380
Many would admire you
and would want to be friends.

36
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:05,976
How can you be sure they'll like me?

37
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,556
Because you are
friendly and easy to talk to.

38
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,519
And who told you we're already friends?

39
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,534
You are already a part of my life.

40
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:26,544
I suppose our first
meeting wasn't really ideal.

41
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,003
Oh, are you referring to...

42
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,299
That day you saved me when I fainted?

43
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,230
Or when...

44
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:40,140
You thought I was a thief and
you almost had your dog bite me?

45
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:43,340
Seems only yesterday.

46
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:46,506
I thought you were a criminal.

47
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:49,788
But now, we're friends.

48
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,397
Miss, do you want to change
the memory of when we first met?

49
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:02,208
Let's pretend we haven't met yet.

50
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:08,062
And tonight is the first
time we'll see each other.

51
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,569
Crazy. Does he want to
do an acting challenge?

52
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,774
Oh well! Whatever happens, so be it!

53
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,258
Of course, i won't let myself lose.

54
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,808
A most wonderful night...

55
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,233
I'm Juanito Alfonso.

56
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:44,172
May I know your name?

57
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:51,861
I'm sure it is as beautiful
as the light of the moon.

58
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,831
What is this?

59
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,374
Am I getting jealous?

60
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:40,047
This can't be, Carmela!

61
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:41,744
Erase! Erase!

62
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:26,960
Maria's party that was prepared by Father
was exactly like this right?

63
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:33,984
For sure.

64
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:41,696
Ouch!

65
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:45,032
Carmelita? Do you feel alright?

66
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47,236
It hurts.

67
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:48,568
Your chest hurts?

68
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:51,330
No... my tummy.

69
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:53,624
Let's go home.

70
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,419
Alright, I'll come with you.

71
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,967
Let's go. We'll go ahead.

72
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,187
Miss Carmelita.

73
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:17,123
Yes?

74
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,741
May I talk to you?

75
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,348
Oh, it's you, Angelito.

76
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:24,961
What is it?

77
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:33,602
I just have something
I'd like to ask, Miss.

78
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:41,429
It won't be long and you'll
become a part of our family.

79
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:46,280
But that will only happen if your wedding
to my brother will push through.

80
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,375
Do take care always.

81
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:53,809
Juanito told me truth about that night
I caught you inside his bedroom.

82
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,189
Damn. Why would Juanito tell him? Unfair.

83
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,592
I didn't even tell Maria
and Josefina about our plan.

84
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,184
I know he doesn't want
to marry you as well.

85
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,451
But it's not easy to
bargain with our Father.

86
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,582
And I'm sure Don Alejandro
will get angry once he discovers your plan.

87
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:19,126
I don't want my brother to get hurt.

88
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:28,302
Did he say he doesn't wanna marry me?

89
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:31,537
He didn't really say that.

90
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:35,567
But he likes Miss Helena.

91
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:46,197
In fact, if you weren't
caught by our Father together,

92
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:51,059
He was planning to ask Captain Flores
for Helena's hand in marriage.

93
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:54,405
Don't worry.

94
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:56,881
I don't really want to get married.

95
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:00,838
You're so cute.

96
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:03,787
You know, if you and
Emily will be seen together,

97
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,499
people will think
you're siblings.

98
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,567
Emily?

99
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:12,792
Is she the one with you
when you went to our house?

100
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:15,403
Oh, no. That's Theresita.

101
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:17,611
Theresita?

102
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,993
What family does she belong to?

103
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,576
- She's our servant.
- Miss.

104
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:25,669
Doña Soledad might be looking for you.

105
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:29,520
Good morning.

106
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:33,607
I'll go ahead.

107
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,292
Of course, sir.

108
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:36,924
You don't have to call me that.

109
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:40,123
Miss Carmelita.

110
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:46,703
Juanito's got wrong timing as always.
His brother's trying to make moves here!

111
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:52,445
Angelito, will you give me
and Miss Carmelita a little privacy?

112
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,686
Such a shy guy. Just like his brother.

113
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:06,055
It's nice to think that you

114
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,791
became closer to my
brother in a short span of time.

115
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:11,989
How are you feeling, by the way?

116
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,843
My head was aching last
night that's why we had to go.

117
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:22,416
But Sonya told me you
were having stomach pains.

118
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,545
And then my stomach hurt.

119
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,332
I had indigestion that's why

120
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:31,215
we had to go home.

121
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:33,505
Don't neglect your health.

122
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,389
Eat properly and sleep early.

123
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,602
It's better to exercise once in a while.

124
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:45,314
Get out more and soak up the sun.

125
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:50,834
By the way...

126
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,033
Helena agreed to go out with me.

127
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:56,823
We're going to the field of roses.

128
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,733
Do you want to come?

129
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,731
Does he want me to be a
third-wheel or a chaperone?

130
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,362
No way!

131
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:10,881
No, thanks. I have lots
of things to do at home.

132
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:12,716
Good luck to the two of you.

133
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,512
What did you say?

134
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:18,138
Good... Good luck?

135
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,620
Oh,

136
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,678
it's an expression
Maria, Josefina and I

137
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:29,595
say when we want to
encourage someone.

138
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:30,664
Good luck. Like that.

139
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:35,649
Good luck.

140
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:38,074
Good luck.

141
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:52,484
Dear diary,

142
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:54,677
I'm supposed to be happy for them.

143
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,205
But what is this?

144
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:59,289
I can't explain what
I'm feeling now.

145
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:03,434
I am here to be the bridge
for Juanito and Helena.

146
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:06,913
Just like how I became a
bridge for James and Shae.

147
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:09,266
But unlike Shae...

148
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,816
I'm not a traitor.

149
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:14,361
And I will never fall for Juanito.

150
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,776
Because it's not right to
fall in love with someone

151
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,171
who is already in love with someone else.

152
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:21,853
Totally confused,

153
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,150
Carmela.

154
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:35,841
Why did Juanito tell me
that he's going on a date with Helena?

155
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,845
While I'm dying of boredom here.

156
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,975
No... I just drank too much coffee.

157
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:46,852
Right... That's right..

158
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:52,608
Carmelita?

159
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:56,612
Do you want to come and stroll around
the hacienda with Theresita and I?

160
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,740
Wait, is Carmelita like this too?

161
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,575
Stuck inside her room?

162
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,457
I don't want to be like her.

163
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:09,166
I'm going out.

164
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,630
It's a good thing you decided
to come with us, Carmelita.

165
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,334
Of couse,

166
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:20,010
I want to get busy so
I wouldn't wonder how

167
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,354
happy Juanito must be
with Helena right now.

168
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:26,877
Carmelita!

169
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,754
Sonya, what are you doing here?

170
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:36,573
I heard that Eduardo will
serenade Maria later tonight.

171
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:42,991
Juanito will play the guitar
and they will be accompanied by Ignacio.

172
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,252
That's why I brought Helena with me.

173
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:49,827
Won't...

174
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,751
Father and Mother see?

175
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,557
They'll be heading home tomorrow.

176
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,506
So there won't be any problem.

177
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:04,165
Gosh! She's wearing it.

178
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:08,688
Thank you very much
for your gift, Carmelita.

179
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:10,310
You chose really well.

180
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,938
Juanito noticed this hair pin as well.

181
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:16,984
It suits you.

182
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:22,698
OMG. Was she wearing that during her date
with Juanito earlier?

183
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,704
It's okay. I'm sure there's
lots of hair clips like that.

184
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,709
Shit. What if Juanito asked her
where she bought that clip?

185
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:36,462
I feel like I want to faint.

186
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,387
Do I look alright?

187
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:48,439
- Of course!
- They're here!

188
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:52,603
♪ There's something I want to tell you. ♪

189
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,847

198
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,521
My beloved, Maria.

199
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,839
Please accept my heart.

200
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:47,966
That beats only for you.

201
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:57,703
Oh, Juanito.

202
00:17:58,672 --> 00:17:59,881
Since we're already here...

203
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:03,340
Why don't you sing a song
to Miss Helena as well?

204
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:10,557
What?

205
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:13,350
Did I hear that right?

206
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,499
A song to Helena?

207
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:20,749
Damn! Too many people know about our plan!

208
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,441
Ignacio also knows!

209
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:29,356
Ignacio, I'm asking you
what you mean by that.

210
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:35,538
Maria, I'll be the one to explain to you.

211
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:42,045
Maria...

212
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:43,922
Thank you for visiting me.

213
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:45,816
Maria...

214
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,593
You can all go home now, gentlemen.

215
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:10,449
Carmelita.

216
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,784
Explain yourself to me.

217
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:15,787
Maria...

218
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:19,513
Juanito and I have decided...

219
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,961
To do something to stop the wedding.

220
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,008
Carmelita!

221
00:19:29,593 --> 00:19:31,011
Why did you do that?

222
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,098
You know how important
this is for our family.

223
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:41,181
What do I do?
I hope she won't tell on me.

224
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:47,659
I understand that you're still young.

225
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,615
And you're probably
not ready to get married.

226
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,390
But I hope you understand that
this is the will of Father and Mother.

227
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,738
What will they say once
they find out about this?

228
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:06,229
Don't worry.

229
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:10,830
Juanito and I will make sure to
say everything at the right time and...

230
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:13,500
In the proper way.

231
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,681
I'm sorry for not telling you and Josefina.

232
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:23,303
Carmelita,

233
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:25,048
I am your sister.

234
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,152
You can tell me anything.

235
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,528
Is there another reason why you did it?

236
00:20:41,194 --> 00:20:43,821
I can't tell her the real reason.

237
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,458
Maria...

238
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:55,705
I am still in love with Leandro.

239
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:04,730
I knew it.

240
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,426
You won't easily forget your first love.

241
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:10,085
Wow,

242
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:14,363
I didn't know the "I still love
Leandro" excuse would be effective.

243
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,908
You bought too much
again. What are all these?

244
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:23,959
Father! Mother!

245
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:25,503
Welcome home!

246
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:31,468
Good morning, Don Alejandro, Doña Soledad.

247
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:33,301
Miss Carmelita.

248
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:37,654
What the hell is he doing here?

249
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:43,310
How are you and Helena?

250
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:46,733
All good.

251
00:21:52,694 --> 00:21:56,656
You know, I already told
Maria about our plan last night.

252
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,325
She agreed to it.

253
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:03,457
That's great.

254
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,587
You know, you did something wrong to me.

255
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:13,052
That's right.

256
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:16,676
You told Ignacio and
Angelito about our plan.

257
00:22:19,195 --> 00:22:20,822
It was Sonya who told Ignacio.

258
00:22:22,351 --> 00:22:24,020
And regarding Angelito...

259
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:27,534
I told him the truth because
he will let our parents know.

260
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,342
that he saw you in my bedroom.

261
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:33,670
He's right. It's better
for Angelito to know the

262
00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:37,764
truth instead of having
more rumors about us.

263
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:41,368
To be honest, you were
the one who did me wrong.

264
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:49,334
Why did you gifted Helena
the hair pin that I gave you?

265
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:58,385
It's because I forgot
to buy a gift for her.

266
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:01,304
That's why I ended up gifting it to her.

267
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:06,643
Besides, wouldn't that make her more happy
since it was you who chose it?

268
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,060
Well, then...

269
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,777
I guess I mean nothing to you.

270
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,255
Juanito!

271
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:21,329
Hey!

272
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:24,680
Wait... Juanito!

273
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:27,842
Annoying!

274
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:29,791
Why is Juanito like that?

275
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:34,216
Are you ready, Carmelita?

276
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:38,133
We're going to Hacienda Alfonso
for Juanito's going-away party.

277
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:43,824
It's a hard pass for me. He got mad
about a mere hair pin. What a bummer.

278
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:50,103
Mom I really don't
feel well... It's like...

279
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:52,821
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

280
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:57,819
It's such a shame, then.

281
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:59,838
He's leaving tomorrow.

282
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:02,079
but you wouldn't get to see each other.

283
00:24:04,272 --> 00:24:05,631
I am really sorry, Mother.

284
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,874
Alright. You rest here.

285
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:38,300
Carmelita.

286
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,197
What is that?

287
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:42,966
A letter from Juanito.

288
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,986
Just put it on the table, Josefina.

289
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:49,639
Don't you want to read it?

290
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,869
Alright.

291
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:57,732
You read it first.

292
00:24:58,051 --> 00:25:00,136
Just tell me all about it tomorrow.

293
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:10,743
Just relax, Carmela, this
doesn't mean anything.

294
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:12,346
Nothing.

295
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:15,191
It's because you didn't attend his party

296
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:17,179
that's why he's gonna ask a favor.

297
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:19,549
Don't assume anything.

298
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,152
Don't assume anything...

299
00:25:25,603 --> 00:25:26,615
Carmelita,

300
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:28,468
first of all,

301
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,746
I want to apologize for the way I acted.

302
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:36,827
I realize that you are not here
because you don't want to see me.

303
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,157
I truly understand.

304
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,863
You might be also aware

305
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:44,431
that I am coming back to Manila tomorrow.

306
00:25:46,366 --> 00:25:49,953
I regret not being
able to travel with you.

307
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:54,227
According to Josefina,
you'll be leaving by Friday.

308
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,078
Carmelita,

309
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:59,915
If your anger towards me has dissipated,

310
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:04,279
may I talk to you tomorrow?

311
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:06,948
There's something I want to tell you.

312
00:26:08,575 --> 00:26:11,119
I hope you can come.

313
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,829
I will be waiting.

314
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:14,134
Juanito.

315
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:33,491
Oh. What's that, Carmela?
Why are you smiling?

316
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:35,155
That can't be.

317
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:38,730
That can't be. No way.

318
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:42,150
But it's really quite difficult.

319
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:44,694
Juanito's so irritating.

320
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,822
You're irritating, Juanito!

321
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:55,456
Josefina, good morning.

322
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,650
Where is Father and Mother?
I will ask for permission.

323
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,626
They're still sleeping.

324
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:01,767
What do I do about this then?

325
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:08,364
I'll handle it.

326
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:12,603
I will tell them you went to the garden
to gather ingredients for breakfast.

327
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:13,628
Alright.

328
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:16,707
I'll make myself pretty. I'm excited.

329
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,306
Good morning to you.

330
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:21,204
Helena...

331
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:24,965
I'll go ahead so you two can talk.

332
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:31,533
What are you doing here?

333
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,037
You are the reason
Juanito and I became closer.

334
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:39,624
I wanted you to be the first to know.

335
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,627
I'm planning on accepting
his proposal today.

336
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,341
I'll go to him now to surprise him.

337
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:52,061
She's getting ahead of me, huh?

338
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:53,633
Wait...

339
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:55,669
She'll accept Juanito's proposal?

340
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:58,637
Does that mean they'll be a couple?

341
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,332
Carmelita?

342
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:08,194
I was just stunned.

343
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,315
I'm happy for the two of you.

344
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:11,798
Yeah.

345
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:13,988
Thank you so much, Carmelita.

346
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:15,967
You're such a true friend.

347
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:34,639
The necklace...

348
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:36,389
Juanito said

349
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:40,209
he'll only give that to the
woman who will own his heart.

350
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,626
It's really Helena whom he loves.

351
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,357
I won't see him then.

352
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,818
I don't care if he thinks I'm mad at him.

353
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:50,714
It's the right thing to do.

354
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:53,638
So that the plan will be successful.

355
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:55,909
Then I'll fulfill my mission

356
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:57,744
and go back to my own time.

357
00:28:59,078 --> 00:28:59,883
But

358
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,358
why do I feel this way?

359
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,516
I should be happy.

360
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:06,555
But I feel differently...

361
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:12,790
One week has passed

362
00:29:13,213 --> 00:29:15,006
but I'm still here.

363
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:19,807
Patiently waiting if Carmelita and
Juanito's destiny will still come true.

364
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:23,692
And my persistent feelings

365
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,756
are slowly disappearing.

366
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,444
I'm okay now,

367
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:29,776
I'm not even complaining.

368
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:31,544
except for...

369
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,078
Miss Carmelita.

370
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,115
A new letter came from Sir Juanito.

371
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:41,290
Juanito is quite eager in sending letters.

372
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,737
That's the third one this week.

373
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,346
I'll read it later.

374
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,505
Are you not reading it?

375
00:29:57,887 --> 00:30:00,002
I don't want to reply to his letters.

376
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:03,002
I don't want to ruin his
relationship with Helena.

377
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:08,214
This other letter is still
addressed to you, Miss.

378
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:10,441
This is from Miss Natasha.

379
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:14,105
Natasha?

380
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:16,477
Why would she write to me?

381
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:23,755
She wants to teach me how to cook?

382
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:26,466
That's great.

383
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:29,335
Natasha is known for
her skills in cooking.

384
00:30:31,671 --> 00:30:33,205
I don't want to go out.

385
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:34,575
I apologize, Mother.

386
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:36,353
Thank you.

387
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:45,518
I noticed you seem edgy since
the day Juanito left for Manila.

388
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:48,660
You need something to take up your time.

389
00:30:51,607 --> 00:30:53,067
Don't worry, Carmelita.

390
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:54,914
I'll just accompany you.

391
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,363
We're not gonna be there long.

392
00:30:58,364 --> 00:31:00,533
What's important is that we show up.

393
00:31:09,459 --> 00:31:12,628
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

394
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,388
Plastic.

395
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,217
Just the other day, she's
arguing with Maria and I,

396
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:20,457
but now she's acting
like where best friends.

397
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:25,101
It was our Mother's
wish for us to come here.

398
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:27,939
Let us go to the kitchen?

399
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:40,663
I forgot the cook book
we need for this recipe.

400
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:44,458
Can you get it from
Father's office, Carmelita?

401
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:46,999
It's just on the table.

402
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,188
Wait a minute...

403
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:53,795
is she giving me orders?

404
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:56,089
Shall we go ahead, Maria?

405
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:20,196
This isn't the cookbook
she's talking about.

406
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:23,228
As if we're friends.

407
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:24,504
She's got a screw loose, I think.

408
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:25,952
Where is it?

409
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:30,649
This is a dictionary.

410
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,503
It's not here.

411
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,264
- Natasha's so annoying.
- Are you looking for this?

412
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:50,869
Oh. Yes, it is.

413
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,110
Yes, that right. This is it.

414
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,781
I've only been away for seven months,

415
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,953
but it seems like you've
already forgotten me, Carmelita.

416
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:17,373
You're handsome, but that doesn't
mean you can just hold my hand like that.

417
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,306
Seems like he knows Carmelita.

418
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:23,892
It's pretending time again.

419
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,221
How are you doing?

420
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,561
You've changed so much.

421
00:33:31,225 --> 00:33:32,702
Well, I'll be going.

422
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,495
So much to do in the kitchen.

423
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,859
Are you not mad at me anymore?

424
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:44,113
Why would I be angry at you?

425
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:47,684
Leandro.

426
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,229
When did you return to San Alfonso?

427
00:33:52,788 --> 00:33:54,916
Oh my gosh!

428
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,001
What am I gonna do?

429
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,504
He's Leandro and he's back?

430
00:34:08,638 --> 00:34:10,765
I was supposed to come back next year.

431
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,652
But the terrible news came to me.

432
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:17,980
That my love is set to be married.

433
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:22,508
He's saying too much

434
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,278
and I don't even know him.

435
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:27,073
Why would Maria leave me in this moment?

436
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,372
I'm sorry.

437
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:41,008
I forget that you're still mad at me.

438
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:46,801
So, Carmelita is mad with her ex?

439
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:48,245
That's alright.

440
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:54,684
Maybe I just need some
time to think things through.

441
00:34:57,436 --> 00:35:03,276
I didn't think the "I need time and
space" excuse would be effective too.

442
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:07,326
Do you mean to say...

443
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,649
There's still a chance
you might forgive me?

444
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:16,283
I don't know?

445
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:17,398
Maybe?

446
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:19,661
I'm not sure.

447
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:25,172
I will do everything for you to forgive me.

448
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:27,220
My love,

449
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:30,920
I am hoping we can
rekindle our relationship.

450
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:34,831
He looks sincere.

451
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,252
But I am not your ex.

452
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:41,063
Why am I always put
in a stressful situation?

453
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:45,223
Do you still remember?

454
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:46,944
Before I left...

455
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:49,739
I have given you something.

456
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:52,158
But you didn't accept it.

457
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,208
What? Is he proposing?

458
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:05,546
I hope you'll accept my love for you.

459
00:36:11,427 --> 00:36:13,304
Even if we don't end up together...

460
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:15,181
It is still for you.

461
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,852
Is this for real?

462
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:25,858
It's a real diamond! I wonder
how much I can sell this for.

463
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:29,615
Do you still remember?

464
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:32,859
What I told you before I left?

465
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,412
I promised you...

466
00:36:39,038 --> 00:36:40,247
That I shall return.

467
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,175
I understand it wholeheartedly

468
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:45,044
if you won't be able to wait for me.

469
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,672
But...

470
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:50,132
I didn't expect it.

471
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,346
That you would agree to get married

472
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,805
to the son of Don Mariano Alfonso.

473
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:01,018
I was deeply hurt.

474
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:08,442
But I found hope when
Helena wrote me a letter...

475
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:10,575
Saying...

476
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:13,080
you didn't really want
to get married to Juanito.

477
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:15,316
Because

478
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,937
you still hold me inside your heart.

479
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:21,612
That's right.

480
00:37:21,722 --> 00:37:25,059
I used Leandro's name

481
00:37:25,216 --> 00:37:27,927
to convince Helena
that I don't like Juanito.

482
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:29,930
Wrong move.

483
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:31,799
Helena's quick to divulge it.

484
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:34,468
That's why I fought hard.

485
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:36,842
I promised

486
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:38,997
that I will return to you.

487
00:37:40,182 --> 00:37:42,435
Even though we faced storms in the sea.

488
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:44,615
I prayed

489
00:37:45,703 --> 00:37:46,746
for a safe return.

490
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:49,264
So that I may be by your side, Carmelita.

491
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,524
Poor guy...

492
00:37:53,863 --> 00:37:57,063
Maybe Carmelita was mad at him.

493
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,261
But I'm not Carmelita.

494
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,156
There's no reason for me to be mad.

495
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:20,743
can we meet at the church?

496
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:27,057
Oh gosh, won't he let me be?

497
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:30,214
I just want a peaceful life.

498
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:39,001
If I agree to meet him,

499
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,410
he'll ask too many questions.

500
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,120
But I don't know him!

501
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,830
We're total strangers!

502
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:48,137
Miss,

503
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:51,341
you don't plan to meet up with Mr. Leandro?

504
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:53,651
You read that?

505
00:38:59,415 --> 00:39:01,129
Miss Carmelita,

506
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:05,136
I understand that you are
still upset with Mr. Leandro.

507
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:11,042
But I feel that he
completely regrets leaving.

508
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:14,168
What is this?

509
00:39:14,357 --> 00:39:17,318
I don't even know what
that guy did to Carmelita.

510
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,403
It's better for me to avoid him.

511
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,077
I don't have to right to forgive.

512
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:24,954
I'm not Carmelita.

513
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:28,624
I wasn't the one who loved and got hurt.

514
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:58,569
Carmelita?

515
00:40:00,113 --> 00:40:01,489
You can't sleep as well?

516
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:07,823
Same for me.

517
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,690
Maybe it's normal when
one thinks of too many things.

518
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,460
Do you have a problem?

519
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:27,485
For the past ten years,

520
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:31,267
this problem and worry of mine...

521
00:40:33,002 --> 00:40:34,943
Still lingers up to this day.

522
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:47,512
You know the first time

523
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,744
I disobeyed Mother.

524
00:40:55,965 --> 00:40:58,185
Now I know who I got
this spunky attitude from.

525
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:01,926
Since then...

526
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,056
Eduardo and I became close.

527
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:11,101
And when I became fourteen...

528
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:17,399
He confessed his love to me.

529
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:24,531
He secretly courted me for about a year.

530
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:26,696
That is why...

531
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:31,372
I am thankful.

532
00:41:32,998 --> 00:41:36,961
That up until now, you and
Josefina kept our relationship secret.

533
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,673
What if you tell Father
and Mother about it?

534
00:41:41,191 --> 00:41:42,692
So you can prepare for your wedding.

535
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,304
I wish it's that simple.

536
00:41:49,098 --> 00:41:49,949
But...

537
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,722
Father and Mother would not allow it.

538
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,650
Eduardo comes from a poor family.

539
00:42:00,993 --> 00:42:02,183
His father, Raul,

540
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:04,472
is our butcher.

541
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,223
And his mother is sick.

542
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:11,935
And Theresita

543
00:42:13,305 --> 00:42:14,806
our servant.

544
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:18,544
That's right.

545
00:42:18,676 --> 00:42:20,886
Status is everything in their era.

546
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,590
I'm afraid that

547
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:28,095
once Father discovers everything...

548
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,974
He'll take me away from Eduardo.

549
00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:34,518
What if Father understands?

550
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:40,315
We don't know what he's capable of.

551
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:45,070
He once said

552
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,156
that he could stand to lose anything

553
00:42:48,157 --> 00:42:51,493
but not the honor and name of our family.

554
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,782
That's why, Carmelita...

555
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,680
I hope you don't throw away

556
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:08,489
the love you have with Leandro.

557
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:14,475
I hope you give him a
chance to make it up to you.

558
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:21,857
And if you and Juanito succeed
in stopping the wedding...

559
00:43:24,193 --> 00:43:26,570
And he and Helena end up with each other...

560
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:31,825
I hope you open up your heart again...

561
00:43:33,702 --> 00:43:35,287
For Leandro.

562
00:44:00,646 --> 00:44:01,420
Carmelita,

563
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:03,159
I hope you will give me a chance.

564
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:04,182
Don't worry.

565
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,190
I will do everything

566
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,958
for us to be together again.

567
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:16,178
You two seem busy at this moment.

568
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:17,913
Your family has been invited

569
00:44:17,913 --> 00:44:20,204
to the birthday of the
Governor General in Manila.

570
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:24,361
I'm sure your Aunt Rosario
will be pleased to see you.

571
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:32,528
Ladies and gentlemen!

572
00:44:32,553 --> 00:44:34,501
Tonight we celebrate

573
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:36,611
- not only with good food,
- Salud!

574
00:44:37,546 --> 00:44:38,860
Miss Carmelita.

575
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,867
May I have this dance?

576
00:44:44,022 --> 00:44:45,290
I'm just wondering.

577
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,731
If I'm here now inside
Carmelita's body…

578
00:44:47,756 --> 00:44:49,216
Where is the real Carmelita?

579
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:50,404
She's here right with you.

580
00:44:52,214 --> 00:44:53,257
You're holding her right now.

581
00:44:53,378 --> 00:44:54,504
OMG.

582
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,047
Is Carmelita inside there?!

583
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,595
Are you just worried

584
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,246
or...

585
00:44:59,246 --> 00:45:01,916
are you starting to have
feelings for her?
