1
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:49,052
The moment this diary
bursts into flames

2
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:50,929
and turns to ash...

3
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:51,930
That would mean

4
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,453
you failed your mission.

5
00:00:53,478 --> 00:00:54,938
To save Juanito.

6
00:00:54,963 --> 00:00:56,047
Is it because

7
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,531
Does that mean

8
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:59,517
Juanito's still alive?

9
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,957
I swear we won't cause
any more trouble.

10
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:03,968
We won't show
our faces here.

11
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:05,610
There is only one way

12
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,904
for you to be
with your husband.

13
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:10,240
And that is death.

14
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:12,159
Carmelita...

15
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:16,859
Sonya?

16
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:31,720
Josefina? Josefina!

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,888
Josefina!

18
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:35,015
- Hindi!
- Josefina!

19
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,350
- Josefina!
- My poor daughter!

20
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,061
You need to marry Leandro.

21
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:44,691
If not, all I worked hard for
will be for nothing.

22
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:47,569
What Carmelita would
remember once she wakes up...

23
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:50,113
will be the time
before she met Juanito.

24
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:52,255
But it will only happen

25
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:54,451
if you succeed in your mission.

26
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:02,037
Mother, who is your guest?

27
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:26,811
Mr. Valdez.

28
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,231
What are you doing here?

29
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,111
He's here to tell you something.

30
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,085
About Juanito.

31
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:42,911
It's true

32
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:49,364
that we planned the attack
on San Alfonso's plaza.

33
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:55,256
It's true that Juanito was the mastermind.

34
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,651
But...

35
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,574
He has nothing to do
with the death of Josefina.

36
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:10,313
Juanito would never hurt innocent people.

37
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:11,982
Especially Josefina

38
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:14,901
who became close to him.

39
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:21,366
We were all shocked.

40
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,326
Most especially Catapang.

41
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,537
When we heard

42
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:30,041
that Mr. Raul stabbed Josefina.

43
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:35,046
Our main objective

44
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:36,464
with the attack

45
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:39,926
was to create a diversion.

46
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:42,137
And kill

47
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:47,267
Gobernadorcillo Flores who was also present
at the plaza that night.

48
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:51,980
We believe

49
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:54,733
that

50
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:56,341
it was only

51
00:05:57,444 --> 00:06:00,864
Mr. Raul's personal grudge against

52
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:03,283
Don Alejandro.

53
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:04,373
Which is why

54
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:07,287
he hurt

55
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:09,056
Josefina.

56
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:13,630
Now,

57
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm afraid...

58
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,257
That...

59
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:26,306
That they would not relent
on torturing Juanito in prison.

60
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:32,873
Mister...

61
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,005
What can I do?

62
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,448
Juanito is important

63
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,869
to Catapang because he is an Alfonso.

64
00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:56,002
Many joined our group

65
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:58,296
when they heard the news

66
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:02,592
that Juanito also joined the rebel forces.

67
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,767
Mother Olivia.

68
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,641
Is there a problem?

69
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:15,897
Did something happen?

70
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,651
I heard that

71
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:26,282
they're planning to execute Juanito.

72
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:28,535
On the 7th of December.

73
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:31,996
It's the 5th of December today.

74
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:34,290
How can they execute him

75
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,502
without even trying his case at court?

76
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:40,588
In Juanito's case,

77
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,926
a trial might not be needed at all.

78
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:48,572
Because it's clear that he's a rebel.

79
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:52,767
The reason

80
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:54,978
his execution was delayed...

81
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:56,994
Was...

82
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,567
Was because Judge Fernandez was hoping

83
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:04,070
Juanito would reveal
where the rebels are hiding.

84
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:09,617
But Juanito didn't say a word.

85
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,210
I visited Juanito earlier.

86
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,546
And I learned

87
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,716
that he knows where Eduardo and Maria are.

88
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:29,095
Are you sure aboout that, Mother Olivia?

89
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,014
Where are they?

90
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:34,392
He wasn't able to tell me because

91
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:36,227
the guards had arrived.

92
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:38,646
They stopped our conversation.

93
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:43,651
Catapang will make a plan

94
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:46,905
to rescue Juanito out of prison.

95
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:51,784
But Catapang was not
made aware of my intentions

96
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,537
here with you because...

97
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,666
His disdain towards
your family is quite great.

98
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,913
But...

99
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:04,672
I need your help,

100
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:06,216
Carmelita.

101
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:11,163
Daughter,

102
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:16,059
Juanito is our only hope of finding Maria.

103
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:19,479
I want to help as well.

104
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:22,842
Mister,

105
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:25,318
how can I help?

106
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:27,178
First,

107
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:30,698
we need to convince

108
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,243
Judge Fernandez

109
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,994
to use

110
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,038
Carmelita.

111
00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:38,748
In order to

112
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:40,702
extract information

113
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:41,978
from Juanito

114
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:46,256
about the rebels' whereabouts.

115
00:09:58,184 --> 00:09:59,143
It's uncertain,

116
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:01,062
but this is our only hope.

117
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,773
We got Judge Fernandez
to agree to our plan.

118
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,984
and proceeded to Fort Santiago.

119
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:09,445
But as soon as we got to Juanito's cell,

120
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:11,489
everything fell to pieces.

121
00:10:12,393 --> 00:10:13,631
Let's stop the act!

122
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:17,583
I will give you one last chance, Juanito!

123
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:20,123
Tell me where the rebels are hiding!

124
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:28,923
You tricked me!

125
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:31,764
Juanito!

126
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:42,163
Let's go.

127
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,109
Stop!

128
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,253
Mother!

129
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:14,510
Let's get out of here!

130
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,180
Your escape is vital, Juanito!

131
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:21,684
Mother!

132
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:54,967
I'm sorry, Mother.

133
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,303
I'm sorry...

134
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:50,189
By the way...

135
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,987
This was found

136
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:58,781
in Doña Soledad's belongings.

137
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:13,379
My beloved daughter,

138
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:15,467
if you are reading this,

139
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:18,008
that means I am no longer in this world.

140
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:20,654
I have read your diary.

141
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:25,208
I know your true identity.

142
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,435
Despite that,

143
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:32,106
I will forever love you
as if you were my own.

144
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,067
I hope you would succeed in your mission

145
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:38,488
and wish happiness for you and Juanito.

146
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:40,114
Your mother,

147
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:43,075
Soledad Montecarlos.

148
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:03,930
You may go home, Carmelita.

149
00:14:05,723 --> 00:14:07,767
Mother Olivia took the
fall for what happened.

150
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,264
And because of that...

151
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,196
She was sentenced to death.

152
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:50,969
Mother Olivia is the only one who knows
what I'm truly going through.

153
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:53,523
I can't lose her too!

154
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,437
Don't worry about me, Carmela.

155
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,538
I have been alive for so long.

156
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:13,791
Before God even created humans.

157
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:17,962
What do you mean?

158
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:25,928
I am an angel, Carmela.

159
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:38,987
My name is Faida.

160
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,767
It means

161
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:45,323
"folded wings."

162
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:57,335
I have three rewards

163
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,794
that I could give.

164
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:03,007
Once I've used that up...

165
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:07,511
I can vanish from this world.

166
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,478
I gave the first one

167
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:18,334
when I fell in love with a mortal.

168
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:22,485
I used the first wish

169
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:25,488
to return him back from the dead.

170
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:32,328
I gave the second one...

171
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,458
To Carmelita.

172
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:47,677
Mother Olivia...

173
00:16:49,804 --> 00:16:50,825
May I

174
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:54,642
use the last one?

175
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:59,271
I want to know who killed Juanito.

176
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:10,199
Only you can find out who it was.

177
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:15,579
But I will give you a hint.

178
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:20,376
That person is just around here.

179
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,505
Watching everything you do.

180
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,342
You need to leave.

181
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:31,011
No... Mother Olivia!

182
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:33,055
Mother Olivia... wait a minute...

183
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:34,724
Mother...

184
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:14,956
Mother...

185
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,276
Carmela,

186
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,609
before I go,

187
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:29,945
I want to share with you
the story of my first love.

188
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:33,841
I fell in love with hi
when he saved a child.

189
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:39,455
It was also his kindness that
led to him being shot and killed.

190
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,403
I gave him my First Wish

191
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:44,732
in order to revive him.

192
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:48,870
Even at the cost of my form changing.

193
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:05,551
Ready!

194
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,004
Aim!

195
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:16,867
Fire!

196
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:44,603
Olivia...

197
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:05,124
Valentino...

198
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:28,147
Mother Olivia left me with
the memory of her first love.

199
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:32,036
She taught me that
despite the noise and chaos,

200
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:36,196
there is nothing two lovers can't do.

201
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:37,233
Esmeralda!

202
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:06,852
This is the first time I saw a
necklace made from wood.

203
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:08,740
I'll keep this for now, alright?

204
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:11,398
Princess!

205
00:21:13,943 --> 00:21:14,944
Who the hell are you?!

206
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:16,779
Don't you recognize me?

207
00:21:17,738 --> 00:21:18,906
I'm Mercedes.

208
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:21,450
The poor girl whom you once played with.

209
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,370
I was with my sister, Cristeta back then.

210
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:28,082
But because we're dirt-poor,

211
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,502
your father forbade you to befriend us.

212
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:36,357
Carding!

213
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:37,174
What's the update?

214
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:38,131
Catapang!

215
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:45,158
Our attack was successful.

216
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:46,881
Theresita...

217
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,188
Don't get your hopes up
about Mr. Juanito's love.

218
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:54,316
Catapang wants him to end up with Mercedes

219
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:55,943
and continue leading the group.

220
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:59,863
Don Alejandro may have killed my father...

221
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:02,825
But that doesn't give me
the right to hate you, Miss.

222
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:04,873
Because he was also

223
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:07,553
the reason for the death of Miss Josefina.

224
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:13,217
Juanito...

225
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:19,862
I am thankful you are still alive.

226
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:22,636
You have nothing to be thankful for.

227
00:22:26,098 --> 00:22:30,060
I need to live to end the misery
your family inflicted on us.

228
00:22:31,854 --> 00:22:32,913
Carding!

229
00:22:32,938 --> 00:22:33,990
get that woman.

230
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:39,361
- Juanito...
- Help me.

231
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:41,076
Wait -

232
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:41,755
Stand up!

233
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,325
- Where are you taking me?! Juanito!
- Come with us!

234
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:46,021
- Where are you taking me?!
- Just come with us!

235
00:22:46,046 --> 00:22:48,053
Juanito! Where the
hell are you taking me?!

236
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:49,121
- Just come with us already!
- Help me, please!

237
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:50,164
Juanito!

238
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:53,042
Where are you taking me?!

239
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:54,131
Stop!

240
00:22:58,005 --> 00:23:00,549
The Spanish were cruel to me.

241
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:02,468
They used me...

242
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:06,388
To cover up their corruption.

243
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:13,937
My sister-in-law asked for your help...

244
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:16,774
To inform your father

245
00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:18,901
about their hardships due to unfair wages.

246
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:22,863
Mang Nestor was Catapang's brother!

247
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:27,724
What would your father feel...

248
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,038
when I send him your severed head?

249
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:34,249
So that he may feel the pain

250
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:37,211
of his deeds.

251
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:39,255
The killing

252
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,006
of my brother

253
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:42,716
and his whole family!

254
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,595
Father didn't order the
murder of Trinidad's family.

255
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,131
Don't defend your father!

256
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:54,420
Maybe it's right for you to die.

257
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,913
As payment for his sins to me!

258
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:00,751
Uncle!

259
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,694
Our comrades are here!

260
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,878
I miss you all so much...

261
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:23,590
I miss my sisters.

262
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:26,459
I miss...

263
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:28,762
I miss my grandmother.

264
00:24:56,623 --> 00:24:57,791
My hunch was correct.

265
00:24:58,667 --> 00:24:59,763
You have fever.

266
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:07,660
This is effective for cough,
runny nose, and headache.

267
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:09,720
This herb. Use it.

268
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,308
Why are you even helping me?

269
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,020
Are you messing with my head?

270
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:21,190
I'm just helping you.

271
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:24,842
Aren't you supposed to be mad at me?

272
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:28,762
Aren't you supposed to hate my family?

273
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,486
Aren't you happier here?

274
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:38,457
Aren't you happier with Mercedes?

275
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:45,756
Just leave me alone.

276
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:49,760
And don't ever help me anymore.

277
00:25:55,724 --> 00:25:56,850
You can count on it.

278
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:00,062
I will never bother you again.

279
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,648
If that is what you want.

280
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,581
Help! Help!

281
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:21,500
Please help us! It's Mercedes!

282
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,043
Come help us!

283
00:26:23,752 --> 00:26:24,798
Mercedes?

284
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:29,704
Mercedes.

285
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:30,884
Juanito...

286
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:33,220
Let her down!

287
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:34,673
Assist her!

288
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,575
Mercedes?

289
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,798
What happened?!

290
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:41,353
We were doing laundry at the river

291
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,480
when Don Alejandro suddenly came.

292
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:45,649
And General Leandro...

293
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:47,484
He was looking for his daughter.

294
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:52,004
- He even showed Carmelita's photo.
- Mercedes?

295
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:54,491
But then, General Leandro saw Mercedes

296
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,952
wearing Carmelita's necklace.

297
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,622
Andoy helped us escape,

298
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:02,749
but Mercedes still got shot.

299
00:27:05,377 --> 00:27:07,004
I didn't know that...

300
00:27:07,222 --> 00:27:10,475
this will be the consequence of taking

301
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:13,400
Carmelita's necklace.

302
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:15,595
Now I know.

303
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,473
That I can never

304
00:27:19,057 --> 00:27:22,060
get the things not meant for me

305
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,146
no matter how much I desire them.

306
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:35,244
Mercedes?

307
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:07,360
Cut off that woman's head!

308
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:09,941
Juanito, no!

309
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:14,029
And send it to her father!

310
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:17,591
Juanito?

311
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:19,076
I should've killed you back then!

312
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:24,251
Carding!

313
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:35,634
Juanito!

314
00:28:36,593 --> 00:28:38,470
Just go, Carmelita.

315
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,679
- Go straight to that path!
- No, no!

316
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,889
- There's a river there!
- No!

317
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:42,974
- Once you cross you'll find...
- Juanito, I'm not leaving you here!

318
00:28:42,974 --> 00:28:45,060
- You'll find the guard's camp across!
- No, no!

319
00:28:45,394 --> 00:28:47,771
- Escape! You must escape, Carmelita!
- No!

320
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:49,481
Escape now, Carmelita!

321
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:52,025
You must escape, Carmelita!

322
00:29:33,024 --> 00:29:34,359
Miss Carmelita!

323
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,361
Thank God I found you.

324
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,071
You must get out of here, Miss.

325
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:41,032
- Don't let Mr. Leandro find you.
- Why?

326
00:29:41,283 --> 00:29:43,410
He was the one who paid Mr. Raul

327
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,662
to kill Miss Josefina.

328
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:46,939
What?

329
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:49,124
He also captured Angelito

330
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:51,001
to force Mr. Juanito to admit

331
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:52,878
planning your sister's murder.

332
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:54,421
General!

333
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:55,853
- The woman is here!
- Wait!

334
00:29:56,131 --> 00:29:57,924
Wait! What are you gonna do to Laura?

335
00:29:57,924 --> 00:29:59,776
Don't hurt Laura, wait!

336
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:02,053
Don't you lay your hands on her!

337
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:03,697
Wait!

338
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:04,548
What are you -

339
00:30:05,015 --> 00:30:06,056
Carmelita!

340
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:06,683
Are you alright?

341
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:07,976
Thank God you're alive.

342
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:09,286
Did they hurt you?

343
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:10,437
Are you in pain?

344
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:13,899
What are you gonna do to Laura?!

345
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:15,525
Carmelita.

346
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,260
Laura is a rebel!

347
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:18,411
Rebel?!

348
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:21,156
I know the truth!

349
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:25,368
You had Josefina killed
and you kidnapped Angelito!

350
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:27,579
How could you?!

351
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:30,665
Carmelita, there's no
truth to what you're saying.

352
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:31,374
What?...

353
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:32,083
Carmelita!

354
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:33,502
- Dear!
- Father!

355
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:11,748
Miss Carmelita?

356
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,751
Noche Buena is tonight.

357
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:17,462
Is there anything you want us to cook?

358
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:20,674
Maybe some caldereta.

359
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:24,135
Would Father eat with me?

360
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:25,720
I haven't

361
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,930
talked to him since I arrived here.

362
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:31,685
He's probably just resting.

363
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:33,812
Did you know?

364
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:37,816
Your father almost never
came home just to look for you.

365
00:31:39,025 --> 00:31:40,569
Is he not mad at me anymore?

366
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,320
He was never mad at you.

367
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,325
He was just a bit hurt and upset.

368
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:50,829
Because you put Juanito first

369
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:52,747
instead of your family.

370
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,043
Did I act too selfishly?

371
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:02,257
Later,

372
00:32:02,257 --> 00:32:04,175
your father has to go somewhere.

373
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:08,930
To thank General Leandro and his men.

374
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:11,933
For saving you.

375
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:19,774
You had Josefina killed
and you kidnapped Angelito!

376
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:27,657
Good morning, Don Alejandro.

377
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,048
Father.

378
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,243
Good morning.

379
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:34,039
Esmeralda already told me.

380
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:37,083
You can attend mass as long
as you're with her and Leandro.

381
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:41,556
Father.

382
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:44,090
Please listen to what I have to say.

383
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:47,302
It's not true that Juanito

384
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:50,604
was the mastermind
behind the death of Josefina.

385
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:53,048
Carmelita...

386
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:57,062
Stop defending Juanito.

387
00:32:57,646 --> 00:32:58,681
But Father!

388
00:32:59,314 --> 00:33:02,734
You won't expect who was
really behind Josefina's murder.

389
00:33:04,194 --> 00:33:05,445
Who are you talking about?

390
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:09,986
It was Leandro.

391
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:12,994
That's enough, child.

392
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:16,206
Stop spewing those lies!

393
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,959
I know you just want to escape
your arranged marriage to Leandro

394
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:22,128
so that you and Juanito could be free!

395
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:23,267
But Father,

396
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:24,297
listen please.

397
00:33:24,297 --> 00:33:25,590
I'm telling the truth.

398
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,800
Laura told me.

399
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,901
It's true

400
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:30,970
Leandro was the one behind Josefina's death

401
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,432
and we have to make a
plan to give her justice!

402
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:35,845
Carmelita!

403
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,019
I told you to stop.

404
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:42,649
Don't make up stories to taint
the name of the Flores family!

405
00:33:45,906 --> 00:33:46,920
I know

406
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:50,407
you want to stop your
upcoming wedding to Leandro.

407
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:55,870
This is the last time
we'll talk about this.

408
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:08,299
Miss?

409
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:12,602
Do you want to stroll around
before heading to church?

410
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,400
Yes...

411
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:16,370
Let's go.

412
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:19,519
Miss, I apologize.

413
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:24,691
My knees aren't good for
walking long distances anymore.

414
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:27,652
Especially in places with so many people.

415
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,238
I'll just go by myself?

416
00:34:31,614 --> 00:34:32,907
You won't be alone.

417
00:34:33,825 --> 00:34:35,118
Someone's gonna be with you.

418
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:40,915
I didn't expect

419
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:43,334
Miss Esmeralda will be
the one who will help us.

420
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:46,588
The only way for me and Juanito
to see each other again.

421
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:48,767
Even in secret.

422
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:50,829
Don't worry.

423
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,929
Catapang believes it was Don
Alejandro's men who was responsible...

424
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:56,598
For the death

425
00:34:57,056 --> 00:34:58,118
of Carding.

426
00:35:00,518 --> 00:35:03,772
Why didn't you tell me about Angelito?

427
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:07,776
Why did you carry all the burden yourself?

428
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,036
Because I was worried Leandro
would pin everything on Don Alejandro.

429
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:21,956
You are aware of my father's involvement?

430
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,460
Why didn't you say anything? Why...

431
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:29,829
Why didn't you take
revenge against my father?

432
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:44,896
Because I do not want to hurt you.

433
00:35:50,527 --> 00:35:51,778
Because I love you.

434
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:57,992
But I saw you and Mercedes close together.

435
00:36:01,037 --> 00:36:02,872
We were just friends.

436
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:05,989
You're the only one in my heart.

437
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:07,646
Really?

438
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:12,677
Merry Christmas.

439
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:16,511
Merry Christmas.

440
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:37,866
It's so beautiful here.

441
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:41,369
This tree

442
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:44,205
is the witness to our love.

443
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,459
That we can overcome anything...

444
00:36:50,712 --> 00:36:53,131
And that no matter what
happens, we'll endure it together.

445
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:58,395
I love you.

446
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:00,555
I love you.

447
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:02,700
I love you.

448
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:04,117
Carmelita.

449
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:05,036
Huh?

450
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:10,565
Three different languages.

451
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:13,902
But all mean one thing.

452
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,488
I love you.

453
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:20,950
I love you too.

454
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:41,012
I will never forget this day.

455
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:43,932
First of January, 1892.

456
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,809
The day I finally told him

457
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,019
that I love him.

458
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:10,458
Eduardo and I knew Father
Orlando from San Alfonso.

459
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:15,546
When Eduardo helped Angelito
escape from Hacienda Flores...

460
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,382
He asked the Father

461
00:38:17,507 --> 00:38:18,967
to help Angelito hide for awhile.

462
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:22,220
Where is Eduardo now?

463
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,013
Are they together with Maria?

464
00:38:25,306 --> 00:38:26,808
They are together in an island.

465
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:30,478
I also intended to bring you
there when we decided to elope.

466
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:33,815
I'm sorry.

467
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:37,360
We saw you that night Eduardo
and Laura helped me escape.

468
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,280
We weren't able to stop Laura from
running to you and confessing everything.

469
00:38:43,074 --> 00:38:46,494
We also witnessed the
guards executing her that night.

470
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:52,125
How did Eduardo know you
were captured by Leandro?

471
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:03,219
You traveled a long way

472
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:06,889
to reach Eduardo to ask for
help in rescuing my brother.

473
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:09,450
Why?

474
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:16,239
Brother...

475
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:18,526
I apologize for not
informing you earlier...

476
00:39:19,518 --> 00:39:21,228
But Theresita and I are in love.

477
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,160
What?

478
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,634
How?

479
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:27,677
Since when?

480
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:29,370
It has been two months.

481
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,956
It happened when we were still in Bohol.

482
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:35,334
Please accept our relationship.

483
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:40,114
Angelito,

484
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:41,841
you are both still young.

485
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,544
You aren't supposed to
hold each other's hands.

486
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:49,536
And how about you?

487
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,354
We are of legal age.

488
00:39:55,313 --> 00:39:56,647
And you are not.

489
00:39:57,356 --> 00:40:00,318
You shouldn’t be courting or holding hands.

490
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:06,365
But it is not my intention...

491
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:10,078
To go between the two of you.

492
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:32,263
I'm happy for the both of you.

493
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,359
Carmelita, come.

494
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:43,957
Don't be afraid of Sampaguita.

495
00:40:46,906 --> 00:40:47,919
Sampaguita.

496
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:50,302
Sampaguita.

497
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,123
Carmelita, come.

498
00:40:55,665 --> 00:40:57,083
Sampaguita will not harm you.

499
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:01,546
Look, Sampaguita.

500
00:41:02,922 --> 00:41:04,549
My love is afraid of you.

501
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:06,651
Alright then,

502
00:41:06,676 --> 00:41:07,677
I will introduce you.

503
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,903
Sampaguita.

504
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:11,356
OMG.

505
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:13,141
The dog understands Spanish?

506
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:15,184
Sampaguita.

507
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,841
This is Carmelita.

508
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,271
The woman I love.

509
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:21,802
Carmelita,

510
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:23,526
this is Sampaguita.

511
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:25,945
My faithful pet.

512
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:29,407
I remember her.

513
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:32,539
But what is she doing here?

514
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:35,083
I asked Father Orlando to look after her

515
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:37,290
when my Father told me to get rid of her

516
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,417
during the Feast of San Alfonso.

517
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:42,044
The dinner your whole family attended.

518
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:46,424
So it was my fault why she
was taken away from Juanito.

519
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:47,559
Sampaguita!

520
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:51,195
Come!

521
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,680
Don't be afraid of Sampaguita.

522
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:55,516
Sampaguita is a good dog.

523
00:41:56,942 --> 00:41:59,187
I know Sampaguita's a good dog.

524
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:03,411
She hasn't forgotten you even
though you've been apart for too long.

525
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:05,943
That's why I love her very much.

526
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:08,779
She's loyal and doesn't forget.

527
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:09,947
Isn't that right, Sampaguita?

528
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:13,284
No matter how long we've been apart.

529
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:16,495
That's how it is when you love each other.

530
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:20,917
Will I let this dog beat me?

531
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:22,752
Fine. We're friends now.

532
00:42:25,713 --> 00:42:26,770
Come!

533
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:28,473
Sampaguita.

534
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:31,903
That's Carmelita.

535
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:34,931
Go on, she's nice.

536
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,936
I'm not afraid of you anymore, okay?

537
00:42:41,077 --> 00:42:43,246
Whoever Juanito loves, I love too.

538
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:46,526
And if it's alright with
you, starting today...

539
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,569
If you'd let me,

540
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:51,678
I'll be your mother.

541
00:43:00,957 --> 00:43:01,911
See?

542
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:03,376
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

543
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,755
How are you?

544
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:10,675
For Juanito,

545
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,886
it's like a dream I don't
want to wake up from.

546
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:15,972
But what happens next?

547
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:20,101
Is a nightmare I want to
slap myself awake from.

548
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:29,485
Carmelita.

549
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:40,246
I have been waiting for you,
but you were not in your room.

550
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:42,929
What the heck!?

551
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,418
What is she doing in my territory?

552
00:43:48,546 --> 00:43:52,717
I already warned you not
to hurt my siblings again.

553
00:43:53,926 --> 00:43:55,344
But you didn't listen.

554
00:43:57,388 --> 00:43:58,639
Because of you,

555
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,391
Helena went away.

556
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:02,601
Because of you,

557
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:06,022
my brother Leandro is suffering.

558
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:08,765
You know,

559
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:11,569
You also know what's
Leandro been doing, right?

560
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:18,100
Be careful of me.

561
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:20,161
You don't know who you're dealing with.

562
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:25,166
You will regret this.

563
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:28,919
If I know, she just cursed me.

564
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,589
Whatever, bitch.

565
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:48,726
Juanito!?

566
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:51,108
That's just the first bullet.

567
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:51,859
Leandro!

568
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,152
So that you can't escape.

569
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:56,630
Leandro!

570
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:57,937
Leandro!

571
00:44:57,962 --> 00:44:59,630
Leandro, I am begging you.

572
00:45:00,034 --> 00:45:01,786
Just this once, please.

573
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:03,451
Leandro, don't.

574
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:06,040
Please, Leandro.

575
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,209
It seems like Leandro
couldn't do anything

576
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:10,461
to save you and your family.

577
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:12,755
Not for long,

578
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:14,590
the rebels will find out that

579
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,884
Juanito died because of you.

580
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:20,137
Carmelita...

581
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,642
I heard that Leandro
killed Juanito.

582
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:28,187
Forgive me, Carmelita.

583
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:33,632
No!

584
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:36,124
Miss!

585
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:37,947
Are you alright?

586
00:45:37,947 --> 00:45:39,448
Did you have a nightmare?

587
00:45:39,758 --> 00:45:42,344
You must be exhausted
from embroidering.

588
00:45:42,902 --> 00:45:43,859
Me?

589
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:45,421
Embroidery?
