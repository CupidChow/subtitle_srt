1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,920
Your son has broken my trust!

2
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,296
Your son has dishonored

3
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:53,423
the agreement
both our families made!

4
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:55,967
Father, forgive me.

5
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,720
It's true that I pushed

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,639
Helena and Juanito
to be closer.

7
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,557
Because I still love Leandro.

8
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:05,610
Miss, thank goodness
you came out.

9
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:06,978
What are you doing here?

10
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,692
This opened my eyes to the truth

11
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:13,610
that Juanito could
never love me!

12
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,696
Because he's already
in love with you!

13
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:17,739
How did you know
where I am?

14
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:19,616
"The place
where it all began."

15
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,660
It was decided here
that we were to be married.

16
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,828
And I guess, we're also here

17
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:23,853
to end everything.

18
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:30,535
Good day, ladies.

19
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:35,465
Carmelita,
you don't have to avoid me.

20
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:37,134
I already accepted

21
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,385
that my love for you
is unrequited.

22
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:40,303
Sometimes, I wish...

23
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:42,139
I wouldn't have known...

24
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:45,275
That your heart
belongs to someone else.

25
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,196
Do you remember?

26
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,156
When I told you to meet me at the port?

27
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:01,421
Before I went back to Manila.

28
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,106
Aside from wanting to
give you the necklace I made...

29
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:17,252
There was something else
I wanted to tell you.

30
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:27,304
I apologize.

31
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:28,972
I think my eyes are starting to hurt.

32
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:33,184
Maybe because of the smoke
coming from the lamps.

33
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,312
Juanito...

34
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:40,609
you don't need to hide your tears from me.

35
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,655
You know back when I was young...

36
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,824
My Daddy...

37
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:50,846
I mean, my father.

38
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:54,004
He would always wipe my tears away.

39
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,536
And you know what else he does?

40
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:16,860
Let's stay like this a bit more.

41
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,912
Even if you didn't meet me at the port.

42
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:35,254
My only wish is that...

43
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,000
I should've been brave enough.

44
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,087
To ask you to

45
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:44,089
push through with our engagement because...

46
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,010
Because I am falling in love with you.

47
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:04,593
It's true that regret comes
in the end, Carmelita.

48
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:09,739
My only wish is to be with you.

49
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:15,912
I'm afraid of what could
happen to my family.

50
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:19,332
But whenever I'm with you...

51
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:24,421
My worries disappear.

52
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:27,924
My heart feels lighter.

53
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:32,929
And all my fears are gone.

54
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:56,536
Thank you, Carmelita.

55
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:57,954
I didn't expect you to

56
00:06:57,954 --> 00:07:00,749
go against your father just to help us.

57
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,578
I know we're friends...

58
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,624
And you are close to our family.

59
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:09,474
But...

60
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,502
Are you doing this

61
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:13,755
because you have fallen
in love with my brother?

62
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:22,737
Yes, I love each and everyone of you.

63
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:26,866
And I also believe that
Don Mariano is innocent.

64
00:07:26,866 --> 00:07:29,786
Truth must prevail.

65
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:32,914
Uh, Ignacio.

66
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:36,209
Captain Corpuz is in
Spain, isn't that right?

67
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:41,589
The ship he boarded to Spain

68
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,550
was intercepted under the
orders of General Seleno.

69
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:47,637
It's still unclear why he
was forced back home.

70
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,155
And...

71
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,557
I have news.

72
00:07:53,935 --> 00:07:57,063
The lawyer that would
represent Don Mariano in court

73
00:07:57,063 --> 00:08:00,775
was appointed by General Seleno himself.

74
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:03,445
I have a hunch.

75
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,072
I sense that...

76
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:08,755
They will deliberately lose his case.

77
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:14,039
That's why I will represent him myself.

78
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:16,805
I will defend your father in court.

79
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:24,894
Are you sure about this, my love?

80
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,937
Please forgive me, Carmelita.

81
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:40,273
I wasn't there when you and
Helena got into an argument.

82
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:45,403
She was probably taken away by her emotions

83
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:46,738
that's why she was able to do that.

84
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:55,184
She couldn't accept
that my brother has feelings for you.

85
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:02,269
I've known for awhile
that Juanito fancies you.

86
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:05,673
Especially after we saw you
and Leandro at that restaurant.

87
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:08,843
I didn't say anything because

88
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:11,096
he wanted to let you know himself.

89
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:15,433
I didn't expect that
you still love Leandro.

90
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:19,945
But... that's not true.

91
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,569
- Sonya?! Sonya?!
- Wait a minute...

92
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,614
- Wait...
- Ignacio! Juanito! Are you alright?

93
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:33,034
- Carmelita, what is it? Sonya?
- What happened, Sonya?

94
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:35,060
What is it?

95
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,788
Don't worry.

96
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:38,470
I'm fine.

97
00:09:39,582 --> 00:09:41,571
My love, please.

98
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:42,972
Get some rest.

99
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:46,448
Being exhausted won't
do any good to the child

100
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:50,003
Ignacio, what do you mean?

101
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:53,922
My wife is pregnant.

102
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:56,028
I'm going to be a father.

103
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:01,521
Congratulations, Ignacio!

104
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:03,248
Sonya!

105
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:04,816
I am happy for the both of you.

106
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,758
Thank you, Carmelita and Juanito.

107
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,991
Sonya, what's the matter?

108
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,367
You don't look happy.

109
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:17,203
I am happy...

110
00:10:17,203 --> 00:10:20,373
but I can't help but be worried.

111
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:23,376
Especially with everything that
is happening to our family now.

112
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:29,883
I'm not sure if we can protect the child
from all of this mess.

113
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:35,930
You know, I think...

114
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:40,852
All you have to do is love your child.

115
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,855
Because your love

116
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:46,441
will be the child's shield and weapon

117
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:49,319
against all challenges
they might face in life.

118
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:51,759
And they will always remember...

119
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:55,033
how much you loved them
and that they aren't alone.

120
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:58,536
No matter where they are.

121
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:02,999
Thank you, Carmelita.

122
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:08,129
I hope my child will be as
good and beautiful as you.

123
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:10,048
if ever she is a girl.

124
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,302
I just hope my niece
won't be as mischievous

125
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:16,763
and loud as she is.

126
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:25,489
I remember when we
were still chidlren, Ignacio.

127
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:27,732
You have always teased Sonya.

128
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,528
That is why we we're all shocked...

129
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:33,278
When you we're arranged
to be married by Father.

130
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:35,528
And now...

131
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,077
You're going to be parents.

132
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,874
Maybe you and Carmelita
will end up like that too.

133
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:46,960
Think about it.

134
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:50,380
You're already with her.

135
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:52,255
And...

136
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:56,427
She's ready to help even if
she's in love with someone else.

137
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,682
That only means you're special to her.

138
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:03,309
Maybe we'll only just be friends.

139
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:08,273
But I will admit...

140
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:11,568
No matter what I do,

141
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,194
I can't forget her.

142
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,364
Especially now that I know
she loves someone else.

143
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:24,914
When I learned about
her past with Leandro...

144
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:26,958
I hoped...

145
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,336
that she'll eventually be
mine once we get married.

146
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,173
But all hope was lost

147
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,758
when our wedding got cancelled.

148
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:41,848
Didn't you like someone else before?

149
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:44,225
Your heart belonged to Helena, right?

150
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:47,021
And yet...

151
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:49,605
How did you change your mind?

152
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,863
You want your wedding
to Carmelita to happen?

153
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:59,449
I don't know, Ignacio.

154
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:03,995
Things happened too quickly.

155
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,207
Since I met Carmelita,

156
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:12,128
she has always been on my mind.

157
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:20,511
Each encounter made
me fall in love with her.

158
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:26,309
Whenever she glares at me,

159
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,853
I just can't help but smile.

160
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:30,063
Even though she's grumpy.

161
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:33,858
Until one day, I woke up...

162
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,861
and she's the one my heart wants

163
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:42,194
If that's the case...

164
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:48,539
why did you meet with Helena
on the night of Thanksgiving?

165
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,126
I was on my way to
the festivities, Ignacio,

166
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:53,753
when Helena stopped me.

167
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,549
I told her I want Carmelita
and that I want the wedding to happen.

168
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:02,387
Suddenly, Don Alejandro
and Doña Soledad walked by.

169
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:05,640
I pulled Helena inside...

170
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:07,892
But without warning, she screamed.

171
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:11,813
Now I think she did it on purpose.

172
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:16,204
So it means, Helena really did betray us.

173
00:14:16,998 --> 00:14:19,250
No matter what era,

174
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,361
there will always be traitors.

175
00:14:22,073 --> 00:14:23,616
But can I blame her?

176
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:25,831
I also betrayed her.

177
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,580
I fell in love with Juanito
even though I know it'll hurt her.

178
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:32,458
Maybe that's how love truly is.

179
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,962
People will fight for
it no matter the cost.

180
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,751
This my plan

181
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:56,362
so that we can attend Father's hearing

182
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,109
without anyone recognizing us.

183
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,924
Are they serious?

184
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:02,438
Do we need to pretend?

185
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,824
What if we get caught?

186
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,579
They won't suspect a
thing if you speak in English.

187
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:14,709
Who taught you the
English language, Carmelita?

188
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:21,549
How can I tell them that after the Spanish,
the Americans will be next to colonize us?

189
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:24,594
And that English would
be our second language.

190
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:29,390
Madre Olivia taught me.

191
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,982
Very well. Come, let me prepare you.

192
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:39,479
Carmelita, you will be a
wealthy Englishwoman.

193
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,342
And the daughter of a renowned professor.

194
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:43,905
While Juanito,

195
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:48,451
is an impaired who
cannot speak English at all.

196
00:15:48,451 --> 00:15:50,286
This is my wife...

197
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,623
And these are my friends from England.

198
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:55,875
Good morning.

199
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,586
I am Ashley Williams and
this is my husband George.

200
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:00,505
Alright! Alright!

201
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:07,178
There is no strong evidence that could link

202
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:09,722
Don Mariano to the rebels.

203
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:14,477
And lots of people come and
go inside Hacienda Alfonso.

204
00:16:14,477 --> 00:16:16,187
They could have easily

205
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:19,398
hidden guns and rice in their stockroom.

206
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:26,196
I stand by my case that Don Mariano

207
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,449
is in alliance with the rebels.

208
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:32,995
I have witness who can testify

209
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:37,917
that he is planning treason
against the government.

210
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:44,678
It's true that Don Mariano,

211
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,423
as well as his son Sergio,

212
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:48,246
are allied with the rebels.

213
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,199
Check Don Mariano's back.

214
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:56,852
We have marked him with an X near the ribs.

215
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,684
Don Mariano, please stand up.

216
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:03,734
Stand up.

217
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:07,071
Turn around.

218
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:09,571
Turn around, please, Don Mariano.

219
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:16,446
How?

220
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:37,310
By the power vested upon me by the Court,

221
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,521
Don Mariano is hereby sentenced...

222
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:41,731
To death.

223
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:23,940
Juanito.

224
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:26,275
Mr. Valdez.

225
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:27,985
What is that?

226
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:30,571
A letter from Catapang.

227
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:36,786
I heard an innocent man
was sentenced to die,

228
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:41,123
and that they have used
my name to implicate him.

229
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:44,043
I am ready to help,
together with my comrades.

230
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,253
For the sake of the nation.

231
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:49,215
I will wait for your answer before dawn.

232
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,469
Leave your answer by the door.
- Catapang.

233
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:57,807
So it means Don Mariano
and Catapang are not allies.

234
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:00,726
But why didn't Don Mariano defend himself?

235
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:02,645
And who is behind all of this?

236
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:06,232
But Mr. Valdez...

237
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:09,819
why do you have the letter from Catapang?

238
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,530
Does this mean...

239
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:16,784
Mr. Valdez...

240
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:21,771
You told us that your brother
was murdered by the rebels.

241
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:25,793
We purposely spread that rumor

242
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:31,549
to avoid suspicion that
we joined with Catapang.

243
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:53,070
Because, we know...

244
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:58,065
That it was General
Seleno who killed my brother.

245
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:06,375
The two of them share whatever
money Diosdado collects.

246
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:12,423
But when Doña Julieta got sick...

247
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:18,179
He failed to give money for six months.

248
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:22,933
That's why General Seleno had him murdered.

249
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:30,941
We need your father.

250
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:36,864
We need someone influencial on our side

251
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:42,745
to open the minds of the people...

252
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:45,915
So that they will have the courage

253
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:49,502
to fight these corrupt officials!

254
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:54,840
We must save him.

255
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,072
Father! Father!

256
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:19,782
What are you doing here?

257
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:20,883
Don't!

258
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:21,915
Don't!

259
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:24,537
You might get in trouble.

260
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:29,124
Mr. Valdez and the group
of Catapang helped us.

261
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,252
We'll escape together.

262
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:35,651
This is my fault, Juanito.

263
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,093
I trusted the person who convinced me

264
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:40,845
to put a mark on my back.

265
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:43,180
I didn't realize...

266
00:21:44,265 --> 00:21:46,100
That he would betray me.

267
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:48,769
Who is that person, Father?

268
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:51,230
Let's tell Judge Fernandez.

269
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,398
It's not over yet.

270
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:53,983
It's not too late!

271
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:55,651
The sentence is already out.

272
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:02,366
It will be difficult to overturn.

273
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,287
Father, just come with me

274
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:09,373
Catapang's group promised to help us.

275
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:10,583
You will be a free man.

276
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,128
If I come with you and escape,

277
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:16,630
it's as good as a confession of my crime

278
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,216
against my post and the government!

279
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:20,305
But, Father.

280
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:22,219
Be strong.

281
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:27,349
Don't let anger consume your heart.

282
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:32,479
From now on, you are responsible
for your Mother and siblings.

283
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,480
No, Father...

284
00:22:33,772 --> 00:22:36,775
Tell them I love them very much.

285
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:40,154
And don't be worried.

286
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:43,407
I am ready to face my fate.

287
00:22:44,491 --> 00:22:46,785
No. Please don't say that, Father.

288
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:49,204
What is happening over there?!

289
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:50,080
Go now!

290
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,916
I won't accept it! I won't leave you here!

291
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:52,708
Leave!

292
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,419
Carmela-- Carmelita! Go ahead!

293
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:56,503
Just leave!

294
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:00,555
What is that!?

295
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,151
Go ahead!

296
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:03,402
Go ahead!

297
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:05,220
Try to escape!

298
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:15,147
Stop it!

299
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,040
Stop!

300
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:08,826
Remember...

301
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:15,624
In this world, sometimes
there are battles we lose.

302
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,961
But when you fail,

303
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:23,048
it doesn’t mean you won’t rise again.

304
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:27,970
Carmelita...

305
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:53,746
Ready!

306
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,753
Aim!

307
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:10,846
Fire!

308
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:41,835
Carmelita...

309
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:43,921
Prepare yourself.

310
00:25:44,838 --> 00:25:48,217
A lot of things and people

311
00:25:48,675 --> 00:25:51,011
will be taken in place of Juanito.

312
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:55,641
Destiny is being rewritten.

313
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:01,146
This wasn't supposed to happen.

314
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:03,190
Don Mariano wasn't supposed to die.

315
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:05,526
Is everything changing?

316
00:26:06,026 --> 00:26:09,113
Are all these changes because of me?

317
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:10,864
If yes...

318
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:13,325
Then I wish I can just
go back to my own time.

319
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:17,246
Because I don’t want to be the reason
someone’s life falls apart.

320
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:36,265
Dear child, these are
guava leaves I have boiled.

321
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:39,309
Clean Juanito's wounds using this.

322
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:44,322
Thank you very much, Mother Olivia.

323
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,526
I'd like to thank you as
well, Don Buencamino.

324
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:51,196
I was able to slip inside
this ship all because of you.

325
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:55,359
Before anyone else knew I was in Manila.

326
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:59,246
Remember, I'll come for you later.

327
00:26:59,913 --> 00:27:02,708
I will be the one to take
you where Juanito is.

328
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,836
Do not ever come out of this place.

329
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,561
It's dangerous.

330
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:10,507
General Seleno might catch us.

331
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:17,514
My dear, wear this.

332
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:22,186
And as much as possible,
keep your head down.

333
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,273
You have to impersonate Mother Olivia.

334
00:27:27,024 --> 00:27:30,611
This is the only way for
you to speak to a prisoner.

335
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:37,598
But...

336
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,872
What happens if they find out I'm lying?

337
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:45,751
You might be dragged into this as well.

338
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:51,506
To hell with being dragged into it.

339
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:55,052
Me following you here in Manila...

340
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:57,846
Is proof that I am prepared
to help you and Juanito.

341
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:00,557
Thank you.

342
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:22,621
Juanito...

343
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:26,458
Am I dreaming?

344
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,371
If not...

345
00:28:38,428 --> 00:28:40,597
Then the Lord has already
answered my prayer.

346
00:28:41,014 --> 00:28:42,285
To be able to see you again.

347
00:28:54,194 --> 00:28:55,285
Don't!

348
00:28:56,363 --> 00:28:57,496
You might get into trouble.

349
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,824
There will be consequences.

350
00:29:23,682 --> 00:29:24,683
What is it?

351
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,521
Juanito...

352
00:29:30,689 --> 00:29:31,690
I'm sorry.

353
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:34,693
I'm sorry, I didn't--

354
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:37,988
I wasn't able to save
Don Mariano. I'm sorry.

355
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:39,948
- I'm sorry...
- It's not your fault.

356
00:29:43,368 --> 00:29:44,559
I'm sorry.

357
00:29:45,454 --> 00:29:46,457
There, there.

358
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:47,973
Don't cry.

359
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:49,098
Don't cry.

360
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:53,176
I'm sorry.

361
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:03,889
My father faced the
challenge of fate upon him.

362
00:30:10,437 --> 00:30:12,064
It just saddens me to think...

363
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:16,168
I wasn't able to tell
him at the last moment

364
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:17,402
how much I love him.

365
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:20,989
And that I admire him.

366
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:27,387
Juanito...

367
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:31,708
Even if you weren't able to say it...

368
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:36,671
I'm sure he knew that you love him.

369
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,261
I know that he knew...

370
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:45,806
That you love him very much.

371
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:00,779
Don't cry anymore.

372
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,847
I'm sorry...

373
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:23,863
It's alright.

374
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:35,188
Carmelita...

375
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,860
Do you remember...

376
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:43,113
I told you once that...

377
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:48,493
It's impossible for someone's interest
to completely disappear.

378
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,044
I want to tell you...

379
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,592
Why I stopped painting and drawing.

380
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:11,141
Since I was a child...

381
00:32:12,976 --> 00:32:16,021
It was my dream to
become a renowned painter.

382
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:22,194
But before I went to college...

383
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,576
My father told me he
wanted me to study medicine.

384
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:35,290
He did not stop me
from drawing or painting.

385
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:39,746
But...

386
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:42,589
I knew that if I continued
pursuing drawing and painting...

387
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:45,238
I wouldn't be able to
focus on my priorities.

388
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:50,096
That is why I decided
to follow Father's wishes.

389
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,769
I deeply admire...

390
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:57,426
And respect him.

391
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,266
I know.

392
00:33:04,444 --> 00:33:05,570
Carmelita.

393
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:09,908
I know I have no right to
ask any favors from you.

394
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:20,293
But I just want to let you know
that whenever you're beside me...

395
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:29,928
I feel much braver.

396
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,474
And I am filled with hope.

397
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:42,148
Juanito...

398
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:46,027
I promise.

399
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:52,867
I will never leave your side.

400
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:56,082
I promise.

401
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:03,378
Even if I complete my mission,

402
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:08,258
I know my heart will never
be away from you, Juanito.

403
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,191
I promise.

404
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,282
I promise.

405
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,001
I promise.

406
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:45,545
What is this for?

407
00:34:45,545 --> 00:34:46,963
Just keep it with you.

408
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,886
Don Buencamino?

409
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:55,930
Is there a problem?

410
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,350
I heard this morning...

411
00:34:58,975 --> 00:35:01,269
That Mr. Valdez has a warrant of arrest.

412
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:03,772
On grounds that he was the only outsider

413
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:05,940
sighted within Fuerte de Santiago.

414
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:09,778
On the night Juanito was
caught inside Don Mariano's cell.

415
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:15,575
What happened to Mr. Valdez?

416
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,997
The Civil Guards weren't
able to arrest him at his house.

417
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:23,124
But even now...

418
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:25,627
They still can't find him.

419
00:35:41,685 --> 00:35:43,979
Let me wash your bruises.

420
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,193
Do not worry about me, Mother.

421
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:01,955
What do you mean, Sonya?

422
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:05,709
You and Ignacio were
arrested by the Civil Guards?

423
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,922
They arrested my father.

424
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:15,844
And accused him of being involved

425
00:36:15,844 --> 00:36:19,347
with Don Mariano and the rebels!

426
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,478
He will be taken back to San
Alfonso together with Sergio.

427
00:36:25,478 --> 00:36:28,648
To undergo investigation.

428
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:32,360
We have to be strong.

429
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:37,699
Let's just be thankful that

430
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:42,078
General Seleno agreed
to let us take Juanito home.

431
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,038
Instead of having him imprisoned in Manila.

432
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,666
What's the difference, Sonya?

433
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,126
We're stuck here inside our house.

434
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:50,170
It's as good as being imprisoned in Manila.

435
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:55,341
We are not allowed outside,
not even to attend mass.

436
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:01,264
Until when will we be prisoners here?

437
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:03,892
I want to see Father.

438
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:41,429
Are you hiding something from me, Juanito?

439
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,228
Where is your father?

440
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,398
Where is my husband?

441
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,864
Father was sentenced to death.

442
00:38:46,744 --> 00:38:48,371
Father's gone.

443
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:35,376
- Carmelita, my dear.
- Mother...

444
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:36,544
How's Sugbu?

445
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,936
Come.

446
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:43,718
Alejandro, our youngest daughter is home.

447
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:46,721
My dear, I'm glad you came home safely.

448
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:49,155
Mother Olivia.

449
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:51,809
By the way, we have a visitor.

450
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:52,810
General Seleno.

451
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,234
Welcome back, Mother Olivia

452
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:02,654
Miss Carmelita.

453
00:40:04,322 --> 00:40:07,075
We learned that it was Don Buencamino

454
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:10,411
who let Juanito into the ship to Manila.

455
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:16,584
And Juanito was with a woman that time.

456
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:20,338
General Seleno. What are you trying to say?

457
00:40:21,464 --> 00:40:22,514
Carpio!

458
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:23,967
Bring the witness.

459
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:26,469
Bring him here!

460
00:40:36,437 --> 00:40:37,459
Now...

461
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:41,693
Tell us all what you've seen.

462
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:45,446
I was working for Don Buencamino,

463
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:48,741
as a coal stoker by
the machine of the ship.

464
00:40:50,174 --> 00:40:51,718
Last week...

465
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:54,914
Our ship was set to sail to Manila.

466
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:58,835
That's when I saw Sir Juanito Alfonso.

467
00:41:00,044 --> 00:41:02,463
And a woman wearing a veil.

468
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:09,178
Who is this woman dressed in nun clothing?

469
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:11,723
I apologize, General but...

470
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:14,392
I wasn't able to see her face.

471
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:15,827
General!

472
00:41:15,852 --> 00:41:19,897
Last night, Don Buencamino
and Mother Olivia visited Juanito.

473
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:27,030
I only went there to
treat Juanito's wounds.

474
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:29,490
I don't see anything wrong with that.

475
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,633
Moreover!

476
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:34,370
The law does not forbade
anyone from treating prisoners.

477
00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:37,040
That only means, Mother Olivia...

478
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:39,042
That you came from Manila.

479
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:43,171
And you were on the
ship back to San Alfonso.

480
00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:44,797
Mother Olivia...

481
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:49,635
I thought you were with
my daughter in Sugbu?

482
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:58,269
Are you suggesting

483
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:01,898
that I am the woman accompanying
Don Buencamino and Juanito...

484
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:04,484
On the way to Manila?

485
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,411
Here is my bilette.

486
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:21,834
You can clearly see the date
when I boarded the ship to Manila.

487
00:42:26,422 --> 00:42:27,423
If that is so...

488
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:33,179
Then who is the woman with Juanito Alfonso?

489
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:37,975
Miss Carmelita.

490
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:41,854
How's your trip to Sugbu?

491
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,858
It's quite alright.

492
00:42:50,947 --> 00:42:51,967
Alright, then.

493
00:42:54,742 --> 00:42:59,747
What are the places you went to?

494
00:43:04,377 --> 00:43:05,389
General.

495
00:43:06,629 --> 00:43:08,339
From your tone...

496
00:43:09,757 --> 00:43:14,345
Are you insinuating that Miss Carmelita
didn't come from Sugbu?

497
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:16,681
I didn't say anything like that.

498
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:19,725
I merely wanted to ask her.

499
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:22,854
Miss Carmelita.

500
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:26,482
Show the good General your bilette.

501
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,675
This is a big fumble for
someone in your position, General.

502
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:56,596
I understand that you
are only doing your job,

503
00:43:56,596 --> 00:44:00,391
but you don't have the
right to accuse my daughter.

504
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,482
Punish the witness.

505
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,737
And strip Don Buencamino of his titles.

506
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:17,074
Where are you taking me!?

507
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:19,069
I apologize...

508
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:20,842
Don Alejandro.

509
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:28,303
Oh, by the way.

510
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,564
You are summoned by Judge Valenciano

511
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:33,716
at the town hall a fortnight from now.

512
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,511
Captain Corpuz made a statement.

513
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:41,432
He revealed that you were
the one who schemed...

514
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:43,893
The fake news

515
00:44:43,893 --> 00:44:48,616
about Don Mariano
being involved with the rebels.

516
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,570
Your presence is expected.

517
00:45:16,926 --> 00:45:19,428
I asked
General Sergio for help

518
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:22,932
but he raped and abused me.

519
00:45:22,932 --> 00:45:25,434
I can see that
you're worried for Juanito.

520
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:27,395
But you should
probably accept

521
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:29,063
that maybe you're not
meant for one another.

522
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:31,607
The new leader of San Alfonso!

523
00:45:31,607 --> 00:45:34,151
Governor Vicente Flores.

524
00:45:34,986 --> 00:45:36,946
- Alejandro! Stop it!
- Father!

525
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:39,490
Stop it this instance!

526
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,285
You always go against
my word, Carmelita!

527
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:45,579
What were you doing
at the hospital?!

528
00:45:45,997 --> 00:45:47,957
And why were you
talking to the girl

529
00:45:47,957 --> 00:45:50,501
who testified
against the Alfonsos?!

530
00:45:50,586 --> 00:45:52,004
Why did you stay quiet...

531
00:45:52,545 --> 00:45:54,088
when Don Mariano
was sentenced?

532
00:45:54,088 --> 00:45:55,108
Why?

533
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:57,275
What?

534
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,051
I am to be engaged
to Leandro?

535
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:00,761
Carmelita, dear, wait!

536
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:03,222
Juanito loved you

537
00:46:03,222 --> 00:46:05,850
not because you were
pretending to be Carmelita...

538
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,477
But because you are Carmela.
