1
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:50,624
Why do you always say that
you're gonna be there for me?

2
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:53,001
That's not true.

3
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:55,754
You really wouldn't be alone
because I'd like to be with you.

4
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:57,631
Because I'm happy when
we're together.

5
00:00:57,656 --> 00:01:00,409
- We're not doing anything wrong!
- You're misunderstanding this.

6
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:02,260
I was just thinking...

7
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,805
Why Juanito didn't even visit me?

8
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:05,639
How will he?

9
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:09,976
He and Carmelita were together in the
Governor General's party a few days ago.

10
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:12,354
Seems like something's
going on between them.

11
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:14,439
Guide my heart.

12
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,858
I don't want to fall for him.

13
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:18,694
I don't have doubts about you.

14
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:21,697
I can see that you don't have
any feelings for Juanito.

15
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:26,451
And you truly
love my brother, Leandro.

16
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:27,452
Am I right?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,876
Helena,

18
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:37,003
when are you planning to make it
official with Juanito?

19
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:40,373
Carmelita.

20
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:41,633
- Carmelita.
- Carmelita.

21
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,598
Don't mind them, Carmela.

22
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,517
You'll just stress yourself.

23
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:07,404
Helena, when will you say yes to Juanito?

24
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:13,910
The truth is, I really want him to be...

25
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,455
- Carmelita?
- Carmelita!

26
00:04:17,455 --> 00:04:18,123
Carmelita?

27
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:20,667
- Water...
- Here, drink.

28
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,169
- [Carmela choking]
- Carmelita?

29
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:28,091
Drink it. I told you to eat slowly.

30
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,885
Wait!

31
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,052
Drink up.

32
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,430
- Drink some more.
- Wait, hold on.

33
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:39,728
Ew!

34
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:42,022
How are you feeling, Carmelita?

35
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:45,525
I'm alright...

36
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:58,288
- Do you feel fine?
- Mm-hmm...

37
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:01,917
Eat slowly. Drink, go on.

38
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:03,835
Drink some water.

39
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,387
So that's why my date
with Juanito didn't happen.

40
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,765
Because he has another date.

41
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,326
That's Helena and Juanito.

42
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:41,164
Thank you, Juanito.

43
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:46,294
I'll go ahead.

44
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:57,472
Ouch...

45
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:08,400
Carmelita? Are you still awake?

46
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:14,280
You sound fast asleep so I
won't wake you up anymore.

47
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:21,413
But even though you're sleeping,
let me share the story with you.

48
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:28,086
I can't contain this happiness
within me any longer.

49
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:36,428
It's been five years
since I first saw Juanito.

50
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:41,349
I instantly fell in love with him.

51
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:52,902
I can't understand why my heart
suddenly beat so loudly that night.

52
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,155
Me too.

53
00:06:55,155 --> 00:07:00,201
I can't understand why my heart is
beating for someone I shouldn't fall for.

54
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:16,676
It was during the feast of San Alfonso.

55
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:21,723
My eyes were closed while holding a
candle outside the church that night.

56
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:28,772
You told me, Carmelita, that the
moment I blow out the candles...

57
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:39,074
I must whisper my wish so that it may be
carried by the smoke up to the heavens.

58
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:56,883
I hope I'll end up with
the man I'm with right now.

59
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:11,719
We may not have talked,
but I can feel that our

60
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:15,868
hearts were beating
in sync with each other.

61
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:41,678
I immediately asked my
father to talk to Don Mariano

62
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,264
so that Juanito and I can
be arranged for marriage.

63
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,146
But then I heard that he was planning
to study medicine here in Manila.

64
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:53,857
That's why I told Father
not to push through with it.

65
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:08,955
I waited for almost five years.

66
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:13,126
And during those times...

67
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:18,923
I only see Juanito during the Feast of
San Alfonso and Christmas.

68
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,585
Even after convincing
Father to let me study

69
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:28,183
with Natasha in the
convent here in Manila..

70
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:32,520
I only see Juanito once a month.

71
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:40,111
When he prays here at church...

72
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:42,780
I'm already satisfied with that.

73
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,951
I'm happy just to be
able to see him from afar

74
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,370
as he reaches for his dreams.

75
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,748
Amazing...

76
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:54,083
I didn't know someone like her

77
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:58,046
who could wait and be a martyr for their
love for such a long time can still exist.

78
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:10,433
That's why I was so heartbroken
when I heard the news that...

79
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:13,019
You were engaged to Juanito.

80
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:20,818
I'm lucky that you are such a true friend.

81
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:28,117
You helped me and Juanito become closer.

82
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,984
I wonder what Juanito's up to?

83
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,261
It's been a week since I last saw him.

84
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,141
Stop, Carmela!

85
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,811
Kill your feelings while it's early.

86
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:58,439
As they say, prevention
is better than cure.

87
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,453
Oh Shocks! shocks!

88
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:04,729
Carmelita?

89
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:09,281
Yes, Mother Olivia?

90
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:11,202
Do you need anything?

91
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,830
Finish what you're doing.
We're going somewhere.

92
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:15,508
Alright.

93
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:49,540
Thank you for coming to my
deceased brother's novena.

94
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:54,287
Don Valdez, what happened to him?

95
00:11:56,914 --> 00:12:01,210
My brother, Diosdado, has
been missing for two days.

96
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:10,428
Doña Julieta found him
dead in front of their door.

97
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:18,895
Without a doubt, he
was murdered by rebels.

98
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:25,234
They wanted to get revenge on him

99
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:27,945
since he's a tax collector.

100
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:32,617
I offer my condolences.

101
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:39,665
Excuse me, dear. I'll leave you here.

102
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,300
- Mr. Valdez.
- Oh, Juanito.

103
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,719
- - My sincere condolences.
- OMG! Juanito's here too!

104
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:56,099
Thank you. I'll go ahead.

105
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,069
Miss Carmelita.

106
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:16,035
Gosh, why do I feel so flushed?
And my heart's beating so loudly.

107
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:18,079
You don't need to turn away.

108
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,919
Because no matter where you are,

109
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,244
I will always find you.

110
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:36,722
Carmelita...

111
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:43,187
The man you love that you
said was in a far away place...

112
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,233
Was he Leandro?

113
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:51,175
What? How do I
explain to him that

114
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:54,198
James Gilbert doesn't
exist in this world yet.

115
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:56,284
Don't worry.

116
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:59,036
I understand.

117
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:03,583
First love is difficult to forget.

118
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:08,296
Especially if it left our hearts wounded.

119
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,953
The conversation
must focus only on him

120
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:13,634
so that I don't need
to invent more lies.

121
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:16,554
What does first love mean to you?

122
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:22,059
Sometimes...

123
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,705
We think that a person would
be our first and last love...

124
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,072
But feelings may change for many reasons -

125
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:35,448
Distance, exhaustion...

126
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:41,279
Or maybe your heart is already
beating for someone else.

127
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:53,174
Maybe... it's just admiration?

128
00:14:57,386 --> 00:14:59,369
Is it admiration or love?

129
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:06,187
You're in too deep, Carmela!

130
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:09,857
There's no more cure for
your feelings for Juanito! Fudge!

131
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:25,611
Is what I'm feeling still right?

132
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:29,783
Or should I just avoid
this love altogether?

133
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:34,385
Or would it be better
to just face it head on?

134
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:41,821
I almost forgot. I need to bring
food and give medicine to Josefina.

135
00:15:48,216 --> 00:15:52,470
Let's meet at the Plaza Santo
Tomas tomorrow afternoon.

136
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,631
I already asked Mother
Olivia and she gave

137
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,382
her permission for us
to watch the theater.

138
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:02,619
What?! Why did he write it
on the back of his prescription?!

139
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,624
Oh no, what if Helena
misunderstood Juanito's note?

140
00:16:08,624 --> 00:16:12,545
I promised to help them
become a couple after all.

141
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,724
Oh my!

142
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:51,375
I made sure you'll receive
my message this time.

143
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:57,749
I apologize if you are startled
by my method of sending it to you.

144
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:02,261
I want you to meet me
at Plaza Santo Tomas.

145
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:05,640
I will take you wherever you want to go.

146
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:10,811
Don't worry. I already asked
permission from Mother Olivia.

147
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,693
I'll be waiting.

148
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,443
I hope you would come.

149
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:23,282
Please do not be upset if
ever your window breaks.

150
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,746
It's true, it's true, it's true!

151
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:39,840
Even if I hide before he can see me.

152
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,885
Even if I turn away before he speaks.

153
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:46,263
Even if I try to change my actions.

154
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:48,140
But,

155
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,226
I already know

156
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:56,440
that I cannot escape from the
truth that I am falling in love with him.

157
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,276
And I won't be able to hide it anymore.

158
00:17:59,902 --> 00:18:04,490
But this time, I must tell
Juanito to stay away from me.

159
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,575
I don't want to hurt Helena.

160
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,838
Good morning to you, Miss Carmelita.

161
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:24,385
Sir... good morning.

162
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:29,098
I'm not used to you speaking that way.

163
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:33,310
I think we shouldn't be
formal to each other anymore.

164
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:38,774
You can call me by my name
and I can do the same myself.

165
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:49,034
And I also want to be with... Carmela.

166
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:02,339
There's too many people
here. You might get lost.

167
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,218
And I know this is the
first time you've been here.

168
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:11,182
Do you want to try these?

169
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:27,823
Wow... these are delicious!

170
00:19:27,823 --> 00:19:30,785
This is my favorite siomai.

171
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:34,246
Favorite?

172
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:40,628
Does Doña Soledad cook Chinese cuisine?

173
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:41,629
My gosh!

174
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:47,384
I forgot that in this time, Chinese were
looked down by the Spanish and Filipinos.

175
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:51,645
What I meant to say is...

176
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,047
from now on, siomai will be my favorite.

177
00:19:54,183 --> 00:19:55,434
Yeah...

178
00:19:57,102 --> 00:19:59,563
Sir. Your cooking is delicious.

179
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:05,277
I kinda miss this familiar food.

180
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:07,905
And I also miss my Mom's homemade siomai.

181
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:10,533
You love painting, don't you?

182
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,121
Come on.

183
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:22,795
You told me it's imposible for a
person's interest to truly disappear.

184
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:24,880
Then how about you?

185
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,800
It's a long story.

186
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:29,969
And right now,

187
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:32,429
I'm not ready to tell it.

188
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,099
Come.

189
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,809
We're gonna be late for the show.

190
00:20:51,323 --> 00:20:56,871
Thank you for the time you
spared for me, Carmelita.

191
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:57,955
Me too.

192
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:03,252
I mean, I'm going to bed soon.

193
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:07,003
- Wait...
- Actually...

194
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:10,009
Alright, go ahead.

195
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:17,099
We have to talk about
Operation Stop Wedding.

196
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:21,145
You know, my plan about you and Helena.

197
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:26,191
Before that, I want to give you something.

198
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:28,402
I hope you'll like it.

199
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,439
What is this for?

200
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:35,034
Helena?

201
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:37,968
Helena!

202
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:39,787
Oh, Helena!

203
00:21:40,706 --> 00:21:42,124
Helena, open your eyes!

204
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:42,917
Binibining Helena?

205
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:44,460
Miss!

206
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:47,296
- Helena? Helena, wake up.
- Miss!

207
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,381
Miss...

208
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:51,383
- Miss?
- Helena...

209
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,808
Juanito...

210
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:03,395
Marry me...

211
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:22,539
- Helena? Helena?
- Miss Helena...

212
00:22:23,874 --> 00:22:25,417
Binibini!

213
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:45,187
How is Helena's condition, Dr. Hidalgo?

214
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:47,648
Juanito?

215
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:55,990
Her heart rate is low and her
breathing is slow, Dr. Hidalgo

216
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:01,161
What should we do?

217
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:04,373
Don't worry, Mother Olivia.

218
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:09,628
I will advise you on what to
do make her recovery faster.

219
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:23,434
What happened?
Why did you suddenly come here?

220
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:31,025
I apologize, but I'm not
in the position to say it.

221
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:35,070
It's alright. I know how
trustworthy you are.

222
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,073
Laura? Your name is Laura, right?

223
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:40,451
Yes, Laura Isabela.

224
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:45,080
Is your family from San Alfonso?

225
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,416
I mean, your ancestors.

226
00:23:49,168 --> 00:23:51,545
Don't worry, I'm not a spy.

227
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:55,090
My family is originally from Tarlac.

228
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:02,222
My aunt took me to San Alfonso as payment
for my father's debt to the Flores family.

229
00:24:03,974 --> 00:24:09,646
OMG. I know that Daddy is from
Tarlac and he only met Mommy in Manila.

230
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:12,232
So, Laura is indeed Daddy's ancestor..

231
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:17,029
I was supposed to serve
Don Joselito's household,

232
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,239
the mayor of our town.

233
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,867
But there's already so
many servants there.

234
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:27,247
But Don Joselito was
Captain Flores' brother.

235
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:32,586
It so happens that Miss
Natasha fired their former helper.

236
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:38,425
that's why my aunt
took me to San Alfonso.

237
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:43,972
Don't worry.

238
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:49,895
In just a few years, you'll be
together with your family again.

239
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:54,983
I have grown fond of my masters.

240
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:57,528
They treated me
as if I'm family.

241
00:24:57,528 --> 00:25:02,825
So I will be saddened when
the time comes that I must leave.

242
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,203
Helena is kind,

243
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:08,747
that's why it's hard saying no to her.

244
00:25:08,772 --> 00:25:13,735
Just like Leandro, who
loves Carmelita so much.

245
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:17,714
It was right for Helena
to trust Carmelita.

246
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:20,134
And Leandro is also right for loving her.

247
00:25:20,676 --> 00:25:24,054
The only wrong thing is
that I am the one who's here.

248
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:27,599
I don't deserve their trust.

249
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,809
Miss,

250
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:31,937
I will only tell this to you.

251
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:36,233
Since you are Miss Helena's best friend...

252
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,736
The truth is Miss Helena
ran away from home.

253
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,533
The chief of the Civil
Guards is looking for her.

254
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:47,369
And also the people
working under Captain Flores.

255
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:50,539
Why did Helena run away?

256
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:56,920
After arriving at San Alfonso

257
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,382
she and Captain Flores had an argument,

258
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:02,467
and the Captain slapped her.

259
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:07,222
That night, I caught her packing
with the intention of running away.

260
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:11,223
I tried stopping her
but she said she needs

261
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:15,105
to talk to you and Sir
Juanito here in Manila.

262
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:22,779
OMG! Is that why she
asked Juanito to marry her?

263
00:26:23,906 --> 00:26:27,117
But why does she need to talk to me?

264
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:29,786
To ask me to allow them to get married?

265
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:39,458
Oh! Josefina!

266
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:43,442
Don't come closer. You
might catch the virus from me!

267
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:47,012
My body's so strong. Can't you see?

268
00:26:47,596 --> 00:26:50,015
All thanks to my complete
vaccine when I was young.

269
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:51,892
Shouldn't you be resting now?

270
00:26:51,892 --> 00:26:56,563
We are going home today to attend the
thanksgiving celebration at San Alfonso.

271
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:59,233
Oh, right. Do you need any help?

272
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,239
Helena?!

273
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:05,989
Laura?!

274
00:27:05,989 --> 00:27:07,449
Are you inside?!

275
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:12,871
Miss? Miss Helena!

276
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:17,334
- Miss!
- Mother Olivia! Helena needs help!

277
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:18,001
Helena!

278
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,920
- Miss!
- Helena! Helena!

279
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,171
Get out of the way!

280
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:23,340
Helena!

281
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:52,160
Maybe Helena's being
possessed by an evil spirit?

282
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:55,505
Oh no...

283
00:28:35,954 --> 00:28:39,207
Helena... what is happening to you?

284
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:03,982
I'm going home.

285
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:07,480
- Are you sure, Miss?
- Yes!

286
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:10,167
So move quickly! We're leaving!

287
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:21,458
Helena...

288
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:24,336
What is the reason behind this?

289
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:38,042
Don't bother writing to my Father.

290
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:42,862
I will deliver the message myself.

291
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,233
So that he'll know that his
daughter regained her clarity.

292
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:23,311
Father...

293
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:24,563
My daughter!

294
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:29,276
- Welcome back, my daughter.
- Mother Olivia.

295
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:31,903
Good day, Don Alejandro.

296
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:33,405
Doña Soldedad.

297
00:30:34,489 --> 00:30:35,574
Maria.

298
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:40,495
Father...

299
00:30:40,495 --> 00:30:42,164
I am very sorry.

300
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:47,335
No worries. Always remember
that I love you all very much.

301
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,214
Oh my gosh. What's happening to me?

302
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:55,719
I miss my Daddy. Good thing
I still have a father in this time.

303
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,387
By the way, my daughter...

304
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:02,893
I couldn't understand
this letter you sent me.

305
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:06,813
Carmelita...

306
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:10,066
I think you are missing some letters here.

307
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:13,737
What does ILY mean?

308
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:14,779
IMY?

309
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:19,826
Why are you so lazy
writing full words, Carmela?

310
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:28,210
For sure they'll get weirded out if I say
what's the meaning of IMY, ILY, at TC.

311
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:33,673
The meaning of ILY is...

312
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:38,053
I will make sure to stay away from trouble.

313
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:40,972
And for the others, it just so
happens that the ink ran out.

314
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,812
- Amigo!
- Amigo!

315
00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:51,983
- Amigo.
- How are you?

316
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:54,945
I also fetched Juanito.

317
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:58,031
So, we meet again.

318
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:03,203
And I am inviting you all to a
gathering at our humble home.

319
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:07,290
Father, I don't think
I'm feeling very well.

320
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:16,091
My friend, we all gladly
accept your invitation.

321
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:18,468
Thank you very much, my friend.

322
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:33,483
My friend, I will give you
something you'll surely love.

323
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:42,075
It is breezy outside.

324
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:18,028
Carmelita, I hope you feel
at ease here in our home.

325
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:20,614
Thank you.

326
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:24,451
Is your heart troubled?

327
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:34,377
I understand what's
going on with your feelings.

328
00:33:40,342 --> 00:33:44,387
Carmelita, a parent's love for their child
is something no one could measure.

329
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,427
But I understand
that your parents are

330
00:33:48,451 --> 00:33:52,062
looking forward to
your wedding to Juanito.

331
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:58,818
But I'm also sure that
they have reservations.

332
00:33:59,402 --> 00:34:03,990
Because nothing is
certain in this world, right?

333
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:07,391
Juanito is kind and gentle.

334
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:13,541
Because we raised him to
be kind and well-mannered.

335
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:19,005
And he witnessed the love
between me and his father.

336
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,927
He will love and cherish you forever.

337
00:34:28,348 --> 00:34:32,977
I pray that you may overcome
all the challenges you'll face.

338
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:38,316
Juanito's bride sure is lucky.

339
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:42,153
From now on, please treat
me like your own mother.

340
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:55,917
Doña Juanita? Doña Juanita!

341
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:57,961
Mother?

342
00:34:58,878 --> 00:35:01,506
What's the matter, Mother?

343
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:04,384
Nothing. This is nothing, maybe...

344
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:06,970
Maybe I just need some rest.

345
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:11,725
Please don't mention
it to your father.

346
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:16,020
Because I don't want
him to... get worried.

347
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:18,940
Especially when the Montecarlos are here.

348
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:24,028
Carmelita, I hope you won't
tell your family because...

349
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:28,575
It might... ruin their enjoyment of today.

350
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:32,912
If they are informed that I
am not feeling quite well.

351
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:38,356
Angelito. Fetch Mother's medicines.

352
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:40,132
Let us take Mother to her room.

353
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:41,325
Yes, brother.

354
00:36:52,283 --> 00:36:54,327
How's Doña Juanita?

355
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,830
Mother's already asleep.

356
00:36:57,413 --> 00:37:01,125
Her heart's weak that's why
she must not exert herself.

357
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:05,338
Maybe he got exhausted
preparing for my homecoming.

358
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:08,132
Miss...

359
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:11,302
is Theresita with you?

360
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,430
What are you whispering about?

361
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:21,813
Mother said, she wants Miss
Carmelita to have a tour of our house.

362
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,253
I'll do it, Angelito.

363
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:27,318
You go and watch Mother.

364
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:34,075
Let's go, Miss Carmelita.

365
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:35,910
Where are we going?

366
00:37:50,216 --> 00:37:51,426
Are you alright?

367
00:37:57,932 --> 00:38:00,393
If you're not gonna
talk to me, I'll just leave.

368
00:38:00,393 --> 00:38:04,689
Why does it feel like you've
been avoiding me recently?

369
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,193
You easily joke around with Angelito,

370
00:38:09,193 --> 00:38:11,279
while you can't even spare
a bit of attention to me.

371
00:38:12,906 --> 00:38:15,491
Gosh. So he noticed it.

372
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:21,289
It's not that I'm avoiding you...

373
00:38:21,873 --> 00:38:23,374
It's just...

374
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:25,376
It so happens that...

375
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:31,799
I got tired on the way
here. So I'm feeling lethargic.

376
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:37,263
Binibining Carmelita...

377
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:43,311
I wanted to ask what you think of
the letter I gave you the other night?

378
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:45,313
What is this for?

379
00:38:46,189 --> 00:38:49,901
What do I do? What do I even need to say?

380
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,248
I can't even remember where I put it!

381
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:11,130
Did you like the poem I've written for you?

382
00:39:12,275 --> 00:39:14,402
So it was a poem!

383
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:16,847
Why didn't I read it immediately?

384
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:21,599
He'll get upset if he learns
that I lost the poem he made.

385
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:27,146
I apologize. I haven't read it yet.

386
00:39:27,146 --> 00:39:31,859
We became so busy with taking
care of Helena and packing things.

387
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,864
When you do get the chance to read it,

388
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:41,848
I hope you'll tell me what you think.

389
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:46,249
Just make sure you take care of yourself.

390
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,207
My only wish is to see you doing well.

391
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:03,516
- A blue envelope?
- Uh-huh.

392
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:06,294
I don't think I saw something
like that at the convent.

393
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:09,599
OMG! I lost Juanito's letter!

394
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:16,988
Good morning, ladies.

395
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:22,349
- Doña Soledad, I will take care of those!
- I'll go over there with Esmeralda.

396
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:23,870
Who is she?

397
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,872
Have you forgotten who she is, Miss?

398
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:31,461
She is Esmeralda, your former housekeeper.

399
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:35,060
Your father summoned her
again to keep watch and...

400
00:40:35,085 --> 00:40:37,671
Discipline the workers at the hacienda.

401
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:42,368
Someone is spreading
lies about Don Alejandro.

402
00:40:44,682 --> 00:40:47,769
Miss, a letter came for you.

403
00:40:52,315 --> 00:40:54,233
My beloved Carmelita,

404
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:58,279
I wanted to meet you at the pier yesterday,

405
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:02,352
but I learned that the
Alfonso family was also there.

406
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:04,391
It may hurt me,

407
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:11,340
but I know that you are just following your
father's order to spend time with Juanito.

408
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:14,837
I know I'm still the one in your heart.

409
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:22,011
I wish to see you tomorrow
outside the church for Thanksgiving.

410
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:25,848
With love, Leandro Flores.

411
00:41:35,942 --> 00:41:38,852
Carmelita, let's meet at the church.

412
00:41:38,877 --> 00:41:41,004
I'll accompany Maria first.

413
00:41:46,828 --> 00:41:49,747
My brother Eduardo is waiting for Maria.

414
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:52,841
Alright, you can go
ahead. I'll follow soon.

415
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,173
Come here, you.

416
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,182
And what are you doing here?

417
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:05,805
Why, am I not allowed in here?

418
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,226
I know you like Theresita.

419
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:17,191
I do have feelings for
Theresita, but I know it isn't right.

420
00:42:18,442 --> 00:42:20,797
Because of your status in life?

421
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:23,574
Do you think Theresita
will like me as well?

422
00:42:24,198 --> 00:42:27,994
I don't have the courage
to admit my feelings.

423
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:35,501
And I know when I come of age, my
parents will choose a girl for me to marry.

424
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:43,843
You know, it's better if
you'll be true to yourself.

425
00:42:44,352 --> 00:42:46,888
And if you are ever
arranged into a marriage...

426
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:51,017
My only advice is to follow your heart.

427
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:56,188
Is that why you don't want
your wedding to my brother to happen?

428
00:42:56,213 --> 00:42:58,549
Because there's someone else in your heart?

429
00:43:02,153 --> 00:43:04,488
It's not that I don't like Juanito...

430
00:43:05,565 --> 00:43:06,775
To be honest...

431
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:09,660
I'm actually falling for him.

432
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:12,079
But...

433
00:43:12,747 --> 00:43:14,719
I know, deep inside...

434
00:43:14,744 --> 00:43:16,912
We are not meant for each other.

435
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:22,381
Theresita.

436
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:28,930
Good day to you, Mr. Angelito.

437
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:31,390
Good day to you as well, Theresita.

438
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:35,228
Alright. I'll leave you two be.

439
00:43:37,688 --> 00:43:38,703
Miss!

440
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:13,015
It seems like...

441
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:16,102
I don't need to wish for anything tonight.

442
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:18,980
Because my wish just came true.

443
00:44:19,939 --> 00:44:21,274
To see you.

444
00:44:22,775 --> 00:44:27,488
I almost forgot! He told me
in the letter to meet him here.

445
00:44:34,657 --> 00:44:40,571
Don Alejandro and Doña Soledad caught
Mr. Juanito and Miss Helena together!

446
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:41,764
What?

447
00:44:42,295 --> 00:44:43,296
Let's go!

448
00:44:43,296 --> 00:44:47,300
Is it true that it was your idea
to bring Helena and Juanito closer?

449
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:51,004
I am the reason behind all this.

450
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:55,366
Is this enough evidence to prove
your treachery to my daughter?!

451
00:44:55,391 --> 00:44:57,602
Mind your tongue, Alejandro!

452
00:44:57,627 --> 00:45:02,173
It's true that I was the one who brought
Juanito and Helena closer together.

453
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:05,651
It's also true that I don't want
the marriage to continue.

454
00:45:05,651 --> 00:45:07,153
Because I am in love with Leandro.

455
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:09,739
It's not just Juanito
that you need to protect.

456
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:11,782
Your family needs you as well.

457
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:13,743
You mean to say...

458
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:15,328
Come here!

459
00:45:15,328 --> 00:45:16,412
Miss!

460
00:45:16,412 --> 00:45:17,580
Where's Juanito?

461
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,998
I'm not sure but...

462
00:45:18,998 --> 00:45:20,750
he told me...

463
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,128
He will get some air
where everything started.

464
00:45:24,128 --> 00:45:27,214
Eduardo says there's trouble
at Alfonso's estate.

465
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:27,840
What?

466
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,675
Go ahead! Bring me to court!

467
00:45:29,675 --> 00:45:32,970
I will fight for the truth!
