1
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:51,858
I raped and abused Cristeta.

2
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:56,951
Captain Pedro Corpuz
and General Sergio Alfonso...

3
00:00:56,997 --> 00:01:01,001
are sentenced by this
court to death.

4
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:11,156
Juanito!

5
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,366
Stand up!

6
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,826
The new officer-in-charge

7
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:15,910
of San Alfonso would be...

8
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,496
Governor Vicente Flores.

9
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,711
I lied.

10
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:32,177
Mr. Sergio never
abused me. It's not true.

11
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:35,096
You always go against
my word, Carmelita!

12
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,557
Destiny has already
changed its course.

13
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,483
We are not bad people.

14
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:51,732
Well,

15
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:55,467
don't let them roam around alone.

16
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:58,090
They might get into trouble.

17
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,512
Juanito?

18
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,208
Juanito!

19
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:18,055
Do not get angry, Father.

20
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:23,014
Maybe Carmelita just
needs more time to think.

21
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:24,699
That's why she went to Sugbu.

22
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:31,348
Time to think?

23
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,025
Getting married to you
is a no-brainer, Leandro.

24
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,320
You are a general.

25
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,322
Governor.

26
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,199
Do not worry.

27
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,951
Once Carmelita arrives,

28
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,536
I will make sure her wedding
with General Leandro will push through.

29
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:51,657
But, General Leandro...

30
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:54,065
I'm just wondering.

31
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:58,567
Are you and my daughter really in love?

32
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:05,631
There is no doubt.

33
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,937
What? I am to be married to Leandro?

34
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:24,527
DoÃ±a Soledad.

35
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:27,453
In love or not,

36
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:31,193
we all know you need this
engagement more than us.

37
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:33,936
To clean the reputation of your daughter.

38
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,254
After getting cheated by an Alfonso.

39
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:43,754
Juanito!

40
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:45,996
Juanito!

41
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,966
Can we just talk for a while?

42
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,773
Juanito, are you mad at me?

43
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,670
Why didn't you answer the
letters I gave to Eduardo?

44
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:01,337
Why didn't you show
up at our meeting place?

45
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,155
Why...

46
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,906
Because I don't want to
have anything to do with you.

47
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:09,594
Every time I see you,

48
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,581
I remember the betrayal
your father did to our family.

49
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:18,192
But...

50
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,544
But you told me,

51
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,708
when you're with me...

52
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,345
Everything gets better.

53
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,228
Just pretend that...

54
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:38,775
We haven't met at all.

55
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:45,948
Juanito...

56
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,035
Juanito! Juanito!

57
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,035
It's mother!

58
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:06,825
Carmelita...

59
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:08,145
DoÃ±a...

60
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,726
It is you.

61
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,189
I am grateful that

62
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,983
we were able to see each other

63
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,028
in my last moments...

64
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,867
DoÃ±a Juanita...

65
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,369
Mother, please don't talk that way.

66
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,873
Angelito...

67
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:43,478
Angelito...

68
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,970
Listen to your siblings.

69
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:53,474
Treat them as your second parents.

70
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,811
They'll be the ones to look after you.

71
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:03,609
As for you, Juanito.

72
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,990
Love your siblings.

73
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,331
You will be the ones
to give each other hope.

74
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,266
I love you very much, Mother.

75
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:37,476
Very much.

76
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,530
Mother? Mother!

77
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,438
Don Mariano, General Sergio,

78
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,189
and nowâ€¦

79
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:24,523
DoÃ±a Juanita.

80
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,235
Everything changed
because I changed what was destined.

81
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:28,361
I canâ€™t blame him

82
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:29,779
if he wants to completely

83
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:31,364
erase me from his life.

84
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,949
But still, I hopeâ€”

85
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,493
that our story is not yet over.

86
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:37,328
I donâ€™t want to leave,

87
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,371
but this is the price

88
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:39,372
of my mission

89
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:40,206
in this time.

90
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,415
Because all of thisâ€¦

91
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,875
is for Juanito.

92
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:47,588
Your beauty shines more
when you smile, Carmelita.

93
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,340
That is true.

94
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:53,511
I'm sure General Leandro will
love you truly and whole-heartedly.

95
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,096
So don't you worry.

96
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,099
And forget about Juanito.

97
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,809
If he really loved you,

98
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:02,019
he would not have let you go so easily.

99
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,939
And if he really loved you...

100
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,525
He would be here.

101
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,653
So please, Carmelita.

102
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,158
I hope you give Leandro a chance.

103
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,595
Every time I see you,

104
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,582
I remember the betrayal
your father did to our family.

105
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,167
Just pretend that...

106
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,794
We haven't met at all.

107
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:38,030
What was that?

108
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,765
Josefina, call the men!

109
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,320
No, wait.

110
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,435
Wait a minute.

111
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:44,520
Carmelita, are you out of your mind?

112
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,992
Juanito.

113
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:03,531
What's Juanito doing here?

114
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,167
I need to talk to Juanito.

115
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,085
I need to talk to Juanito.

116
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:09,281
But Carmelita, you could be seen.

117
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,141
Leandro and his family
are already on their way.

118
00:11:12,018 --> 00:11:13,019
I'll do something about it.

119
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,734
Okay?

120
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,765
Alright.

121
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:18,863
Carmelita!

122
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,181
It'll be just for a moment!

123
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:29,065
I never thought that

124
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:32,485
we'd see each other again after
we bid our goodbye in Sugbu.

125
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,031
There's...

126
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,491
Something I wanted to...

127
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:40,429
Fix.

128
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,036
And get something back here.

129
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,647
And...

130
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,584
I'm hoping...

131
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:49,835
It's not too late.

132
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,797
What is it that you want back?

133
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,522
You.

134
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,060
Do you remember when we first met?

135
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:12,441
You told me I shouldn't
fall in love with you.

136
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,239
But I wasn't able to stop my feelings.

137
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,620
I want to you know that...

138
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,253
My heart only beats for you.

139
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,635
I thought if I turn away from you,

140
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,888
my heart and mind will soon forget you.

141
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,226
But it just made me long for you more.

142
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,481
And if you'll allow it...

143
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:59,530
I want to show you how
pure my intentions are.

144
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,290
Carmelita...

145
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,586
Yes, it's fine.

146
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:16,964
Does that mean...

147
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,092
You're letting me court you?

148
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,427
Yes.

149
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,696
Then,

150
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,222
- are you saying yes?
- Huh?

151
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,184
I thought you're just courting me?

152
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,690
You want to be official already?

153
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:32,732
I was just trying my luck.

154
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,424
Miss?

155
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:47,036
General Leandro and
Gobernadorcillo Flores have arrived.

156
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:49,979
Thank you.

157
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,042
Don't worry.

158
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,879
I'll tell Father that the
wedding with Leandro will not happen.

159
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,403
I was teasing Leandro actually.

160
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,655
I told him to...

161
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:25,407
Make sure he and Carmelita
would have lots of kids.

162
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,452
So that our families would
grow bigger and merrier.

163
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,332
Gosh! Here we go again
with the number of kids.

164
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:38,796
It's true that destiny
pulls two people in love closer together.

165
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,174
Leandro also told me

166
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:45,427
he and Carmelita have
been together for a long time.

167
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,179
Even before he became a soldier.

168
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,142
You and Leandro are
already in a relationship?

169
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:06,073
How can I explain that
I'm not really Carmelita?

170
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,134
I apologize.

171
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:14,461
My Father is naturally a joker.

172
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,877
Well, when would you like to get married?

173
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,591
All of us here are well aware that...

174
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,301
A lot has happened in the last few months.

175
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,641
I think it's better to let our
emotions settle down first.

176
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,020
Since Don Mariano and
his family were gone--

177
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:39,992
I mean, let's do the wedding in May.

178
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,655
If you still think that's too much time...

179
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,452
Maybe we can ask Mother Olivia's opinion.

180
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:05,478
No wedding shall happen
between Carmelita and Leandro.

181
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,310
And who are you to decide for our family?

182
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:17,478
What power do you hold

183
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,229
to choose our children's path?

184
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:26,157
I am here

185
00:16:26,182 --> 00:16:27,934
to inform all of you...

186
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,724
That Carmelita decided to
be a servant of the church.

187
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:42,461
Carmelita,

188
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:44,365
you wish to also become a nun?

189
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,369
Yes.

190
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,094
I'm sorry I wasn't able to inform you.

191
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,111
But...

192
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,639
That is my decision.

193
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,433
But this engagement is...

194
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,503
Father!

195
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,206
Father.

196
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:06,610
We all know that your
decision is important.

197
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,657
But when I decided to serve
the church, you accepted it.

198
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,096
Father.

199
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,083
Please let Carmelita decide for herself.

200
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:24,962
Governor Flores.

201
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:27,464
I apologize for this incident.

202
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,002
Do not worry.

203
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,087
I will fix it.

204
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,041
Father!

205
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,220
Excuse me.

206
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:48,658
Father!

207
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,611
Father!

208
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,740
- Let go of me.
- Father!

209
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,450
Alejandro.

210
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:56,910
Alejandro!

211
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:29,658
Did your Father scold you?

212
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:32,863
I'm fine.

213
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,259
You?

214
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:39,080
How are you doing?

215
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,253
Would you believe me...

216
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,006
If I told you that...

217
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,968
My heart is deeply hurt right now.

218
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:06,611
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,733
I never wanted to hurt you.

220
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,904
My conscience is bothering me.

221
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,366
Leandro doesn't deserve all this hurt.

222
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:21,703
I can pretend to be
Carmelita on the outside,

223
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,456
but my heart cannot lie.

224
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,460
Don't say sorry.

225
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:32,935
Maybe you are just confused right now.

226
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,754
Because all the good times
you had with the Alfonsos are still fresh.

227
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:41,502
And that is why...

228
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,056
I will give you more time to think.

229
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,634
Carmelita.

230
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:57,494
I hope that...

231
00:19:58,004 --> 00:19:59,505
you'd still choose me in the end.

232
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,214
I received a call from
the Governor-General.

233
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,445
He wants me to lead the battalion there.

234
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,469
To train them well.

235
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,473
I still don't know...

236
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:25,964
How long I will stay there.

237
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,394
But rest assured.

238
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:31,611
I will write to you everyday.

239
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,392
I hope...

240
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,699
That you respond to my letters.

241
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,620
Honestly,

242
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,581
I can feel that Leandro is a good person.

243
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,292
He always try to understand the situation.

244
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,795
The thing is, he loved the wrong person.

245
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,189
Did Juanito really go back to Sugbu?

246
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:18,445
Eduardo told me that
Angelito wrote to Juanito.

247
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,406
He said that Sonya suddenly bled,

248
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,785
and almost lost the baby.

249
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,579
So Juanito needed to return quickly

250
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,247
to take care of his sister.

251
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,670
He wasn't able to say goodbye.

252
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,714
Because he doesn't want to give Father
any more reason to get angry

253
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:41,301
Because he knows you'll escape again,

254
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,428
just to see him.

255
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,556
Carmelita...

256
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:52,813
I'm sure you'll see Juanito again soon.

257
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,566
You don't need to hide from us, Carmelita.

258
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,443
We are your sisters.

259
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,363
We know that Juanito is the reason

260
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,408
why you declined the marriage to Leandro.

261
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,286
And Mother Olivia is
helping you see him again.

262
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:13,208
The path you have chosen is not easy.

263
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,377
But don't worry.

264
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,587
We're here beside you.

265
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,716
We're here for the two of you.

266
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,177
Don't worry, Carmelita.

267
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:27,671
Thank you.

268
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,645
But I know Father and Mother
won't let me go back to Sugbu anymore.

269
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,741
Are you really sure
about your choice, dear?

270
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,069
About what?

271
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,078
About being a nun.

272
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,999
Is there any other reason why
you want to return to Sugbu?

273
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,147
Nothing.

274
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,964
I will explain everything to your Father.

275
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,924
Just make sure,

276
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,219
don't give Mother Olivia a hard time.

277
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,806
Mother, thank you. Thank you very much.

278
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:12,768
Carmelita,

279
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,853
take care of yourself.

280
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:19,024
And always remember
that we love you very much.

281
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,526
We're gonna do everything.

282
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:22,977
For you.

283
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,074
I wish for you eternal happiness.

284
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:47,106
It's so peaceful here.

285
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:56,186
Forgive me if...

286
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,314
I became angry at you.

287
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:01,942
Even though it wasn't your fault.

288
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:05,266
I promise...

289
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,405
It won't happen again.

290
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:12,821
By the way...

291
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,498
Mother Olivia has agreed...

292
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,960
For you to return to the convent tomorrow.

293
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,549
What are we doing here exactly?

294
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,553
This place...

295
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,931
is proof

296
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,434
that there is light beyond the darkness.

297
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,168
Have you heard of
the legend of the firefly?

298
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,754
Mmm. Before.

299
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:05,856
But...

300
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:06,965
I forgot about it.

301
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,386
Once upon a time,

302
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,972
there were secret lovers.

303
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,308
The daughter of the cabeza

304
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,269
and a humble fisherman.

305
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:24,983
But when their love affair was uncovered...

306
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,069
The young lady was taken away

307
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,739
by her parents.

308
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:33,533
According to legend,

309
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:35,994
the lady tried to go home on her own.

310
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:39,456
But she was never able to return.

311
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,500
She was never found.

312
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:46,429
One night...

313
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:50,884
A little light approached the fisherman.

314
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,764
It was his lost love.

315
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,310
Cursed by an engkanto.

316
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,773
After much pleading by the young man...

317
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,443
They were allowed to be reunited.

318
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,614
And together, they
became two little lights...

319
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,909
Bound to fly with one another.

320
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,162
Amidst the darkness.

321
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,247
Forevermore.

322
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,421
That story is quite sad.

323
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,509
Sad as it was...

324
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,345
The important thing was

325
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,681
they found each other.

326
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,558
And were reunited.

327
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,176
I will never forget this night.

328
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,025
The night

329
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:34,195
when the firefly found...

330
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,740
The woman he was dreaming of.

331
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,932
I won't forget this moment too.

332
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,354
The time when Juanito
and my heart became one.

333
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:35,427
For you.

334
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,052
This smells nice.

335
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,349
The sampaguita flower symbolizes...

336
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,393
Eternal love.

337
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:48,578
And...

338
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:49,687
And it came from...

339
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,357
the phrase "I promise you."

340
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:56,361
And I promise

341
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,489
that my love for you will never change.

342
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:03,785
Carmelita.

343
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,413
It's time to go.

344
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,836
Mother Olivia, may I talk to you for a bit?

345
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:22,637
Mother Olivia,

346
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,181
can I ask for a favor?

347
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,764
That you can join us for my birthday?

348
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,247
Dear child.

349
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,120
Haven't you finished embroidering?

350
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,582
It's almost night.

351
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,293
I'm done.

352
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,693
Ouch.

353
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,818
Ouch.

354
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:03,678
You know, dear...

355
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,222
You are quite adept at cooking.

356
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,266
You clean diligently.

357
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,518
And you can pray the rosary.

358
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,729
And do all the house chores.

359
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,161
But...

360
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,483
When it comes to embroidery,

361
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,109
it seems you cannot focus at all.

362
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,412
It's not a passion of mine, that's why.

363
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,157
Also, look at this.

364
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,783
My fingers are all bloody.

365
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:27,842
It's so painful.

366
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,208
Dear,

367
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,583
you heard about the Legend of the Rose

368
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,461
when you went to Binondo with Juanito.

369
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:44,511
I knew that Juanito asked
Mother Olivia to take me out.

370
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:48,306
But how did she know we watched
the play about the Legend of the Rose?

371
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:51,392
I never told her that.

372
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,313
I can hear your thoughts.

373
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:57,899
Oh my God!

374
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,443
Mother Olivia can read my thoughts?

375
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:02,458
Mother...

376
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,863
are you psychic?

377
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:04,880
Yes.

378
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,492
I can read your mind.

379
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,463
Why do you look so shocked?

380
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,167
Have you never thought

381
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,878
about my true identity?

382
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,190
Shocks!

383
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:24,467
Am I still talking to Mother Olivia?

384
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,427
Maybe she's possessed?!

385
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,556
Calm down, dear.

386
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,933
It is still me.

387
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:35,728
What if she hits me? My gosh!

388
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,485
I will not hurt you.

389
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,487
I don't hurt humans.

390
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,827
I do apologize

391
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:54,455
for not mentioning I can
read your thoughts before.

392
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:57,041
It's not just you.

393
00:31:57,875 --> 00:32:00,295
Even the other people I encounter.

394
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:10,138
Mother Olivia is already in her 60s

395
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,406
but...

396
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,599
she's still beautiful.

397
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:17,353
She maybe prettier
during her younger years.

398
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:26,029
Thank you for the compliment.

399
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:28,489
Gosh!

400
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:31,159
I forgot she can read my mind!

401
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,788
Mother... what are you exactly?

402
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,876
Far from what you're expecting, dear.

403
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:41,389
But...

404
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,504
I'm not too different from you humans.

405
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:50,927
Like you,

406
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,598
I also have a mission to accomplish.

407
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,643
And a punishment I must pay.

408
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:04,567
What is the mission and
punishment you're talking about?

409
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:08,988
Something...

410
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,574
I must both fulfill.

411
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,204
My mission is just like a rose.

412
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:20,083
Beautiful and alluring.

413
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:24,253
But with it, comes thorns.

414
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,298
Able to bring forth...

415
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,301
Pain and suffering.

416
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,348
Someone has to sacrifice.

417
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:37,934
Blood must be shed.

418
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:40,687
For it to come to pass.

419
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:44,774
Sacrifice?

420
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:46,984
If I fulfill my mission,

421
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:49,445
Juanito's life would be spared.

422
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,436
Carmela...

423
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,582
Always remember.

424
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,669
This is not your fault.

425
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,506
No one is at fault.

426
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:13,970
It was Destiny who wrote
everything that has happened.

427
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,097
And will happen.

428
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,100
And the things that are happening now...

429
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:23,229
Is not the same
with Carmelita's time.

430
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,459
Father!

431
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,037
Father.

432
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,326
Have you heard of what
happened at the church?

433
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,621
I never imagined...

434
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,624
that Ka Tapang's forces
were already that large

435
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,084
here in San Alfonso.

436
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,503
Last week,

437
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:51,674
they stopped and attacked
a civil guard's carriage.

438
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:54,066
They even stole the weapons.

439
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:55,236
And now,

440
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,472
they protested in the middle of the mass.

441
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,474
Furthermore, they're condemning the death

442
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:00,975
of Don Mariano Alfonso.

443
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,061
Father...

444
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,514
It seems like...

445
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,898
they don't fear anyone anymore.

446
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,610
Did you catch any of them?

447
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:18,201
My men weren't able to identify the rebels.

448
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:21,412
After they dispersed
into the crowd at church.

449
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,002
The problem they bring
gets bigger and bigger.

450
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,214
We need to move.

451
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,302
I will postpone my travels to Cavite.

452
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,096
I will send out civil guards

453
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,848
to all public spaces.

454
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,230
Don't forget to add
security for Don Alejandro.

455
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,376
Especially since you're about
to be married to Carmelita.

456
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:56,322
You also need to gather
information about the rebels.

457
00:35:58,658 --> 00:35:59,852
Who do you think...

458
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,745
would have the guts to
convince these people

459
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,914
to condemn the death of Mariano?

460
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,196
But...

461
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,843
The Alfonsos are exiled far away.

462
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:21,722
Make sure of that.

463
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:29,580
Very well.

464
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:30,773
Are you all ready to eat?

465
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,275
I'm so famished!

466
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,805
Mother Olivia,

467
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:41,534
thank you for fulfilling my wish.

468
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:45,246
This is a big gift to me already.

469
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,499
OMG!

470
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:51,002
October 21st is Juanito's birthday?

471
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,839
My dear friends.

472
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,399
I wish to introduce to you...

473
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,344
The woman who captured my heart.

474
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,852
Carmela.

475
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:11,654
If I say your real name,
you might get into trouble.

476
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,404
We are pleased

477
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:21,449
you could celebrate with us.

478
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,658
Let us all give cheers!

479
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,077
For the birthday of Juanito Cristobal!

480
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,498
Happy birthday, Juanito!

481
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,188
Eat!

482
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:32,543
Let's eat!

483
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:33,961
Go on, eat!

484
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,685
Have you heard of the story about

485
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:50,686
the handsome cat...

486
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:52,730
and the naughty rat?

487
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,153
One day, there was a handsome cat...

488
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,739
And he met

489
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,367
a naughty lady rat.

490
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,578
He wanted to eat this rat.

491
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,414
But since the cat was nice...

492
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,000
He didn't do it.

493
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:17,338
Until the days passed.

494
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,343
They fell in love with each other.

495
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:27,014
Even though they know
they shouldn't be together.

496
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,394
They still continued loving one another.

497
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,188
And they got married.

498
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,570
What's so funny about my story?

499
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:43,990
Because it's impossible!

500
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:47,034
A cat and a rat can't get married.

501
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,917
So you're saying it's
impossible for us to get married?

502
00:38:57,962 --> 00:39:00,006
Juanito, all I'm saying is that...

503
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,633
I'm pertaining to the cat and rat.

504
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:04,135
Not us.

505
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,346
If that's so, then be with Leandro then.

506
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:15,312
To cap off my beloved brother
Juanito's birthday celebration...

507
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:19,066
Carmela wishes to sing a song for him.

508
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,236
This song is for you, Juanito.

509
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:27,700
I want you to know that
my heart only beats for you.

510
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:34,623
â™« It's harrowing to promise â™«

511
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:39,378
â™« that I won't think of you â™«

512
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:44,175
â™« Nothing will come true â™«

513
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:47,303
â™« even if we try again â™«

514
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:52,224
â™« Now, I confess â™«

515
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:58,272
â™« I can only be with you in my mind â™«

516
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:06,989
â™« Whenever I hear our song â™«

517
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:24,423
I never thought you'd sing a song for me.

518
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,762
Your heart gets easily grouchy.

519
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,263
You are hard to appease.

520
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,475
Does that mean you believe

521
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:37,436
that the cat and rat can get
married and live together?

522
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,746
Mm-mm!

523
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,106
I hope you promise

524
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:44,652
that the mouse will never
leave his beloved cat.

525
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,403
And that she will never come

526
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,155
and get married

527
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,281
to the other rat.

528
00:40:50,435 --> 00:40:51,494
Yes.

529
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:55,913
I promise I won't leave
you and marry Leandro.

530
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,756
Carmelita!

531
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,967
A letter arrived for you.

532
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:10,928
It's from a man named Eduardo.

533
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:16,225
Why would Eduardo send me a letter?

534
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:21,772
Explain to me what's your
relationship to this man

535
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:23,274
and why he's writing to you?

536
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,195
Mother Ophelia,

537
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,266
I apologize but Eduardo
is my older brother.

538
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:37,955
I think, he wrote Miss
Carmelita's name on the envelope

539
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,624
in order for the letter
to be given priority.

540
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,627
Is this true, Mother Olivia?

541
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,507
You heard it right, Mother Ophelia.

542
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,927
Theresita and Eduardo are indeed siblings.

543
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:07,401
Miss, I think this is really yours.

544
00:42:09,842 --> 00:42:12,156
Why would Eduardo send me a letter, though?

545
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,498
Miss Carmelita,

546
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:25,252
I know that I shouldn't
meddle in your family's affairs.

547
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:28,911
But because of your delayed
wedding to Heneral Leandro...

548
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:30,758
Don Alejandro has decided

549
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:32,843
to marry Maria into the Alfonso family.

550
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,054
Miss Carmelita,

551
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,933
I know you are also
against your Father's plan.

552
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,644
That is why I'm asking for your help.

553
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:43,771
Sincerely, Eduardo.

554
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,065
Mother Olivia.

555
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,651
I need to go back home.

556
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:07,461
Carmelita, dear!

557
00:43:08,528 --> 00:43:10,631
Why didn't you inform us
you were coming home?

558
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:12,967
We couldâ€™ve fetched you from the pier.

559
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:15,386
Come and greet your father.

560
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,806
Who accompanied you here, Carmelita?

561
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:23,762
Father.

562
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:28,899
Is it true you are marrying
Maria off to Gobernadorcillo Flores?

563
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,075
Carmelita...

564
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:32,861
Don't start this.

565
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:36,490
You have just arrived

566
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:40,327
and you're already disrespecting me.

567
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,453
But Father.

568
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:44,957
Gobernadorcillo Flores
is too old for Maria.

569
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:46,625
They're the same age as Natasha!

570
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,711
Should I even listen
to a word she's saying?

571
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:53,799
I can't understand, but I've noticed

572
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,218
how you've changed so drastically!

573
00:43:57,886 --> 00:44:01,307
When and where did you learn to disobey me?

574
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:06,353
Since you've been spending time with...

575
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:08,474
That woman.

576
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,358
You completely changed.

577
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:16,238
Carmelita is just saying the truth.

578
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:17,262
Alejandro...

579
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:19,283
Stop it.

580
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:21,535
Show respect to the Reverend Mother!

581
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:24,580
Don Alejandro.

582
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:28,000
It's not up to you to decide
the outcome of things.

583
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:30,294
Keep in mind that

584
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:34,465
your desire for wealth and power...

585
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:38,260
comes at a great price you wouldn't expect.

586
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,515
You have no right to speak to me that way.

587
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:53,317
From now on,

588
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:57,821
you are forbidden to be with that woman!

589
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,157
But Mother Olivia has
nothing to do with this!

590
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:04,536
The issue here is you insisting on
marrying Maria to Gobernadorcillo Flores!

591
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:06,317
Father!

592
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:13,170
Iâ€™ve run out of patience
with you, Carmelita.

593
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,298
You don't listen to me anymore.

594
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:19,093
I tried to understand you

595
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:23,138
since you were close to the Alfonsos,
that's why I didn't punish you.

596
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:25,557
But you went out of line this time!

597
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:26,266
Father!

598
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,393
Father, please.

599
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:29,978
Please try to understand Carmelita.

600
00:45:33,065 --> 00:45:34,650
This child has to be punished!

601
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,404
Let her kneel on salt until I say
that she can return to her bedroom!

602
00:45:38,404 --> 00:45:39,427
Alejandro...

603
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:41,824
Esmeralda!

604
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:46,495
Esmeralda!

605
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:49,623
What is it, sir?

606
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:50,916
Are you deaf?

607
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:54,294
Get the salt and tray!

608
00:45:55,129 --> 00:45:55,629
Yes, sir.

609
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:56,645
Alejandro...

610
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:58,882
You don't have to hurt your child.

611
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:01,677
I will just talk to Carmelita.

612
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:03,804
She will never learn her lesson

613
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:05,722
if she won't taste punishment!

614
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:09,351
Alejandro!

615
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:32,673
Esmeralda,

616
00:46:32,698 --> 00:46:34,116
I'm begging you.

617
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,420
Take pity on Carmelita.

618
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,754
Stop this, Father! Please have mercy!

619
00:46:37,779 --> 00:46:38,857
Take your hands off me!

620
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,008
Didn't I tell you to kneel on salt?!

621
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:42,176
And you, Josefina!

622
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:44,219
You must learn to
discipline your sister!

623
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,929
Why would she be
taken to Laguna?

624
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:49,683
I think Father wants to
hide her far away.

625
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,477
Take that old man to prison!

626
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,061
I swear.

627
00:46:53,086 --> 00:46:55,254
I will make you pay,
Alejandro!

628
00:46:55,606 --> 00:46:56,623
Maria,

629
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:57,692
it's me.

630
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:58,775
How are you?

631
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:00,736
Carmelita, where is Eduardo?

632
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,947
What did Father do to Mang Raul?

633
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:05,866
Your eyes look sad.

634
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:06,928
Are you alright?

635
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,888
Carmelita,

636
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:12,164
I know you are aware that

637
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:13,290
since the beginning,

638
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,959
I have been charmed
by your doe eyes...

639
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:17,544
And sweet smiles.

640
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:18,552
Carmelita!

641
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:21,092
Juanito?

642
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:25,594
I'll take you away, Carmelita.

643
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:29,097
Let's elope somewhere
your Father wouldn't find.
