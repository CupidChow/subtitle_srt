1
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,444
So, I went back to
the time of Carmelita?

2
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:23,263
Okay. I'm dead.

3
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:24,382
Miss?

4
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:28,936
What is happening to you?

5
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,339
You are not making
any sense!

6
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,542
Please! I need
to get out of here!

7
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:33,711
You!

8
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,105
What's wrong with
all of you?!

9
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:38,247
So, I just need to
keep Juanito

10
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:40,558
from falling in love with
me to stop him from dying?

11
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,392
That's easy.

12
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,962
Listen carefully to
what I'm about to say.

13
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,446
Whatever happens...

14
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:49,831
Don't fall in love with me.

15
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:52,356
Carmela, dear.

16
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:53,815
Don't forget that

17
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:56,526
you are Carmelita
while you are here.

18
00:01:56,526 --> 00:02:00,197
Yeah, it's fine, Mother.

19
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:03,659
Our names sound
exactly the same, so...

20
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:05,395
I can handle it.

21
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,549
Juanito!

22
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:08,025
My god!

23
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,014
Juanito?

24
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,441
Juanito?

25
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:23,685
I just need some fresh air.

26
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,103
But it is not allowed.

27
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:27,921
What?

28
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:29,130
It is not allowed.

29
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:29,631
Why?

30
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,234
Even though I’m
the one with her?

31
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:39,713
Pardon me, Sir Juanito.

32
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:43,688
But you are not
accompanied by anyone else.

33
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:47,526
We will bring Nena,
the househelp.

34
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,667
We’ll just stroll around.

35
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:56,250
Let me handle it.

36
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:04,374
No! I’m not ready yet!

37
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:07,238
I'll be reminded of all the
embarrassing stuff I did!

38
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:12,899
Miss!

39
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:13,925
Wait a moment!

40
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:19,344
Miss!

41
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:24,352
Where are you going, Miss?

42
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,527
Why are you following me?

43
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:34,730
Miss…

44
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,532
last time I
checked, I live here.

45
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:41,536
Wow, arrogant huh?

46
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,416
Where are you going, Miss?

47
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:54,382
Now I get it! That’s why
Carmelita fell for this guy.

48
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:56,843
Juanito’s too handsome.

49
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,178
Miss?

50
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:04,893
Is there… a mango
tree around here?

51
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,762
Where can I find the mango tree?

52
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:09,105
Why are you asking?

53
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:13,359
I cannot say. Just because.

54
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:14,778
Don’t tell me…

55
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:18,323
Your father will surely kill you

56
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:19,872
the moment he discovers this.

57
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,285
He’s a killer? Don Alejandro?

58
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:23,411
I mean, my father

59
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:25,712
He will search the whole world

60
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:28,115
just to find the man
who disgraced you.

61
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:31,419
Excuse me?!

62
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:32,295
Hey!

63
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:33,797
I’m not pregnant!

64
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,632
Where the hell did
you get that from?

65
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:38,343
Forgive me, Miss.

66
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,845
According to the
books I’ve read,

67
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:43,556
the mango fruit is
the usual craving

68
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:45,475
of pregnant women.

69
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:46,684
Hello?!

70
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:49,104
I’m not pregnant!

71
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,563
I don’t even have a boyfriend.

72
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:52,023
I'm not seeing anyone.

73
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:55,652
I'm not in a relationship!

74
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,271
A boyfriend you said?

75
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:03,034
Maybe that’s why
you’re too grumpy.

76
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:07,122
Because you haven’t
fallen in love yet.

77
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:11,459
Not only judgmental
but nosy too!

78
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:14,671
Miss.

79
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,553
Miss Carmelita,

80
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:23,680
To be honest, you amaze me.

81
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:26,975
Despite all that
you’ve said to me,

82
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:30,061
you still have the
confidence to face me.

83
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:33,731
Hello? That’s exactly
why I’m avoiding you!

84
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,817
It’s you who’s
always following me!

85
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:40,864
Juanito, I mean… Sir Juanito.

86
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:44,701
Do you know the saying,

87
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,412
“when something
embarrassing happens…”

88
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:52,041
“It’s much better to
pretend that it didn’t happen.”

89
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,923
I think I never
heard of that one.

90
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,092
On what book did you read it

91
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:02,969
or whom did you hear it from?

92
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:06,313
Father told me.

93
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:13,745
You know, Miss…

94
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:17,651
I remember you
haven't thank me yet.

95
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:19,801
And what for?

96
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:22,901
First, I saved you.

97
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:24,949
Second,

98
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:26,993
I didn’t tell Mother
Olivia that you wanted

99
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:29,412
to escape the
convent that night.

100
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:30,788
And third…

101
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:34,959
I am here to accompany you.

102
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:36,669
Honestly,

103
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,955
I hardly say thank you.

104
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,423
but since this guy is persistent

105
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:42,596
and is smiling genuinely,

106
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,469
I still won't do it!

107
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:50,183
Whatever you say.

108
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:55,198
But if it’s a mango
tree you’re looking for…

109
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,857
We don’t have any in our garden.

110
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:04,080
But I know a place
outside of our estate.

111
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:08,493
Should I trust him?

112
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:12,055
He’s a stranger and
might put me in danger.

113
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,674
I’m not gullible!

114
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:18,211
Miss?

115
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:24,854
Miss?

116
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:35,436
Don Mariano,

117
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:36,521
we’ll take our leave since

118
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:37,689
it’s getting late in the night.

119
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:40,275
Then I will not
stop you, Alejandro.

120
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:43,611
Where are Maria and Carmelita?

121
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:47,949
Josefina, I saw
you talking earlier.

122
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:49,993
Where are Carmelita and Maria?

123
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:52,161
Maybe they went
looking around the house.

124
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:53,579
But surely, they’re
about to return.

125
00:09:58,501 --> 00:09:59,686
Father…

126
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:00,729
Mother…

127
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,800
Are we going home now?

128
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,549
Where is your sister?

129
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:09,721
Where is Carmelita?

130
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:23,568
Are we there yet?

131
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:24,694
Almost.

132
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:27,113
So, I guess he’s an
expert at escaping too.

133
00:10:27,113 --> 00:10:29,073
Why didn’t you
just ask the servants

134
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:31,326
to pick some mangoes for you?

135
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:34,829
- Since your condition is so delicate…
- I told you, I’m not pregnant!

136
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:36,744
Are you an addict?

137
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:39,208
Miss…

138
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:42,207
what is the meaning of
the word you just spoke?

139
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,301
Addict?

140
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:48,134
Oh, when someone
says, “you’re an addict,”

141
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:49,302
It means you're a gentleman

142
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:54,182
Well then… I am
indeed an addict.

143
00:10:57,977 --> 00:10:59,645
I can handle myself.

144
00:11:00,229 --> 00:11:01,246
You can go.

145
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:03,399
Miss, I cannot allow that.

146
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:06,069
The road is dangerous.

147
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,760
You might get hurt.

148
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:11,122
What? Is this the pick-up
line boys use in this era?

149
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:12,116
Believe me,

150
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:13,284
I can protect myself.

151
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:14,702
Can’t you see this?

152
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,168
Even when frogs are
jumping at your feet?

153
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:23,669
[Carmela screams]

154
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:25,004
[Juanito chuckles]

155
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:26,881
I hate those things!

156
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:28,841
Frogs!

157
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,886
I thought you fear nothing?

158
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:35,765
The frog almost had a heart
attack because of your screams.

159
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,172
You’re concerned for that frog?!

160
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:39,352
Let’s just go!

161
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,320
- We’re here.
- What?

162
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:51,614
Are we really here?

163
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:55,159
Then where are they?

164
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:56,406
Huh?!

165
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:57,446
Who’s “they?”

166
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,499
Are you sure we're
in the right place?

167
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:05,002
This is the closest mango
farm outside our property.

168
00:12:05,002 --> 00:12:07,125
And this is the
most fruitful tree.

169
00:12:08,464 --> 00:12:13,553
OMG. What if Maria already
went back to the mansion?

170
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,721
Carmelita!

171
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:16,848
Juanito!

172
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:18,558
What is the meaning of this?!

173
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:21,144
What are you two doing here?!

174
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:23,938
Pardon us, Father.

175
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:25,022
Don Alejandro…

176
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:26,149
but this doesn’t mean anything—

177
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:28,818
Are you saying there’s
another meaning

178
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:31,195
to this secret meeting
between you and Carmelita?

179
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:32,864
Well, Juanito?

180
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:34,574
Is that what I teach you?

181
00:12:35,116 --> 00:12:36,164
Father…

182
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,455
Oh my gosh…

183
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,373
I forgot that it’s not
normal in this era

184
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:45,543
for a man and a
woman to be together

185
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:46,836
without anyone else around!

186
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:55,261
Is he abandoning me?

187
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,013
He wouldn't help me?

188
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:02,643
This is what I do

189
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:05,438
when I want to escape
from my Dad’s scolding.

190
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:07,273
I hope it’s effective here too.

191
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:14,280
Carmelita!

192
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,323
Carmelita, dear!

193
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:18,034
- My daughter…
- Oh, dear.

194
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:19,869
Carmelita must be tired.

195
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:22,121
It is important she
gets some rest.

196
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:25,666
Mother Olivia is right.

197
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,710
Carmelita was
probably too exhausted

198
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,462
from their long journey.

199
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,756
Then you go home without me.

200
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:35,301
We’re going to discuss this
unbecoming behavior of these two!

201
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:37,136
Josefina, let’s go.

202
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:42,266
- Josefina!
- Help me with her.

203
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,026
Are you okay Carmelita?

204
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,566
Alright, this is a safe space now.

205
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,922
But I sure want to get
back to my own time.

206
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:16,842
My dear…

207
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:19,554
Don’t be upset about

208
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:22,056
what your Father said earlier.

209
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:25,977
He got carried away.

210
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:28,563
And I know for sure,

211
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:31,524
your Father can’t be
mad at you for too long.

212
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:34,652
She’s just like my Mom…

213
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:38,698
It's weird that I have
a mother in this era.

214
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:40,658
But it’s fine.

215
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,994
In a way, I want to experience

216
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:44,537
having a mom again.

217
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:48,874
I haven’t seen you
in months, dear.

218
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,752
How’s your life in Manila?

219
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,130
Oh no. What should I say?

220
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:57,258
It’s okay.

221
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:02,513
“Okay?”

222
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:05,725
Is it a term often
used in Manila?

223
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:09,437
Shit. Mother Olivia’s right.

224
00:15:09,437 --> 00:15:11,439
I should probably
shut my mouth now.

225
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,275
It’s like…

226
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:16,794
just fine.

227
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:19,238
Very good. That’s what it means.

228
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,074
Give it a few more years

229
00:15:22,575 --> 00:15:25,244
and you’ll learn so
much more in Manila.

230
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:29,165
And you’ll be serving
the Lord as well.

231
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,210
I was just thinking

232
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:38,674
about your beauty
and capabilities…

233
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:43,054
If only you could share
them to your future family,

234
00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:44,805
If you would have one.

235
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:47,892
But still, it’s honorable

236
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,770
to serve the church.

237
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:54,857
What? Carmelita was
studying to be a nun?

238
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,876
Did she want to follow
the footsteps of Josefina?

239
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,822
Okay then, take a rest.

240
00:16:02,281 --> 00:16:04,825
And tomorrow, don’t forget.

241
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:07,036
Ask forgiveness from your father.

242
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,919
What did you and
Alejandro talk about?

243
00:16:57,753 --> 00:16:59,505
We had a calm conversation.

244
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:02,717
But he didn’t like
what happened.

245
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:09,056
Juanito told me that
he and Carmelita

246
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:11,559
don’t have any
kind of relationship.

247
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,019
He just accompanied her.

248
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:15,229
It doesn’t matter.

249
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:18,357
You know how people would think.

250
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:23,946
Alejandro is worried about his
youngest daughter’s reputation.

251
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:27,783
What does he want to happen?

252
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,411
You know.

253
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:35,124
Juanito is a good child.

254
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,753
He has always followed
whatever you ask of him.

255
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,339
This time, I only ask that

256
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:44,925
you put your son’s
happiness first.

257
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:48,846
We need to talk to Juanito.

258
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:00,399
Miss Carmelita.

259
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:01,817
Wake up.

260
00:18:02,151 --> 00:18:03,694
Miss, it’s time to wake up.

261
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:05,863
- Miss…
- What?...

262
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:08,157
Jenny, Emily.

263
00:18:08,157 --> 00:18:09,867
Please, leave me alone.

264
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,118
I’m still sleeping.

265
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:14,764
Pardon? Miss, my
name’s Theresita

266
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,332
Your mother has asked me

267
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:17,875
to wake you up.

268
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,336
You’ll be late for
the first mass in town.

269
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:21,504
[Carmela grunts]

270
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:22,713
Is this a joke?

271
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,424
Who the hell is this girl?

272
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:33,307
Miss, your bath and fresh
clothes are ready as well.

273
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,770
How old are you?

274
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:39,814
Ahh…

275
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:42,691
Oh, I’m 13 years old, Miss.

276
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:45,294
13? In this tender age,

277
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:48,364
girls in this era are
already working?

278
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:51,793
When I was 13, the only
thing I do is use my phone.

279
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:57,414
I will assist you in
bathing and changing.

280
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,356
No need.

281
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,126
I want to be alone.

282
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:02,503
I’ll do it on my own.

283
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,880
Just leave the clothes there.

284
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:06,423
Yes, Miss.

285
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:08,968
I’ll put them here.

286
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:10,845
I’ll just call you
if I need help

287
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:11,971
putting on make-up.

288
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:14,098
Make-up?

289
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:16,225
Pardon me, Miss.

290
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:17,076
What is that?

291
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:18,227
It’s, uh…

292
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:20,980
Do you have any spare fabric?

293
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,731
I’m gonna “make something up.”

294
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:24,775
Oh, I do, Miss.

295
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:26,485
I’ll just get it downstairs.

296
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:31,907
I still can’t believe

297
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:34,285
that I'm the girl
in the painting

298
00:19:34,285 --> 00:19:35,832
Am I even in my own body?

299
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:11,989
OMG! Is that Juanito again?

300
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:13,991
Shit, they might see us!

301
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:15,117
Carmelita!

302
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:18,120
Carmelita, what’s
with the sudden rush?

303
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,204
I need to poop.

304
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,542
She needs to use the toilet.

305
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:25,753
Can’t you hold it a bit, dear?

306
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,227
I would like to go
around the market.

307
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:29,670
I apologize, Mother.

308
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:31,842
Doña Soledad?

309
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:34,553
Doña Juanita.

310
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,114
Good morning, Doña Soledad.

311
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:38,182
Ladies.

312
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:40,100
Miss Carmelita.

313
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:44,271
What is this guy smiling about?

314
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,230
Good morning,
Doña Juanita. Juanito.

315
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,986
Excuse us,

316
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:54,573
but Carmelita and I must go.

317
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:56,951
The mass has just finished.

318
00:20:57,409 --> 00:20:59,620
Aren’t you coming
to the feast later?

319
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:02,289
Carmelita couldn’t hold it in.

320
00:21:02,498 --> 00:21:03,916
She needs to go now.

321
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:11,215
What?! That’s the same as
telling them that I need to poop!

322
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:13,425
So embarrassing!

323
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:18,389
Carmelita? Carmelita!

324
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:22,893
Have you met with
Juanito last night?

325
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:26,355
I heard he’s back
in San Alfonso.

326
00:21:27,564 --> 00:21:30,526
So that’s why he’s not
answering my letters.

327
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:34,989
Have you heard the
rumors about Sir Juanito?

328
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:37,324
They caught him last night

329
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:38,951
with the youngest
daughter of the Montecarlos.

330
00:21:39,576 --> 00:21:41,328
Miss Carmelita?

331
00:21:41,328 --> 00:21:44,322
Yes. Rumor has it that
they have long been

332
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:46,542
secretly seeing each other

333
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,419
without their
families’ knowledge.

334
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:49,845
Is that so?

335
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:53,882
Miss, would you
like to buy these?

336
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:56,218
These are lovely.
Made from gold.

337
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,387
This is very cheap.

338
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,223
Maybe you’re interested?

339
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:03,900
Buy from us please.

340
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:19,324
It has only been six
months since my brother left,

341
00:22:19,324 --> 00:22:20,743
but there are already rumors

342
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:22,703
that you are seeing someone new.

343
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:26,623
This was the girl who slapped
me back in the convent.

344
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:28,417
What’s her name again?

345
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:29,752
And what brother?

346
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,503
Who is she talking about?

347
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:36,842
Be careful of the words
you speak, Natasha.

348
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:39,189
Why?

349
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:41,096
Is it not true?

350
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:44,892
That the honorable daughter

351
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:46,268
of the Montecarlos family

352
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:48,562
was caught with a man

353
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:50,522
in the middle of the night.

354
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:52,900
With no chaperone in sight.

355
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,279
What did you think
people would say?

356
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:02,326
Damn, rumors spread
fast in this era too.

357
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:09,333
I apologize, Natasha.

358
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,627
But it seems like your knowledge

359
00:23:11,627 --> 00:23:13,212
is based purely on speculation.

360
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:17,800
I know it's true

361
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:22,596
Talking to you is such a waste
of time

362
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:26,975
Oh, gosh. I can’t
understand a thing!

363
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:30,104
Let's go Carmelita

364
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:35,234
Gosh. So mean girls
exist in this time too, huh?

365
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:43,367
Don’t take offense
with what Natasha said.

366
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:46,078
She’s naturally mean-spirited.

367
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:49,164
Just be careful in
dealing with her.

368
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:53,377
She’s just like
Shae. A war freak.

369
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:55,295
And look at that.

370
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:57,965
Mean girls aren’t the only
ones existing in this time.

371
00:23:57,965 --> 00:23:59,716
Womanizer spotted!

372
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:02,094
Is he smiling at me?

373
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:03,720
Carmelita!

374
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:07,349
It’s been so long since
we last saw each other!

375
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:09,393
I have so much
to share with you.

376
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:14,898
Maria, can I take Carmelita
from you for a while?

377
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:16,066
We’ll just chat.

378
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:20,112
Alright. I’ll just
walk around then.

379
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:24,533
I won’t be long, brother.

380
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:26,076
We’ll just chat.

381
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:26,785
Alright, Sonya.

382
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:28,662
“Brother?” So, they’re siblings.

383
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:30,581
I judged them too early.

384
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:31,832
Am I a judge now?

385
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:33,834
Sure, Sonya.

386
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:36,086
Just let me know if
you’re ready to leave.

387
00:24:40,924 --> 00:24:43,427
I hope you’re
feeling relieved, Miss.

388
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:46,930
Damn! He had to
remind me of that!

389
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,808
-Come, Carmelita.

390
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,697
I’m glad and thankful that
I listened to your advice.

391
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:06,283
Oh… is that so?

392
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:08,035
Good to hear.

393
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:12,039
I don’t even know what
advice Carmelita gave her.

394
00:25:13,665 --> 00:25:15,751
The heart can be taught indeed,

395
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:17,044
just like you said.

396
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,340
At first, I don’t want
to marry Ignacio.

397
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:23,967
But because of what you said,

398
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:26,303
my mind has changed.

399
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:29,598
I am now happy that
Ignacio became my husband.

400
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:32,809
I promise to myself

401
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:34,519
that I will never be that corny

402
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,188
when I fall in love.

403
00:25:36,688 --> 00:25:39,608
Oh, by the way, Carmelita.

404
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:41,777
Are the rumors true?

405
00:25:41,777 --> 00:25:44,071
That you and Juanito are
getting to know each other better?

406
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:46,031
No, of course not!

407
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:49,326
He was just helping me look for Maria

408
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:51,453
And then, people
saw us together,

409
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:53,705
sparking rumors.

410
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:58,126
What I meant was,
Don Mariano saw us.

411
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,670
So, we got reprimanded.

412
00:26:00,128 --> 00:26:03,090
Next time, be cautious.

413
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:06,760
Things like this
spread like wildfire.

414
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:11,598
I also heard that Helena’s
back in San Alfonso as well.

415
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:16,645
I think you should
bear her in mind.

416
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:20,399
Carmelita.

417
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,277
We’ve been friends for so long.

418
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,529
I hope you won’t
hurt her feelings.

419
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,199
I know you did not mean
what have happened

420
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:31,618
That’s why I feel that

421
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,663
it’s better for
you to talk to her.

422
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:36,123
To clear things up.

423
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:40,210
What? Did Carmelita
do something wrong?

424
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,504
And I have to
apologize in her place?

425
00:26:48,677 --> 00:26:50,512
What do you mean?

426
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:52,723
Have you forgotten?

427
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:56,268
Helena has feelings for
Juanito

428
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:57,853
What?

429
00:26:57,853 --> 00:27:01,189
Someone has a crush on
Juanito aside from Carmelita?

430
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:04,860
I hope you won’t
forget all the things

431
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,738
Helena did for you and Leandro.

432
00:27:08,447 --> 00:27:10,615
Not because they’re siblings,

433
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,994
but because she wants
you to end up with Leandro.

434
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:16,788
So confirmed!

435
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:19,499
There’s something
about that Leandro.

436
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:22,336
He’s Carmelita’s
secret boyfriend.

437
00:27:32,304 --> 00:27:33,305
Father,

438
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:34,056
Mother.

439
00:27:34,765 --> 00:27:36,224
You wanted to talk to me?

440
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:44,441
Rumors are already
circulating around town

441
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:46,276
about the incident last night.

442
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:49,654
Juanito, I believe that you

443
00:27:49,654 --> 00:27:53,075
and Miss Carmelita don’t
have any kind of relationship.

444
00:27:53,075 --> 00:27:53,992
But…

445
00:27:53,992 --> 00:27:56,953
But Don Alejandro would
not be pleased about it.

446
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:02,667
He wants you to clear
Carmelita’s name.

447
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,671
Clear her name?

448
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:08,965
You don’t mean…

449
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:10,300
Marry her.

450
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:15,180
We will not force you.

451
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:17,265
The decision is still up to you.

452
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,485
That’s okay, I think.

453
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:31,238
Carmelita, prepare
the crock pots.

454
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:38,245
How should I say this?

455
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:39,871
If there's an oven here,

456
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:41,790
I've already cooked
lasagna for them

457
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,255
Mother, I’m not feeling so well.

458
00:28:48,255 --> 00:28:51,341
I don’t think I can cook today.

459
00:28:52,384 --> 00:28:53,552
Oh, dear.

460
00:28:53,885 --> 00:28:55,637
But I already taught you and

461
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:56,680
your sisters how to cook

462
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,099
this special
caldereta?

463
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:00,767
Aside from that,

464
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,395
you are the one who
must cook this today.

465
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:11,987
Doña Soledad…

466
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:15,282
We haven’t finished the
decorations in the drawing room

467
00:29:15,282 --> 00:29:17,993
when the butler
lost consciousness.

468
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:21,538
Alright,

469
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:23,498
Carmelita, carry on cooking.

470
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:25,375
Come, follow me.

471
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,799
What should I do now?

472
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:38,805
Carmelita.

473
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:41,516
Are you still not feeling well?

474
00:29:44,311 --> 00:29:46,146
If I’m the one to cook today,

475
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:48,773
will that stop you
from being upset?

476
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:50,233
Really?

477
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,777
I want to apologize.

478
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:54,446
I forgot that there’s something

479
00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:56,781
going on between
you and Juanito.

480
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:02,829
Let’s forget about that.

481
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:04,206
Just help me with this.

482
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:50,752
Miss, let’s fix the
ornament in your hair.

483
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:52,504
Your mother will scold me.

484
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:54,631
She specifically told me to
take extra care in grooming you.

485
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:57,551
She’s too much. We’re
just here in the house.

486
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:00,428
Dear…

487
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:03,598
Whatever you hear later,

488
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:05,475
just keep smiling.

489
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:20,115
The guests have arrived.

490
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:25,745
Don Mariano.

491
00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:27,747
Sir.

492
00:31:29,207 --> 00:31:32,877
- Good morning.
- Let’s go.

493
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:37,716
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you as well.

494
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:40,427
- Come in.
- Good morning to all of you.

495
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:44,014
- Juanito, good morning.
- Good morning.

496
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:47,892
They’re the important
guests?! What the hell?

497
00:32:14,794 --> 00:32:15,837
Don Mariano…

498
00:32:17,172 --> 00:32:20,216
Let’s talk about the
upcoming wedding

499
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:24,804
that will bind our families
into becoming one.

500
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:33,438
Wedding?

501
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:35,273
Who’s getting married?

502
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,360
Don Mariano.

503
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:42,030
Everyone knows that
our maiden daughter

504
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,699
is always here at home

505
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:46,409
since she doesn’t really know

506
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:48,995
how to socialize
with a lot of people.

507
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:54,584
We give her the utmost
importance and care.

508
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:57,212
But now,

509
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,300
I am giving the hand of my
youngest maiden daughter,

510
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,594
Carmelita Montecarlos…

511
00:33:06,388 --> 00:33:09,099
To the second
son of your family.

512
00:33:10,183 --> 00:33:12,644
Dear boy… Juanito.

513
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:15,355
I give you my
daughter to take care of.

514
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:34,749
Oh no... damn it.

515
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:49,097
Just my luck.

516
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:51,057
He’s even sitting
in front of me.

517
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:53,101
My friend,

518
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:55,603
I wanted to suggest

519
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:57,272
I wanted to suggest

520
00:33:57,272 --> 00:34:00,358
doing the children’s wedding
by the end of February.

521
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:03,027
On the 29th of February?

522
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:05,338
That is also the
birthday of Carmelita.

523
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:07,615
Oh, shocks. It’s
going to be a leap year.

524
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:11,911
Grandma Carmina said it
would also be the wedding day

525
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:13,872
of Juanito and Carmelita,
when Juanito died.

526
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:17,500
And then Carmelita took
her own life after a week?!

527
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,462
And now it’s happening again!

528
00:34:20,712 --> 00:34:22,756
We also want them to get married

529
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:25,175
in the church of San Alfonso.

530
00:34:25,175 --> 00:34:27,594
We are going to take
care of everything.

531
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:34,184
Isn’t he gonna say
no to this wedding?

532
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:36,352
Maybe he asked
something in return?

533
00:34:36,352 --> 00:34:38,646
Or he’ll get a huge inheritance?

534
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,444
What do you say, Miss Carmelita?

535
00:34:47,572 --> 00:34:49,032
Carmelita.

536
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:51,659
Doña Juanita is
asking you a question.

537
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,250
What is it again, Doña Juanita?

538
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:02,128
I would also like to know.

539
00:35:02,128 --> 00:35:04,339
How many children
do you want to have?

540
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:06,800
Are they tripping?

541
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,428
Do they seriously want to know
how many children I want to have?

542
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:22,106
Maybe Carmelita
haven’t decided yet

543
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:24,275
since she is still very young.

544
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:27,195
I just want to say that

545
00:35:27,195 --> 00:35:30,448
I think it’s for the
better if she would bear

546
00:35:30,448 --> 00:35:31,741
many children for Juanito.

547
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:32,951
Isn’t that right, son?

548
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:37,413
You’re quite right, Mother.

549
00:35:39,374 --> 00:35:41,584
Why are we talking
about children?

550
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:43,628
I feel like I’m gonna be sick.

551
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:47,966
For me, a dozen
children is enough.

552
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,302
Goodness, Sergio.

553
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:54,305
Isn’t a dozen a bit too much?

554
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:57,016
I suggest ten children.

555
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,855
Eight children are
what I’m recommending.

556
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:04,482
Gosh, what’s happening here?

557
00:36:04,482 --> 00:36:05,650
Is this a bidding?

558
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,111
What do they think of
me, a pig for breeding?

559
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:13,366
What do you think, Juanito?

560
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:15,159
Miss Carmelita?

561
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:17,936
- Seven.
- Nothing.

562
00:36:26,804 --> 00:36:30,057
My god, my blood
pressure’s rising.

563
00:36:31,551 --> 00:36:33,054
What do you mean, dear?

564
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,890
You don’t want to
have any children?

565
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:36,973
Oh good Lord.

566
00:36:38,474 --> 00:36:40,977
Carmelita, take back your word.

567
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:44,355
A woman who doesn’t want
children is said to be cursed.

568
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,073
What I meant to say was,

569
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:57,160
nothing would be
more happier than…

570
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,704
Having a husband like Juanito

571
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:02,290
and giving birth
to seven children.

572
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,134
[relieved chuckles]

573
00:37:17,764 --> 00:37:19,432
Juanito seemed to
fall in love with you

574
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:21,184
because of the caldereta.

575
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:25,355
From now on, he will
always crave for your cooking.

576
00:37:25,355 --> 00:37:27,899
If only Juanito knew that
I don’t know how to cook.

577
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:30,526
He’s in for a future where
he’ll turn into skin and bones.

578
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:39,619
By the way, I heard
something about you.

579
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:42,580
I heard Carmelita is quite
adept at playing the piano?

580
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:44,499
Isn’t that right, Sonya?

581
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:49,253
Don Mariano, our family
is very proud of Carmelita

582
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:51,673
because of her
talents for music.

583
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:54,217
If that’s the case,

584
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,344
then maybe you can play
even just one song for us?

585
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:58,930
Oh no! What should I do?

586
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,266
I don’t know how
to play the piano!

587
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:05,645
Let them hear you play.

588
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:08,272
Showcase your talent.

589
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:10,316
Do not be shy.

590
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:14,737
Ah, Carmelita!

591
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:17,515
Play that song you always
play for me and Helena.

592
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,868
My goodness!

593
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:24,122
I don’t even have a clue what
Carmelita plays for any of you!

594
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:32,980
Lord, please bring
forth the rapture and

595
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:35,987
let the earth swallow
me whole. Now, please.

596
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:46,352
Shocks. I’m sorry,
Carmelita, but I need to do this.

597
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:18,675
Very well!

598
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,515
Good thing I still remember something
from music class back in elementary.

599
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:29,645
Carmelita knows that is not
the piece I was talking about.

600
00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:32,648
But maybe she’s not
just feeling well tonight.

601
00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:34,609
Apologies to you all.

602
00:39:35,485 --> 00:39:36,495
Come.

603
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:53,620
I’m still sleepy.

604
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:57,673
But I have to learn how
to cook from Mother Olivia.

605
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:02,178
They might ask for me to cook
Caldereta every now and then.

606
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:04,964
I can’t rely on
Josefina forever.

607
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:35,636
You must stir it just right.

608
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,417
It shouldn’t be lacking.

609
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:40,675
And it shouldn’t be too much.

610
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:45,471
The food won’t taste
good if you rush it

611
00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:47,473
or if it’s overcooked.

612
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:49,684
You know, Mother Olivia,

613
00:40:50,226 --> 00:40:52,270
if only we have a
microwave here,

614
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,396
I can do that quite easily.

615
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:55,191
But…

616
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:57,692
well, let me do that.

617
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:00,941
I don’t have any choice.

618
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:07,326
- Dear.
- Yes?

619
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:08,792
Just so you know.

620
00:41:10,246 --> 00:41:12,540
- I’ll be leaving by noon.
- What?!

621
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,418
I must go back to
the convent in Manila.

622
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:17,879
But… no!

623
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:21,674
Mother Olivia, you
can’t just leave me here.

624
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:23,217
You’re the only one
who understands me.

625
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:24,569
I’ll just come with you.

626
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:26,095
Calm down, dear.

627
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:29,098
Next week, you can
come back to Manila.

628
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:31,434
Gosh. One more week?

629
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:33,561
One week of nothingness.

630
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:34,729
No wifi,

631
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:36,230
no cell phone.

632
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:39,734
- No TV.
- Dear.

633
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:42,651
Those things don’t
exist in Manila as well.

634
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:44,015
But at least you’re there.

635
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,458
I’m not gonna be all alone.

636
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,867
And what if a problem comes up?

637
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,161
No one will save me.

638
00:41:52,496 --> 00:41:55,541
Good thing you’re aware
that you stir so much trouble.

639
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:57,835
That’s why you need to fix

640
00:41:57,835 --> 00:41:59,503
all the problems you made here.

641
00:42:00,796 --> 00:42:03,507
Make sure no one would suspect

642
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:06,302
anything about your
uncanny actions.

643
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:10,264
Can’t I just come with
you, Mother Olivia, please?

644
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:12,016
Please! What if you leave

645
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:13,559
and come back to
the modern world?

646
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:15,228
I’ll be left here all alone!

647
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,565
I cannot leave

648
00:42:19,565 --> 00:42:22,068
unless you finish
your mission here.

649
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,028
Don’t you worry, dear.

650
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,990
For now, I’m the only
one who understands you.

651
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:30,117
But as the days pass,

652
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:32,995
many will be on your side.

653
00:42:35,748 --> 00:42:36,816
Carmelita,

654
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,323
Madre Olivia.

655
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:39,460
Father.

656
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,879
Get ready. We’re
going out later.

657
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:43,839
Alright.

658
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:52,108
Oh my… where could we be going?

659
00:42:56,143 --> 00:42:58,062
Didn’t you bring
any flowers, child?

660
00:42:58,813 --> 00:42:59,831
What?

661
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:02,650
Your friend is sick, isn’t she?

662
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,069
That is why I asked you to come

663
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:06,988
so you can visit Helena.

664
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:09,365
And there’s also something
important I need to discuss

665
00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:11,492
with her father,
Captain Vicente.

666
00:43:12,535 --> 00:43:13,573
Here.

667
00:43:14,203 --> 00:43:15,913
Give this to Helena.

668
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:18,874
Good thing your mother
was able to prepare flowers.

669
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,519
Alright.

670
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,756
- Good day, my friend.
- My friend.

671
00:43:25,781 --> 00:43:27,450
I see you brought
your youngest along.

672
00:43:27,978 --> 00:43:29,486
So she can visit Helena as well.

673
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:32,471
Good day, Captain Flores.

674
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:33,656
Alright, dear.

675
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:35,308
You may go to Helena’s room.

676
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,059
I’m sure she’ll be
glad to see you.

677
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,589
Alright.

678
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:56,370
Where’s Helena’s room anyway?

679
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,134
Can I help you, Carmelita?

680
00:44:11,093 --> 00:44:12,845
Shocks! It’s Natasha!

681
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:16,015
The mean girl we
encountered yesterday.

682
00:44:16,015 --> 00:44:17,683
What is she doing here?

683
00:44:17,683 --> 00:44:19,362
Is she Helena’s sister?

684
00:44:22,188 --> 00:44:24,315
Are you still hoping

685
00:44:24,315 --> 00:44:27,568
to receive a letter
from my brother?

686
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:40,829
Pardon me, Miss Natasha.

687
00:44:40,854 --> 00:44:42,856
Captain Vicente has asked me

688
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:47,093
to show Miss Carmelita
to Miss Helena’s room.

689
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:49,215
Whew! Thank you, Universe.

690
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:51,550
That’s a sign for
me to avoid a fight.

691
00:44:53,636 --> 00:44:56,013
Watch your steps.

692
00:44:56,514 --> 00:44:58,265
What is she saying?

693
00:44:58,265 --> 00:44:59,642
I don’t get it.

694
00:45:01,977 --> 00:45:04,688
You might fall, and I...

695
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:07,149
can't wait to see it happen.

696
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:12,071
This girl is so
screwed up in the head.

697
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:15,408
Maybe trashtalking is
not yet invented in this era.

698
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:18,202
Shall we go, Miss Carmelita?

699
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:23,666
Thank you.

700
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:25,292
What was your name again?

701
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:27,336
I am Laura Isabella, Miss.

702
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:30,506
Shocks! Did I hear that right?

703
00:45:30,506 --> 00:45:32,967
Isabella? That’s our last name!

704
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:52,027
Miss Helena, Miss
Carmelita is here to see you.

705
00:46:01,704 --> 00:46:02,955
How are you?

706
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,709
What are you doing here?

707
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:14,306
This is for you.

708
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,178
I just wanted to see
how you’re doing.

709
00:46:22,391 --> 00:46:24,727
Me? You’re worried about me?

710
00:46:26,187 --> 00:46:27,233
What for?

711
00:46:28,647 --> 00:46:30,983
You and Juanito
are set to get married.

712
00:46:33,986 --> 00:46:35,321
Helena, the thing is…

713
00:46:41,076 --> 00:46:42,036
Seems only yesterday

714
00:46:42,036 --> 00:46:43,913
that my brother was your lover.

715
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:46,672
And now, you turned to Juanito?

716
00:46:49,502 --> 00:46:52,755
You know well how long I had
these feeling for Juanito, right?

717
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,052
Believe me.

718
00:46:58,636 --> 00:47:01,764
It was an accident
when they caught us

719
00:47:01,764 --> 00:47:04,016
under the mango tree.

720
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:06,435
I was just looking
for my sister, Maria.

721
00:47:08,312 --> 00:47:11,398
How can I be sure you
have no feelings for Juanito?

722
00:47:23,744 --> 00:47:27,331
Are you sure of your
plan Miss Carmelita?

723
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:28,249
Shh!

724
00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:30,543
They might hear my name.

725
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:32,044
Don't say my name.

726
00:47:32,044 --> 00:47:33,879
And Yes! I am sure of my plan.

727
00:47:33,904 --> 00:47:35,698
No one can stop me.

728
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:41,220
It's nice and clean
in his bedroom.

729
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:41,929
Wait, Miss!

730
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:43,049
Do not look!

731
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,937
I know that you don't want
this wedding to continue, right?

732
00:47:50,854 --> 00:47:52,273
I will help you.

733
00:47:52,898 --> 00:47:54,316
Helena has feelings for you.

734
00:47:55,192 --> 00:47:58,028
Why does Helena seem
more important to you?

735
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:01,865
Is our wedding not
important to you?

736
00:48:02,491 --> 00:48:04,410
You don't have to come here.

737
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:07,830
I just wanted to see
and be with you, Miss.

738
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:11,417
Good morning, Sir Jaunito.

739
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:13,460
Good morning, Trinidad.

740
00:48:14,044 --> 00:48:15,921
- Carmelita!
- Yes?

741
00:48:16,088 --> 00:48:17,965
What are you still doing there?

742
00:48:18,382 --> 00:48:20,509
We have an important
place to go to.

743
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:21,969
Did you not receive?

744
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,846
The letter that Helena sent?
