1
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,094
Oh, when someone says,
“you’re high,”

2
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,801
it means they think
you’re a gentleman.

3
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:37,011
Well then…
I am indeed high.

4
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,916
Carmelita! Juanito!

5
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:40,378
What is the meaning of this?

6
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:42,321
Carmelita couldn’t hold it in.

7
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:43,977
She needs to go now.

8
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,398
It has only been six months
since my brother left,

9
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,841
but there are already rumors

10
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,706
that you are meeting someone new.

11
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,640
I believe that you

12
00:00:57,665 --> 00:01:00,672
and Miss Carmelita don’t have
any kind of relationship.

13
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:03,074
But Don Alejandro would
not be pleased about it.

14
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,374
He wants you to clear Carmelita’s name.

15
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,826
Marry her.

16
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:09,711
I just want to say that,

17
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,171
I think it’s for the
better if she would bear

18
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,740
many children for Juanito.

19
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,293
- Isn’t that right, son?
- You’re quite right, Mother.

20
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:20,364
I heard something about you.

21
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:23,224
I heard Carmelita is quite
adept at playing the piano?

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,625
Your friend is sick, isn’t she?

23
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,877
That is why I asked you to come

24
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:29,738
so you can visit Helena.

25
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:37,357
Miss Helena,

26
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:39,843
Miss Carmelita is here to see you.

27
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:54,347
How are you?

28
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:57,970
What are you doing here?

29
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,744
This is for you.

30
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:08,513
I just wanted to see
how you’re doing.

31
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:14,894
Me?

32
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,212
You’re worried about me?

33
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,507
What for?

34
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,128
You and Juanito are set to get married.

35
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,682
Helena, the thing is…

36
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:35,008
It was only yesterday that
my brother was your lover.

37
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:38,307
And now, you turned to Juanito?

38
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,543
You know well how long

39
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:44,251
I had these feelings
for Juanito, right?

40
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:49,519
Believe me.

41
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:53,239
It was just an accident when

42
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:55,475
they caught us
under the mango tree.

43
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,875
I was just looking
for my sister, Maria.

44
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:02,904
How can I be sure you
have no feelings for Juanito?

45
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:08,932
Because...

46
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,795
Because I'm still in love with
Leonardo-- I mean, Leandro.

47
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:23,883
I want to rest now.

48
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,293
Helena...

49
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,938
I don't want to lose another friend,

50
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:35,451
just like what happened
between me and Shae.

51
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:41,799
I'll go ahead.

52
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,011
But I hope

53
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,929
you'll believe me

54
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:48,663
when I say I don't want the wedding
to push through.

55
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:16,272
Hmm?

56
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,979
OMG!

57
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:27,614
What's Juanito doing here
in the Flores residence?

58
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,837
Wait... is he looking for Helena?

59
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,835
So, they have mutual feelings.

60
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,402
They are in love.

61
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:47,926
My friend, we'll be heading now.
Thank you.

62
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:49,701
Until next time, my friend.

63
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,201
Thank you very much, Captain Flores.

64
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:20,788
Dear Diary.

65
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:25,359
Now I realize that not everything
that was written in this diary is true.

66
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,625
Not all of Grandma Carmina
and Mother Olivia's stories are factual.

67
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:34,141
The truth is only Carmelita
fell in love with Juanito.

68
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:37,458
And Juanito has
feelings for someone else.

69
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,127
Completely confused, Carmela.

70
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:03,619
I have to plan everything
smoothly in order to stop all of this.

71
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:07,597
First, I have to save Juanito.

72
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,041
To stop the tragedy,

73
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:13,590
Helena and Juanito
must become closer.

74
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:15,857
Which is actually not that difficult

75
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:18,273
since they already have
feelings for each other.

76
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,179
Second,

77
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:21,853
I need to...

78
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,728
I need to think of a reason

79
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:27,739
for Don Alejandro
and Don Mariano...

80
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:32,722
To stop them from pushing
this arranged marriage.

81
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:35,707
But I can't think of anything!

82
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,287
Yes, come in.

83
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,790
Miss,

84
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:49,477
your mother has sent
these books for you.

85
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:51,403
So that you may read it immediately.

86
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:56,141
What is all these books
Carmelita has been reading?

87
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,038
I don't even like reading.

88
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,793
Do you need anything else, Miss?

89
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:23,005
Are you sure about what you're
planning to do, Miss Carmelita?

90
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:24,038
Shh.

91
00:09:24,092 --> 00:09:26,245
They might hear you say my name.

92
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,774
Don't say it.

93
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,127
And yes, I'm sure of it.

94
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,529
No one can stop me.

95
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,291
But...

96
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:38,167
how did you know that that
window is the room of Mr. Juanito?

97
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:40,569
Of course. I saw him
looking out there earlier.

98
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,124
I'll go ahead.

99
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:45,725
Shush.

100
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,977
- Miss, please be careful!
- Shush! Shush!

101
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,096
Miss! Please be careful!

102
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:18,367
In fairness,

103
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,328
his room is clean and tidy.

104
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,042
And what's this?

105
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,089
Leccion de clinica cor... oh!

106
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:33,883
Whatever!

107
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:35,403
These books are thick.

108
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,683
Too thick.

109
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,534
Who are you?

110
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,927
Miss!

111
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:46,477
Don't you dare look!

112
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:56,473
OMG!

113
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,157
Miss Carmelita?

114
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:03,028
What are you doing here?

115
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,183
How did you get in?

116
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:07,069
There. Through the window.

117
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:08,417
Through the window?

118
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,251
How did you come up here?

119
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,818
What if something happened to you?

120
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,179
Are you hurt?

121
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:15,482
No biggie.

122
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,051
I can easily climb through a window.

123
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,076
Basic.

124
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,758
No biggie? Basic?

125
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:21,409
Miss, why are you speaking this way?

126
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:22,434
Shh.

127
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,681
Shh.

128
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:26,669
I just want to be unique.

129
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,004
Just keep this between us.

130
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:31,374
It's our secret. Okay?

131
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,856
Miss-- Miss, you can't be there!

132
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:35,162
- You can't be there!
- Huh?

133
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,781
Miss, why are you here?

134
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:41,314
My father might catch us.

135
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,418
Also, how did you leave your home?

136
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:45,570
I'm sure Don Alejandro
wouldn't have permitted you.

137
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,027
Chill.

138
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:48,509
Just chill.

139
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:53,250
First of all, there's something
important I have to tell you. And...

140
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,712
And... secondly...

141
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:56,689
Don't worry.

142
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,025
My father won't catch me

143
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,593
because I'm quite good at this.

144
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:01,139
And thirdly...

145
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:03,973
You know what they say.

146
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,939
"If you want it,
there's always a way."

147
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,477
So that's why I found a
way to get out of the house.

148
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,398
Miss, I still don't understand

149
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,983
what you're doing here?

150
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:16,486
Juanito.

151
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,158
Oh, right. I shouldn't
touch him without reason.

152
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:28,956
Long hair suits you
very well, dear sister.

153
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,316
Do you remember?

154
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,797
You and Carmelita always
have the same hairstyle.

155
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:39,452
We have many similarities
when we were younger.

156
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,044
But you're not children anymore.

157
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,567
You cannot share
every single thing.

158
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,668
Especially when it comes to love.

159
00:12:56,066 --> 00:13:00,002
And to the man you wish
to be your husband.

160
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:04,154
Miss,

161
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,959
what is this urgent
thing you mean to tell me

162
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,483
that couldn't wait tomorrow?

163
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,997
You really need to know this.

164
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,371
I don't want to waste
time as well. Besides…

165
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,211
I still couldn't sleep.
It's too early.

166
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:22,497
My back hurts from climbing the window.

167
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,753
Oh, wait. People here are conservative!

168
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:28,920
He might think I'm seducing him.

169
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,849
I'm a bit drunk,

170
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,501
that's why I'm impulsive.

171
00:13:36,144 --> 00:13:37,641
You don't smell like liquor.

172
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:43,173
OMG! Why did he smell me?
I haven't bathed yet! So embarrassing!

173
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,074
You read Noli Me Tangere too, huh?

174
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,485
Miss Carmelita,

175
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:50,653
what is it you wanna tell me?

176
00:13:52,618 --> 00:13:54,401
Carmelita promised me.

177
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,993
That she will not push
through with the wedding.

178
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,716
And you believed her?

179
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,261
Carmelita is my friend.

180
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,189
How can you be sure
of your friend's promise?

181
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,819
Promises are easily broken.

182
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,321
Or forgotten.

183
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:31,493
But there's a thing that isn't
easily broken or forgotten.

184
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,704
What is it you're thinking of?

185
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,937
I will write to Leandro.

186
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,063
I also know that you don't want
this wedding to push through, right?

187
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,645
Let's help each other.

188
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:01,938
And how can you be sure that
this wedding is against my wishes?

189
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,946
Your heart belongs to Helena, right?

190
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:08,254
I will help you out.

191
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:10,285
Helena is in love with you.

192
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,961
This wedding is important
to both our families.

193
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:16,209
I do not want to go against my father
and neither should you.

194
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,548
You mustn't go against him.

195
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:23,585
How about your heart?

196
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:25,682
And how about your dreams?

197
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:29,194
You're just gonna let other people
dictate the course of your life?

198
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:33,265
You're Helena's crush, and
you have a crush on Helena.

199
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,290
You like each other.

200
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:36,359
I don't want to go between you.

201
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:37,861
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:40,904
All I'm saying is that

203
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:44,788
we should avoid situations
we don't want to be in.

204
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:48,442
I know for sure Helena likes you.

205
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:52,065
And I don't want our friendship
to end just because of a guy.

206
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:55,679
What's the reason

207
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,481
why you don't want
this wedding to happen?

208
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:04,507
Hello? I can't tell him that he'll die
if our wedding pushes through.

209
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:05,822
Just so!

210
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,265
I don't want to be
controlled by other people.

211
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,639
Your principles are important to
you, so it seems, Miss Carmelita.

212
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:18,491
Just don't worry anymore, okay?

213
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:20,036
I will help you and Helena.

214
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,058
On one condition.

215
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,158
Promise me,
no matter what happens,

216
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,380
you'll survive.

217
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:37,027
He needs to survive for me
to accomplish my mission.

218
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,332
Juanito!

219
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,708
Juanito!

220
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:45,347
Angelito!

221
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:49,732
Miss!

222
00:16:54,494 --> 00:16:55,781
- Miss!
- Shush!

223
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,578
Run! Just run!

224
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,901
What are you doing here?

225
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,273
I just want to ask you to tutor me.

226
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,364
How about them?
Why are they here?

227
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,740
Did something happen last night,
Carmelita?

228
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:26,262
Huh?

229
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,214
You're in such a good mood,
you even cooked breakfast.

230
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,931
You're really preparing
for a married life.

231
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,257
It's different once a person falls in love.

232
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:39,713
It's different if a person
has no other choice.

233
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,186
Carmelita, we still haven't prayed.

234
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:49,172
That's right. I noticed they
always pray before meals.

235
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:59,628
Bless us, O Lord, this food
we are about to receive,

236
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,205
and those who prepared it...

237
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:04,601
Amen.

238
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:09,603
I envy Carmelita's family.

239
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:13,510
Dad, Jenny, Emily and I
don't pray before meals.

240
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:18,395
We don't even eat together
because Dad leaves early

241
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:20,599
and does overtime at night.

242
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:25,351
On times we do eat together,
we're all glued to our phones.

243
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:35,888
Carmelita, isn't this what
you like to eat for breakfast?

244
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:41,197
As far as I know, we
don't eat this for breakfast.

245
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:46,521
It's usually cereal, pancake,
toasted bread, bacon and eggs.

246
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:48,614
- Here you go.
- Carmelita.

247
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:50,582
Your coffee's getting cold.

248
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:54,424
I noticed you haven't
been drinking coffee lately.

249
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:58,470
It's because I don't drink black coffee.

250
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:00,756
I just forgot about it, Father.

251
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,934
Salted egg?

252
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:08,869
I'm sure Carmelita will eat
them all. That's her favorite!

253
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,323
Ew. I've never tried
this in my whole life.

254
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:16,261
Carmelita and I
are total opposites.

255
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,157
Here you go.

256
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:25,323
Don't you have an appetite, Carmelita?

257
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:26,912
I do.

258
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,550
Hmm.

259
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:38,735
Not bad!

260
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,880
It's surprisingly delicious!

261
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:42,776
Good morning,
Don Alejandro, Doña Soledad.

262
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:44,348
- Good morning.
- Ladies.

263
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:45,851
Miss Carmelita.

264
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:52,153
Oh no! Why is he here?
Is he ratting me out?

265
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,638
Juanito, dear boy. What can you
say about Carmelita's kaldereta?

266
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,529
It's like no other.

267
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,485
Huh? Josefina helped me
in cooking this.

268
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,294
You know, Juanito.

269
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:21,204
Carmelita is naturally
a fine, respectable lady.

270
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,119
She never disobeyed her father.

271
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:30,347
Juanito.

272
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,107
Run! Just run!

273
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:46,206
It is true that Miss Carmelita
is a gentle and desirable lady.

274
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:50,098
She also likes reading
books and sewing.

275
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,460
She is also quite
adept at house work.

276
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,530
And she never complains to anyone.

277
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:05,307
Carmelita, after eating you must
show Juanito around the hacienda.

278
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:20,401
This guy charmed my family.

279
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:26,171
How are you feeling?

280
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,373
May I check your condition?

281
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,861
Is that why you brought me here?

282
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,153
Because you thought I got injured
from climbing your window?

283
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,921
My God, come on.
That's nothing to me.

284
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:42,045
And in case I got injured,
why would you bother to check?

285
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:49,507
If you haven't realized from the books
you saw on my room...

286
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,340
I am a student of medicine.

287
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:56,379
So, this jerk is a medical student, huh?

288
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:58,400
Oh, really. That's nice.

289
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,905
Wait, why would I respond that way?

290
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:06,412
Carmelita would look
clueless about the world.

291
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,150
Where are we going, by the way?

292
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:14,975
Why, you don't like it here?
Would you prefer the Lake of Tears?

293
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,960
Oh, no. That lake has a bad story.

294
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,670
Huh?

295
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,923
There's an elder

296
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,093
who told the story of a
brokenhearted woman

297
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,262
who once cried there unconsolably...

298
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:29,180
Until the moment of her death.

299
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:33,487
All the tears she had shed
filled the Lake of Tears.

300
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:34,536
It is saddening

301
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,748
that the story of that lake became reality
when Carmelita drowned herself in there.

302
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,341
I will make sure from now on

303
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:45,655
that no other woman
will die in that lake from now on.

304
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:50,088
I will make sure that Carmelita
won't suffer the same fate...

305
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:52,193
because of you, Juanito.

306
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:55,935
You seem quite
absorbed in your thoughts.

307
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,186
Have you been in love as well?

308
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,749
You're used to get whatever you want.

309
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:08,849
You don't care if anyone gets hurt.

310
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:14,942
I apologize if you
don't want to share.

311
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:16,230
I do not mind.

312
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,182
Let's just say,

313
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,616
I have bad luck in love.

314
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:28,683
Of all the boys in the world...

315
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,855
I just had to give
my heart to him.

316
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,290
There's no such thing
as bad luck in love.

317
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:40,919
And there's no wrong person to love.

318
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:46,777
Maybe the timing wasn't just right...

319
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,228
When you fell in love.

320
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:55,326
Or maybe we're
just not meant to be.

321
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,728
Where is he right now?

322
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:04,672
Maybe he's thinking that my first love
is just in the next village, or city.

323
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,780
He's somewhere far away.

324
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,552
No one can ever come there.

325
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,309
I'm not even sure if
I will see him again.

326
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,872
I didn't even get to
say that I like him.

327
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,726
I'm sure...

328
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,626
that even if you weren't able to say it,
he knows what you feel.

329
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:28,179
And deep in his heart...

330
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,538
You're the one it belongs to.

331
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:37,909
If only Juanito knew

332
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,006
that I'm talking about
James from the future.

333
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,065
But in fairness, I feel better
because of what he said.

334
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:53,158
Is there anything I can
do to make you feel better?

335
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:56,693
What's happening? My heart beat...

336
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,494
Not for me.

337
00:25:04,122 --> 00:25:06,624
For my friend, Helena.

338
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,549
I want you to get closer.

339
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,593
How did you two meet?

340
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,419
We write letters.

341
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,185
What did you like about her?

342
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:24,130
Why does it seems like
Helena is more important to you?

343
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,609
Is our wedding not your priority?

344
00:25:28,171 --> 00:25:29,674
How about the wishes of your family?

345
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,322
Come on,

346
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:36,085
we can just ignore
what our parents want.

347
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:38,751
Don't tell me

348
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,597
you're just blindly following
your parents' orders all your life?

349
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,237
How about what you want?

350
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,128
Do you even like medicine?

351
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:48,639
Nothing else?

352
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,060
You don't find joy in anything else?

353
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,591
What are you good at?

354
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,747
I like painting.

355
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,931
- Oh?
- And drawing.

356
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,368
See? Then do that.

357
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,902
That's what will make you happy.

358
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,452
Why don't you paint me?

359
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,070
That'll be cool.

360
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,242
Don't you think?

361
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:30,575
Thank you for accepting
my invitation to stroll around.

362
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:35,359
No worries, I enjoyed...

363
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:38,652
It made me glad too.
The air's fresh.

364
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:42,174
By the way...

365
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:48,312
Is this for me?

366
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,377
A letter. For Helena.

367
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:53,877
I'm hoping she can receive it.

368
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,230
Alright. I'll handle it.

369
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,100
I'll be going then, Miss.

370
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:14,739
Miss, Dona Soledad
is looking for you.

371
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,587
She said you're going to be
doing embroidery with your sisters.

372
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Is that so?

373
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:22,464
Can you give this to Helena?

374
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,127
I got it.

375
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:25,381
Thank you.

376
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:48,239
Oh!

377
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:54,131
Thank you very much, Carmelita!

378
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,919
Please forgive me for misunderstanding.

379
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,971
Now I see your true intentions.

380
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:03,497
Thank you.

381
00:28:03,838 --> 00:28:05,297
Don't you worry about it.

382
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:07,200
As long as you and Juanito are happy.

383
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:11,834
Good thing the
misunderstanding was cleared.

384
00:28:11,914 --> 00:28:14,991
I don't want to ruin her
friendship with Carmelita.

385
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:20,447
Here's my reply to
Juanito's letter yesterday.

386
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:25,292
I'll be going now.

387
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:27,631
Helena.

388
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,394
Can we chat even for a little bit?

389
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:32,679
There's just some things I want to ask.

390
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:35,088
Like what?

391
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:38,174
Like... your interests?

392
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:41,232
- What?
- Oh, right.

393
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:43,401
Helena and
Carmelita are best of friends.

394
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:45,714
She might be confused
why I'm asking.

395
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,519
Well, uh...

396
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,898
I forgot about a few things and
also I want to pass it on to Juanito.

397
00:29:01,777 --> 00:29:03,116
Carmelita, my dear child.

398
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,027
Married life is not easy.

399
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:10,146
In a few months,
you'll be a wife.

400
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:15,822
And we don't know, maybe soon you
and Juanito will be blessed with child.

401
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:22,045
Juanito has almost completed
his study of medicine.

402
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:26,631
And I'm sure he'll be busy with his job.

403
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:31,060
And you will be busy
with your tasks at home.

404
00:29:33,193 --> 00:29:37,405
You will cook, shop,
clean the house.

405
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,071
And you will be taking
care of your children.

406
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,847
And you will also bring
pleasure to your husband.

407
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:50,331
Bring pleasure? Am I
really ready for all of this?

408
00:29:50,878 --> 00:29:53,943
That's why I'm going to
teach you as early as now.

409
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:58,812
I noticed that you haven't
been yourself lately.

410
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:05,165
Does she know that I
am not really Carmelita?

411
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,432
Good day, Dona Soledad.

412
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:11,017
Miss Carmelita.

413
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,876
Why are you here?

414
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:15,617
Good day to you as well, Juanito.

415
00:30:16,175 --> 00:30:18,677
I am glad to see you here today.

416
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,085
When I visited your home,

417
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,613
I was informed that
you will be here in town.

418
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,135
I do not have anything
important to do today,

419
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,596
that is why I've decided
to accompany you.

420
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,287
If you would allow me.

421
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:34,795
You didn't need to be here.

422
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,349
I wanted to see you and
spend time with you, Miss.

423
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:41,481
There he goes again.

424
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,508
My heart is beating so fast.

425
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,031
Am I feeling nervous, or what?

426
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:46,968
Very well.

427
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,821
Juanito, Carmelita, I
will do my shopping now.

428
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:51,328
I will leave the two of you.

429
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:53,334
Do not worry, Dona Soledad.

430
00:30:53,543 --> 00:30:55,647
I'll take good care of your daughter.

431
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,689
Don't call me Dona anymore.

432
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:03,016
I think it would be better
if you would just call me...

433
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:04,329
"mother."

434
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,323
From now on.

435
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:10,605
Yes, mother.

436
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:14,610
I'll be going then.

437
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:20,265
What's wrong with you?

438
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:23,589
You shouldn’t be cozying up to my family!

439
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,935
It's going to be difficult
to cancel the wedding.

440
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,596
I'm just making most of
my time as your fiance.

441
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:36,239
Huh? Fiance? Am I
really his girlfriend?

442
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:38,446
Oh?

443
00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:40,541
Why are you staring like that?

444
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:43,702
Haven't you realized

445
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,362
that when a man and woman
are arranged to wed,

446
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:48,870
they are actually
engaged to each other?

447
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,411
Miss?

448
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:54,676
Are you alright?

449
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,708
Mother wouldn't mind

450
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:00,931
if I take you for the day.

451
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:08,259
Help! This isn't part of the plan.
I shouldn't be falling for Juanito.

452
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:12,439
Miss? Are you alright?

453
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:17,804
Just focus on your mission, Carmela.

454
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:20,645
Oh!

455
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:24,005
These accessories are beautiful!

456
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,403
Accessories?

457
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,247
What do women like these days?

458
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:35,282
Oh... For Helena, right?

459
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:40,516
Helena likes red roses.

460
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:44,587
She likes reading, embroidery,
and generally being affectionate.

461
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,590
Good thing I interviewed Helena last time.

462
00:32:54,993 --> 00:32:57,052
What can you say
about this necklace?

463
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:06,707
My grandmother gave it to me.

464
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,677
She said I should give it to the
woman I'm ready to give my heart to...

465
00:33:12,232 --> 00:33:13,634
Without second thoughts.

466
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,371
Is this real gold?

467
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:20,997
Are you serious?

468
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,666
Wow.

469
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,240
How about you, Miss Carmelita?

470
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:31,121
What kind of gift do you like?

471
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,677
Hmm...

472
00:33:34,904 --> 00:33:36,504
I like things that are made with effort.

473
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,467
Nothing that can be
bought or acquire easily.

474
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:45,345
That's tough.

475
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:48,081
Of course.

476
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:50,232
I'm not easily appeased.

477
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:53,971
Good day, Mr. Juanito.

478
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,275
I'm glad to see you here.

479
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:58,703
Good day to you as well, Trinidad.

480
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:00,476
How are you?

481
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:02,719
I'm doing good, Sir.

482
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:06,080
Excuse me for asking, Mr. Juanito.

483
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:07,875
But I just want to know

484
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,547
if the lady you're with

485
00:34:09,572 --> 00:34:12,241
is the youngest daughter of
Don Alejandro Montecarlos?

486
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,675
Yes.

487
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,801
She's Miss Carmelita Montecarlos.

488
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,894
I am pleased to meet you, Miss Carmelita.

489
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:23,572
Now, I can surely say
that what they've been saying is true.

490
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,934
That you possess such a
stunningly beautiful face.

491
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:29,121
Gee, thanks.

492
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,111
Thank you.

493
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,154
Miss,

494
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:34,971
if you would allow me...

495
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:38,439
I want to make use of this moment.

496
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,455
To ask you a favor.

497
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:42,506
From me?

498
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,683
What do you need?

499
00:34:44,974 --> 00:34:47,894
I just want you to ask your father

500
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,880
if it's possible to keep the
price of rent from rising...

501
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,078
For the workers of your plantation.

502
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:57,421
My husband's meager salary
wouldn't be able to afford it.

503
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:59,764
He is one of your many workers.

504
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:01,490
Wait, what?

505
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:04,143
Is Don Alejandro oppressing his workers?

506
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,605
Sure. I'll let Father know.

507
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,225
Thank you so much, Miss.

508
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:12,127
You are a blessing from Heaven.

509
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:15,382
Have you chosen anything, Miss?

510
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,411
If you would ask me, Miss...

511
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,122
I think this will suit you.

512
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:32,496
Seriously? I would look
like a household ornament.

513
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,758
I'm sure it'll look good on her, Sir.

514
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:39,317
I will buy this. For her.

515
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:48,729
And if you would allow it...

516
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,983
I want you to take this
as a token of gratitude

517
00:35:53,008 --> 00:35:54,885
for visiting our humble town.

518
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:57,784
And for passing on our
request to your father.

519
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,825
Thank you.

520
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:05,088
Thank you as well, Miss.

521
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:20,949
Here's the letter.

522
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,348
Is this from Helena?

523
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,567
You don't believe me?

524
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,246
What I'm doing here is volunteer work.

525
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,357
I don't get anything
from the two of them.

526
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,901
I should charge delivery fee next time.

527
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,112
Thank you.

528
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,528
Good afternoon, Don Alejandro.

529
00:36:45,397 --> 00:36:46,940
The sun is setting, dear boy.

530
00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:51,977
I'll be going then, Don Alejandro.

531
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,295
Miss Carmelita.

532
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,260
Alright. Take care on your way home.

533
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:04,388
Maybe Don Alejandro is thinking
we're passing love letters to each other.

534
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,588
Father?

535
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,536
May I talk to you?

536
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:44,697
What is it, dear? Sit down.

537
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:56,903
Earlier, in the other town...

538
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:59,926
A merchant talked to me.

539
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:04,764
She asked to pass
on a request to you.

540
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:11,138
If it's possible not to raise the
price of rent for our workers.

541
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,751
Who said this to you?

542
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:22,931
It is important to listen and
respond to the woes of our workers.

543
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,263
It was Trinidad
from the other town.

544
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:34,036
I am glad that you care for
the welfare of our workers.

545
00:38:34,892 --> 00:38:35,892
Very well...

546
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:39,846
I will cut their rent next week.

547
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,698
Thank you, Father.

548
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,781
Miss.

549
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,285
This is from Miss Helena.

550
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:27,598
It's in Spanish? I don't understand this.

551
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:30,987
What's written in the letter, Miss?

552
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,596
A poem.

553
00:40:34,322 --> 00:40:36,073
What is it about?

554
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,470
Uh...

555
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,604
A poem about love.

556
00:40:40,629 --> 00:40:44,091
She's asking to edit her...

557
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:46,538
To revise her poem.

558
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:02,858
It's early to sleep.

559
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:09,557
In fairness, I'm getting used
to sleeping early. It's fine.

560
00:41:12,308 --> 00:41:13,976
- Carmelita.
- Oh?

561
00:41:14,497 --> 00:41:16,311
What are you still doing here?

562
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:19,072
We are going somewhere important.

563
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,644
Where are we going?

564
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:24,571
Didn't you receive the
letter Helena sent you?

565
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:39,246
There. That's the
invitation for her birthday.

566
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:41,802
You don't have any plan to attend?

567
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:46,866
What? I didn't know
it was an invitation.

568
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:50,132
You'll go, understand?

569
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,352
What's your gift to Helena?

570
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,184
I'll just give this
to her as my gift.

571
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:35,535
This party is crazy!

572
00:42:35,668 --> 00:42:37,735
She really prepared for her birthday.

573
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:41,429
But it's so boring, there's
not even any drinks.

574
00:43:34,856 --> 00:43:37,994
Miss, do you wish to change
how we first met?

575
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,826
Can I ask for your name?

576
00:43:40,948 --> 00:43:42,408
Perhaps this is

577
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,441
as beautiful as the
light of the moon.

578
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:46,173
Why does Juanito have to tell me

579
00:43:46,198 --> 00:43:47,771
that they are going out on a date?

580
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,437
I have an information

581
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:53,378
that Eduardo is going to
serenade Maria later at night

582
00:43:56,112 --> 00:43:58,072
Juanito will be playing the guitar

583
00:43:58,097 --> 00:43:59,724
and Ignacio will also come.

584
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:04,918
Juanito.

585
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,877
Since we're already here,

586
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:10,205
you can also serenade Helena.

587
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,065
Did I heard that right?

588
00:44:12,357 --> 00:44:14,067
A song for Helena?

589
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,716
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

590
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:19,619
I'm planning to make
our relationship official.

591
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:23,160
Is this what you're looking for?

592
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,786
Oh yes, This is it!

593
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:26,330
Seven months has
already passed since I left.

594
00:44:26,355 --> 00:44:27,603
But it seems like,

595
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,151
you've already
forgotten about me.

596
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,333
Leandro.

597
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,837
Since when did you comeback
to San Alfonso?
