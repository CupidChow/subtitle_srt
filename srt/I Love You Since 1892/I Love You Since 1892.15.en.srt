1
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:47,724
I have no time for this!

2
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:48,909
Get out!

3
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,332
Father, have mercy...

4
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:59,110
I can't bear
to lose this child

5
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,653
in my womb, Father.

6
00:01:00,653 --> 00:01:02,363
You will have
that child aborted.

7
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:05,892
And you will marry
Gobernadorcillo Flores!

8
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,225
Father!

9
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,474
Father, I beg you!

10
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:12,044
I'm ready to marry Leandro.

11
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,785
They didn't mean
for it to happen,

12
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:16,053
so just let them be!

13
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:18,831
Father ordered to have
Mr. Raul killed.

14
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:20,583
I'll take you away, Carmelita.

15
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:24,628
Will you really not stop

16
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:25,713
with this nonsense?!

17
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:28,132
Eduardo!

18
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:31,218
Farewell to you,

19
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:34,305
Juanito Alfonso.

20
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:57,698
It's all my fault.

21
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,002
It's all my fault.

22
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:17,893
If not for me, Juanito
would still be alive.

23
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:20,304
I'm to blame...

24
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:31,218
If only I hadn’t fallen
in love with Juanito.

25
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,403
It's my fault.

26
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,826
Everything's my fault.

27
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,035
Get out!

28
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:47,848
I don't want it!

29
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,042
I'm not hungry!

30
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:52,176
I said get out!

31
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:56,465
It's me, Carmela.

32
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:01,345
Mother Olivia?

33
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:03,818
Mother...

34
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:15,870
How did you get in here?

35
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:19,113
The guards are strict, aren't they?

36
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:25,113
Doña Soledad helped me get in.

37
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:26,265
Don't worry.

38
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:34,503
Carmela, dear.

39
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,409
I was suddenly awoken last night.

40
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:43,061
I know something bad happened.

41
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:52,896
Juanito is dead.

42
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:55,824
I'm sorry.

43
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:10,774
Mother Olivia?

44
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,170
I can feel it...

45
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,784
Juanito is still alive.

46
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:25,193
What?

47
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,989
Where is the diary?

48
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:33,154
Here.

49
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,260
The moment this diary burst into flames

50
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,518
and turns to ash...

51
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,971
That would be the sign

52
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,692
that you failed your mission.

53
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,440
To save Juanito.

54
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:43,147
Every page of this diary,

55
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:48,022
contains your story with Juanito.

56
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:54,069
His brush with death...

57
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:58,240
Caused these burns.

58
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,743
In these pages of the diary.

59
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:08,792
Is it because the diary is still intact?

60
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:12,963
Does that mean Juanito's still alive?

61
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:20,304
Juanito is still alive?

62
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:28,145
I want to tell him I love him.

63
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,356
Mother Olivia.

64
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:34,735
No matter where he is, I
want to tell him I love him.

65
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:40,741
But Carmela...

66
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,577
You must remember.

67
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:47,915
If you fail your mission...

68
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,088
You won't be able to
return to your own time.

69
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,661
Your father sent Maria to Laguna.

70
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:30,290
And you're still here because
your wedding to Leandro

71
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,416
is set by the end of the month.

72
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:36,713
How about Josefina?

73
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:40,884
She's also locked in her room.

74
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:43,929
Your father discovered

75
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:47,474
she also helped Mr. Raul escape.

76
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:53,883
My dear...

77
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,610
I just want to know.

78
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,989
Why did you plan to elope with Juanito?

79
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:04,908
But before,

80
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:07,452
you were adamant not to get married to him.

81
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,417
I can feel you're also in love.

82
00:10:14,543 --> 00:10:16,086
Even though you won't admit it.

83
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,924
It's such a shame that all these happened.

84
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,803
So much pain and conflict.

85
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:33,625
There...

86
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:35,606
There are things.

87
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:39,568
Things that cannot stay with us.

88
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:44,281
Let Juanito go.

89
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,485
You're just gonna make
things hard for each other.

90
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,580
He's just gonna suffer more.

91
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,668
Because your father will not
allow you to end up with him.

92
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,041
My daughter.

93
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,725
I know that only someone who loves truly
can do this sacrifice.

94
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,035
You should rest.

95
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:04,319
W-what are you doing here?

96
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,363
I need to return to my room.

97
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:07,572
There's bad news.

98
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:11,493
Theresita is here in
San Alfonso with Sonya.

99
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:12,160
What?

100
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:15,539
She wants to plead for Ignacio's case.

101
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:18,417
Wait. We have to stop her.

102
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,711
If the officials see her,

103
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,587
her life will be in danger.

104
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:31,129
I'm sorry but they didn't
know that Miss Sonya escaped.

105
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:32,556
Please let my husband go.

106
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,851
I swear we won't cause any more trouble.

107
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:37,728
We won't show our faces here.

108
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:40,814
Ignacio is all that's left of their family.

109
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,607
Anything.

110
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:46,028
I'll do anything just let him go, please.

111
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,613
There is only one way

112
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:49,865
for you to be with your husband.

113
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:52,242
And that is death.

114
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:56,680
Don't you people have hearts?

115
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:58,874
You're laughing while
another person is suffering?

116
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:00,561
Carmelita!

117
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,216
Please excuse my daughter's action.

118
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,320
Don Alejandro,

119
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:14,139
as the second-in-command
here in San Alfonso,

120
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:15,772
what is your judgment?

121
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:20,729
Just put her in prison.

122
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:23,398
Let us wait for the
Gobernadorcillo's return.

123
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:24,991
Sonya!

124
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:34,034
Carmelita...

125
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,975
If something happens to me...

126
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:43,001
Please tell my brothers I
apologize for leaving them behind.

127
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,419
And tell Ignacio,

128
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:47,422
that my love for him
will stay forever true.

129
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:50,891
What would people say?

130
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:53,804
That you gave consideration
to the people you know?

131
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:59,717
It's not gonna help us
if we execute a pregnant woman in public.

132
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,020
That is why I instructed General Seleno

133
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:06,066
to give whatever her punishment is.

134
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,150
In secret!

135
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:33,819
Sonya!

136
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:35,070
Sonya!

137
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:36,596
Wait, I need to see Sonya!

138
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:37,848
What did you do to her?!

139
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:39,558
Sonya!

140
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:41,827
- Sonya!
- I told you not to insist.

141
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:43,004
Just stay there!

142
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,551
Sonya!

143
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:46,248
Sonya!

144
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:47,023
Sonya?

145
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:48,024
Wait... wait...

146
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:49,386
Wait!

147
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:50,902
Wait!

148
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,238
Sonya?

149
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:54,926
Sonya!

150
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,004
Sonya.

151
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:01,113
Sonya.

152
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:02,480
Sonya.

153
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:10,172
Sonya!

154
00:15:16,344 --> 00:15:18,160
Sonya!

155
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:19,964
Sonya!

156
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:28,482
Sonya!

157
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:35,465
I'm sure Sonya is happy
and at peace in the afterlife.

158
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,136
Far from the suffering she
experienced in this world.

159
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,870
We will be praying at the plaza later.

160
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:14,796
May I borrow the rosary that
Aunt Rosario gave you before?

161
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:20,010
I want to use it as I
lead the prayer later.

162
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:23,315
Wait a moment.

163
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:33,823
Is this the one?

164
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:45,831
Here.

165
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:53,058
Thank you.

166
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:55,754
Don't take it back, okay?

167
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,859
Ever since Sonya died,

168
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:20,445
I haven't talked to Don Alejandro.

169
00:18:20,945 --> 00:18:23,907
I just chose to keep quiet and ignore him.

170
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:28,411
Carmelita, dear.

171
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:34,417
Do you remember the story
of your Father's ancestors?

172
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:39,732
Don Patricio Montecarlos

173
00:18:39,964 --> 00:18:42,884
was a pure Spanish settler from Spain.

174
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:47,389
He lived here in 1684.

175
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:51,267
He married a farmer's daughter.

176
00:18:51,267 --> 00:18:52,560
Felicidad.

177
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:56,064
He bought so many land here.

178
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:59,192
And established lots of businesses.

179
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:02,112
Rice, wheat,

180
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:05,824
and several animal farms.

181
00:19:06,658 --> 00:19:09,661
That is why the Montecarlos clan was known

182
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:13,957
as the richest in San
Alfonso for centuries.

183
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:21,673
What would Don Patricio
and Doña Felicidad feel

184
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:25,885
if they knew their descendant
turned out to be a horrible person?

185
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,222
Come on, let's head to the plaza.

186
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:32,392
- Josefina might be waiting for us.
- Don Alejandro! Don Alejandro!

187
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:35,979
The rebels attacked the plaza!

188
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:37,897
Miss Josefina was stabbed.

189
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:38,857
She's in critical condition.

190
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:41,167
- What? What happened to my daughter?!
- Who's responsible for this?!

191
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,527
What happened to...

192
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,488
He was the one who attacked your daughter.

193
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:49,380
Animal! You shameless wretch!

194
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,032
Degenerate!

195
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:55,623
Don Alejandro! That's enough!

196
00:19:58,126 --> 00:20:00,503
We need this rebel alive!

197
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:03,590
So that we can catch the others.

198
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:07,970
Answer me!

199
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:10,930
Who's the mastermind behind all of this?

200
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:14,976
Are you from Catapang's rebel group?

201
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:17,395
I said speak!

202
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:20,690
Or would you prefer to have this bullet
bored into your brain?

203
00:20:21,316 --> 00:20:22,330
What?!

204
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:26,112
Remove his shirt!

205
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,627
Now,

206
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:42,170
answer our questions!

207
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:48,551
What is the purpose of this attack?

208
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:50,762
Where is your base?

209
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:59,854
Catapang is our leader.

210
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,244
But...

211
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:04,572
The mastermind behind all this..

212
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:06,736
Who also planned

213
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:09,364
the murder of Josefina.

214
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:17,330
Was Juanito Alfonso.

215
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:19,374
The son

216
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,254
of the late Gobernadorcillo.

217
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,850
After Juanito learned
what happened to Sonya...

218
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,812
He came up with the plan.

219
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,566
In order to bring justice

220
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:46,651
for our families.

221
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:50,154
Whom you murdered and tortured!

222
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:55,994
Don Alejandro!

223
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,246
Heneral Seleno!

224
00:21:59,205 --> 00:22:01,833
The rebels also attacked the prison.

225
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,294
They broke out Ignacio and Eduardo.

226
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:07,255
I knew it!

227
00:22:07,672 --> 00:22:09,007
The attack at the plaza

228
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:10,592
was a diversion

229
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,277
so that you can raid the prison!

230
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:17,849
Look at what you've done, Carmelita!

231
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,935
You helped this scum escape!

232
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:23,980
You gave them the
chance to hurt your sister!

233
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:46,169
The stab wound in her abdomen is deep.

234
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:49,756
Her liver was badly injured.

235
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,801
She also lost a lot of blood.

236
00:22:55,428 --> 00:23:03,228
She needs to stay here for
her medication and recovery.

237
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:16,950
Fight.

238
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:20,064
Don't leave us.

239
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:37,804
You're here with me?

240
00:23:57,907 --> 00:23:59,283
Don't you worry.

241
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:02,244
I promise.

242
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,251
I will not leave you.

243
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:12,922
That's a promise, okay?

244
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:16,503
I will not forget it.

245
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:01,971
The doctor said Josefina's
condition is getting better.

246
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,266
Maybe she can be discharged
the day after tomorrow.

247
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:09,687
Good thing Josefina's
condition is better now.

248
00:25:10,271 --> 00:25:13,483
I am more at ease now.

249
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:15,526
Because nothing bad happened to you.

250
00:25:17,028 --> 00:25:18,988
I wouldn't be able to forgive myself...

251
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:21,199
If something like that happened to you.

252
00:25:23,951 --> 00:25:24,911
Go on and eat.

253
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:26,370
I cooked some Caldereta.

254
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:30,917
I am sure

255
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,919
that what my beloved made is delicious.

256
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:36,964
If this is what

257
00:25:36,964 --> 00:25:40,009
awaits me at the dinner table
every day and every night...

258
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:43,011
I bet I wouldn't leave the house anymore.

259
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,938
Come on, Carmelita.

260
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:53,480
Eat with me.

261
00:25:55,691 --> 00:25:56,776
I don't have any appetite.

262
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:04,242
Do you know?

263
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,162
Every time I'm going through something...

264
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:12,250
And when I'm mourning the
deaths of my fellow soldiers...

265
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,585
I always think.

266
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,630
What if this is my last day?

267
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:20,675
That's also how I think every time I eat.

268
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:23,010
Even though the food's not to my taste.

269
00:26:23,302 --> 00:26:24,887
I still try to eat.

270
00:26:25,638 --> 00:26:26,722
Because what if

271
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:30,017
that breakfast, lunch, or dinner...

272
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:31,894
Would be my last meal.

273
00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:34,814
I believe

274
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,150
that we have to give importance to food.

275
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:38,776
And to the chances

276
00:26:38,943 --> 00:26:40,236
that we have something to eat.

277
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:43,072
We are not assured...

278
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:45,950
When would be our last.

279
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:53,654
Alright.

280
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:04,349
Mm!

281
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:13,686
It's too salty!

282
00:27:16,564 --> 00:27:18,149
He doesn't think it's salty?

283
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:30,453
Ah... Leandro?

284
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:32,455
There's other food in the kitchen.

285
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:33,331
Do you want me to get it?

286
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:34,790
I will finish all of this.

287
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,210
My beloved worked hard to cook it.

288
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:41,060
I'm glad that

289
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,787
I was able to make you smile.

290
00:27:45,551 --> 00:27:46,594
Give me your glass.

291
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:47,762
I'll pour you some water.

292
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:49,498
Thank you.

293
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:54,904
Here. You need this.

294
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,033
Is the coffee to your liking?

295
00:28:09,033 --> 00:28:11,827
It's delicious. Very good, Don Alejandro.

296
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:14,455
Tell the cook to wrap two more fishes.

297
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:15,706
I'll take it home.

298
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:16,999
No problem.

299
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,751
We have lots of fishes here.

300
00:28:18,751 --> 00:28:20,378
Here comes the photographer!

301
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,005
Don Alejandro,

302
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,883
it's ready now.

303
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:36,310
When did you marry...

304
00:28:38,312 --> 00:28:39,689
Judge Velario?

305
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:41,232
Isn't he too old for you?

306
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:43,901
He was chosen by those close to me

307
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:45,611
so that no matter what happens...

308
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:47,280
I wouldn't get hurt anymore.

309
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:49,969
Carmelita.

310
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,539
Do I look alright now?

311
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,332
Of course.

312
00:28:58,332 --> 00:29:00,918
You know, the rosary I
gave you really suits you.

313
00:29:02,837 --> 00:29:04,130
Thank you.

314
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:07,216
This rosary carries your love.

315
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:10,181
Very well.

316
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,374
Is everyone ready?

317
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:36,954
I'm sure you look beautiful in our picture.

318
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,043
Mother...

319
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:45,415
Josefina?

320
00:29:46,505 --> 00:29:47,089
Josefina!

321
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:48,424
- Josefina?!
- Josefina!

322
00:29:48,424 --> 00:29:49,930
What's happening to you?!

323
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:51,635
Judge Velario, please call a doctor!

324
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:52,636
Of course. Right away.

325
00:29:54,305 --> 00:29:55,348
- Josefina?
- Call for help!

326
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:57,266
Get a doctor here!

327
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:58,309
Please help us!

328
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:59,368
Josefina?

329
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:00,227
Josefina!

330
00:30:00,227 --> 00:30:01,687
Please help us!

331
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:02,772
Get a damn doctor here now!

332
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:04,607
Josefina, my dear!

333
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:06,192
Wake up, child.

334
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:08,044
Dear...

335
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:09,278
Josefina!

336
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:10,985
- No!
- Josefina!

337
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:15,982
- Josefina! Josefina!
- My child!

338
00:30:16,786 --> 00:30:19,080
Josefina!

339
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,529
Josefina!

340
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:25,836
Josefina!

341
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:27,421
- Josefina!
- Josefina!

342
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:32,676
No, my child! Josefina!

343
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:41,602
Father, excuse me.

344
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:42,618
Child.

345
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:46,829
If...

346
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:49,902
there's one person that is to blame

347
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:52,863
for Josefina's death...

348
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:56,790
It's me.

349
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,290
This is all my fault, Carmelita.

350
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:10,506
I conspired with Gobernadorcillo Flores.

351
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:14,051
to take revenge for
Don Mariano’s belittling...

352
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:20,057
and his desecration of our family.

353
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:26,564
When he called off your wedding to Juanito.

354
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:33,946
I was blinded by rage.

355
00:31:37,158 --> 00:31:39,076
It's true that we tainted his name.

356
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:43,164
And made up stories...

357
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:46,208
That ended up taking his life.

358
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:52,882
We also know Captain
Corpuz is quite powerful.

359
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,925
And also Sergio Alfonso.

360
00:31:59,054 --> 00:32:00,973
That's why they were also targeted.

361
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:08,189
Josefina's life

362
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:11,984
was the price I had to pay
for all my sins towards the Alfonsos!

363
00:32:11,984 --> 00:32:13,087
Father!

364
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,766
Father!

365
00:32:16,864 --> 00:32:18,189
Father, that's enough.

366
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,745
Even then, I did not stop!

367
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:24,704
Father, that's enough.

368
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:29,462
I also took the life of
Sonya who was innocent!

369
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:31,282
Father...

370
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:36,634
Now I don't know what to do, Carmelita.

371
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:37,774
Father...

372
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:40,763
You're my only hope.

373
00:32:45,184 --> 00:32:46,268
Father...

374
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:50,856
Carmelita...

375
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:53,192
Father...

376
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:59,732
You need to marry Leandro.

377
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:05,246
The Montecarlos and Flores
families must become one.

378
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:07,927
If not,

379
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:11,460
all I worked hard for will be for nothing.

380
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:15,089
Our family will lose its protection.

381
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,786
Carmelita...

382
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:20,658
Carmelita...

383
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:30,033
After everything that has happened,

384
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:34,525
in the end, it's still my fault.

385
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:37,611
That's why I should be the one to fix it.

386
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:40,531
It's me who needs to sacrifice.

387
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:52,918
How did that happen!?

388
00:33:54,128 --> 00:33:58,257
The rebels attacked
Mr. Rosalejos' home earlier.

389
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,885
And they left something on your door step.

390
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:06,015
The severed head of Mr. Rosalejos.

391
00:34:19,236 --> 00:34:20,654
From this day on,

392
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,073
I command...

393
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,035
The strict surveillance
of the civil guards...

394
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:28,662
Within the town of San Alfonso.

395
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:32,583
Anyone caught with weapons in their house,

396
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:34,793
and doing suspicious activities,

397
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:36,435
will be arrested.

398
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:39,757
Rebels will be executed.

399
00:34:52,978 --> 00:34:54,647
There are times when
you just have to choose

400
00:34:54,647 --> 00:34:56,315
your mind over your heart.

401
00:34:57,248 --> 00:34:59,693
Because if I follow
my feelings for Juanito,

402
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:03,130
It will only end
badly, for both of us

403
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:04,990
and for my family.

404
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:08,202
And the only way to keep everyone safe

405
00:35:08,227 --> 00:35:10,646
is for me to marry Leandro.

406
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:40,234
Mother Olivia,

407
00:35:40,984 --> 00:35:43,445
isn't it unfair for Carmelita

408
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,239
to wake up one day

409
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:47,491
and find that she's married to Leandro?

410
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:54,957
What Carmelita would
remember once she wakes up...

411
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:58,919
will be the time before she met Juanito.

412
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:01,880
But it will only happen

413
00:36:03,132 --> 00:36:05,175
if you succeed in your mission.

414
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:20,087
Carmelita!

415
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,543
Carmelita!

416
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:24,027
You need to go somewhere safe.

417
00:36:24,027 --> 00:36:25,048
Let's go!

418
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:43,922
Judge Valenciano!

419
00:36:48,427 --> 00:36:52,347
You sentenced my father to
death without enough evidence!

420
00:37:01,482 --> 00:37:01,899
Don't!

421
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:04,443
That will be the basis of your fate!

422
00:37:08,822 --> 00:37:09,990
Die!

423
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,593
You must escape! Quickly!

424
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:30,607
Leandro!

425
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:39,019
Leandro!

426
00:37:45,234 --> 00:37:46,401
You!

427
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:53,116
You were the one who murdered
my helpless wife and child!

428
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:57,862
And you!

429
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,623
On your knees!

430
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:00,707
I'm your friend!

431
00:38:00,707 --> 00:38:01,834
I'm an ally!

432
00:38:02,668 --> 00:38:03,811
Ignacio, don't!

433
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:07,815
I never knew you could betray
my father and Don Mariano!

434
00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:11,179
And you let my wife and child die!

435
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:13,011
Don't... Please...

436
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:16,050
Ignacio, don't!

437
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:17,866
Ignacio!

438
00:38:17,891 --> 00:38:18,901
Hold on!

439
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:56,073
Carmelita, dear.

440
00:39:58,033 --> 00:40:00,410
Thank God, you're alive.

441
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:09,086
How are you feeling?

442
00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:11,470
It was a good thing that

443
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:14,299
the bullet only scraped you.

444
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:19,888
Doctor Hidalgo said

445
00:40:21,473 --> 00:40:23,141
your hearing might not

446
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:26,687
return to normal.

447
00:40:29,648 --> 00:40:32,985
You might get dizzy

448
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:34,903
or hear buzzing in your ear.

449
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:42,819
How's Maria?

450
00:40:58,135 --> 00:40:59,344
My beloved Mother,

451
00:40:59,845 --> 00:41:02,097
I hope you can forgive me for my decision.

452
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:04,766
Don't worry because I know

453
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:06,768
Eduardo will take care of me,

454
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:08,562
and our child.

455
00:41:08,812 --> 00:41:11,023
I ask for your forgiveness.

456
00:41:11,523 --> 00:41:13,859
With love, Maria.

457
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:21,199
I am worried for the state of our family.

458
00:41:24,786 --> 00:41:26,329
There are rumors that it was Maria

459
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:28,957
who gave rebels information.

460
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,919
So that they can attack
during your wedding to Leandro.

461
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:48,435
And Juanito?

462
00:41:52,522 --> 00:41:54,858
He's imprisoned at Fort Santiago.

463
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:58,070
They’re forcing him to reveal

464
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,322
where the rebels are hiding.

465
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:04,144
Mother...

466
00:42:07,162 --> 00:42:10,248
May I see and talk to Juanito?

467
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:15,420
I know what I'm asking
is impossible, but...

468
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,173
But I won't be at peace

469
00:42:19,508 --> 00:42:22,302
if I don't see him at least.

470
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:29,142
Your request is quite difficult, child.

471
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,940
But I will find a way.

472
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,611
I will do everything for you.

473
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,615
Thank you very much.

474
00:43:04,678 --> 00:43:05,762
Miss?

475
00:43:05,787 --> 00:43:06,997
Have some water.

476
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:08,997
Thank you.

477
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,983
Esmeralda.

478
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:21,342
Thank you for helping me.

479
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:24,573
I also would like to apologize

480
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:28,076
for what Josefina and I did

481
00:43:28,076 --> 00:43:29,703
when we let Raul escape.

482
00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:30,871
I am truly sorry.

483
00:43:32,664 --> 00:43:35,792
It is I who needs to apologize, Miss.

484
00:43:36,543 --> 00:43:40,172
Because of me, Mr. Juanito almost died.

485
00:43:41,673 --> 00:43:44,718
And Mr. Ignacio and Eduardo as well.

486
00:44:08,783 --> 00:44:10,035
Carmelita, my dear.

487
00:44:10,952 --> 00:44:13,538
I am grateful and happy.

488
00:44:14,164 --> 00:44:16,416
That you are here by my side.

489
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:27,719
Always remember, my child.

490
00:44:28,428 --> 00:44:31,014
I will forever be thankful

491
00:44:31,014 --> 00:44:32,933
that the Lord blessed me with you.

492
00:44:35,894 --> 00:44:37,520
And I believe,

493
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:41,358
no matter the challenge may come your way,

494
00:44:41,942 --> 00:44:44,361
you will always find a
way to get through it.

495
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,954
Even though Carmelita and I are different,

496
00:44:53,979 --> 00:44:57,023
I learned to love the
people she cares about.

497
00:44:57,499 --> 00:44:59,292
Especially Doña Soledad.

498
00:44:59,793 --> 00:45:02,170
Because of her, I get to have a mom again.

499
00:45:10,762 --> 00:45:13,265
The one you're waiting for has arrived.

500
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:14,838
Alright.

501
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:16,201
Use the backdoor.

502
00:45:16,226 --> 00:45:18,019
Take him to Carmelita's room.

503
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:22,332
Mother,

504
00:45:22,357 --> 00:45:23,984
who is your guest?

505
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:41,918
What are you doing here?

506
00:45:45,338 --> 00:45:46,965
He's here to confess.

507
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:50,010
Something about Juanito.

508
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,514
I will give you
one last chance, Juanito.

509
00:45:54,848 --> 00:45:57,058
Tell me where the rebel base is!

510
00:46:11,406 --> 00:46:13,116
You may go home, Carmelita.

511
00:46:13,825 --> 00:46:15,744
Mother Olivia took the fall.

512
00:46:16,328 --> 00:46:17,351
Because of that...

513
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,873
She was sentenced to death.

514
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,126
Do not worry about me, Carmela.

515
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,128
I have been alive for so long.

516
00:46:25,628 --> 00:46:27,839
Before God even created humans.

517
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,640
- The guards' camp is over there!
- I will not leave you, Juanito!

518
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:32,917
- Please escape, Carmelita!
- I won't leave you!

519
00:46:34,105 --> 00:46:36,031
Thank God I found you.

520
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:37,640
You must get out of here, Miss.

521
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,060
Don't let Mr. Leandro find you.

522
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,070
Why?
