1
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:05,119
7th of March, 1892.

2
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:06,486
Juanito, my love.

3
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:08,279
This should not have happened.

4
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:09,130
Just wait...

5
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:10,712
We will see each other again.

6
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,533
I'm Carmela Isabella.

7
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:15,395
Soon-to-be twenty. Business
Management student.

8
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:16,329
Cool, right?

9
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:18,369
But no. I don't
like any of this.

10
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:19,799
And there must
be actions instead.

11
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:20,832
What the hell?

12
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,752
What is happening there?

13
00:01:22,777 --> 00:01:25,017
And where are you
going, Ms. Isabella?

14
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,631
Student Affairs Office.

15
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:29,817
I thought you and Shae
are no longer friends?

16
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:30,843
And also,

17
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:32,620
Mrs. Falcon called me earlier.

18
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:36,349
She said you and Shae interrupted
your Philippine History class.

19
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:37,374
Carmela...

20
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,702
why can't you be
like your cousins?

21
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:40,645
Look at them!

22
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,910
They're already all successful!

23
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:43,272
You're left behind!

24
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:46,381
I wish you were here, mom.

25
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:48,169
Carmela.

26
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:49,797
Carmela, why did Grandma
look at you that way?

27
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:51,572
Oh my God, Grandma.

28
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:55,535
I didn't know there's a
place like this in this mansion.

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,895
I want you to meet someone.

30
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,778
Okay... I'll admit.

31
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:06,516
Grandma's smile was a bit creepy.

32
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:09,794
But with all
the expensive things in here,

33
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:12,703
I wonder how much
I can sell them for.

34
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,639
She was the youngest
sister of Josefina,

35
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:43,703
who became a nun...

36
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,539
And Maria Montecarlos...

37
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:49,041
my grandmother.

38
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:51,851
So you mean to say,

39
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,697
our family came
from Maria Montecarlos...

40
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,925
I look so much like Carmelita.

41
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,646
Even though she was not
my great-great-grandmother.

42
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,230
It's simple enough.

43
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,708
She was also our ancestor.

44
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:10,390
Blood of our blood.

45
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:13,548
Flesh of our flesh.

46
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:18,096
I studied Genetics in high school.

47
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,055
Yes, we're related.

48
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,873
We share DNA and genes.

49
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:23,373
But is that really it?

50
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:25,497
We look like the same person!

51
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:29,594
She died the same age you are now.

52
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:30,929
What?

53
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,692
Grandma, what happened to her?

54
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,336
She was too blinded by love.

55
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:39,167
That was the reason for
all that happened to her.

56
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:43,912
One hundred and thirty two years.

57
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,790
Destiny had been waiting...

58
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,042
For this to happen.

59
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:52,039
Are you ready to find out...

60
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:55,166
the story behind the painting?

61
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,114
Grandma, isn't it better to include
Jenny and Emily as well?

62
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,660
They also love
hearing stories, you know.

63
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,928
It is not allowed.

64
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,652
No one may ever know about this.

65
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:20,520
Except the eldest
daughters in our family.

66
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,541
Carmelita lived
a quiet and peaceful life.

67
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:32,419
Together with her family…

68
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:37,465
They were the wealthiest in San Alfonso.

69
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:44,431
She was arranged to marry
Juanito by her parents.

70
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:48,654
The son of the Governorcillo.

71
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,824
The Alfonsos were
the most influential family…

72
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:59,578
Governing the town of San Alfonso.

73
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:05,459
Juanito and Carmelita fell
in love with each other.

74
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:11,173
So, the engagement
did not cause any problem.

75
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:16,428
But everything changed when
Juanito was murdered.

76
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:19,306
On the day of their wedding.

77
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:23,769
No one knew why he was killed.

78
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:27,231
And after just one week…

79
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,693
Carmelita took her own life.

80
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:39,243
She drowned herself in the lake.

81
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,770
That was very tragic, Grandma.

82
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,256
Like Romeo and Juliet.

83
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:56,430
When my grandmother told me

84
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,833
about the tragedy
that befell her sister…

85
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,709
We were here in this very room.

86
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,191
In front of that painting.

87
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:17,156
And when I saw
you for the first time…

88
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,934
I thought you were Carmelita.

89
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:25,509
But I know, it wasn't just
coincidence that you look alike.

90
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:29,138
Because you two
were born on the same day.

91
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:36,592
She was born on February 29, 1872.

92
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:38,435
Oh my God!

93
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:43,174
Grandma, my birthday
is February 29, 2004!

94
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:07,081
This was Carmelita's diary.

95
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,699
Read it.

96
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:15,275
So you might understand
their story better.

97
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,537
It was Maria Montecarlos' will

98
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:29,769
to name every eldest daughter
in our family after Carmelita.

99
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,419
She gave that diary
to her daughter,

100
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:37,245
Carmen, who was my mother.

101
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,119
She named me Carmina.

102
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:45,736
And I named my
own daughter, Carmenia.

103
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:48,691
And you were named Carmela.

104
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:56,842
But none of us were born during
the day that only happens every four years.

105
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:04,471
So that's why Carmela is my name.

106
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:10,194
I'm so girly but my name
sounds like an old maid.

107
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:26,952
Our love will be rewritten on
the day of the fourth chance.

108
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Nosebleed.

109
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,331
Nevermind.

110
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,799
"I missed you?"

111
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,266
You two are together anyway.

112
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,389
God, I want to slam
their heads so bad!

113
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:50,809
But you know, since I'm nice,

114
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,311
I'm gonna leave a like.

115
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:06,828
No way!

116
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:11,041
They're having fun while I'm stuck
in this old house full of weird stories

117
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:15,202
and sulking inside a dead girl's
bedroom, who looks just like me.

118
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:17,842
No! I won't allow this!

119
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:36,475
It's time to party!

120
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,585
- There! Just one more!
- Alright…

121
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,197
Just one more left!
Do it! It's sure win!

122
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:47,965
- That's it! One more!
- Here I go!

123
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:52,162
Yes! Scatter! Scatter, babe!

124
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,461
Scatter! Look!

125
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:08,944
Hey, that's Playtime!

126
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,205
Go on, press it!
Maybe you're lucky.

127
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,812
Boom! Winner!

128
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,934
Thank you, miss.

129
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:18,959
Alright…

130
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:33,385
- Hi, ma'am.
- Hi, sir. Do you have vodka?

131
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,972
Sorry, ma'am. We don't have it.
How about a margarita?

132
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,544
- Thank you.
- Alright.

133
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:43,672
Sir, one margarita.

134
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:49,765
Shae needs to know
that I'm having fun too

135
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,096
and my weekend's not boring.

136
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,510
Hi, ma'am. Here's your order.

137
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,535
Thank you.

138
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,368
- I told her.
- Oh, wow. You really told her that?

139
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,936
Yeah, that's why.

140
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:25,583
Her makeup doesn't look good.

141
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:28,860
That girl's makeup looks wrong.

142
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:31,029
Yeah, I want to fix it for her actually.

143
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,490
Want me to tell her?

144
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:36,297
No need.
She might be offended.

145
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:39,746
Don't you worry. I'm here.
I will protect you.

146
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:40,831
- Wow...
- Rawr.

147
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:41,831
Oh, wow.

148
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,207
How's that again?

149
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:49,214
Carms, midterm results are posted!

150
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:53,124
Yes! I got 1.5!

151
00:14:53,264 --> 00:15:00,183
2023-01892.
That's me. 2.75. Shit.

152
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,032
You?

153
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,012
Let's go celebrate. Eat out?

154
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,037
Let's go.

155
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:11,486
- Fishball?
- Sure. Is that what you want?

156
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,511
Yeah.

157
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,290
Dad…

158
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,168
Can I talk to you?

159
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:28,895
Oh. Yes, Carmela.

160
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,460
What do you wanna talk about?

161
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:36,511
It's about my course, actually.

162
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:41,433
Business Management is not for me.

163
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:45,646
Okay.

164
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:51,570
So, what course would
you like to take instead?

165
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:56,281
I don't know.

166
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:00,744
I want to find myself first.

167
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:03,288
Find out what I really want.

168
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,253
Carmela...
Isn't it too late for that?

169
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:12,129
I mean...

170
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,467
Your cousins have
already achieved a lot.

171
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:18,679
They're making names for themselves.

172
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:21,181
Considering you're all the same age.

173
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,975
You are falling behind.

174
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,563
Why do you always
compare me with my cousins?

175
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:31,358
We're different from each other.

176
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:36,232
Isn't it enough that I tried
to do what you wanted?

177
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:40,497
I'm sorry, Carmela.

178
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:45,620
I just don't want you to
give up so quickly and easily.

179
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,911
It's not even about giving up.

180
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:54,381
What if my passion is in the arts?

181
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:57,508
Carmela...

182
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,221
it's hard to build
a future in the arts.

183
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,973
Of course, it's better

184
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,618
to choose a path in which you'll
have a better and stable future.

185
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:07,894
And that's business.

186
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:11,273
Dad... I'm not
interested in business.

187
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:15,693
Carmela...

188
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,505
Listen to me.

189
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:23,330
After you graduate,
I will retire early.

190
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:26,833
I will help you put up
your own business.

191
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,622
And then, I'll have more time
for you and your sisters.

192
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:33,639
You want that, right?

193
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:39,582
Good girl.

194
00:17:41,564 --> 00:17:42,564
You can do it.

195
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,505
Can you still handle it, Carmela?

196
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,225
He's my classmate.

197
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,163
James!

198
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:52,071
What kind of pass is that?

199
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,240
Sorry.

200
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:01,679
Were you hurt?

201
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:05,429
It's okay. I was just startled.

202
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:11,123
Don't be sad.

203
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,106
You'll get through it.

204
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,935
You can do it. Just smile.

205
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:19,848
There.

206
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,712
You're prettier when you smile.

207
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:54,769
What are we doing here?
You don't even like basketball.

208
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:58,216
We're gonna watch my crush play.

209
00:19:58,315 --> 00:19:59,733
- Crush?
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,187
It's him again!

211
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,779
He's so handsome.

212
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:26,426
Shit, he smiled at me!

213
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:29,105
What? Who?

214
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,172
My crush!

215
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:32,720
Number eight. James!

216
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,533
Go, James! Do your best!

217
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,341
Wow!

218
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:01,708
Thank you, Lord. I made it.

219
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:03,802
I can't be late on
the first day of the semester.

220
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,802
Oh, Carmela. Sit over here.

221
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:07,467
- Let's sit together.
- Alright.

222
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:11,347
- Traffic?
- Yeah.

223
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:25,273
So handsome! Lucky,
I'm sitting beside him.

224
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:29,474
It's okay. At least
we're in the same class.

225
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,125
Hi.

226
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,098
Shae helped me out earlier.

227
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:44,921
Hey, why did you tell her?

228
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:47,523
It's fine. It's just Carmela.

229
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,262
Remember, we talked
about something?

230
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:52,799
What did you talk about?

231
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,975
Secret.

232
00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:00,939
Don't tell her, okay?

233
00:22:03,082 --> 00:22:06,112
Why do I feel like
I'm being left out?

234
00:22:07,753 --> 00:22:08,793
Are you sure?

235
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:17,458
Carmela, let's go.
We'll be late to the party.

236
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,610
- Let's go. Come with us.
- Yeah.

237
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:21,379
I...

238
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:22,751
have an exam tomorrow.

239
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,754
I need to review, you know,
so... you guys enjoy.

240
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,212
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:29,298
Alright.

242
00:22:30,368 --> 00:22:31,661
- Bye.
- Alright.

243
00:22:58,937 --> 00:22:59,937
Carmela!

244
00:23:00,935 --> 00:23:01,935
Carmela!

245
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Carmela!

246
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:08,925
- Carmela, please!
- What is it?

247
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,800
Give it to me straight.

248
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,968
What's your problem?

249
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:17,602
You've been avoiding
hanging out with me and James.

250
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:19,932
I'm just busy.

251
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:21,975
You're lying.

252
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,850
I can see it in your eyes.

253
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:27,834
You know what?
Believe what you want to believe.

254
00:23:28,246 --> 00:23:29,732
You're so full of shit!

255
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:34,380
For once, can't you just say
what's on your mind?

256
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:39,131
You really want to know
what I'm thinking?

257
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:41,769
I hate you.

258
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:43,860
I hate you.

259
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,142
Because you and James
are close to each other.

260
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,477
You're always talking,
always together.

261
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:49,921
It's breaking my heart.

262
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:54,384
Don't tell me you also like James?

263
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:59,013
What kind of friend are you?

264
00:24:00,078 --> 00:24:02,581
I told you first
that he's my crush.

265
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:05,066
And now you're telling
me you like him too?

266
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:07,355
Shae... it's not that.

267
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:09,982
It's exactly that.

268
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:12,861
The thing about you...

269
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:16,279
you're too spoiled.
Too entitled.

270
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,039
Whatever you want, you get.

271
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:23,206
You don't care if
other people get hurt.

272
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,252
If that's what you think of me...

273
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,046
Then you don't
really know me, Shae.

274
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,133
You're not a real friend to me.

275
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:38,678
Maybe you're right.

276
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:43,609
But don't expect that
I will give James up for you.

277
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:44,808
Because no!

278
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:46,852
Never!

279
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:49,891
Carmela.

280
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,717
- I'm going to class.
- Wait.

281
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,257
I don't know what happened
between you and Shae.

282
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:59,705
Please. Don't avoid me too.

283
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:03,181
James, what's wrong
if I do avoid you?

284
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:06,407
You have tons of friends.
Your basketball team,

285
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,432
your fans...

286
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:08,685
Even Shae.

287
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:10,800
But you're different, Carmela.

288
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,525
And what makes me different, James?

289
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,026
Because I like you.

290
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,446
No... It's Shae you like.

291
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:26,140
No. It's you I want.

292
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:30,167
I'm just asking for her help
to get close to you.

293
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,710
I wanted to court you, but...

294
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:35,491
I felt scared...

295
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:37,832
That you will just outright reject me.

296
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:40,138
Please.

297
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:42,385
Believe me.

298
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:18,754
Carmela.

299
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:21,472
Carmela, please. Listen to me.

300
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:23,033
Carmela!

301
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,670
Please, keep your distance from James.

302
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,279
Seriously?

303
00:27:28,765 --> 00:27:31,809
Shae... James confessed to me.

304
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:33,553
He said I'm the one he likes.

305
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:35,480
I don't care.

306
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:38,599
You can't steal him from me.

307
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:41,235
You have everything you want.

308
00:27:42,737 --> 00:27:46,449
But me, I have no one, Carmela.

309
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,245
I only have James.

310
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:55,500
So, don't take him away.

311
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:04,419
Here you go.

312
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:08,388
James... I already told you
to stop bugging me.

313
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:10,107
And I also told you,

314
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:11,849
I won't be doing that.

315
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:14,060
I want you, Carmela.

316
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:16,162
James,

317
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:18,068
Shae has feelings for you, okay?

318
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:19,434
So, what?

319
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:21,442
Lots of other girls
have a crush on me.

320
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:22,984
Shae's not the only one.

321
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:25,780
Shae's my friend.

322
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,118
I don't want her to get hurt.

323
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:30,703
But... how about you?

324
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:31,868
Me?

325
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:35,250
I know you want me too, Carmela.

326
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:37,165
Is he serious right now?

327
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:39,359
Don't make it hard for yourself.

328
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:44,197
James! Will you please stop?

329
00:28:48,598 --> 00:28:49,598
Shae?

330
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:04,987
What? Carmela is flirting
with James?

331
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:07,567
Isn't Shae and James
an item already?

332
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:11,574
Well, as Shae said so herself,
"looks can be deceiving."

333
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:15,063
Carmela's secretly a hoe.

334
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:19,816
Poor Shae. Her own
best friend betrayed her.

335
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:26,340
Whatever Shae is saying,
it's all lies.

336
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:28,373
I can prove it to everyone.

337
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,488
That was your fault...

338
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,016
That bitch!

339
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:36,071
She's really getting on my nerves!

340
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,560
She better watch out for me.

341
00:29:37,727 --> 00:29:40,259
- Is she still there?
- She left already.

342
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,307
I haven't finished it yet.

343
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:47,737
You've been telling everyone
that I'm flirting with James, huh?

344
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:51,684
What do you mean?

345
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:54,231
I don't even have to do that.

346
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:57,341
The whole school can clearly
see what you've been doing.

347
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,674
I'm not doing anything wrong, Shae.

348
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:07,381
I'm trying so hard
to be considerate of you.

349
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:10,324
Considerate?

350
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:13,471
Didn't I tell you to keep
your distance from James?

351
00:30:14,055 --> 00:30:15,631
But you didn't listen.

352
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:18,422
So if you've become
the talk of the town...

353
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:21,117
You just reap what you sow.

354
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:24,023
You want drama?

355
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:27,944
I'll give you a whole damn show.

356
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:30,155
Just keep this in mind...

357
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:33,152
I'm the type of person
you don't want as your enemy.

358
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:05,563
Great! You deserve each other!

359
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:12,495
No! You will not ruin my night.
Erase, erase, erase!

360
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:13,602
Sir!

361
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,370
You know...

362
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:22,171
Being by yourself is quite lonely.

363
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:23,762
But if you'd like...

364
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:25,758
I'm willing to keep you company.

365
00:31:31,928 --> 00:31:32,928
Excuse me.

366
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:17,472
The nerve...
He's not even handsome.

367
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:41,400
Weird...

368
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:42,760
Why am I getting dizzy?

369
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,630
I only had one Margarita.

370
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:53,170
Why can't I book a ride?
Isn't there any taxi here?

371
00:32:57,706 --> 00:32:58,760
Hey...

372
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:00,701
It's too early to go home.

373
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,153
- No...
- Oh, come on.

374
00:33:02,178 --> 00:33:04,472
- No, please go.
- Come on. Let's go.

375
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:05,606
- Ouch!
- Hey!

376
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:07,049
- I told you, no!
- Wait up...

377
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:08,688
Come on.

378
00:33:08,713 --> 00:33:10,033
What the hell
are you doing, man?

379
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:30,918
Dad! Carmela's awake!

380
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,737
How are you feeling now?

381
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,124
My head hurts.

382
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:41,804
Why are we here?

383
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,934
You don't remember anything, Carmela?

384
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:52,189
The only thing I remember...
I was outside the bar.

385
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:54,900
Waiting for a ride home...

386
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:59,321
Then there's this stranger that
came up and talked to me...

387
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:00,639
Carmela Isabella!

388
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:04,329
Didn't you know you almost got into
trouble because of your stubbornness?

389
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:06,035
Dad...

390
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,539
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to happen.

391
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:09,956
And I'm sorry too.

392
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:11,569
Because from now on,

393
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:14,503
you may not leave the house
unless you're going to school.

394
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:17,899
But how about
my birthday celebration, Dad?

395
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:22,303
Don't you know what you did
was awfully dangerous?

396
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:26,515
I don't know what I would do
if ever you got hurt!

397
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:29,349
And if I need to be strict, I will.

398
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:31,437
Just to make sure it won't happen again.

399
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,105
I'm sorry.

400
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,692
Your birthday party is cancelled.

401
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:40,154
Dad! No!

402
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:43,491
That's alright, Carmela.

403
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:46,744
Good thing there
was a guy who saved you.

404
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:49,078
If not...

405
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:51,582
then maybe something
worse could have happened.

406
00:34:53,414 --> 00:34:54,502
What do you mean?

407
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:59,131
When the police called,

408
00:34:59,548 --> 00:35:01,967
they told us you were
at the station, unconscious.

409
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,647
A guy took you there.

410
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:09,600
Together with the other guy
who wanted to rape you.

411
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:14,255
Good thing you have
IDs on your wallet.

412
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:17,608
They saw Dad's calling card in there.

413
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:20,622
And then, when
we arrived at the station...

414
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,530
The suspect was already in jail.

415
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:25,741
They say it was that Paulo's modus

416
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:29,745
to put sleeping powder
into the drinks of his victims.

417
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:33,958
Carmela, good thing
somebody saw you.

418
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:40,207
But still, Dad already decided
to come back to Manila later.

419
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,124
Just in case, that Paulo
can pay his bail.

420
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:45,127
He might follow you again.

421
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:48,389
But wait, where was
the guy who helped me?

422
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:51,171
We didn't see him.

423
00:35:52,101 --> 00:35:53,394
Oh! But...

424
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,566
He left his name and
number with the police.

425
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:10,369
Carmela, what's this?

426
00:36:11,328 --> 00:36:13,122
Are you collecting old stuff now?

427
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,455
Grandma Carmina owns this.

428
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:32,998
Hey, girls. Our oral presentation
would be later, right?

429
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,602
- That's right.
- Are you ready?

430
00:36:35,786 --> 00:36:37,621
We have to do our best.

431
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:40,316
I'll handle our slideshow, okay?

432
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,293
By the way, Carmela.

433
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:45,190
Those related articles about
the well-known families.

434
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:46,215
Where is it again?

435
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:47,479
I'll look for it.

436
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,373
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

437
00:36:49,398 --> 00:36:50,398
We're heading back.

438
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,679
Let's go.

439
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:03,801
Happy birthday!

440
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:06,843
Here we go again.

441
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:08,775
Why won't this guy
stop bothering me?

442
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:11,130
Can't he see I want to live
a peaceful life now?

443
00:37:11,155 --> 00:37:12,967
You're so grumpy.

444
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:15,869
I just miss you. That's it.

445
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:18,102
Are you free later?

446
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:19,854
Let's have some dinner.

447
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:21,439
Same place like before.

448
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,743
James, I have things to do later.

449
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:27,429
Besides, you have Shae.
Just take her to dinner.

450
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:28,655
Shae again?

451
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:30,616
But today's not her birthday, right?

452
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:32,003
It's yours.

453
00:37:37,512 --> 00:37:40,378
Wait... Is that Carmelita's diary?

454
00:37:41,502 --> 00:37:43,587
So? Are you game later?

455
00:37:46,382 --> 00:37:49,969
I'll just be waiting for you.
I have to go. Bye.

456
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,230
This is not your diary.

457
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:25,084
And it will never be yours.

458
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,338
Sister!

459
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:33,512
Sister!

460
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:38,183
Sister!

461
00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:42,396
Sister!

462
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,735
Sister!

463
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:03,030
What the hell?
Are you doing this on purpose?

464
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:06,369
Shae, not now. I'm in a hurry.

465
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:07,896
So, what? You're gonna
avoid me again?

466
00:39:07,921 --> 00:39:10,430
You're good at that.
You never say sorry.

467
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:11,589
Spoiled brat!

468
00:39:11,991 --> 00:39:12,991
Bitch!

469
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,980
How I wish I was really
insensitive and selfish, Shae.

470
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:21,305
So that I wouldn't have to give up
my feelings for James.

471
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,041
Since you ended our friendship anyway.

472
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:46,879
Sister!

473
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:50,073
Please... give me back my dairy.

474
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:53,275
You cannot have this, dear.

475
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,332
It belongs to someone else.

476
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,407
My grandma owns that.
She'll get upset if I lost it.

477
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:01,665
Don't you worry.
She won't get mad.

478
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:04,478
Sister!

479
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:18,992
Sister!

480
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,120
Sister!

481
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:23,417
Sister!

482
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:26,083
Aren't you getting tired?
Please stop!

483
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:32,242
If not for this nun's age,
I would've tackled her.

484
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:34,891
She should be grateful
I'm still being respectful.

485
00:40:41,098 --> 00:40:42,608
Sister!

486
00:40:46,687 --> 00:40:47,687
My god...

487
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,832
Sister!

488
00:40:49,977 --> 00:40:53,675
Stop! I'm not allowed to go through there!
I won't be able to graduate!

489
00:40:54,901 --> 00:41:00,231
Your love will be rewritten
on the day of the fourth chance.

490
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:01,376
Huh?

491
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,162
And today is that fateful day.

492
00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:14,878
Huh?

493
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:32,640
I'll just pick it up,
I won't pass through.

494
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
Huh?

495
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:48,906
How did you--

496
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:51,019
You were just there moments ago.

497
00:41:51,964 --> 00:41:52,964
Yes.

498
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:56,135
But I won't leave without you.

499
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:54,593
What happened to you?

500
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:55,947
Are you hurt?

501
00:43:56,918 --> 00:43:57,918
Miss?

502
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:00,020
Carmelita?

503
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:02,398
How are you feeling?

504
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:05,055
Where am I?
What is this place?

505
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,309
You have to bring me back
to the place where you found me!

506
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:08,626
I want to go back home!

507
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:09,986
She is not Carmelita!

508
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:11,346
You!

509
00:44:12,493 --> 00:44:14,472
What's wrong with all of you?

510
00:44:14,497 --> 00:44:15,749
There is no other way

511
00:44:15,774 --> 00:44:17,076
back to your own time...

512
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:19,270
Unless you finish your mission here.

513
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:21,891
Miss!

514
00:44:23,966 --> 00:44:26,012
Whatever happens...

515
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:29,938
Don't you dare
fall in love with me.

516
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:33,803
Carmela, dear... Don't you forget...

517
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:36,666
That you are Carmelita
while you are here.

518
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:38,291
Mind your actions.

519
00:44:38,316 --> 00:44:40,157
Refrain from being unrefined.

520
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:44,154
- Don Mariano!
- We arrived too early.

521
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,600
- Don Mariano!
- We arrived too early.

522
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:46,956
Beside him is his wife.
