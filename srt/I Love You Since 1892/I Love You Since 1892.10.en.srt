1
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:50,056
I hope I'll end up with
the man I'm with right now.

2
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:51,099
Oh no!

3
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:53,351
What if Helena misunderstood

4
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,435
Juanito's note?

5
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:58,356
We have to talk about
Operation Stop Wedding.

6
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,400
You know, my plan
about you and Helena.

7
00:01:03,078 --> 00:01:04,195
Helena?

8
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:08,700
Marry me.

9
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,204
I am inviting you all

10
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:14,872
to a gathering at our
humble home.

11
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:16,624
I pray that
you may overcome

12
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:19,043
all the challenges you'll face.

13
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,539
Doña Juanita!

14
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:23,339
I wanted to ask...

15
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:26,300
what you thought
of the letter I gave you

16
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,093
the other night?

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,344
I apologize.

18
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:30,638
I haven't read it yet.

19
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:33,391
We became so busy with
taking care of Helena.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,269
Good morning, Miss.

21
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:39,188
- Who's that?
- That's Esmeralda

22
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:40,857
your former housekeeper.

23
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:45,820
I don't think I need to wish
for anything tonight.

24
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:56,659
I don't think I need to
wish for anything tonight.

25
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:59,120
Because my wish just came true.

26
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,163
To see you.

27
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:03,040
I almost forgot!

28
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,334
He told me in the letter to meet him here.

29
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:07,879
He might assume I was waiting for him.

30
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:12,550
Good evening, ladies.

31
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:19,140
- Good evening, Leandro.
- Good evening, Mother Olivia.

32
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:21,893
The procession is about to start.

33
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:25,646
If you're done with your prayers, let's go.

34
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,656
I hope I finish my mission.

35
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,535
Miss Carmelita, please come with me!

36
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:42,330
Don Alejandro and Doña Soledad caught

37
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,333
Mr. Juanito and Miss Helena together!

38
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,375
What?

39
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:05,072
Helena?

40
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:14,820
Carmelita, come over here.

41
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:21,410
Listen to Father.

42
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,245
He'll only get angry if you don't.

43
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:29,752
Carmelita!

44
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,196
Is it true that it was your idea

45
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,407
to bring Helena and Juanito closer?

46
00:06:00,992 --> 00:06:02,010
Helena...

47
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:05,871
Once again, speak the
truth in front of Don Alejandro.

48
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:10,167
That it was Carmelita who
made you closer to Juanito.

49
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:19,844
It is true.

50
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:24,265
Carmelita helped me
and Juanito became closer.

51
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:26,232
What the heck?

52
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:27,810
She ratted me out?

53
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:30,646
After all I did for her
to be close to Juanito.

54
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,398
Now, it's my fault?

55
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:37,194
Carmelita...

56
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:39,071
Are they telling the truth?!

57
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:07,700
Father!

58
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:08,726
Father!

59
00:07:10,853 --> 00:07:12,146
Father...

60
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:15,316
Carmelita is not to blame.

61
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:20,529
She is just helping Helena as a friend.

62
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,708
What is happening here, my son?

63
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,960
What is this commotion about?

64
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,922
Your son has broken my trust!

65
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:41,550
Your son dishonored the
agreement both our families made!

66
00:07:45,763 --> 00:07:47,056
My son... What have you done?

67
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:52,978
It wasn't Juanito's fault.

68
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,817
It was Carmelita!

69
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,530
Carmelita has nothing to do with it!

70
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,573
I am the reason behind all this.

71
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:21,173
That was the letter given to me by Juanito.

72
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:29,014
"I am yours...

73
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:31,225
...as you are mine."

74
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:35,354
I am yours as you are mine.

75
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,444
He wrote that for me?

76
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,490
Does that mean, he likes me?!

77
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,162
So that's why he wants
to know my response...

78
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:59,044
Is this enough evidence
to prove your treachery to my daughter?!

79
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:01,380
Mind your tongue, Alejandro!

80
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:05,384
I cannot understand...

81
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:10,973
Why would Carmelita help Juanito and Helena
end up with each other?

82
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,060
Because she has her own reasons.

83
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:17,980
Tell them already, Carmelita.

84
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:36,624
Father...

85
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,544
I am very sorry.

86
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:47,927
It's all true.

87
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:55,559
It's true that I pushed Helena
and Juanito to be closer.

88
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,275
And it's also true that

89
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:05,527
I don't want the wedding to push through.

90
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,410
Because...

91
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:16,956
Because I still love Leandro.

92
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:51,198
It is clear...

93
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,951
that there will be no more wedding.

94
00:10:54,535 --> 00:11:00,374
And from this day on, I sever
my family's ties to the Montecarlos.

95
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:09,049
Mariano...

96
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:11,343
let's not be too hasty.

97
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,930
We can still fix this
mess, don't you think?

98
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,145
Do not touch me.

99
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:25,524
I will regret it to my death

100
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:28,527
if Carmelita gets married
to their unfaithful son.

101
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:30,779
You have no right to disrespect us!

102
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:34,096
Maybe you're forgetting I
am the Governor of this land!

103
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,078
- My love?
- Father?!

104
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,664
- My love, what is happening to you?
- Father! Father!

105
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:42,963
Help us!

106
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:45,669
- Don Alejandro...
- Stop!

107
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:48,547
- Stop...
- Call a doctor!

108
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:49,686
Father?

109
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:05,397
Carmelita...

110
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,317
Didn't you say Leandro is the reason

111
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:10,778
why you don't want to
get married to Juanito?

112
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:13,072
Shouldn't you be happy

113
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,199
that the wedding was cancelled?

114
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:18,869
Maria's right.

115
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,412
But I can't accept the fact

116
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:22,623
that I couldn't see Juanito when I want to.

117
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:24,625
Whenever I want to.

118
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:32,007
Mother Olivia.

119
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,802
I want to talk to Carmelita.

120
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:38,514
May you please give us some privacy?

121
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:17,886
You have to be strong, Carmela.

122
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:22,724
Because this time...

123
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:27,187
It's not only Juanito you have to protect.

124
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:29,022
What?

125
00:13:29,022 --> 00:13:30,941
Your family needs you as well.

126
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:34,570
What do you mean?

127
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,282
Carmela...

128
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,951
Remember this.

129
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:44,079
Juanito's death...

130
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:48,292
Happened on the day of
his wedding to Carmelita.

131
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:52,254
Even though the wedding was cancelled...

132
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:56,842
Juanito's life is still in danger.

133
00:13:57,676 --> 00:13:59,595
Not until...

134
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:03,182
The people behind his murder are exposed.

135
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,938
Juanito's life is still in danger?

136
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,998
Forgive me, Father.

137
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:31,043
It wasn't my intention
to hurt you and Mother.

138
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:36,006
And to ruin your friendship
with Don Alejandro.

139
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,637
Is that what happened?

140
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:49,311
You agreed to your engagement
to Carmelita just for me?

141
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:52,981
To save my friendship with Alejandro?

142
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,612
That was the truth at first, Father.

143
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:01,405
But...

144
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:05,385
It didn't take long for
me to love Carmelita.

145
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:11,291
Yet you continued talking to Helena.

146
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,752
I do not know what to do anymore, Father.

147
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:16,505
I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

148
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:19,007
Remember, son.

149
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:25,472
A true gentleman knows how
to stand up for his decisions.

150
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,852
And to be true to his heart.

151
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:36,608
Do not worry, Father.

152
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:40,195
I will speak to Don
Alejandro and fix all of this.

153
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:46,660
This mess is between me and Alejandro.

154
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:54,918
As the head of this family, I
should be the one to fix this.

155
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:56,253
But Father...

156
00:15:58,547 --> 00:15:59,840
My son...

157
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,344
No matter what you've done...

158
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,558
My love for you will never be gone.

159
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:26,783
Josefina!

160
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,829
May I be the one to take this to Father?

161
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:35,375
Make sure you ask for forgiveness.

162
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,711
So that he may feel better.

163
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:00,233
Father?

164
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:09,951
Father, forgive me--

165
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,453
Get out!

166
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:19,294
Father, I'm sorry that
the wedding got cancelled.

167
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:21,046
I didn't mean it.

168
00:17:21,797 --> 00:17:23,256
I apologize.

169
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:26,259
Father...

170
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,513
I'm really sorry.

171
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,350
Please forgive me.

172
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,643
I said get out!

173
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:37,729
I don't want to see your face!

174
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:46,196
Get out now!

175
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:51,910
Carmelita...

176
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:54,663
I'm so sorry, Father.

177
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:57,874
Get out!

178
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:01,920
Soledad.

179
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:27,362
Miss, you must eat.
You didn't eat breakfast earlier as well.

180
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:29,656
I don't have an appetite.

181
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:34,077
Miss, there's something you must know.

182
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:36,329
It's about the Flores family.

183
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:39,945
What is it?

184
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:47,466
But you have to eat first before I tell
you the important news you need to hear.

185
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:54,389
Say it first. Go on.

186
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,449
I heard that

187
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:17,537
Miss Helena and Miss Natasha
are going to Madrid tonight.

188
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:18,747
What?

189
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:29,299
She's running away after
blaming everything on me?

190
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:31,968
I thought we were friends.

191
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:35,013
Take this away, Theresita.

192
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,306
I'm going to see Helena.

193
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:37,343
What?

194
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:41,520
Wait, Miss. I'm coming with you.

195
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,986
Mr. Sergio took Mr. Leandro
to Cavite earlier this morning.

196
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:51,905
Meanwhile...

197
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,784
Miss Natasha went to see Mother Olivia.

198
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,789
Miss Helena has been staying
in her room since last night.

199
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,708
She hasn't eaten anything yet.

200
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:10,132
I know Helena is suffering more.

201
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:13,677
Maybe she can't accept that
Juanito fell in love with me.

202
00:20:14,094 --> 00:20:15,303
But, wait...

203
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:17,097
In the original diary...

204
00:20:17,097 --> 00:20:19,099
Juanito really loved Helena.

205
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:21,977
And Carmelita's love was unrequited.

206
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,688
What happened?

207
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:27,023
Why was it flipped?

208
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,401
Why did Juanito fall for me?

209
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:32,028
I need to speak to Mother Olivia.

210
00:20:33,488 --> 00:20:36,491
- Miss, thank goodness you came out!
- What are you doing here?

211
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,495
I'm asking you, Carmelita.

212
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:43,498
What are you doing here?

213
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,626
Why are you leaving?

214
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,130
What is my purpose here?

215
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:53,550
You already took Juanito from me!

216
00:20:57,429 --> 00:20:59,264
Our wedding was cancelled.

217
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,934
His heart belongs to you!

218
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:06,980
And I can't accept...

219
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:10,358
that it was you he chose.

220
00:21:11,568 --> 00:21:14,195
Wait, when did Juanito choose me?

221
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:32,255
I know you've been together
at the library in Santo Tomas.

222
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:36,801
And I know he was
waiting for you at the plaza.

223
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:40,180
He stopped writing to me.

224
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:43,183
Because he started to fall for you.

225
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:54,903
Here!

226
00:21:56,613 --> 00:21:58,865
This opened my eyes to the truth

227
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:01,159
that Juanito could never love me!

228
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,331
Because he's already in love with you!

229
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:10,210
Helena, wait...

230
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:18,857
Yes.

231
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,181
You took Juanito from me.

232
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:28,311
And I swear to you...

233
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:31,147
You will never end up with each other.

234
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,608
It's enough for me that
your wedding was cancelled.

235
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:41,116
Miss...

236
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:05,181
What's written in the diary
was completely changed.

237
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:09,686
Now I know why Juanito fell for Carmelita.

238
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:13,356
He fell in love.

239
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:15,692
Not with Carmelita...

240
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:18,236
But with me.

241
00:23:20,113 --> 00:23:23,324
Is Helena the one behind Juanito's murder?

242
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,369
But they loved each other.

243
00:23:28,246 --> 00:23:31,499
It is also possible that Helena

244
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:35,045
had Juanito killed for marrying Carmelita.

245
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:38,256
And she doesn't want
anyone else to have him.

246
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,218
She's a bit selfish too.

247
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:46,765
From now on, I need to
keep a close eye on Helena.

248
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:11,539
Angelito!

249
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:15,460
Angelito!

250
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:19,047
Miss!

251
00:24:21,424 --> 00:24:23,384
Nice to see you here.

252
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:25,428
I slipped out.

253
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:27,764
Don't worry, Miss.

254
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:31,518
Father attended a meeting
held at the town this morning.

255
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:33,853
While Sergio is in Cavite.

256
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:36,022
But Mother...

257
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:39,442
She's resting in her bedroom.

258
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:43,279
She was deeply saddened by what happened.

259
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:48,409
I'm really sorry for
everything that happened.

260
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:50,245
You don't have to apologize, Miss.

261
00:24:50,245 --> 00:24:52,539
We are actually grateful
you spoke for Juanito's behalf.

262
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:56,251
If not, he's gonna take all the blame.

263
00:24:58,294 --> 00:25:01,714
Good thing I have someone
on my side in times like this.

264
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,508
Where is Juanito?

265
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,845
I knew you were looking for him.

266
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:08,763
I didn't understand what he meant but...

267
00:25:08,763 --> 00:25:14,144
He told me he's getting air
in the place where it all began.

268
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:18,565
The place where it all began?

269
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:20,775
Is there such a thing?

270
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:24,696
My brother Juanito is a bit of a poet.

271
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:26,698
You should get used to it.

272
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:31,161
To see the place where it all started...

273
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,560
Juanito.

274
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,073
How did you know where I am?

275
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:14,746
"The place where it all began."

276
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,544
It was decided here that
we were to be married.

277
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:23,922
And I guess, we're also here to...

278
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,594
End everything.

279
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:36,976
Juanito...

280
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:42,315
- The truth is...
- Don't worry, Carmelita.

281
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,497
You don't need to tell me...

282
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,877
Your answer to the poem I gave you.

283
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,643
Thank you, Carmelita.

284
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:23,481
Because you gave me
a chance to be with you.

285
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,859
And to know you.

286
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:39,914
I wish for your happiness.

287
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:46,754
Together with Leandro.

288
00:28:03,146 --> 00:28:04,814
It's been the talk of the town

289
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:06,858
how Mr. Juanito was caught

290
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:08,526
with his other woman.

291
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:09,944
Meanwhile,

292
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:11,988
they've been saying you are in love.

293
00:28:11,988 --> 00:28:13,948
With an unknown man.

294
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,957
Good morning, Carmelita.

295
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:31,257
I was about to leave for Cavite.

296
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:35,428
But I thought it's not
right for me to leave you.

297
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:38,890
Especially now that you're
dealing with a lot of things.

298
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:41,492
I know...

299
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:43,811
How heavy your heart is.

300
00:28:44,562 --> 00:28:46,481
Because of the incident with your father.

301
00:28:48,316 --> 00:28:50,109
That is why I'm gonna talk to him.

302
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:51,861
And tell him...

303
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,405
that we weren't doing anything wrong.

304
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:58,117
You'd do that?

305
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,293
And once the tension dies down...

306
00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:10,797
I will ask your father for
your hand in marriage.

307
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:15,454
Carmelita.

308
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:18,054
Once again,

309
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:20,681
I want to hear the words
you said the other night.

310
00:29:30,733 --> 00:29:33,152
Your hearts must be dancing with joy.

311
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:34,946
I am happy for the two of you.

312
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:38,199
Let's head to the dining room.

313
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,083
Carmelita, just wait a moment.

314
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:49,627
I will just talk to your father.

315
00:29:57,135 --> 00:29:59,011
I just want to thank you.

316
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:01,806
Because you saved my family from danger.

317
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:26,556
It seems only yesterday

318
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:30,251
when I almost went crazy
thinking about

319
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,503
how I will survive in this era.

320
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:39,302
There's no TV, laptop,
cellphone, or video games.

321
00:30:39,765 --> 00:30:40,945
But now...

322
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,348
I'm too busy thinking about
all the stupid things I did.

323
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:50,521
Why didn't I tell Juanito my true feelings?

324
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:52,690
I never really learn.

325
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:56,777
I should've learned my lesson with James.

326
00:30:56,777 --> 00:31:00,531
I didn't have the guts
to confess my feelings.

327
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:02,366
And now...

328
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:04,494
I had to let go of Juanito too.

329
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,783
Miss, can I take your time for a moment?

330
00:31:40,988 --> 00:31:43,157
It's clear to me that you're
doing everything you can

331
00:31:43,157 --> 00:31:45,409
to forget Mr. Juanito.

332
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:51,199
But I believe that your friendship
shouldn't be disregarded.

333
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,195
That's why, I think you
should still keep this.

334
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:33,283
Laura sent that box earlier this morning.

335
00:32:33,316 --> 00:32:39,655
She told me you needed to
have that since it belongs to you.

336
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:47,805
If only I was able to read this.

337
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:50,766
I wouldn't have hurt Juanito.

338
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:55,313
Carmelita!

339
00:32:56,314 --> 00:32:58,107
Why the worried faces?

340
00:32:58,441 --> 00:33:01,110
Carmelita, do not panic.

341
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,613
We also learned this from Eduardo just now.

342
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:04,589
What is it?

343
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:07,867
Eduardo said there's a
commotion at Hacienda Alfonso.

344
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:08,701
What?

345
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:11,078
The Governor General ordered

346
00:33:11,078 --> 00:33:15,041
to search all of the Alfonso's property.

347
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,501
They will also arrest Don Mariano.

348
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:20,046
If they find proof

349
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:23,132
that he is helping and
supporting the rebels

350
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:25,009
who are fighting the government.

351
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:28,054
And if he is truly behind
Don Diosdado Valdez' murder.

352
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:29,914
Impossible!

353
00:33:30,306 --> 00:33:32,767
Don Mariano and his family are good people!

354
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:35,186
We should ask help from Father!

355
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:37,083
Let's inform him!

356
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:40,191
Father is attending a
meeting in another town.

357
00:33:40,216 --> 00:33:42,093
He'll be back later tonight.

358
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,655
But we sent someone to tell him the news.

359
00:33:46,697 --> 00:33:49,075
I have to help them. Wait!

360
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:51,744
Carmelita, will you please calm down?

361
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:52,995
Carmelita...

362
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:07,263
- Move quickly!
- Spare my children, please, I beg you!

363
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,263
Do not hurt my family.

364
00:34:11,972 --> 00:34:13,824
- No!
- Father!

365
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:15,893
- Stop!
- Carmelita! Carmelita!

366
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:18,896
- Carmelita! Don't!
- Sir!

367
00:34:19,145 --> 00:34:21,064
Sir! Please let her go!

368
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,778
Please forgive my sister.

369
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:28,114
She's still young.

370
00:34:28,614 --> 00:34:30,032
You look familiar to me.

371
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:32,656
You're a...

372
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:36,622
student of Mother Superior Olivia,

373
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:38,516
right?

374
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:39,583
Yes, sir!

375
00:34:41,043 --> 00:34:42,154
Very well.

376
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:45,131
Your sister is too young to understand

377
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:50,761
whether it's appropriate to
intervene on official matters.

378
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:56,976
General Seleno!

379
00:34:56,976 --> 00:35:00,771
We found a crate of weapons
hidden in their storeroom.

380
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,622
And there's plenty of rice
stocked inside their granary.

381
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,753
My eldest son, Sergio, is
also a general like yourself.

382
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:27,423
It is normal for us to have
guns inside our home.

383
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:32,052
But these kind of guns must
be stored inside the camp.

384
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:35,473
Unless he plans on using
them somewhere else?

385
00:35:35,473 --> 00:35:39,101
Are you accusing my son of treason?

386
00:35:42,563 --> 00:35:45,524
If not, then explain yourself!

387
00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:49,570
Why are you hoarding rice like this?

388
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:51,822
This certain type of rice...

389
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,283
is known to have a stable shelf life.

390
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,937
Rain or shine, it doesn't go bad easily.

391
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:02,917
Why do I need to explain myself to you?

392
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,586
You won't even listen to me.

393
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:07,880
Just take me to court.

394
00:36:08,214 --> 00:36:10,883
I will fight for the truth there!

395
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:12,760
You are being arrested!

396
00:36:13,177 --> 00:36:15,763
There's nothing we can do for a criminal

397
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:19,016
who is unashamed of his sins!

398
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:22,019
My father is innocent!
So you cannot arrest him!

399
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:26,565
Although I am assigned to Manila...

400
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,443
The Governor General instructed me

401
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:32,321
to investigate your family.

402
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,331
My family did nothing wrong.

403
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,995
Not all bad deeds are easily seen.

404
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:44,500
Sometimes, you must scrutinize
the newly-harvested rice...

405
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,547
In order to discover the
stones and dirt mixed into it.

406
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:54,844
You will all be placed under house arrest!

407
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:58,722
- Do you understand?!
- No! Our family is innocent!

408
00:36:58,722 --> 00:36:59,805
Juanito!

409
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,477
Mother! Mother!

410
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:08,446
General.

411
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:15,384
Please excuse us.

412
00:37:17,123 --> 00:37:18,666
I will take my daughters home.

413
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,125
Go home now.

414
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,843
- We're leaving. We're going home.
- Carmelita, let's go.

415
00:37:35,843 --> 00:37:38,512
- Carmelita, come on...
- We must leave, Carmelita!

416
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:40,931
Go. Leave this place.

417
00:37:55,863 --> 00:37:58,824
Let's ask Father for
forgiveness tomorrow morning.

418
00:37:59,182 --> 00:38:02,185
Whatever the reason, leaving
home like that was wrong.

419
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:13,881
My ladies, there's something you must know.

420
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:15,591
According to Eduardo,

421
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:21,055
General Seleno took Don Mariano
as a captive and went to Manila.

422
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:25,017
He also learned that he will be
imprisoned at Fuerte de Santiago

423
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:28,354
while his case is being heard.

424
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:30,204
Are you sure about that?

425
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,608
Don Mariano is facing heavy charges.

426
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:37,947
I'm sure he knows a lot of
lawyers willing to help his case.

427
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:40,574
Unfortunately,

428
00:38:40,574 --> 00:38:44,662
Heneral Seleno designated
Mr. Ocampo as his lawyer

429
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:48,999
since no other lawyer would
take Don Mariano's case.

430
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:51,877
Mr. Ocampo from the other town?

431
00:38:52,593 --> 00:38:55,513
He can't defend his clients properly!

432
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:57,716
Don Mariano's in danger.

433
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:02,888
I will talk to Father.

434
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,848
About what?

435
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:10,562
If you're gonna appeal for the Alfonsos,

436
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:13,148
I think it's better for
you to shut your mouth...

437
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:15,609
And go to bed.

438
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:19,989
But Father, I cannot rest

439
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:23,033
knowing Don Mariano's life is in danger.

440
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:26,745
Let's help them. I know you can save Don--

441
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:29,248
And why would I do that?

442
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:31,875
We have no relations to one another.

443
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:33,669
I do not care about him.

444
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:36,296
And I don't give a damn about his family.

445
00:39:36,505 --> 00:39:38,507
Weren't you old friends?

446
00:39:38,716 --> 00:39:40,718
You have history together, don't you?

447
00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:42,490
Will you just let him be?

448
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:44,221
Father!

449
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:46,765
Alejandro! What do you think you're doing?!

450
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:49,184
You shouldn't have slapped your daughter!

451
00:39:52,604 --> 00:39:55,566
Don't you forget that I
am the man of this house.

452
00:39:56,316 --> 00:40:01,113
I did everything to protect
the name of our family.

453
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:06,201
But because of your meddling
with General Seleno's work,

454
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:08,579
and working together
with Juanito and Helena

455
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,205
to stop your wedding...

456
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:15,627
You brought shame and danger to our family!

457
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,638
Let go of me, Soledad.

458
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:24,303
Alejandro!

459
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:30,868
Carmelita?

460
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:44,448
My Dad never raised his hand against me.

461
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,326
Didn't expect to experience it here.

462
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:53,916
Here is your luggage, Miss.

463
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:58,003
I prepared all the things you will need
for a few days in Manila.

464
00:40:58,504 --> 00:40:59,587
Thank you.

465
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:03,675
Do everything you can to help Don Mariano.

466
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:07,262
But... what about Father?

467
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:08,485
Don't you worry.

468
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:10,224
Mother Olivia told Father

469
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:12,034
that you'll be staying
at the convent at Sugbu.

470
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:14,770
To get away from the problems
and ponder your thoughts.

471
00:41:15,354 --> 00:41:16,605
So he knows...

472
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:19,990
You're gonna be at the convent in Sugbu

473
00:41:21,927 --> 00:41:23,124
Thank you.

474
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:27,866
Carmelita, please be careful.

475
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:33,705
Don't let any friends of
father recognize you in Manila.

476
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:37,126
We talked to Don Buencamino.

477
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:39,253
He's the one in-charge of the ship.

478
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:42,631
He promised to keep your
journey to Manila a secret.

479
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:44,900
And don't you worry.

480
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:46,677
Mother Olivia will meet you there.

481
00:41:47,803 --> 00:41:49,847
Thank you. Thank you very much.

482
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:53,934
By the way...

483
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:56,395
Someone wants to come with you.

484
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:05,904
Good day, ladies.

485
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:10,159
Wait, how did you escape the civil guards?

486
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,493
Eduardo helped me.

487
00:42:12,578 --> 00:42:15,247
He knows the way in
and out of our property.

488
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,710
Don Buencamino.

489
00:42:21,044 --> 00:42:22,713
Ladies and good sir.

490
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:27,801
The ship will sail in a minute.

491
00:42:54,453 --> 00:42:56,205
The two of you stay here,

492
00:42:56,205 --> 00:42:59,333
until a room becomes vacant for the lady.

493
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:02,920
Thank you.

494
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:17,517
Miss, are you...

495
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:24,775
Carmelita, you don't have to avoid me.

496
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:30,489
I already accepted that my
love for you is unrequited.

497
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:38,997
Sometimes, I wish I wouldn't have known...

498
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,251
That your heart belongs to someone else.

499
00:43:43,835 --> 00:43:44,912
I wish...

500
00:43:46,546 --> 00:43:48,298
I didn't hold on to hope...

501
00:43:49,591 --> 00:43:51,426
That you will fall in love with me too.

502
00:43:53,303 --> 00:43:54,388
And I wish...

503
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:59,434
I was brave enough to
tell you my true feelings

504
00:43:59,434 --> 00:44:00,811
right from the start.

505
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:07,901
You're wrong, Juanito.

506
00:44:08,402 --> 00:44:10,237
It's you that I want.

507
00:44:10,862 --> 00:44:15,367
But I'm afraid of what might
happen if I tell you the truth.

508
00:44:22,499 --> 00:44:26,503
Juanito, you don't need to
hide your tears from me.

509
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:29,548
Just for a little while.

510
00:44:29,548 --> 00:44:30,966
Thank you, Carmelita.

511
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:33,010
I didn't expect you to
go against your father

512
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,303
just to help us.

513
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:35,512
Are you only doing this

514
00:44:35,512 --> 00:44:37,597
because you have grown close
to my brother?

515
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:39,516
This my plan

516
00:44:39,516 --> 00:44:41,727
so that we can attend
Father's hearing

517
00:44:41,727 --> 00:44:43,020
without anyone recognizing us.

518
00:44:44,987 --> 00:44:46,572
This is my wife,

519
00:44:47,316 --> 00:44:48,942
and these are my friends

520
00:44:48,942 --> 00:44:49,793
from England.

521
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:51,612
I have a witness

522
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:54,531
who can testify that he is planning

523
00:44:54,531 --> 00:44:58,285
treason against the government.

524
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:03,248
We need your father.

525
00:45:03,248 --> 00:45:06,376
We must save him.

526
00:45:06,585 --> 00:45:09,713
If I come with you and escape,

527
00:45:09,713 --> 00:45:11,548
it's as good as a confession
of my crime.

528
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:13,300
Carmela, prepare yourself.

529
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,303
A lot of things and people

530
00:45:16,303 --> 00:45:18,430
will be taken in place of Juanito.

531
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,016
Destiny is being rewritten.
