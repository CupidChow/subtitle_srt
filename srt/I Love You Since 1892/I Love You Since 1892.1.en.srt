1
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:27,781
7th of March, 1892.

2
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,841
Juanito, my love.

3
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:34,589
This should not have happened.

4
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,726
Just wait...

5
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:38,440
We will see each other again.

6
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:41,362
Our love...

7
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,889
will be rewritten

8
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:46,088
on the day of the fourth chance.

9
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:17,040
Our love...

10
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:21,922
will be rewritten on the
day of the fourth chance.

11
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:55,511
1892.

12
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:58,787
The Revolution's founding year.

13
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,608
It was also the same year

14
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:05,587
when Dr. Jose Rizal was
captured and exiled to Dapitan.

15
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:08,964
Blah... blah... blah...

16
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:11,884
Gosh. I hate this class. So boring.

17
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:14,987
When will this end?

18
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:16,555
Before that happened,

19
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:20,288
Rizal was able to
found La Liga Filipina.

20
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:22,720
A group who believes

21
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,473
in a quiet and peaceful reform.

22
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,295
However...

23
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,441
After just a few days.

24
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,689
He was arrested.

25
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:33,752
Read and pass.

26
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:37,785
And this, so it seems,

27
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:41,261
And this, so it seems, ignited the
resolve of the young revolutionaries.

28
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,837
That reforms are not enough.

29
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:57,323
And there must
be actions instead.

30
00:11:58,264 --> 00:11:59,395
What the hell?!

31
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:01,286
What is happening there?

32
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:03,175
It's you two again!

33
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,436
If you want to fight,

34
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:09,082
do it in the Student
Affairs Office.

35
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:10,463
Alright?!

36
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,850
Not here in my class!

37
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,120
Ew!

38
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,130
How dare you?!

39
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:26,172
And where are you
going, Ms. Isabella?

40
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,374
Student Affairs Office.

41
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:29,794
As you advised.

42
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:30,896
Sir.

43
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:49,140
It is clearly written in this
college's Code of Conduct

44
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:52,026
the Rules and
Regulations you violated.

45
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,612
I'm Carmela Isabella.

46
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:57,520
Soon-to-be twenty. Business
Management student.

47
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,816
Cool, right?

48
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:01,141
But no. I don't
like any of this.

49
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:03,091
I just followed my Dad's orders

50
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,181
since he wants
to start a business.

51
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,333
Guess who he wants
to be in charge of it?

52
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:10,461
Yup. Me. Great.

53
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:12,943
Miss Isabella, are you with us?

54
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:16,342
Yes, ma'am.

55
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:23,071
I really want to quit
if not only for this girl.

56
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:26,077
'Shae. My childhood
friend turned mortal enemy.

57
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,521
Why?

58
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:33,442
Because everyone knows her
boyfriend James has a thing for me.

59
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,027
Like I care?!

60
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:40,074
Since then, it's like she made it
her life's mission to ruin my life.

61
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:48,169
But I don't want to
give her the satisfaction

62
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,690
to say that I am
a college dropout.

63
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:51,720
No! Never!

64
00:13:53,796 --> 00:13:57,925
If this happens again, you two
will have a formal disciplinary action.

65
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,258
Girl, you're such a baddie. .

66
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:42,094
It was bold of you to
walk out of class like that.

67
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:46,098
But wait... What if
Professor Luis fails you?

68
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,016
Like, duh?

69
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:51,520
What is even the point of History class
when we're Business Management students?

70
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,187
And besides,

71
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:54,815
will we ever use those
lessons in modern times?

72
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:56,900
Carmela,

73
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,169
there's a saying na

74
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:01,547
"those who doesn't learn
from history are doomed

75
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:02,572
to repeat it."

76
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:03,640
Yeah, she's right.

77
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:06,345
Scary. For real.

78
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:08,766
You know, if I were you,

79
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,877
I'll just make up during our
group reporting next week.

80
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:14,393
Don't forget, it's about
the history of San Alfonso.

81
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:15,269
Hey!

82
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,515
- Don't you have relatives there?
- Yeah.

83
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,228
Next week?

84
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:21,049
But it's my birthday. Besides,

85
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:22,843
it's been so long
since I've been there.

86
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:25,472
Girl, stop.

87
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,253
You will really fail to
graduate if you exit from there.

88
00:15:30,408 --> 00:15:31,452
There.

89
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:32,677
- Here?
- Uh-huh.

90
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:34,899
- You believe in superstitions?
- Yeah!

91
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:36,248
Hey, Carmela.

92
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:40,152
Our school was established
in the 17th century.

93
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,389
Many before you have
proven it to be true.

94
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:44,056
But...

95
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:46,864
if you don't believe it...

96
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,552
Go ahead.

97
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:51,121
Pass through it.

98
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:55,350
You know I don't fear anything.

99
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,384
Wow.

100
00:15:57,544 --> 00:15:58,437
Hazel, Angelica!

101
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,243
- The dog's here.
- Hi!

102
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:05,886
You! Stop right there!

103
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:07,168
Hey! Carmela!

104
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:08,194
Why did she run?

105
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,909
Hey...

106
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:14,176
Carms.

107
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:15,997
Carmela.

108
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:19,939
Will you be at my
house party tonight?

109
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:22,152
Everyone's gonna be there.

110
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:24,321
Not me.

111
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:29,353
I didn't know you love
reading history books.

112
00:16:30,118 --> 00:16:31,662
James, what do you care?

113
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:33,914
What about our past together?

114
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:35,374
Our history.

115
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,961
I have long moved
on from the past.

116
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:42,047
And I hate history.

117
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:43,976
Carmela.

118
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:45,457
Come here.

119
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:57,788
So, obviously,

120
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:01,024
James hasn't been
able to move on from you.

121
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:04,194
He was just asking if
I'm gonna be at his party.

122
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:06,196
As if anyone's
gonna be there, right?

123
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:07,765
Us?!

124
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,750
I know that Shae's just planning
to make me jealous at James' party.

125
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:20,752
But I don't care.

126
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,451
Hello mic test.

127
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:29,946
Looks like you're
having too much fun.

128
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:56,896
Oh!

129
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:00,936
Why are you looking
at me that way?

130
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:03,255
Wanna fight?

131
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,038
You want trouble?

132
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,326
If she's not gonna
fight, then I will.

133
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,322
Is that so?

134
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,412
OMG!

135
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:20,023
How dare you?!

136
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:24,746
Hey...

137
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:26,390
Are you okay?

138
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,215
You didn't need to help me.

139
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:32,053
I can handle it myself.

140
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:34,169
I just don't like seeing
someone getting bullied.

141
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,080
Besides, why did
you just let her be?

142
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:41,727
There are other ways to fight.

143
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:45,105
Also, my Dad is expecting a
lot from me. I can't let him down.

144
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:49,484
You're just saying that because
you haven't experienced pain yet.

145
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:08,462
Will you really not
do anything right?!

146
00:20:08,462 --> 00:20:11,131
Problems are the
only thing you give me!

147
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:13,759
Please, Tita. Not here.

148
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:15,802
Oh, so now you're embarrassed?

149
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:18,572
You know shame when
you're reprimanded in public.

150
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:19,595
But you don't give a damn

151
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,747
when it's me getting shamed
because of your actions!

152
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,521
If I only knew you'll
turn out like this,

153
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:26,401
I will not have
supported your studies!

154
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,081
Can I?

155
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:30,118
Of course. Go ahead, try it.

156
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:33,274
Can i see?

157
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,116
Go on.

158
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:41,536
So pretty. Who are you again?

159
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:45,232
By the way...

160
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,292
Are you living here by yourself?

161
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:48,919
Well...

162
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:50,337
I have two younger sisters.

163
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,131
But they'll be home later

164
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:54,216
from school.

165
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:56,848
And your parents?

166
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:01,723
My mom passed
away when I was eight.

167
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:03,642
And my Dad...

168
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:06,069
He's always busy
with work, so...

169
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:07,624
...he doesn't really come home.

170
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:11,900
At least your Dad is just at
work and will eventually be home.

171
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:14,152
As for me,

172
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,279
both my parents are gone.

173
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:19,574
That's why my aunt
is taking care of me.

174
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:22,786
She's the one you're
talking to earlier?

175
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:32,838
If ever you need someone to
make you smile, I'll be here.

176
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,090
You can drop by here anytime.

177
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:37,467
I shouldn't have taken you in!

178
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:40,387
You should've
been better off alone!

179
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,375
Hey, Carmela!

180
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:14,297
Jenny, Emily. Why
are you still awake?

181
00:22:15,755 --> 00:22:16,756
How about you?

182
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,341
Where have you been?

183
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:23,513
Dad, I just went to my
friend's birthday party.

184
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:25,576
Who that might be?

185
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:27,047
It's Shae.

186
00:22:29,185 --> 00:22:32,152
I thought you and Shae
are no longer friends?

187
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:34,217
And also,

188
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:36,380
Mrs. Falcon called me earlier.

189
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:40,196
She said you and Shae interrupted
your Philippine History class.

190
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:43,292
Dad...

191
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:45,869
It was just a petty fight.

192
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:48,455
Besides, I don't
have time for that.

193
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:52,417
Actually, I was studying
in the library earlier.

194
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:55,003
So how do you explain this? Huh?

195
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,756
Why are your grades so low?

196
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,133
im screwed

197
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:04,346
Did you know you left
your computer open?

198
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:06,598
Your school portal!

199
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,808
There! I printed it!

200
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:11,227
Carmela...

201
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:13,313
why can't you be
like your cousins?

202
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:16,117
Look at them!

203
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:17,677
They're already successful!

204
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:20,111
And you?

205
00:23:20,695 --> 00:23:21,863
You're left behind!

206
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:24,376
See?

207
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:25,473
I know that already!

208
00:23:31,164 --> 00:23:32,332
Carmela.

209
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,542
My child...

210
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:37,058
You know why I'm doing this.

211
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:40,548
Because I care for you.

212
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:43,682
Always.

213
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:48,056
Good night, Dad.

214
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:52,894
Good night.

215
00:23:57,607 --> 00:23:58,522
And you two,

216
00:23:58,775 --> 00:23:59,776
go to bed now!

217
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:00,777
- Yes, Dad.
- Okay.

218
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:02,153
You're getting used to this.

219
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:04,608
- Go to sleep.
- Yes, Dad.

220
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:06,032
Good night. Love you.

221
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:07,409
Good night!

222
00:24:07,784 --> 00:24:08,868
Love you.

223
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:36,271
Always like this...

224
00:24:37,814 --> 00:24:38,898
It's always like this.

225
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,105
I wish you were here, Ma.

226
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:24,611
Maybe things will be different.

227
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:29,074
I miss you.

228
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:31,826
I miss you.

229
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:33,953
I miss you.

230
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:49,006
How much rice do you want?

231
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:50,798
That's enough.

232
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:53,364
- More.
- I was first.

233
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:54,890
Mommy!

234
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:57,370
Carmela, please.

235
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,080
That is Jenny's seat.

236
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,582
- Come on, child.
- But Mommy...

237
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:01,875
Come on, child.

238
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,793
Please, Carmela.
You are the eldest.

239
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:06,963
- Carmela.
- So unfair.

240
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:10,038
Carmela, it's not unfair.

241
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:11,648
You are eldest.

242
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:13,011
You should...

243
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:14,637
always put your sister first.

244
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:17,140
Right? What if we're
not around anymore--

245
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:23,563
Carmenia,

246
00:27:24,063 --> 00:27:25,273
- David, I think...
- What?

247
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,152
I think the baby's coming.

248
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:30,304
- Mommy!
- I think the baby's coming!

249
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:32,291
Mommy, Mommy!

250
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,634
Hi Daddy!

251
00:27:58,181 --> 00:27:59,474
- Hi baby!
- Hi baby!

252
00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:02,214
Jenny, look. We
have a new sister.

253
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:04,784
- Look! It's our new baby.
- So cute!

254
00:28:04,854 --> 00:28:06,693
She's really cute, isn't she?

255
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:09,609
Daddy, where's Mommy?

256
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,737
Daddy, where's Mommy?

257
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,026
Mommy?

258
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:15,215
Mommy?!

259
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,300
Mommy?

260
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:17,911
Mommy?!

261
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:19,702
Mommy, where are you?

262
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:30,546
Daddy... where's Mommy?

263
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,936
Carmela, Daddy loves
you very much, okay?

264
00:28:46,688 --> 00:28:47,721
It's just that...

265
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:50,566
Mommy's not gonna come home.

266
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:07,372
Emily?

267
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:09,836
Emily!

268
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:12,261
You rascal! Emily!

269
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:15,419
Emily!

270
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:27,270
Ew. Is that your
new facial mask?

271
00:29:27,323 --> 00:29:29,533
Ew? Do you want some too?

272
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:33,151
You want it too, huh?!

273
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:35,278
Hey, hey, hey.
What's happenening?

274
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:38,271
Stop -- I said stop!

275
00:29:39,282 --> 00:29:41,075
I already asked you to quit it.

276
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:47,415
Dad...

277
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,212
Are you still mad at me?

278
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,720
Carmela...

279
00:29:57,925 --> 00:29:59,376
I will never be mad at you.

280
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:02,597
Come here.

281
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:05,933
You know what?

282
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,078
Daddy's a bit grumpy.

283
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:10,605
Strict.

284
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:13,399
But when I tell you off,

285
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:15,234
it doesn't mean
that I don't love you.

286
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,905
I love you and your
sisters very much.

287
00:30:20,782 --> 00:30:21,866
Okay?

288
00:30:27,413 --> 00:30:28,325
Dad.

289
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,350
Why are there luggages outside?

290
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,667
Are we going somewhere?

291
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,419
We're going to San Alfonso.

292
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:34,629
Huh?

293
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:36,968
Your Grandma Carmina
is making a request.

294
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:39,109
She's asking us to visit
before your birthday.

295
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:40,747
So, we're spending
the weekend there.

296
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,856
What?!

297
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:44,702
I'll be stuck in the
province for two days?!

298
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,559
You know it's been awhile
since we last visited her.

299
00:30:51,354 --> 00:30:53,873
I know your Mom
will be happy if we go.

300
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:55,978
Alright, that's it.

301
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:59,340
Just get the bag of gifts we'll
be giving your Grandma. Okay?

302
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:01,948
- Put it in the car.
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:03,215
I'll be upstairs.

304
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:06,334
Jenny, you heard what Dad said.

305
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:08,663
Get the bag of
gifts. Put it in the car.

306
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:10,289
Why me?

307
00:31:10,362 --> 00:31:11,679
Dad told you to
do it, didn't he?

308
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:14,669
You know what to do.

309
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:16,395
Why is it always me in the end?!

310
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,431
Shhh.

311
00:31:17,964 --> 00:31:18,756
I'm older than you, remember?

312
00:31:18,756 --> 00:31:19,549
But Carmela...

313
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:20,812
Come on, Jenny.
Let's go upstairs.

314
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:23,134
So unfair!

315
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:47,004
Carmela.

316
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:49,117
Is there wi-fi here?

317
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,096
I hope so.

318
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:52,886
It has been 12 years,
since i last visited this place

319
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:56,270
I stil remember i held
my 7th birthday here

320
00:31:56,888 --> 00:32:00,189
I've been waiting for
you for a long time. Jenny.

321
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:02,675
You're all looking
beautiful. Emily.

322
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:04,051
Grandma.

323
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:06,027
Carmela...

324
00:32:14,937 --> 00:32:16,147
1...

325
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:16,939
2...

326
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:17,815
3...

327
00:32:17,815 --> 00:32:18,691
4...

328
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:19,567
5!

329
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:21,002
Seriously?

330
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:22,193
10 seconds?

331
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:24,102
Gosh! what has
been with grandma?

332
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:27,592
- Mom.
- Oh, David.

333
00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:29,118
We brought you something.

334
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,116
Oh, you shouldn't have.

335
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:32,930
Come on, girls. Get
inside the house.

336
00:32:32,955 --> 00:32:34,074
Alright.

337
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,707
Carmela, why did Grandma
look at you that way?

338
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,084
I dont' know.

339
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:39,387
- I know why.
- And why's that?

340
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:41,112
She probably thinks
you're quite ugly.

341
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:42,597
Wow! Jenny!

342
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:03,361
These paintings are beautiful.

343
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:34,548
Cool!

344
00:33:34,573 --> 00:33:36,118
It's like we're in a museum.

345
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,052
Don't you think?

346
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,989
Cool? More like creepy.

347
00:33:47,989 --> 00:33:50,822
These stuff are far
older than any of us.

348
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:54,453
Ghosts are probably
haunting this place!

349
00:33:56,664 --> 00:34:01,085
So that's why Mom said she insisted
on studying in Manila for college.

350
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:03,935
Because she feels as if there's
something weird in their house.

351
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:24,692
- Jenny, look!
- It's beautiful...

352
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:40,249
Carmela,

353
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:42,126
look. It's Mommy.

354
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:43,246
She's so pretty.

355
00:34:43,544 --> 00:34:46,080
It's too bad. You
didn't get to meet her.

356
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:51,052
Hey...

357
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:52,428
Don't get upset about it.

358
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:55,197
At least you got Mom's beauty.

359
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:56,599
Right, Jenny?

360
00:34:56,807 --> 00:35:00,478
That's right. We
both got Mom's looks.

361
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:03,564
Ohhhh, is that so?

362
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:05,366
Then how about Carmela?

363
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:08,009
Ohhhh...

364
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:12,323
So that's why Lola's
looking at you all weird.

365
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:14,700
So, that's how you
wanna play, huh?

366
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,175
Thank you.

367
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:46,236
That's Lucia and
her twin sister.

368
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:50,258
They are the daughters
of my friend, Choleng.

369
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:54,060
They are the ones helping
me around the house.

370
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,659
Go on, you must eat a lot.

371
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:59,499
- Have a bite. It's delicious.
- Here, have some relleno.

372
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:02,498
Emily, eat some vegetables.

373
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:03,892
- Here, vegetables.
- That's right.

374
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:04,960
Eat your veggies.

375
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:08,838
The last time you were here...

376
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:11,757
It was on your 7th birthday.

377
00:36:12,425 --> 00:36:14,677
Do you still remember
that, Carmela?

378
00:36:14,677 --> 00:36:16,929
Yes, Grandma.

379
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:19,432
Mom, I do apologize.

380
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:22,518
We haven't been
able to visit you here.

381
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,586
Don't worry about that anymore.

382
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:27,452
We have always talked
to each other on the phone.

383
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:33,074
Alright, you should all eat
now before the food gets cold.

384
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:44,467
What's wrong?

385
00:36:44,673 --> 00:36:45,949
It isn't to your liking?

386
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:53,395
Mom...

387
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:55,593
I just remembered Carmenia.

388
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:58,966
Her caldereta is
exactly like this.

389
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,380
Really, Dad? Mommy's
cooking was like this?

390
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:07,605
I taught her the recipe.

391
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:12,623
It was passed down
from my ancestors.

392
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:14,989
And that is why...

393
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:18,731
You kids must learn how to cook

394
00:37:19,492 --> 00:37:23,204
...caldereta like a Montecarlos.

395
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:26,832
So that you can also teach
it to the next generation.

396
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:31,962
But, Grandma... your
surname's not Montecarlos, right?

397
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:38,469
But our family came from the
ancestry of the Montecarlos.

398
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:45,434
That's why we are still Montecarlos.
And that will never change.

399
00:37:46,268 --> 00:37:50,898
No matter how many
generations pass.

400
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:53,000
So, learn how to cook...

401
00:37:56,111 --> 00:37:57,672
Caldereta.

402
00:37:58,572 --> 00:37:59,698
Especially you.

403
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:37,707
So dramatic. Am
I really that ugly?

404
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:39,657
But I'm very pretty!

405
00:38:39,682 --> 00:38:42,564
Why did Grandma
looked at me that way?

406
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:46,030
But in fairness...

407
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:47,872
Bet.

408
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,617
I like this room. It's very...

409
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:52,039
Very classic.

410
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:55,045
But it's a bit... scary.

411
00:38:55,101 --> 00:38:59,030
Why did Grandma made us
sleep in separate rooms? Gosh...

412
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,311
Carmela?

413
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:05,514
Oh my gosh!

414
00:39:09,268 --> 00:39:10,519
Carmela?

415
00:39:11,812 --> 00:39:12,897
Carmela?

416
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:15,778
Our Father who art in Heaven...

417
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,084
Holy be thy name.
Thy kingdom come--

418
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:18,193
Carmela?

419
00:39:18,485 --> 00:39:19,570
Child!

420
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:23,471
Grandma...

421
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:25,187
I thought you were
something else.

422
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:28,688
Why aren't you sleeping?

423
00:39:29,914 --> 00:39:31,536
It's too early, Grandma.

424
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:35,336
Actually, I would usually
go home by midnight.

425
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,545
- Is that so?
- Yes.

426
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:40,385
- You're not sleepy yet?
- Not yet.

427
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:44,259
Okay. Come with me. There's
something I want to show you.

428
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,584
Whoa...

429
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:00,974
Oh my God, Grandma.

430
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:05,658
I didn't know there's a
place like this in this mansion.

431
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:10,731
Oh my God... it's like
the National Library!

432
00:40:11,372 --> 00:40:15,072
Jenny will find this amazing
because she loves to read!

433
00:40:17,378 --> 00:40:18,753
Wow...

434
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,514
Oh my God, Grandma!

435
00:40:34,144 --> 00:40:38,691
This is just like the secret
doors I saw on movies!

436
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,651
Oh my God!

437
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:42,015
Follow me.

438
00:40:45,364 --> 00:40:48,158
OMG! Is this where
Grandma keeps her wealth?

439
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:51,078
I can't breathe. Inheritance
is waving! I'll be rich!

440
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:55,485
OMG! Is this where
Grandma keeps her wealth?

441
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:07,761
Come inside, Carmela.

442
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:11,640
Don't be shy. This is your home.

443
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:21,141
Okay... I'll admit. Grandma's
smile was a bit creepy.

444
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:27,197
But with all the expensive things in here,
I wonder how much I can sell them for.

445
00:41:34,279 --> 00:41:35,447
Grandma?

446
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,833
Why did you bring me here?

447
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:43,047
You know, if we also bring
Dad, Jenny, and Emily here...

448
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:45,132
They'll be excited
to see all of these.

449
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:48,068
I want you to meet someone.

450
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:50,041
What?

451
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:55,100
Meet someone?

452
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:57,586
So there's no inheritance?

453
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,277
Gosh...

454
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:02,898
Is Grandma hiding a hermit in
here that she wants me to befriend?

455
00:43:39,388 --> 00:43:40,956
Our love...

456
00:43:40,956 --> 00:43:45,553
will be rewritten on the
day of the fourth chance.

457
00:43:47,129 --> 00:43:48,179
nosebleed!

458
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,481
Nevermind.

459
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,070
It's time to party!

460
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:58,557
did you know, you almost got in
trouble? because of your foolishness!

461
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:00,392
Dad, what's this?

462
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:02,776
You're now a
collector of old stuffs?

463
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,898
Mother!

464
00:44:06,607 --> 00:44:07,774
mother!

465
00:44:13,822 --> 00:44:14,854
Where am I?

466
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,341
Where am I?

467
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:17,492
What is this place?

468
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:23,729
what's wrong with all of you?

469
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:25,959
there's no other way...

470
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:27,692
for you to go back to your time!

471
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:29,391
if you don't finish
your mission here.

472
00:44:31,673 --> 00:44:32,758
Miss Carmelita!

473
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,843
You should not end up together!

474
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:39,817
You have to keep yourself from
falling for him and him to you!
