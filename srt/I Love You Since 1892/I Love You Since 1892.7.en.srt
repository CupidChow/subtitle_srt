1
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:49,219
What is this?

2
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:50,688
Am I getting jealous?

3
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,888
This can't be, Carmela!

4
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:53,515
Erase, erase.

5
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,333
By the way...

6
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:56,910
Helena agreed to
go out with me.

7
00:00:56,935 --> 00:00:59,020
We're going to the
field of roses.

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,565
Do you want to come?

9
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,457
No, thanks.

10
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,109
I have lots of things
to do at home.

11
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:06,294
Good luck to the two of you.

12
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,282
Good luck.

13
00:01:07,946 --> 00:01:08,672
Good luck.

14
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:10,282
Please accept my heart

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,200
that only belongs to you.

16
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,347
Oh, Juanito. Since we're already here...

17
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:16,454
Why don't you sing a song

18
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,689
to Miss Helena as well?

19
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:18,953
Carmelita,

20
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,459
Explain yourself to me.

21
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:24,004
Juanito and I have decided

22
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:25,881
to do something

23
00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:27,173
to stop the wedding.

24
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,552
I am still in love with Leandro.

25
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:34,489
Carmela, why are you smiling?

26
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,682
Are you looking for this?

27
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:36,808
My love,

28
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:38,226
I am hoping we can

29
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:39,311
rekindle our relationship.

30
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:41,813
And if you and Juanito succeed

31
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:43,607
in stopping the wedding...

32
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:45,901
I hope you open up your heart again...

33
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,235
for Leandro.

34
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:53,737
I hope you open up your heart again

35
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:56,239
for Leandro.

36
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,472
I will not give up on you, my love.

37
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:24,100
I am hoping that you
will give me a chance.

38
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,519
Is this a song or a poem?

39
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:28,371
Gosh!

40
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:29,564
It's already midnight

41
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,649
but he's still bugging me.

42
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:34,944
Miss...

43
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:38,406
There's something I want to give you.

44
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:45,246
I did not forget

45
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:50,188
your strict instruction
since Mr. Leandro left.

46
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,547
You asked me to dispose of all his letters.

47
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:56,341
Even those that are to be delivered.

48
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,429
I apologize, Miss,

49
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,556
but I didn't throw all of it.

50
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:07,477
I thought there would come a time

51
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:10,355
when you would need to read his letters.

52
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:12,482
So that you may have a better decision.

53
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:28,498
Miss,

54
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:30,375
it's not yet too late.

55
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,045
It seems like Mr. Leandro
doesn't plan to give up.

56
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:37,173
I hope you won't give up as easily.

57
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:50,616
If Leandro didn't write
what his fault was,

58
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:52,056
I don't know what I'll do.

59
00:05:52,814 --> 00:05:54,732
I think I'll be reading
throughout the night.

60
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:59,863
17th of January,

61
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:03,700
Year 1891.

62
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:05,702
My dear Carmelita.

63
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:06,995
How are you?

64
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:11,374
Have you read the letters I've sent you?

65
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,795
You might still be mad at me.

66
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:18,381
I cannot blame you.

67
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,758
I want you to understand that

68
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:23,803
it is my dream to join the army.

69
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:26,222
Aside from Father's wishes

70
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:28,766
for me to follow in his footsteps,

71
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:30,768
it is also my own desire.

72
00:06:51,414 --> 00:06:54,876
I'm touched by Leandro's
efforts and principles.

73
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:57,253
He truly loves Carmelita.

74
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,007
Maybe Carmelita just acted dramatically

75
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:11,399
Carmelita...

76
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:14,854
I hope you'll give me a chance.

77
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:18,392
For me to prove how much I care for you.

78
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,881
I know it's not my place to forgive

79
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:24,239
on behalf of Carmelita,

80
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:27,408
but this is the only way

81
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:30,203
to fulfill the mission of
stopping the wedding.

82
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:32,670
Don't worry anymore.

83
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,457
I forgive you.

84
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,461
Are you saying

85
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,837
you're not mad at me anymore?

86
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:44,717
Just promise me that
you will not hurt me again.

87
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,965
Oh...

88
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:52,274
Apologies.

89
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:55,144
- I thought that...
- It's fine.

90
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:58,273
I forgave him but that doesn't me
I get to be his girlfriend.

91
00:07:58,815 --> 00:07:59,965
And...

92
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,367
what if my Father and Mother catch us?

93
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,070
They'll get upset,

94
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:06,098
right?

95
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,323
Carmelita,

96
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:09,200
our families are close to one another.

97
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,620
They are fully aware of our relationship.

98
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:15,415
I was about to ask your parents

99
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,040
for your hand in marriage.

100
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,876
But you became angry with me

101
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,004
when you learned that I'm leaving.

102
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:25,925
Gosh, if only Carmelita
didn't act like such a brat,

103
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:28,094
Leandro and her would still be together.

104
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:30,763
Juanito wouldn't be dragged into it

105
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:32,890
and they wouldn't have died.

106
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,142
Most importantly,

107
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:37,145
I wouldn't be transported into the past!

108
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:40,732
But don't you worry.

109
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:42,525
I will do everything

110
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,694
for us to be together again.

111
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,322
Leandro.

112
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,782
Do you really know me that well?

113
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:52,952
Of course, Carmelita.

114
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:55,705
If you love a person,

115
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:57,731
you know all the
important things about her.

116
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,211
What's my favorite food?

117
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,606
Vegetable stew.

118
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:08,968
Seriously? I don't even eat vegetables.

119
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:11,346
Is Carmelita a vegetarian? Gosh...

120
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:13,346
How about my hobbies?

121
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,059
Reading books.

122
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,185
Doing embroidery.

123
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:17,894
Dance?

124
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:18,978
Carinosa.

125
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,229
And Tinikling.

126
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:21,866
Games?

127
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,858
Is this a trick question, Carmelita?

128
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,860
You don't like playing games.

129
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,363
You're always cooped up in your house.

130
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:32,950
What do I fear?

131
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:39,874
You're afraid of losing me.

132
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:45,922
So, pick-up lines are
popular even then, huh?

133
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:49,050
Apologies. I was just joking.

134
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,471
You are afraid of bugs and beasts.

135
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,545
General.

136
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:16,369
Miss Carmelita.

137
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:18,955
What are you doing here?

138
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:21,124
Mr. Leandro.

139
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:26,838
He's just keeping me company on my walk.

140
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,673
Miss Carmelita,

141
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,843
my brother Juanito wrote to me.

142
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:35,430
He's asking why you are
not answering his letters.

143
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,722
Angelito,

144
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:40,685
it is not right for you to
interrupt adult conversations.

145
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:44,188
I was just really busy
with a lot of things,

146
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:46,086
that's why I wasn't able to reply.

147
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:52,196
You really do seem very busy right now.

148
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:53,406
Don't take it the wrong way,

149
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:56,659
but you will be in trouble

150
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:59,120
if anyone puts malice on the two of you.

151
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,259
Having said that...

152
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,625
would you rather just walk with us instead?

153
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:07,145
There's no need.

154
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,672
Our carriages will soon
come any moment now.

155
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:11,983
Very well.

156
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:12,967
We'll go ahead.

157
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:15,379
I don't want to be late
on my journey to Manila.

158
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:49,504
General Sergio doesn't know about
the plan to stop the wedding.

159
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:53,257
He might tell Don Alejandro!
I'm doomed!

160
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,752
I'll prepare your bath before we go.

161
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,892
Your family has been invited

162
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:05,329
to the birthday of the
Governor General in Manila.

163
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,564
Problem solved!

164
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,359
I can avoid Leandro with this.

165
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:13,903
And Don Alejandro would not suspect me.

166
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,066
I'll help you.

167
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:18,574
Do not bother yourself, Miss.

168
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:31,087
I'm sure

169
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:34,382
your Aunt Rosario will
be pleased to see you.

170
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,186
Aunt Rosario?

171
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:39,111
Yes.

172
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:40,680
Your mother's sister.

173
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:43,432
Her family has been invited as well.

174
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:47,353
Oh my Gosh!

175
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:50,898
I'll meet a relative who knows Carmelita.

176
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:53,317
What if she asks me about books?

177
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:56,362
Gosh! I need to do something about this!

178
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:33,858
This is the first time
you'll be able to attend

179
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,234
the Governor-General's birthday,

180
00:13:35,234 --> 00:13:36,694
isn't it, Carmelita?

181
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:40,906
Sorry.

182
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,950
I forgot that you don't have a voice.

183
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:48,623
Shouting nonstop to lose my voice
was actually a smart strategy.

184
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,541
Less talk, fewer mistakes.

185
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:02,845
Ladies and Gentlemen!

186
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:07,747
Tonight we celebrate
not only with good food,

187
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,713
but also with good company.

188
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,649
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

189
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,114
Music please.

190
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:27,536
Let us dance!

191
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:47,984
OMG! I missed this! It's time to party!

192
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:58,776
Carmelita., Dance appropriately.

193
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:00,653
Oops, I forgot about that.

194
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:03,364
They may have lived in a different time,

195
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:06,780
and we came from different eras...

196
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,586
one thing is for sure.

197
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:12,407
From today, they're a part of my life too.

198
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:18,045
Maestro, may I request
the traditional Cariñosa?

199
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:22,033
We invite the couples to the center
of the dance floor.

200
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:23,551
Cariñosa!

201
00:15:45,072 --> 00:15:46,490
Miss Carmelita?

202
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:51,829
May I dance the Cariñosa with you?

203
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,502
Focus, Carmela!

204
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:06,427
You must be sharp in copying the dance.

205
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:08,929
You must not get
distracted by Juanito's eyes.

206
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:04,610
Juanito is really good at dancing.

207
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:44,430
Thank you for letting me be with you

208
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,541
during your favorite dance.

209
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:02,269
You were wonderful,

210
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:03,771
Carmelita and Juanito.

211
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:07,441
I am glad to meet you, Mr. Juanito.

212
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:10,586
I heard so many things about

213
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:13,555
your handsome face and brilliant mind.

214
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:16,488
And you are such a gentleman.

215
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,385
That is not true.

216
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,533
Maybe the person who told you that

217
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,900
were giving too much compliments.

218
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:23,499
Mr. Juanito,

219
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:27,252
are you saying that my niece

220
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,921
over-praised you?

221
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,090
Wait,

222
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,677
I never said that Juanito is handsome,
brilliant, and a gentleman.

223
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:36,178
Apologies, Juanito.

224
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:41,308
Carmelita lost her voice
since we left San Alfonso.

225
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:43,769
Why, what happened to your voice?

226
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,206
Wondeful! wonderful!

227
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:48,482
I am left speechless!

228
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:54,415
It's unfortunate Helena
wasn't able to come.

229
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:56,343
I heard she was sick.

230
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,260
By the way, my friends,

231
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,829
my only son has returned.

232
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:04,974
Leandro cut his training short.

233
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:06,083
But he is in Cavite now

234
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,334
and would not be able to come.

235
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,948
Why did Leandro went
home earlier that expected?

236
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:15,092
An important thing was stolen from him.

237
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:18,679
He has to take it back
before it's too late.

238
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:36,947
Is that Juanito?

239
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:39,074
What is he doing here in Laguna?

240
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:40,951
Doesn't he have classes?

241
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:41,969
Carmelita,

242
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:43,412
what's happening to you?

243
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:46,165
You look like you've seen a ghost.

244
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:47,833
I think I saw Juanito.

245
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:48,959
Can I catch up to him?

246
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:00,736
Miss Carmelita.

247
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:03,123
What are you doing here?

248
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,684
Who are those candles for?

249
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:10,643
I wanted to pay my
respects to a kind family

250
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,634
who became close to me.

251
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,362
I heard what happened
to them just this morning.

252
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,619
There were witnesses who heard

253
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,037
their screams a few nights ago.

254
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:28,325
Their whole family was brutally murdered.

255
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,126
And their corpses were thrown

256
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:32,544
in the cemetery for criminals.

257
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,381
What was their crime?

258
00:21:39,343 --> 00:21:40,886
They were accused of a crime

259
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:42,429
I know they could never commit.

260
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,133
It's impossible for Nestor
to steal a bag of rice.

261
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:50,145
And Trinidad would never say

262
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:52,022
anything false against other people.

263
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:56,944
Killing their five children
was truly brutal as well.

264
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:01,299
Trinidad's family was murdered?

265
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,065
I promised Trinidad and Nestor...

266
00:22:09,123 --> 00:22:11,416
That I will not stop until I discover

267
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:13,377
who had them murdered.

268
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:19,529
It is important to recognize and address
the concerns of our workers.

269
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:21,844
Dear Diary...

270
00:22:21,844 --> 00:22:24,221
I hope my suspicion is wrong.

271
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:30,269
But I think Don Alejandro is involved
in the murder of Trinidad's family.

272
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:43,824
Carmelita!

273
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:46,201
We're gonna be late on
the road to San Alfonso!

274
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:47,619
Where is your sister?

275
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,288
We have to go!

276
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:57,629
I won't come.

277
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,217
What's wrong with you?

278
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:04,714
What are you saying?

279
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,972
Is there a problem, Carmelita?

280
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:10,390
Why are you suddenly
acting this way, Carmelita?

281
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:14,977
Doña Rosario,

282
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:18,400
did something happen
while you were out last time?

283
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,361
Nothing, Don Alejandro.

284
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:27,659
My gut is always right, so
don't bother covering it up.

285
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:31,872
I've learned my lesson,

286
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,241
When i said that it was Miss Trinidad
who asked for favor

287
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:37,926
Something bad happened to her family.

288
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:42,925
And now, if I mention Juanito,
he might get in danger next.

289
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:46,494
Answer me, Carmelita.

290
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:48,148
Did something happen?

291
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:52,059
How can you murder Trinidad's whole family?

292
00:23:53,046 --> 00:23:55,332
Carmelita, watch what you're saying.

293
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:58,284
Carmelita,

294
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:01,235
don't you ever talk
that way to your Father.

295
00:24:03,362 --> 00:24:06,031
I know that rumor is going around,

296
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:08,033
but I didn't expect my own daughter...

297
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:10,661
To believe in lies that were made

298
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:12,913
to ruin her Father's reputation.

299
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,752
If you don't want to be
around me, I understand.

300
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:21,370
Stay here if you must.

301
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:28,145
Thank you.

302
00:24:35,394 --> 00:24:36,447
I will go ahead.

303
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:41,754
Thank you very much.

304
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:43,944
God bless you.

305
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,626
Mother Olivia!

306
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:12,431
He's so vile!

307
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:18,353
We can't do anything about it.

308
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:20,731
If that's what's destined to happen.

309
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:24,651
Let's just pray for their souls.

310
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,072
Is that the way it's gonna be?

311
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:32,492
I could've prevented

312
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,077
a terrible thing from happening, but...

313
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:36,155
But I did nothing.

314
00:25:54,892 --> 00:25:56,727
That isn't your mission here, dear.

315
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:02,856
Focus your attention there.

316
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:07,027
If you continue meddling,

317
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:10,072
things will only get worse.

318
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:15,042
Remember this.

319
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:18,246
You are Carmelita.

320
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:24,419
She will never talk back to her father.

321
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,755
Unlike what you did.

322
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:35,347
Stay here in my room

323
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:38,475
until Helena gets better.

324
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:43,271
Josefina will be staying in Natasha's room.

325
00:27:08,171 --> 00:27:09,525
I'm just wondering.

326
00:27:09,923 --> 00:27:12,259
If I'm here now inside Carmelita's body…

327
00:27:13,844 --> 00:27:15,345
Where is the real Carmelita?

328
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:33,642
She's here.

329
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:36,366
You're holding her in your hands.

330
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,161
Her fate is up to you.

331
00:27:39,161 --> 00:27:40,412
Oh my gosh!

332
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:42,914
Is Carmelita inside there?!

333
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:44,107
In the diary?

334
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:00,640
Do not be afraid, dear.

335
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:09,232
Her mind and soul rest in this diary.

336
00:28:13,945 --> 00:28:15,030
She can't hurt you.

337
00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:21,334
Before you even came to this time…

338
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:24,796
She already knew that you would come.

339
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:27,237
To help her.

340
00:28:31,254 --> 00:28:33,071
Before Carmelita took her own life…

341
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:38,261
She came to the church first.

342
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,691
And prayed.

343
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,601
Juanito has been dead for a week by then.

344
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:50,190
I was also praying at the church too.

345
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:55,445
And I heard her prayer.

346
00:28:57,781 --> 00:28:59,908
I followed her out of the church.

347
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:12,048
Carmelita!

348
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:13,612
Carmelita!

349
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,552
If you will strike a deal with me…

350
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:23,139
You may be able to change
the fate of Juanito and yourself.

351
00:29:28,228 --> 00:29:29,454
By rewriting the…

352
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:37,487
Events that happened in
the past and changing them.

353
00:29:41,408 --> 00:29:43,702
I can stop Juanito's death?

354
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:47,685
Not you.

355
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:52,544
But a woman

356
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:54,963
born into the family
of your sister, Maria.

357
00:29:56,006 --> 00:29:59,593
She will be born with
your striking likeness.

358
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,932
She will rewrite your fate.

359
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:18,445
Using this diary.

360
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:20,852
She is the person

361
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:24,784
destined to change
your fate and Juanito's.

362
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,203
And what's the catch?

363
00:30:34,753 --> 00:30:35,879
You need to disappear.

364
00:30:37,422 --> 00:30:39,758
So that time may continue to pass.

365
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:45,096
I am ready to die if that's what it takes.

366
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:50,185
You aren't going to die, dear.

367
00:30:51,686 --> 00:31:00,278
Your soul with just
sleep inside the diary.

368
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:07,698
I'd rather wait years
for the destined woman.

369
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:11,777
And forget Juanito.

370
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,105
Than letting him die.

371
00:31:18,004 --> 00:31:24,094
And be haunted by our
memories for the rest of my life.

372
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:26,930
And my love for him.

373
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,938
Wait, Mother Olivia.

374
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:40,916
You said that if I finish my mission,

375
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,075
Carmelita will wake up.

376
00:31:43,697 --> 00:31:45,450
But she won't remember anything?

377
00:31:46,497 --> 00:31:49,835
But what about the sacrifices
that she made for Juanito?

378
00:31:51,112 --> 00:31:53,675
She will just wake up
like nothing happened?

379
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,545
She will forget about Juanito?

380
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,588
Why do you concern yourself with it?

381
00:32:02,465 --> 00:32:04,300
You know the truth of Carmelita's

382
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:07,929
unrequited love towards Juanito.

383
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:13,369
Ouch. I forgot that this
is an unrequited love.

384
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,440
The moment Carmelita first saw

385
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,441
Juanito

386
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:21,526
during Helena's birthday party…

387
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,545
She immediately fell in love with him.

388
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:32,120
Even though she knew
that Juanito likes Helena…

389
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:35,498
Carmelita still chose to love him.

390
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,585
OMG.

391
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,089
Carmelita met Juanito
during Helena's party?

392
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:47,302
But why did I met Juanito at UST

393
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:49,345
and then we were able
to talk in the convent?

394
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,244
I stopped you that night.

395
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:56,478
But you didn't listen.

396
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:02,609
That is why I don't know
how the next events will unfold.

397
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:05,659
It seems like

398
00:33:06,404 --> 00:33:09,324
you already changed
what is supposed to happen.

399
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:17,898
The one who will kill Juanito…

400
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:20,504
Is it still the same person?

401
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:28,134
Why didn't I read the diary
when it was first given to me?

402
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:31,304
Then I would have a
clue who's behind it all.

403
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:38,812
Maybe the situation has changed.

404
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:44,442
But the people behind Juanito's murder…

405
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:49,697
I'm sure it's still the same people.

406
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:52,217
Them?

407
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,517
So there's more than one?

408
00:33:56,955 --> 00:34:00,500
One cannot fulfill things
without the help of others.

409
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:05,921
You know, I think Don
Alejandro is a part of this.

410
00:34:06,414 --> 00:34:09,556
If he can order to
murder Trinidad's family…

411
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:12,595
It's not impossible for him
to murder Juanito as well.

412
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:16,750
Carmela...

413
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:24,357
Be careful with your assumptions.

414
00:34:26,782 --> 00:34:30,244
It's not enough that you
complete your mission.

415
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:39,414
You must also ensure the
safety of the Montecarlos family.

416
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:42,000
Especially Maria.

417
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:47,380
You are from her lineage.

418
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:56,055
It means that if Maria
fails to bear a child,

419
00:34:56,055 --> 00:35:00,101
Grandma Carmina, Mommy,
Jenny, and Emily and I

420
00:35:00,101 --> 00:35:02,695
will not exist in the future!

421
00:35:13,252 --> 00:35:16,797
I heard Carmelita went back to the convent.

422
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:20,617
And that she and Don
Alejandro aren't in good terms.

423
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,074
I may be the reason.

424
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,278
I told her about the
murder of Trinidad's family.

425
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:38,399
And she suspects that
Don Alejandro is behind it.

426
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:41,809
Is it true?

427
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,521
I can't tell for sure.

428
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:50,944
But I am worried about Carmelita.

429
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,617
Are you just worried or

430
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:01,955
are you starting to have feelings for her?

431
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:10,600
If you're in love with her

432
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:12,627
you need to be true to yourself.

433
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:15,217
And to Helena as well.

434
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:18,466
That I'm sure she's in love with you.

435
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:22,775
Juanito...

436
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:27,230
You need to be true to who you love.

437
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:30,858
But before you could do that…

438
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:34,404
You need to be honest with yourself first.

439
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,289
Honest with what you feel.

440
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:45,393
You need to talk to Carmelita and Helena.

441
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:49,123
And tell them the truth.

442
00:37:14,674 --> 00:37:17,468
Mother Olivia's revelations
were so over the top.

443
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:19,841
I'm more stressed than ever.

444
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:24,162
Good thing I found this
in Aunt Rosario's house.

445
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,872
I'm not the type to get drunk easily, but

446
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,083
this wine's no joke!

447
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:12,585
I can't!

448
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:27,683
Carmelita!

449
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:31,896
Carmelita!

450
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:32,969
Wake up!

451
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,538
If Father and Mother learn that you drink,

452
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:38,399
they will surely reprimand you!

453
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,155
Add that to the punishment you'll get

454
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:44,117
since alcohol is forbidden here.

455
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:46,883
Carmelita!

456
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,872
I never imagine you drink alcohol.

457
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:53,810
What would Mr. Juanito say?

458
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:56,129
That the woman he's about to marry

459
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:58,506
is out of her mind alcoholic?

460
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:02,593
What does Juanito have
to do about me drinking?

461
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:06,389
I don't care about what he thinks of me.
He can judge me all he wants.

462
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:09,684
Juanito was the one to took you back here.

463
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:11,602
- What?!
- You were too drunk and…

464
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:14,313
You were saying all these weird things.

465
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:17,108
How did he know where I am?!

466
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,068
He arrived here last night

467
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:21,377
but Mother Olivia
refused to let him enter.

468
00:39:22,363 --> 00:39:23,881
That's why I helped him.

469
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:26,200
I told him where he can find you.

470
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,076
In the kitchen.

471
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:28,862
There at the back, at the balcony.

472
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:30,514
Why did you tell him?

473
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:33,250
Because I support your marriage to him!

474
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,585
And I didn't know you were drinking!

475
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:14,123
You're so embarrasing, girl!

476
00:40:18,211 --> 00:40:19,324
Carmelita?

477
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:42,860
What are you doing here?

478
00:40:46,197 --> 00:40:47,677
I want to give you something.

479
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:08,135
Do you like it, Miss Carmela?

480
00:41:09,328 --> 00:41:12,058
How did Juanito know my real name?

481
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:15,977
What is this?

482
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,447
Do you remember the day I left San Alfonso?

483
00:41:21,472 --> 00:41:23,516
When I told you to meet me at the port?

484
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:25,736
Because I want to give you something.

485
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,201
Is this it?

486
00:41:32,076 --> 00:41:34,627
I was supposed to give you
another one at the pier.

487
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:36,580
But I thought…

488
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:40,594
That name suits you more
because of how naughty you are.

489
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:46,465
Is he saying Carmelita
sounds fair and lovely,

490
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:50,052
but Carmela sounds naughty? Crazy!

491
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,195
What are you trying to say?

492
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:56,892
Don't you remember?

493
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:00,229
Remember what?

494
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:01,856
Do I need to remember anything?

495
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:05,526
Everything that happened to us last night.

496
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:12,094
So it's true! Josefina
wasn't messing with me.

497
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:17,788
I know a way to help someone remember

498
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:19,582
when they've forgotten something.

499
00:42:22,293 --> 00:42:23,362
It's like this…

500
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:32,887
On the count of three, you'll remember…

501
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:35,865
One...

502
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:38,691
Two...

503
00:42:41,354 --> 00:42:42,381
Three.

504
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:47,511
I'm just kidding.

505
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:50,481
Don't force yourself to recall it.

506
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:52,336
It's better this way.

507
00:42:52,615 --> 00:42:55,659
You might avoid seeing me.

508
00:42:58,996 --> 00:43:00,289
Someone actually told me that

509
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:02,575
when it comes to embarrassing things…

510
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,797
It's better to pretend
as if nothing happened.

511
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:16,071
Come.

512
00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:17,538
I'll put it on you.

513
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:37,493
It adds to your beauty…

514
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:43,290
When you wear expensive jewelry
made with silver and gold.

515
00:43:45,084 --> 00:43:49,380
But I'm aware you prefer gifts
made with one's own effort.

516
00:43:51,674 --> 00:43:54,009
That's why I thought of giving this to you.

517
00:44:01,927 --> 00:44:05,034
This was the other
necklace I ought to give you.

518
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,964
I wanted to give it you at the pier.

519
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:11,861
But you didn't come.

520
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:16,269
I'm sorry.

521
00:44:16,296 --> 00:44:18,509
I failed to wake up early.

522
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:19,936
That's why I couldn't come.

523
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:24,165
If he only knew how much
I prepared for that day.

524
00:44:24,165 --> 00:44:26,375
But the things is, Helena
was going there first.

525
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:28,878
I went there early.

526
00:44:29,712 --> 00:44:30,830
I waited for you.

527
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,945
Speaking of Helena,

528
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,515
she told me she's going to
respond to Juanito's proposal.

529
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,640
What happened with you and Helena?

530
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:45,941
I was already aboard
the ship when she arrived.

531
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:49,356
I actually thought it was you who came.

532
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:55,270
Even the letters I've sent
you were left unanswered.

533
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:58,701
So, Helena wasn't able
to tell Juanito her feelings?

534
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:03,329
Yeah, actually…

535
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:05,761
it was Maria and Mother.

536
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:07,958
We're always going out.

537
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,294
I forgot to reply to your letters.

538
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:12,030
I'm sorry.

539
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,762
You forgot to wake up early…

540
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:24,211
You also forgot to reply to my letters.

541
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,652
You don't remember
anything from last night.

542
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:33,864
What else did you forgot?

543
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:45,504
I promise…

544
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:49,291
I won't ever forget anymore.

545
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:53,475
I hope you won't forget…

546
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:56,850
That no matter what happens…

547
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,753
And where ever I may be…

548
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:02,948
I'll wait for you.

549
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:26,779
Oh no!

550
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,286
I can't fall in love
with Juanito!

551
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:30,729
Miss, what are you
doing here?

552
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,377
What is it to you
if I want to get drunk?!

553
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:34,962
I don't even care!

554
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:40,301
Miss Carmelita, let's go.

555
00:46:40,687 --> 00:46:41,938
Her name's Cristeta.

556
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:44,466
A man wearing black came.

557
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:46,414
He told me I was safe.

558
00:46:46,439 --> 00:46:47,600
But I have to say that

559
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,402
Don Alejandro was
the mastermind.

560
00:46:52,057 --> 00:46:54,390
Don't you love
reading books?

561
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,396
I am feeling dizzy.

562
00:46:56,805 --> 00:46:58,165
Do you know
that feeling...

563
00:46:58,268 --> 00:47:00,382
It feels like I can't read
for a few months.

564
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:02,423
I am yours and you are mine.

565
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,185
That is what's written
in the stars.

566
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:09,453
Why are you two
alone in here?!

567
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:11,981
- We're not doing anything wrong!
- You're misunderstanding this.

568
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:15,836
Did Juanito gave you
a letter for me?

569
00:47:15,978 --> 00:47:19,773
He stopped sending me letters since he
came back to Manila.

570
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:21,008
Mr. Leandro.
