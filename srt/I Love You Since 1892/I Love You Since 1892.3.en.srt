1
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:21,114
One hundred and thirty two years.

2
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:23,225
Destiny had been waiting...

3
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:24,768
For this to happen.

4
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:30,732
Our love will be rewritten on the
day of the fourth chance.

5
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,443
Shae needs to know
that I'm having fun too

6
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:35,529
and my weekend's not boring.

7
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,992
Guys!

8
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:42,423
Sorry.

9
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:43,544
Were you hurt?

10
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:46,510
Shae... James confessed to me.

11
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:47,536
He said I'm the one he likes.

12
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,155
I only have James.

13
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,556
So, don't take him away.

14
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:54,260
James... I already told you
to stop bugging me.

15
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:55,185
Hey...

16
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,630
- No, please go.
- Come on. Let's go.

17
00:01:58,343 --> 00:01:59,343
Hey!

18
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,886
Ouch!

19
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:07,811
This is not your diary.

20
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,480
And it will never be yours.

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,280
Huh?!

22
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:11,832
How did you--

23
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:13,191
You were just there moments ago.

24
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,323
We should hurry!

25
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:10,702
What happened to you?

26
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:14,122
Are you hurt?

27
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,598
Why is your nose bleeding?

28
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:20,395
This is a prank, right?

29
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,631
My schoolmates are making fun of me again.

30
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,024
Tell them this is getting too old now.

31
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:27,761
Don't fool me or else...

32
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,454
And where did you learn that language?

33
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:34,639
Forgive her.

34
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:38,163
She might be tired from studying last night

35
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:40,190
- That's why she's acting strange.
- She called me Carmelita?

36
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,069
My ancestor? Oh no, is this a
side effect from the sleeping pills?

37
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:47,572
Helena, Nenita, Natasha... You go ahead.

38
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,575
I will take her to the
convent to get some rest.

39
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,994
Wait... Hold on!

40
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,657
Carmelita!

41
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:56,206
Come back here!

42
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,231
Wait!

43
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:04,899
So, I went back to the time of Carmelita?

44
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:10,435
I-- I think I'm gonna die!

45
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:20,230
Okay. I'm dead.

46
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,272
Miss?

47
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:36,861
Dad?

48
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:38,298
Carmelita?

49
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,651
How are you feeling?

50
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:44,060
Gosh. I'm still here?

51
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:45,712
I am not dreaming?

52
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:48,031
This is real. This is so real.

53
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,386
I've sent a letter to Mother and Father.

54
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:53,263
I'm sure you'll be able
to come home safely.

55
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:54,763
What?

56
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,062
We're sisters?

57
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,761
Ofcourse!

58
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:00,014
What are you talking about, Carmelita?

59
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,124
It is I, your sister Josefina.

60
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:06,821
Josefina? The one Grandma Carmina talked
about. Carmelita's sister who became a nun.

61
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,216
My gosh. I need to go back home.
How can I return home?

62
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,386
Where am I? What is this place?!

63
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:19,539
I cannot understand you. We're
here at Colegio de Santa Isabel!

64
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,958
You have to bring me back
to the place where you found me!

65
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,293
I want to go back home!

66
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,757
What is happening to you?

67
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,671
Carmelita!

68
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:27,564
Carmelita!

69
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:28,314
Carmelita!

70
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,549
Please, help me!

71
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,586
I don't care how high this is, I will jump!

72
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,219
Please, help me!

73
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,061
Carmelita!

74
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:36,556
- Carmelita, will you lie down?!
- I want to go home! Daddy!

75
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,445
- What's wrong with you?
- Daddy! Daddy, help me! No!

76
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,156
What is happening to you?
You are not making any sense!

77
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,064
Please! I need to get out of here!

78
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,406
Carmelita, calm down.

79
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,154
How dare you?!

80
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:54,231
Demon, begone from our sister's body!

81
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,676
Natasha, what are you doing?

82
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:58,787
Your sister is being possessed, Josefina!

83
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:01,206
- I'm not possessed...
- She's speaking another language.

84
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:03,625
Can't you hear what she's saying?

85
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,586
She doesn't recognize you
and she's saying she's not Carmelita.

86
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:10,272
I bid you, demon.
Leave our sister's body! Help me out here!

87
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,133
Let us pray!

88
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,928
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with you.

89
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,080
Blessed are you--

90
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:19,766
Let her go.

91
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:23,884
Mother Olivia!

92
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:25,980
You...

93
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,568
You...

94
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,112
It's you...

95
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,484
It's you!

96
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,056
What's wrong with all of you?!

97
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:44,415
Leave us alone.

98
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:14,114
Can you please explain to me?

99
00:09:15,113 --> 00:09:16,698
First, you stole my diary.

100
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,968
Second, you took me into this place.

101
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:23,478
And now, they're thinking
that I am possessed.

102
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:34,507
I want to go home.

103
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,761
I want to go home!

104
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:41,556
I want to go home!

105
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,021
First and foremost...

106
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:51,145
I didn't stole the diary.

107
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,534
I am going to return it to its true owner.

108
00:09:58,281 --> 00:09:59,699
Second...

109
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:02,691
I was not the one who brought you here.

110
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:04,954
And third...

111
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:08,166
You are the reason

112
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,295
Why they assumed
you are being possessed by a demon.

113
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,049
Okay...
Fine.

114
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:17,926
Whatever.

115
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:22,889
But I want to go home now.

116
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:25,892
How can I go back?

117
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:29,650
There is no other way
back to your own time...

118
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:33,860
Unless you finish your mission here.

119
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,580
Mission?

120
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,499
What mission?

121
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,021
You have to stop destiny.

122
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:48,790
You have to change what was written there.

123
00:10:57,131 --> 00:10:59,717
You and Juanito may never be together.

124
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:05,616
You have to stop him
from falling in love with you.

125
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:09,936
You cannot fall in love
with him in order to...

126
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,269
Save him from being murdered
on the day of your wedding.

127
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:24,246
She drowned herself in the lake.

128
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,706
Annoying!

129
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:34,127
She killed herself because of a broken
heart and now I'm tangled up in their mess?

130
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:37,422
What if I refuse?

131
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:40,049
What if I just admit to them that

132
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:43,261
I am not Carmelita?
That I'm from the future.

133
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:44,872
Alright...

134
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,557
It's up to you.

135
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,420
Let us see if they will believe you.

136
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:54,566
There can only be two possibilities.

137
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:58,693
First...

138
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:06,602
They may believe that
you are being possessed.

139
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:08,786
Or maybe...

140
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:12,560
They may believe you have lost your mind.

141
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:19,420
They may take you to all sorts of healers.

142
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:23,818
Until they leave you for
good in a far off island.

143
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:27,597
Why is there no good choice?

144
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:29,498
The moment that happens...

145
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:33,436
You will lose the chance
to go back to your time.

146
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:36,904
Hold on to this.

147
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:39,999
You are now it's rightful owner.

148
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,873
In nomine Patris, et Fili,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

149
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:12,779
I prayed for Carmelita to the Virgin Mary.

150
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,030
I hope she'll get better soon.

151
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:18,092
That's right.

152
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:21,087
Whatever is happening to Carmelita now...

153
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,803
I'm sure she'll get passed it.

154
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,334
Thank you, Helena, Nenita.

155
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:32,178
I'm glad Carmelita has friends like you.

156
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:39,019
Let us hurry. It is time to prepare dinner.

157
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:13,718
More things were written here before.

158
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,496
Where are they?

159
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:18,916
For now, nothing is written there.

160
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:25,533
We are in the time of June 1891.

161
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,132
What?

162
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,438
We're just in June right now?

163
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:38,102
But Juanito died on February 29, right?...

164
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:44,400
It means I have to stay for seven months
in order to finish my mission?

165
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,819
That's too long.

166
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,907
You and Juanito cannot meet each other yet.

167
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,407
But...

168
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,576
He has already laid his eyes upon you.

169
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:58,517
He saw me... But I didn't see him?

170
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:00,181
What do you mean?

171
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:03,985
He saved you earlier this morning.

172
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,839
When do I meet him?

173
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:08,528
He's heading here right now.

174
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:11,063
What?! As is now?! Now already?!

175
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:20,645
Mother Olivia. Mr. Juanito
Alfonso is waiting downstairs.

176
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:22,899
He wants to check on Miss Carmelita.

177
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:28,027
Tell him to come back another day.

178
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,242
Carmelita is not feeling
well at the moment.

179
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,159
What?

180
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:37,844
But I'm feeling fine.

181
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:40,456
I want to see Juanito. We need to talk.

182
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:42,208
It cannot be.

183
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:45,944
You still need to explain
yourself to the women

184
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:48,730
who saw you. Tell them
you are not possessed.

185
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:51,925
Go to sleep.

186
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:55,781
Think hard about your mission.

187
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,043
Where have you been, Nenita?

188
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,055
Have you forgotten about your chores?

189
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:10,069
I just opened the door for
the gentleman who visited.

190
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:15,412
You know it is not allowed to accept
guests in the convent at this late hour.

191
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:17,477
Poor Juanito.

192
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:20,143
Did you say Juanito?

193
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,500
It seems like he's worried about
Carmelita. That's why he came.

194
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:30,229
He might just wanted to check on her.

195
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:34,250
If that's the case,

196
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,764
then I hope he can give us an answer
as to why my sister is acting strangely.

197
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:41,851
May the Lord bless him.

198
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:55,645
Will I really be staying here?

199
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:58,377
No electricity.

200
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,418
No cellphone.

201
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:05,441
No internet! No wi-fi!

202
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,161
I can't stay here!

203
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,423
I need to find a way to escape from here.

204
00:17:16,677 --> 00:17:18,718
So, I just need to
keep Juanito from falling

205
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:20,640
in love with me to
stop him from dying?

206
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:27,291
That's easy. Why don't I just talk
to him directly so I can warn him?

207
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,463
I just wanted to check how
she's doing, Mother Olivia.

208
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:43,287
She might have other symptoms
from what happened earlier.

209
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:47,917
That's Juanito? The man I need to save?

210
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,352
I can't see his face,
but... he has nice body.

211
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:50,229
Don't you worry...

212
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:56,135
Señor Hidalgo gave me permission since
this is part of my studies in medicine.

213
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,213
Thank you for your concern, Juanito.

214
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,639
But I have to disappoint you.

215
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:03,948
Carmelita decided to rest early.

216
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,894
I'll go ahead. Please be on your way.

217
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:19,045
Sampaguita!

218
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:20,229
Sampaguita!

219
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,559
Sampaguita!

220
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:29,854
Oh God, please get away, dog!

221
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:32,487
Don't be loud! The thief may fall down!

222
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,838
Me? A thief?

223
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:48,399
Hi, it's me. Carmela who became
Carmelita Montecarlos of 1891.

224
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:53,431
Locking eyes with the man who
shattered her heart into pieces.

225
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:58,946
And broke her will to live after
her beloved was murdered.

226
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:04,949
Are you sure Carmelita will
be just fine, Mother Olivia?

227
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:11,026
Please excuse my worrying heart.

228
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,641
She is very precious to
our Mother and Father.

229
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:18,480
She's the youngest of our family.

230
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:21,963
Carmelita is a quiet and reserved lady.

231
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:27,252
If given the chance, they wouldn't
want to be parted away from her.

232
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:33,647
But she was allowed to study here
in Manila because I am here with her.

233
00:19:36,984 --> 00:19:39,195
I don't want to disappoint my parents.

234
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:44,667
She'll get back to how
she was before, Josefina.

235
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:47,833
I'll look after her.

236
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:53,684
Do not worry, Miss.

237
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:55,174
I'll catch you if you fall.

238
00:19:56,216 --> 00:20:01,649
I don't believe in love at first
sight. I don't believe in forever either.

239
00:20:01,674 --> 00:20:06,197
I don't even believe in
happy endings. But now...

240
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:09,831
Why do I feel like I want
to get shot by Cupid?

241
00:20:12,785 --> 00:20:14,036
Miss!

242
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:20,452
Ouch!

243
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:21,477
Miss!

244
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:23,846
Are you hurt anywhere?

245
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:25,352
Isn't it obvious?

246
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:28,854
What are you doing up there?

247
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,899
I'm a thief just like what
you said earlier, remember?

248
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:38,690
I thought men in this era were gentlemen.

249
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,823
Do you really have no
intention of helping me?

250
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:46,971
But, Miss, I can't be just careless
with my actions and touch you.

251
00:20:47,034 --> 00:20:51,851
Ah, right. People were more
conservative back in the old days.

252
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:03,713
Who's out there?

253
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,338
Come quick!

254
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:07,065
Who are you?

255
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,245
Let's go! Carry me.

256
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:19,419
Who's out there?

257
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:22,409
Take me there! Carry me, quickly!

258
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,463
Quick! You have to carry me!

259
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:27,152
There! Over there!

260
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:28,823
- Juanito, quickly!
- Alright, alright!

261
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,074
We almost got caught.

262
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:48,263
Wait, Miss...

263
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,924
How did you know my name?

264
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:54,497
Juanito.

265
00:21:54,873 --> 00:21:56,580
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

266
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:00,987
This man's a snob.

267
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,006
Okay, fine. Fine.

268
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:10,120
One of the nuns told me that you were here.
She spoke your name.

269
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:13,190
That's how I knew.
But that's not important.

270
00:22:15,994 --> 00:22:17,073
Juanito...

271
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,956
Whatever happens...

272
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,588
Don't you dare fall in love with me.

273
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,495
In love?

274
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:32,838
Right. People here aren't
used to speaking English yet.

275
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,760
What I meant was...

276
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,846
You must not give your heart to me.

277
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:45,856
Why...

278
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:47,315
Why are you laughing?

279
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,054
Miss... please don't take it the wrong way.

280
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:55,099
But the truth is, my heart
already belongs to someone else.

281
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:59,267
What?! I got rejected?!

282
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:02,557
Is there anyone there?

283
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,292
Who's out there?

284
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:07,625
Sampaguita!

285
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:09,663
Sampaguita!

286
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:11,364
Who's out there?

287
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:16,815
Sampaguita!

288
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:18,746
Sampaguita!

289
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:20,456
Juanito, dear.

290
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,584
- Mother Olivia.
- What are you still doing here?

291
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,237
I'm just looking for my dog, Sampaguita.

292
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,672
Sampaguita!

293
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:29,465
Sampaguita!

294
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,885
Sampaguita! Sampaguita!

295
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,221
Where did you go?

296
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:37,599
You must be on your
way, dear. It's getting late.

297
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,143
Yes, Mother Olivia.

298
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,161
Thank you.

299
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,354
Come now, Sampaguita.

300
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:10,382
Always keep this in mind.

301
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:14,540
Alright. Until our next class.

302
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,316
- Umm...
- Juanito.

303
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,816
How was your excursion last night?

304
00:24:28,442 --> 00:24:30,321
Did you examine the injured lady?

305
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:33,540
There was no dizziness or confusion.

306
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:38,642
Nor slowness in her responses or lethargy.

307
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:40,621
The lady is in good health.

308
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,935
Good.

309
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:47,461
I believe you'll become an
exceptional doctor, Juanito.

310
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:51,634
I'd like to ask permission, Doctor.

311
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,540
To be excused from
our class for a few days.

312
00:24:55,385 --> 00:24:57,471
My Father and Mother are
asking me to come home.

313
00:24:58,806 --> 00:24:59,806
No problem.

314
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:02,267
Are you coming back to San Alfonso?

315
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:04,018
Yes.

316
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:06,271
Gracias, Señor.

317
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,470
Carmelita, take a bath and get dressed.

318
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,644
Where are we going?

319
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,646
We're going home to San Alfonso.

320
00:25:51,213 --> 00:25:55,509
Don't worry. I won't
tell them what you did.

321
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:59,126
I was the only one who saw
you and Juanito last night.

322
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:03,762
I thought you were never
going to forget Leandro.

323
00:26:03,787 --> 00:26:06,874
Wasn't he the reason you
wanted to come here with me?

324
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:09,794
Leandro?

325
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:12,296
What a funny thing, love.

326
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:16,592
One can never be sure when
it will fall into someone new.

327
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Are you ready?

328
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:23,021
Our chauffeur is alreay here.

329
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,146
You're coming with us?

330
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:31,889
I won't allow you to mess up
what is destined to happened

331
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:35,006
That is why I'm coming
to keep an eye on you.

332
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:44,068
I can do it.

333
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,480
I'm a strong, independent woman.

334
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:59,509
I'm sure he'll keep his distance from
me since I was too aggressive last night.

335
00:26:59,962 --> 00:27:03,049
But that's good so he'll never be
linked to Carmelita now.

336
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,525
It seems like you're writing
all your woes in that diary.

337
00:27:17,782 --> 00:27:19,451
You shouldn't have done that.

338
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,157
What did I do wrong?

339
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,803
You shouldn't have met with him last night.

340
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:30,748
How did Mother Olivia
knew that I met Juanito?

341
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:33,201
You cannot hide anything from me, Carmela.

342
00:27:43,804 --> 00:27:46,682
Why did you push me into
the Arc of the Centuries?

343
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:49,142
It was painful and I tripped as well.

344
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:53,214
Dear, you must learn how
to be polite with your words.

345
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:58,800
Being respectful and having good manners
are important in this time period.

346
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:03,740
Of course. But why did you push me?

347
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,620
You still shouldn't have
met Juanito last night.

348
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,083
Expect that a lot of things that are
supposed to happen will now change.

349
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,422
And because of what you did,
your mission has become more difficult.

350
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,591
Yes, Mother Olivia.

351
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:43,256
It's been days since I
time slipped into this era.

352
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:51,277
Get ready. They're already here.

353
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:53,596
Is Mother Olivia a magician?

354
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,852
She's so good at appearing out of nowhere.

355
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:02,352
- Carmelita!
- Maria!

356
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:09,477
- Madre Olivia.
- How are you?

357
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:13,242
Madre Olivia, did my
sisters give you trouble?

358
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:17,767
I didn't have any problems with Josefina.

359
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:21,375
She's diligent in her studies
and is an obedient lady.

360
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:24,586
Carmelita on the other hand...

361
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,377
Is kind and is also obedient.

362
00:29:31,677 --> 00:29:37,933
Carmelita's reputation is good.
Oh God, I hope I don't ruin it.

363
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,871
My great great great grandmother
is standing right in front of me!

364
00:29:42,236 --> 00:29:48,157
She's so beautiful! Flawless skin and soft
eyes. In short, she's prettier than me.

365
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:55,987
Carmelita, aren't you glad
to see your eldest sister?

366
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:05,687
It's been six months since I last saw you.

367
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:08,422
I'm glad you're back home.

368
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:10,325
She's so sweet!

369
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:13,161
It made me remember Jenny and Emily.

370
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:16,992
I wonder if they're looking for me?
Are they worried about me?

371
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:21,776
Where are Mother and Father, by the way?

372
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,756
They're preparing for the festival.

373
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,657
Father has a lot of visitors today.

374
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,428
They're waiting for us at the house.

375
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:32,936
Come now. The carriage is waiting.

376
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,142
Maria...

377
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:38,937
I'd like to take Carmelita with me.
There's something we've got to go first.

378
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:43,473
Is that so?

379
00:30:45,437 --> 00:30:47,439
Josefina and I will run along then.

380
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:48,590
Good idea.

381
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,051
I will have Eduardo escort you.

382
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:03,023
My butt hurts from seating
too long in the carriage.

383
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:07,880
That is why we rest before moving on.

384
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:11,008
Be careful, dear.

385
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:13,805
Carmela, dear.

386
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:18,987
Don't forget that you are
Carmelita while you are here.

387
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:24,234
Yeah, it's fine, Mother. Don't worry...

388
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,845
Our names sound the exactly the same, so...

389
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,372
I can handle it.

390
00:31:29,015 --> 00:31:30,032
Dear,..

391
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:33,369
fix the way you talk.

392
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:36,507
People in this time
period don't talk that way.

393
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:39,505
Aside from that,

394
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:41,666
mind your actions. Don't
be unrefined or rowdy.

395
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,360
mind your actions. Don't
be unrefined or rowdy.

396
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:49,192
Maybe I shouldn't move at all?

397
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:51,962
You know, dear.

398
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:54,596
During this time...

399
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:56,840
Women are...

400
00:31:57,523 --> 00:31:58,941
very conservative.

401
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:01,868
They do not hold hands.

402
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:08,979
And they do not look into the eyes of men
who aren't their partners.

403
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,610
Remember that.

404
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:16,034
- Eduardo.
- Yes?

405
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,037
Return to our carriage
and keep an eye on our belongings.

406
00:32:19,913 --> 00:32:20,915
Thank you.

407
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:26,044
Dear. All that your eyes can reach

408
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:29,059
is owned by the Montecarlos family.

409
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:30,298
Wow!

410
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:32,467
Happy festivities, Mother Olivia.

411
00:32:32,926 --> 00:32:34,759
Happy festivities to you as well, Raul.

412
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:35,968
Where are you headed?

413
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,099
To the preparations for
the Thanksgiving Feast.

414
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:42,239
- Good. Take care, Raul.
- You as well.

415
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:46,329
Dear,

416
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,241
he is the father of Eduardo.

417
00:32:49,442 --> 00:32:52,987
He's been serving the Hacienda
Montecarlos for a long time.

418
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:56,488
Your crops are the main products

419
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,036
sold by San Alfonso to Manila.

420
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:06,410
That is why your family is
one of the riches in this town.

421
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:08,353
Wow...

422
00:33:35,365 --> 00:33:37,284
That is the Lake of Tears

423
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,527
that is connected to the Wailing River.

424
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,777
Lake?...

425
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:47,794
Wait... Lake of Tears? Isn't that the...

426
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:51,939
That is indeed the lake
where Carmelita drowned herself.

427
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:55,911
The real Carmelita.

428
00:33:57,507 --> 00:33:59,926
Gosh! Someone died there!

429
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:01,619
I'm losing it!

430
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,968
Mother Olivia, Miss.
We need to go now.

431
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:22,699
Alright.

432
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:39,569
OMG! This is the same as
Grandma Carmina's house!

433
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:45,207
But bigger, newer, and more elegant!
Seems only yesterday that I've been here.

434
00:34:47,276 --> 00:34:48,558
Remember.

435
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,378
They must not suspect
that you are not Carmelita.

436
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,144
Our most beloved youngest daughter.

437
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:18,433
Carmelita. Thank goodness
you came back safe and sound.

438
00:35:19,714 --> 00:35:21,465
- Come on.
- Let's head inside.

439
00:35:22,363 --> 00:35:23,614
This way.

440
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,574
- You look like you enjoyed your travels.
- How was your trip?

441
00:35:36,418 --> 00:35:39,160
My god! What will I do now?

442
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,916
So they're Carmelita's parent's then.

443
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:46,327
Don Alejandro, and Doña
Soledad Montecarlos.

444
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:03,257
Please take some rest.

445
00:36:03,282 --> 00:36:07,412
We're heading to
the Alfonsos for dinner.

446
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:21,824
Mother Olivia, aren't we
going to eat? I'm so hungry.

447
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,100
The mass earlier was too long

448
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:26,420
and I can't even understand a thing
since it's in Latin and Spanish!

449
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:29,787
Dear,

450
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:32,738
learn how to speak
respectfully to your elders.

451
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:39,222
You will be scolded by anyone if
they hear you speak like that.

452
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,470
- Amigo!
- Don Mariano!

453
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,263
We were a bit early.

454
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,433
I don't intend to keep you waiting,

455
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:53,269
but our dinner will be served shortly.

456
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:56,147
He is the Governor of San Alfonso.

457
00:36:57,273 --> 00:37:01,528
And beside him is his wife,
Doña Juanita.

458
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:05,073
And his right hand man,
Captain Corpuz.

459
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:10,370
Now, I'm delighted to introduce
you to my children.

460
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,206
Who bring us both joy and pride.

461
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:17,919
- This is Sergio.
- Sergio.

462
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:19,963
- This is Angelito.
- Angelito.

463
00:37:19,963 --> 00:37:20,963
And of course...

464
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:22,381
Juanito!

465
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:24,049
My god!

466
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,050
Juanito?

467
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:26,075
Juanito?!

468
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:36,854
Juanito.

469
00:38:22,328 --> 00:38:23,454
Thank you, mother.

470
00:38:23,692 --> 00:38:24,735
Eat up.

471
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,383
My gosh.

472
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,995
I forgot that he was the Governor's son.

473
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:35,931
I shouldn't have come here.

474
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:38,833
I'm remembering all the silly things I did!

475
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,439
Miss!

476
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,224
Juanito.

477
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,389
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

478
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:37,200
- Something's under the table!
- What? What's happening?

479
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:38,225
Wait.

480
00:39:40,765 --> 00:39:41,933
What's happening?

481
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:43,375
Sampaguita!

482
00:39:45,623 --> 00:39:46,833
Were you bitten?

483
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:47,859
- What happened to you?
- Juanito!

484
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:49,169
- I'm fine.
- Juanito!

485
00:39:57,124 --> 00:40:00,419
Dear, are you sure you're alright?

486
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:02,588
Yes, Don Marino...

487
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,503
I mean, Don Mariano.

488
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:07,046
I'm fine now.

489
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:10,608
Doña Juanita,

490
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:13,219
Don Mariano, I apologize but

491
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:16,292
it seems like
Carmelita was unharmed.

492
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,143
Good. What's important is that
Carmelita was not hurt.

493
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,104
If that's the case, then
let's continue with our dinner.

494
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,414
- Sit down, everyone.
- Very well.

495
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,440
Take your seats.

496
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:04,646
Seems like you enjoyed the food
that was served to us.

497
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,730
It was good.

498
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,840
Miss, this is for you.

499
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:26,053
What's that?

500
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:30,088
Just like before,

501
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:35,426
if Father or Mother asks,
you know nothing.

502
00:41:36,565 --> 00:41:40,736
Remember. I covered
up for you and Leandro too.

503
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:44,865
Again? Who's that Leandro anyway?

504
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:48,481
I'm heading out.

505
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,372
If Father asks, I'm in the bathroom.

506
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:03,075
My beloved,

507
00:42:03,325 --> 00:42:05,828
I am now here at our meeting place.

508
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:10,086
Under the mango tree that
has been a witness to our love.

509
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:15,466
I am waiting to see your beauty
that is unmatched in this world,

510
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,759
now and forever.

511
00:42:17,343 --> 00:42:20,263
Beauty that is
unmatched in this world?

512
00:42:20,263 --> 00:42:21,163
Why?

513
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,065
Have you seen the whole world?

514
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:27,186
The one who wrote this
is such a sweet talker.

515
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:35,331
Why do we need to worry about rebels?

516
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:36,489
Amigo...

517
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:41,325
As the Gobernadorcillo,

518
00:42:41,504 --> 00:42:47,426
I'm doing the best I can to listen
to every citizen's voice.

519
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,628
I want to make sure to hear all
their worries and needs.

520
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:58,856
That is why San Alfonso is very fortunate
to have you as our Gobernadorcillo

521
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,814
Right you are, Captain Corpuz.

522
00:43:01,387 --> 00:43:05,474
I saw his care for the people
during our time together at school.

523
00:43:08,227 --> 00:43:09,687
My family...

524
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:12,732
founded San Alfonso.

525
00:43:13,316 --> 00:43:15,693
That's why this town
is very important to me.

526
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:18,196
Your dedication is inspiring.

527
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,364
As you are, Alejandro.

528
00:43:21,824 --> 00:43:24,410
Your family business has
indeed grew more profitable.

529
00:43:24,676 --> 00:43:26,636
And you have helped so many people.

530
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,585
You know the hardships
my family faced, Mariano.

531
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:34,795
I've told you that.

532
00:43:35,652 --> 00:43:40,532
I do not want my family's effort
to be wasted nor our name to be tarnished.

533
00:43:42,747 --> 00:43:44,124
That is why I want

534
00:43:44,837 --> 00:43:49,591
my daughters to marry
into respectable families.

535
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:52,241
Cheers.

536
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,348
We're fine there at the convent.

537
00:44:28,108 --> 00:44:30,027
All right, I'll go ahead.

538
00:44:30,052 --> 00:44:31,387
They look so happy.

539
00:44:31,638 --> 00:44:34,808
My family is also like this
when we get-together.

540
00:45:11,246 --> 00:45:12,747
How are they doing now?

541
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,936
I'm sure they're worried sick about me.

542
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:34,582
Carmelita.

543
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:37,126
Where is Maria?

544
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:40,517
The thing is...

545
00:45:42,798 --> 00:45:44,300
Is he with Eduardo?!

546
00:45:44,717 --> 00:45:46,218
She met with Eduardo?!

547
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:51,057
Our servant? He's the one
writing to Maria?

548
00:45:51,057 --> 00:45:53,642
Hush your voice or
someone might hear you!

549
00:45:53,775 --> 00:45:56,110
Oh! For real?

550
00:45:57,792 --> 00:46:00,962
Listen to me.
We're about to go home.

551
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:06,572
Find Maria and tell her to come back
before Father looks for her.

552
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:08,991
I will buy you some time.

553
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:11,369
Why don't we just
tell them the truth?

554
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:12,495
They'll bound to find out anyway.

555
00:46:12,495 --> 00:46:15,706
That cannot be.
Father might kill Eduardo!

556
00:46:16,553 --> 00:46:19,764
You know that Eduardo
came from a poor family.

557
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:22,959
Father will never approve
of their relationship.

558
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,700
Go on. Look for her
before anything bad happens.

559
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:30,345
Alright.

560
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,361
- Where will I look for her?
- Miss?

561
00:46:43,371 --> 00:46:44,371
Miss!

562
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:46,833
Where do you think you're going?

563
00:46:47,831 --> 00:46:49,652
His tummy really stands out!

564
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:52,308
if only there were
probiotics around this time.

565
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:55,847
I just want some fresh air.

566
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:56,967
Right.

567
00:46:57,917 --> 00:46:58,917
You may not.

568
00:46:59,542 --> 00:47:00,242
What?

569
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,368
You may not do so.

570
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:03,504
Even if I'm with her?

571
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:10,678
Dear Diary, what the hell
is he doing here again?

572
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,139
Why do we keep crossing each other's paths?

573
00:47:13,383 --> 00:47:16,594
Is he doing this or is it destiny?

574
00:47:19,092 --> 00:47:20,969
I cannot allow this to continue.

575
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:23,566
I have to stay away from him, or else,

576
00:47:23,566 --> 00:47:25,776
I won't be able to go back to my own time.

577
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:27,385
Losing my mind,

578
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:28,696
Carmela.

579
00:47:29,022 --> 00:47:30,052
Miss.

580
00:47:32,032 --> 00:47:33,617
Where’s the mango
tree around here?

581
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,977
Are we leaving?

582
00:47:35,536 --> 00:47:36,903
Where is your brother?

583
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:38,911
Where is Carmelita?

584
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:40,666
You know the saying,

585
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:44,758
that when something
truly shameful happens,

586
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:49,020
it’s better to just think
as if nothing happened.

587
00:47:49,045 --> 00:47:50,535
Does it mean something else?

588
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,597
Your secret meetings
with Carmelita?

589
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:54,805
Carmelita!

590
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:55,930
Carmelita!

591
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:56,431
Young lady.

592
00:47:56,432 --> 00:47:59,059
You’re going to be late
for the early mass in town.

593
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,136
Is this a joke?

594
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:03,914
They say she was caught last night
with the youngest of the Montecarlos.

595
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:06,886
What is this rumor that
you are meeting another?

596
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:11,947
Juanito, I believe that you have
no relation with Miss Carmelita.

597
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,892
She wants you to clear
her daughter’s name.

598
00:48:15,117 --> 00:48:18,621
My friend, I would like to propose
that the wedding be held

599
00:48:18,621 --> 00:48:20,789
at the end of February
for the young ones.

600
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:23,125
What do you say,
Miss Carmelita?

601
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:24,668
What is it, Doña Juanita?

602
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,746
How many children
do you wish to bear?
