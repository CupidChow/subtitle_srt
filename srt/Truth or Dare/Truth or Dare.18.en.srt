♫ My little happiness is having you by my side ♫

♫ You're in my world ♫

14
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,090
Didn't you say there won't be a next time? Why did you kiss me again?

15
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,000
That's because... I like you.

♫ I want you to remember ♫

23
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,010
Could it be that you are that unwilling to accept me?

24
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,320
It's not like that.

25
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,950
I don't know what to do either.

26
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,040
It's all right. I don't need you to answer me right now.

27
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,210
Take your time to think about it.

28
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,970

34
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,390
You're right on time! Thanks, Bro.

35
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,030
Come, come.

36
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,580
I've already discovered a clue about the map.

37
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,620
What clue?

38
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,170
Let me tell you slowly.

39
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,920
Based on my talent and elegant appearance,

40
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,990
in addition to my wealth of knowledge and ability to rule the country,

41
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,930
- and the observation skills to understand the human heart—
- Uncle He.

42
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,700
Get to the point.

43
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,070
Inside Nan Batian's cane.

44
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,730
Inside the cane?

45
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,360
Look... An old man like Nan Batian

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,960
who has wandered many years in Jianghu,

47
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,140
had already lost trust in people.

48
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,740
There's only one thing that never leaves his side.

49
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,950
That is his cane.

50
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,190
Then... I will get his cane into our hands. He will be back here at the fort in a few days anyway.

51
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,340
- All right. Make sure to be careful, okay? Go on.
- Okay.

52
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,070
Wait, wait! Leave me the food.

53
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,070
Go ahead. Be careful!

54
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,550
Okay!

55
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,980
That brat!

56
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,190
He doesn't like me but instead likes that boulder-shattering chest.

57
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,230
Why are you here? Get out!

58
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,660
- I know you're still mad at—
- Stop talking!

59
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,150
I won't trust your words ever again!

60
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,920
I think that there's just one last step in your relationship with Xiao Bao.

61
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,370
You can't make him think you care about him too much,

62
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,690
or else he won't cherish you.

63
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,190
Then what should I do?

64
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,030
How about this? Isn't the chief returning in a few days?

65
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,620
You can personally cook a feast to welcome him back.

66
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,530
This way, you can first show yourself off.

67
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,210
Secondly, it will let Xiao Bao feel a sense of crisis.

68
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,810
To let him see how many brothers of the fort admire you.

69
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,490
This is the last time I'll trust you.

70
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,910
If you dare to trick me again, I'll kill you for sure!

71
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,300
- Brother Six.
- Hey.

72
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,160
Why are you here? Are you feeling sick?

73
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,200
It's like this. Xiao Bao is feeling a bit constipated so I came to get him some medicine.

74
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,670
Look... I told him long ago to drink less and eat less meat.

75
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,510
He's made himself suffer now, right?

76
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,110
Wait a moment. I'll go get the medicine.

77
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,700
You must remember to control the dosage of the medicine.

78
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,270
This medicine is very strong.

79
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,690
It'll be enough for him to have diarrhea covering hundreds of miles.

80
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,430
Don't worry, Brother Six. I'll tell him that for sure.

81
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,880
Okay, go on.

82
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,820
Before, when I told you I was going to learn to cook, you laughed at me.

83
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,710
Look here. You have nothing to say now, right?

84
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,390
I have been mistaken.

85
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,650
My precious daughter, you've worked hard to make this many dishes for me.

86
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,510
I'll punish myself with a cup of alcohol.

87
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,310
Don't drink wine yet. Hurry and try it.

88
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,760
As long as it's made by my Nan Xiang, I will like it.

89
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,580
How is it?

90
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,330
Very good.

91
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,060
Nan Xiang is truly pretty and talented.

92
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,100
Bandit Chief, you are very fortunate.

93
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,340
You finally said some decent words. Here, a toast to you,

94
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,890
- Brother Wu.
- Cheers.

95
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,260
It looks like Boulder-Shattering Chest's idea is not bad.

96
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,990
I'll let Xiao Bao sense my femininity from now on.

97
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,530
Xiao Bao,

98
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,260
how is the task I gave you coming along?

99
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,850
Godfather, don't worry. I'll definitely capture Night-Spirited Hero as soon as possible.

100
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,290
There isn't much time left.

101
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,360
Don't worry, Godfather.

102
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,020
Xiao Wanzi.

103
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,540
Yes, Chief?

104
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:03,140
When I was away, you've recovered quite well.

105
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,030
These days, I've been mostly with Nan Xiang.

106
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,200
We've been pretty happy every day, so I've been able to recover quite quickly.

107
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,550
Good, good, good.

108
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,330
Here. I'll pour you a cup of wine, Chief.

109
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,930
Sure!

110
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,950
Bandit Chief, I'll go and get you another bowl.

111
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,160
I didn't scare you did I?

112
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,830
Good, good.

113
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,970
Drink this, Chief.

114
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,570
Okay.

115
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,880
Good wine.

116
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,690
- Hurry and sit.
- All right.

117
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,460
Dad! What are you doing?

118
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,380
Well— This—

119
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,120
I can't hold it anymore. I'm going to go take care of big business.

120
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,350
- Godfather!
- Yes?

121
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,850
How about... I go with you?

122
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,860
I am all right.

123
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,030
Dad! Hurry and go, Dad!

124
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,480
Enough, stop fanning. Hurry and eat.

125

[For Chief's Exclusive Use]

127
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,820
What are you doing here?

128
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,550
This is the latrine exclusive to the chief.

129
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,630
I came to the wrong place.

130
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,490
Then, what are you doing with Godfather's cane?

131
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,170
What are you doing with my cane?

132
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,550
Lately, I noticed your walking posture doesn't look too comfortable.

133
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,110
I was wondering if your cane had any problems.

134
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,540
I was examining it. Look how damaged the bottom is.

135
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,250
- I was thinking about— -
- Give it back!

136
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,030
Don't touch what you shouldn't touch. Do you understand, Xiao Bao?

137
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,700
Yes.

138
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,920
Come with me.

139
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,100
What exactly did you want to do with my godfather's cane?

140
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,720
Xiao Bao, just don't meddle with my business.

141
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,250
Wanzi, don't play with fire.

142
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,670
My godfather's body may not be as well as in the past,

143
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,710
but he's still as cruel and merciless as back in the day.

144
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,700
All right. I got it.

145
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,280
Come, come. Hurry, Princess.

146
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,890
How did it go? Was it in the cane?

147
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,240
I got the cane,

148
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,590
but there weren't any mechanisms nor map inside.

149
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,130
Nothing?

150
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,250
Did you look carefully?

151
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,120
I looked carefully.

152
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,180
I won't be able to see my Wanzi.

Why?

166
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,560
Why is he the Night-Spirited Hero?

167
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,160
Why is he the Junior General?

168
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,760
And I'm... just someone who shatters boulders.

169
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,730
If... If the princess doesn't come back...

170
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,600
No, this won't do! Xiao Wanzi, you promised you would return everything to the princess.

my heart obviously can't let him go.

189
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,280
Xiao Wanzi?

190
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,680
Xiao Wanzi, what is it?

191
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,540
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

192
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,600
Did something happen between you and Prince Consort again?

193
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,310
No! We are quite well.

194
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,880
Quite well? Then, why have you been avoiding him?

195
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,360
Did something happen again?

196
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,480
I'm not avoiding him.

197
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,920
We're just... getting along harmoniously.

198
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,660
Can we not do that?

199
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,610
It's not that you can't. Qiu Hua didn't mean it that way.

200
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,710
It's just that you two are usually bickering with each other,

201
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,190
and now you are suddenly saying you two are quite well

202
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,910
so we think it is a bit strange. Right, Qiu Hua?

203
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,810
Yes, yes!

204
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,100
Specifically, how well have you been with Prince Consort?

205
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,450
Just...

206
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,020
Mutually respectful.

207
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,850
We respect each other like guests and mind our own business.

208
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,540
That's good then.

209
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,290
Actually, I'm still a bit worried about Uncle He and Princess.

210
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,620
Say, it's been so long yet we've heard nothing from them.

211
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,320
That's right. I wonder how they are.

212
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,970
If they have enough food or if they are warm.

213
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,520
Although my dad is experienced in Jianghu,

214
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,460
he is cowardly and is addicted to gambling.

215
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,410
I really am worried about him.

216
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,070
Don't worry. I will go make inquiries about him when I have a chance to leave the manor.

217
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,740
Once I hear any news about them, I'll tell you two right away.

218
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,710
Actually, a blessed person is naturally cared for by Heaven.

219
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,600
Xiao Wanzi, you're a good girl.

220
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,880
Heaven will not mistreat you.

221
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,040
[Mei Shiqing]

222
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,000
[Mei Shiqing]

223
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,790
[Mei Shiqing]

224
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,660
Young Master, what are you thinking about?

225
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,580
Why do you ask that?

226
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,070
I'm just curious.

227
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,620
Place your focus on serious matters.

228
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,150
Thoroughly investigate the sales of contraband salt.

229
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,850
Oh right! A'Rou seems to have found some clues.

230
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,240
Young master, weren't we going to—

231
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,170
Young master, didn't we say we're going to...

232
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,910
Oh, I thought of it!

233
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,080
Yesterday, you told me to especially order a roast goose for the princess.

234
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,050
Ruyi Restaurant already cooked it and is waiting for you to go eat it.

235
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,640
Roast goose?

236
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,440
A roast goose fresh out of the oven tastes the best.

237
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,640
Let's go together.

238
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,370
I won't go.

239
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,310
That's a shame.

240
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,340
Then stay at home and rest well.

241
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,500
I'll have someone stew some soup to bring back for you.

242
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,230
- Siheng, let's go.
- Let's go.

243
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,800
Are you going to Ruyi Restaurant because there's new information about the contraband salt?

244
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,530
Yes, but in regard to the contraband salt matter,

245
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,740
the less you know, the safer you'll be.

246
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,660
- But—
- No but's.

247
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,320
Just stay here honestly.

248
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,690
Siheng, have the guards watch her. Don't let her out.

249
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,270
Yes.

250
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,760
Those matters are completely separate.

251
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,240
I will still make an effort regarding carrying out justice.

252
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,960
Young Master, aren't we going to Ruyi Restaurant?

253
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,700
What are we doing here?

254
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,880
You'll know in a bit.

255
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,700
Look.

256
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,450
What a coincidence!

257
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,690
Why are you two here as well?

258
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,150
We're here to catch a mouse.

259
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,390
Siheng, escort the princess back to her own room.

260
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,050
No need, no need! It's fine. I can go back myself.

261
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,540
Excuse me.

262
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,080
Princess and her passion for justice

263
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,980
are quite suitable to you.

264
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,940
I think your passion for justice should be cultivated.
 (T/N: suitable and cultivate sound the similar)

265
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,000
No need! No need! I have already been inspired by your passion.

266
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,250
I am already very content.

267
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,180
Aren't we going to Ruyi Restaurant?

268
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,980
Right? Let's go!

269
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,520
Let's go.

270
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,330
How could they possibly stop me?

271
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,420
Young Master, the scouts have sent us news.

272
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,980
A few days ago, Wang Biao indeed went to the Green Dragon Fort with hefty gifts.

273
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,200
These two groups are the same.

274
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,640
They are definitely up to no good.

275
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,440
Soon after that, the fake Night-Spirited Hero made an appearance.

276
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,880
Actually, I suspect he's someone from the salt gang.

277
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,980
They had someone dress up as Night-Spirited Hero to lure me out.

278
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,130
But after fighting with the person, I find his fighting techniques to be very familiar.

279
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,070
If I'm right, then he is that mountain monkey from the Green Dragon Fort.

280
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,880
There's another matter.

281
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,410
I have yet to confirm whether this is related to the contraband salt.

282
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,150
I investigated the origins of the money going to the Paradise Gambling House.

283
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,460
It doesn't seem to be only from Green Dragon Fort.

284
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,710
Are you saying that they are also related to the salt gang?

285
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,260
Turns out Paradise Gambling House is in connection with the Green Dragon Fort.

286
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,070
Paradise Gambling House is owned by the Green Dragon Fort.

287
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,130
If that's the case, then there are many people who are involved in this beneficial line of business.

288
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,310
A'Rou, you have to keep an eye out at all times.

289
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,960
If there's news, be sure to tell me.

290
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,850
All right.

291
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,040
Young Master, do you think this matter has to do with Situ—

292
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,490
Come in, little mouse.

293
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,180
How did you know I was outside?

294
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,160
You've been eating a bit much recently.

295
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,570
Your footsteps are a bit heavy.

296
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,110
Princess, fortunately, our Young Master knew it was you.

297
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,220
If it was someone else, I would have drawn my knife

298
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,070
and beheaded you.

299
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,950
I was clearly very careful already.

300
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,850
What am I going to do with you? You don't want to come with me when I ask,

301
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,070
yet now you sneak out. Does that make you happy?

302
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,870
Yes! That makes me happy.

303
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,140
Fine. I'm going out for some air.

304
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,010
Siheng, eat it all. Don't let it go to waste.

305
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,110
Just go by yourself.

306
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,450
Darn.

307
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,580
Mei Shiqing and I can't continue like this.

308
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,940
Please let the princess return soon so all this will end.

309
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,520
Just now, I heard A'Rou say Paradise Gambling House is connected to Green Dragon Fort.

310
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,560
Then can I use Paradise Gambling House to get news about Green Dragon Fort?

311
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,670
Perhaps I can find out where my father and the princess are.

312
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,160
What bad idea are you thinking about? Do you want to go to the gambling house again?

313
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,180
No, no, no! Don't falsely accuse an innocent person.

314
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,510
Last time, I almost lost my life fighting that fake Night-Spirited Hero.

315
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,940
I don't dare do that again.

316
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,920
- Really?
- Really.

317
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,550
I need to keep this mouth on my face

318
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,960
to eat good food.

319
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,270
This reason is something that applies to you. I will trust you this once.

320
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,780
Stinky tofu!

321
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,150
Do you smell something especially delicious?

322
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,450
Stinky tofu!

323
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,780
Stinky tofu!

324
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,520
Stinky tofu!

325
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,960
- Boss, I'll have one serving of stinky tofu.
- All right.

326
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,210
- No, no! It's too stinky, Boss.
- I want it, I want it.

327
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,790
Give me lots, Boss.

328
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,490
My goodness!

329
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,840
- Here. You can get what you want on top.
- Have you never eaten stinky tofu before?

330
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,940
- No.
-You've never eaten such delicious food before?

331
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,770
- Hurry and pay.
- How much is it?

332
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,130
One wen.

333
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,990
So expensive.

334
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,500
I'm not eating it.

335
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,330
How is it? Is it good?

336
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,630
It's... all right.

337
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,280
If you don't like it then the rest is mine.

338
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,970
Boss.

339
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,620
Two more bowls.

340
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,040
Okay!

341
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,750
What is it? You're being so secretive.

342
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,180
I heard someone at Ruyi Restaurant say that Paradise Gambling House belongs to Green Dragon Fort.

343
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,550
- Really?
- This news is very dependable.

344
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,840
If that's the case, we can get news about Green Dragon Fort at the gambling house.

345
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,740
Smart. Perhaps we can get news about my father and the princess this way.

346
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,080
But...

347
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,860
The gambling house's steward, Chi Feng, isn't an easy person to deal with.

348
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,980
What do we need to do to get him to cooperate obediently with us?

349
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,790
Don't worry about that. I already thought of a way.

350
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,750
What way?

351
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,610
Just meet up with me outside.

352
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,280
No way, that's too dangerous! How about I go instead?

353
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,250
I have my way. You just have to trust me.

354
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,810
Small! Small!

355
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,920
Catch him!

356
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,370
Irrelevant people leave quickly. I'm just here to see the steward.

357
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,720
Let's go. Let's go.

358
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,030
If you have something to say, can't you say it politely?

359
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,770
This... pulling out weapons like this,

360
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,680
why are you doing this?

361
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,810
I came today to get some information from you.

362
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,220
Answer honestly, or else I'll take your cheap life!

363
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,130
You are the famous Night-Spirited Hero.

364
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,920
Why did you especially come to find an insignificant person like me?

365
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,230
Green Dragon Fort's matter.

366
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,570
Green Dragon Fort?

367
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,110
Then you should go ask someone from Green Dragon Fort.

368
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,800
Why are you here to see me?

369
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,680
I know you are connected to the Green Dragon Fort. Answer honestly.

370
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,740
Do you know a person named He Yizhi?

371
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,950
I don't know. Never met him before.

372
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,120
- Will you sat or not?
- I will, I will.

373
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,340
There is someone like that.

374
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,510
How has he been lately?

375
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,930
He is living very well right now.

376
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,440
I heard that Nan Batian is treating him as his father-in-law.

377
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,810
He is eating and drinking well every day.

378
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,340
As far as I know, He Yizhi's daughter

379
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,020
was also abducted by you all to Green Dragon Fort.

380
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,150
- Did you make things hard on her?
- No, definitely not!

381
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,600
After that girl went up the mountain,

382
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,550
she caught some strange illness where pimples grew all over her face.

383
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,920
No one dares to go near her. I personally saw it.

384
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,580
You personally saw it?

385
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,240
- When?
- The first...

386
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,600
of this month

387
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
The first?

388
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,330
Looks like the people of the gambling house go to the Green Dragon Fort on the first of the month.

389
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,830
Boss!

390
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,720
Are you okay?

391
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,450
Do you know you were wrong?

392
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,440
How was I wrong?

393
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,900
You promised me you wouldn't go to the gambling house, yet you still went to mess around.

394
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,470
How was I messing around? I clearly...

395
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,310
stunned them all.

396
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,500
If I... If you waited a bit longer, I would have gathered more information.

397
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,130
Do you know you nearly lost your life earlier?

398
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,350
If I hadn't gotten there in time, then you wouldn't be alive now.

399
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,940
But you can't catch the tiger cubs without entering the tiger's lair.

400
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,580
How can you accomplish great things if you're always so careful?

401
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,180
I find that you are such a brawny simpleton.

402
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,120
I clearly gathered information.

403
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,920
Why do you always think I have no plan and am causing trouble?

404
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,520
Even though my martial arts...

405
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,880
I don't have kungfu, but at least I'm very strong.

406
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,040
Let me tell you. If you keep messing around like this, then I'm taking back the cloak and the bracelet!

407
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,810
I gave you these in order to protect you, not for you to go messing around out there.

408
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,070
Then, I'll return it to you. I'll return it all to you! I don't want to have any ties with you!

409
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:26,040
I don't want to have any ties with you anymore!

410
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,060
You idiotic meatball!

411
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,180
If you don't want it, fine!

412
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,780
Qiu Hua!

413
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,510
Stop right there!

414
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,840
Stop right there.

415
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,650
Why are you avoiding me?

416
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,920
I'm not. I just suddenly remembered that I'm boiling water in the kitchen. I have to go take a look.

417
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,150
I only told you about going to the Paradise Gambling House.

418
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,260
- Why does Third Young Master Mei know about it?
- Really?

419
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,140
Prince Consort is indeed well-informed.

420
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,400
He even knew about that.

421
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,350
Pretend. Keep pretending.

422
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,420
Fine, I admit it. I told him.

423
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,740
I trust you so much, yet you sold me out.

424
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,910
I'm going to shatter you like a boulder!

425
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:04,290
I was just worried about you! You're a girl and you went to a bandit hideout alone.

426
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,360
- You make people so worried.
- Enough.

427
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,330
I forgive you for now seeing that you were worried about me.

428
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,740
- This should not be a next time.
- Got it. There's no next time.

429
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,200
Since you went yesterday, what did you find out anything?

430
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,930
I found out that my dad and the princess are living well for now at the Green Dragon Fort.

431
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,710
- So I feel reassured for now.
- That's great! As long as they are okay!

432
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,800
But... I heard that the chief of the Green Dragon Fort, Nan Batian, has his eyes on the princess.

433
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,750
So if we keep delaying things like this, I'm afraid that the princess...

434
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,780
I've decided. I'll go save them earlier than we agreed.

435
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,770
That way, the princess can return sooner, too.

436
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,140
That won't do. I have to go save them now.

437
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,070
Don't rush it. There are a lot of people at Green Dragon Fort,

438
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,040
even officers and soldiers cannot do anything to them.

439
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,230
What can you do going there alone?

440
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,690
- What else can we do? We can't just stay here and wait.
- I have an idea.

441
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:57,210
I need your and Qiao Yun's help with the specifics.

442
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:02,730
As long as I can save the princess, I am willing to traverse mountains of blades and seas of fire.

443
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,590
That's enough. As long as you promise to not tell Third Young Master Mei,

444
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:10,410
- it'll do.
- All right, I promise.

445
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,000
Why is it so quiet today?

446
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,670
Why is there no chitter-chatter like usual?

447
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,650
- Siheng!
- Coming!

448
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,910
- Mei Siheng!
- Coming!

449
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,470
- What is it, Young Master?
- Are you hungry? Do you want to go to Ruyi Restaurant to eat?

450
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,650
Young Master, I just ate so I'm not hungry at all.

451
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,370
Are you really not hungry?

452
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,770
I heard that Ruyi Restaurant has a new dish.

453
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,710
There are also a lot of people who are lining up to eat it. It's especially delicious.

454
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:51,660
Since there are so many delicacies, why don't we go together?

455
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,260
Forget it, I'm actually not that hungry either.

456
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,110
- Then, if there's nothing else, I'll...
- Go, go, go.

457
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:51,180
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

458
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:57,910

00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:06,000

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:27,790
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,440

00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,890
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

474
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,520
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

475
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,290
♫ My treasured memories ♫

476
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:51,430
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

477
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:55,150
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

478
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:59,010
♫ It's me missing you ♫

479
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:08,470
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫
