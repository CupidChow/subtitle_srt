[Heroic Couple]

4
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,650
-You are the Night-Spirited Hero?
- Besides me, who else can it be?

5
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,180
Officer, I already said that he would get revenge.

6
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,140
Hurry and capture this bad guy!

7
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,750
Night-Spirited Hero, it'll be hard for you to escape today so just hurry and surrender.

8
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,930
You want to use the local authorities to catch me? I am afraid your plan is going to go to waste.

9
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,870
This Guo Baiwan sold contraband salt, breaking the country's law

10
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,650
and harming the common people. He's the person you should capture.

11
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,480
Officer, you mustn't listen to him.

12
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,870
Night-Spirited Hero, stop talking in circles.

13
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,480
Come with us and the truth will naturally be revealed.

14
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,560
- What are you doing!
- Don't worry, it is not a secret weapon.

15
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,890
This shows where Guo Baiwan is hiding his contraband salt.

16
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,340
If you don't believe me, go there to take a look for yourselves.

17
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,440
Night-Spirited Hero, you really are as the rumors say.

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,720
If you and I collaborate, we will definitely be able to achieve great deeds.

19
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,510
Why are you dreaming in broad daylight?

20
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,890
Don't leave a single person alive.

21
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,870
Hurry up and leave!

22
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,140
- Chase them!
- Yes. Chase!

23
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,880
- Search!
- Yes.

24
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,100
- Go search that way!
- Yes!
- Hurry!

25
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,720
They have left.

26
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,440
You. Didn't I tell you to not follow along? Why did you still follow me?

27
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,580
I wanted to help you. I was afraid you would be in danger so I came.

28
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,770
You're causing more trouble, not helping. Following me not knowing anything is dangerous! Aren't you afraid of death!

29
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,550
Even the Night-Spirited Hero isn't afraid so, of course, I'm not afraid.

30
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,260
- I am worried about you—
- All right. All right, stop talking.

31
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,900
In regards to my actions just now

32
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,620
and my aid, do you not have anything to say about that?

33
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,170
It wasn't easy to escape, so why are you so serious?

34
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,630
Do you really... not have anything else to say?

35
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,600
Is it that hard to say 'Thank you'?

36
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,400
- Thank you!
- What?

37
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,410
I deserve to die. It was not easy to lure the Night-Spirited Hero out,

38
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,530
yet I let him escape again.

39
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,740
You can kill or beat me as you please.

40
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,970
I cannot blame you entirely for this matter.

41
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,560
Night-Spirited Hero's martial arts skills are great so it's indeed hard to capture him.

42
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,240
You... Go to Green Dragon Fort for me.

43
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,620
Yes!

44
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,920
- Master Xiao Bao.
- Master Xiao Bao.

45
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,720
Master Xiao Bao, the chief has given orders that no one can enter.

46
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,270
Wait! Even I cannot enter?

47
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,500
Well, that is the chief's order.

48
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,630
Master Xiao Bao, don't make it hard for me.

49
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,410
All right, I won't go in.

50
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,720
Just let her go in to deliver the meal.

51
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,040
Master Xiao Bao, if the chief were to know about this,

52
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,350
- we cannot bear the consequences?
- Can't bear the consequences?

53
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,860
All right.

54
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,100
I wonder if this...

55
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,270
- is enough to bear the consequences?
- Yes, yes, yes.

56
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,680
Older Brothers, I am just going in to deliver a meal. I will come out really quickly.

57
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,490
- Yes.
- Sure, please go in.

58
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,040
When she comes out and I get her back,

59
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,950
I will give you the money.

60
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,110
Sit down.

61
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,400
Did you go afterward?

62
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,410
How would I have time?

63
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,030
Xiao Bao.

64
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,330
- Let's go.
- Master Bao, give us the money.

65
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,610
The money? Here.

66
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,130
Give me your hand.

67
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,570
One, one.

68
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,750
Master Bao, this...

69
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,470
That's right, Master Bao, weren't you going to give us the whole bag of money?

70
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,970
When did I say that I will give you the whole bag of money?

71
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,210
- No--
- In your dreams.

72
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,860
Let's go.

73
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,780
Wait! He is even more of a bandit than a bandit.

74
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,270
I am Wang Biao. Greetings, Chief.

75
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,970
My master is unwell today,

76
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,800
so he could not come to visit. He especially told me to bring a generous gift to greet you with, Chief.

77
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,500
The wise do not beat around the bush.

78
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,990
Before, we accidentally stole your goods.

79
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,520
There weren't that many goods though.

80
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,560
What? Is he still thinking about those goods?

81
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,690
It is my fault. I should have brought a generous gift to visit you with, Chief.

82
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,630
Our master also said that first, this is being used to pay our respects to you.

83
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,380
He is thoughtful.

84
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,780
I still have one thing to ask of you.

85
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,540
That day the Night-Spirited Hero lured us into a fight with our own people,

86
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,490
while he, on the other hand, benefited from the fight.

87
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,600
Not only did he steal our goods, but he also ruined our plans.

88
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,590
I really cannot let him go for that.

89
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,280
You don't need to beat around the bush.

90
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,500
Does your master want us to help you guys capture the Night-Spirited Hero?

91
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,520
Chief, you are wise.

92
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,470
Although we are not afraid of the Night-Spirited Hero,

93
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,680
we also don't have the need to irritate him.

94
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,480
I understand.

95
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,120
This is 200 taels of gold that my master wants to pay as our respect toward you.

96
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,610
My master has said that if you are able to catch him alive,

97
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,690
we will give you an additional 500 taels afterward.

98
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,360
Back then, when your master was still following me,

99
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,670
I already said that he was someone with talent.

100
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,430
As expected,

101
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,210
only a few years had passed,

102
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,770
yet he's living prosperously and rising in the ranks of the world.

103
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,340
He really is a rare talent.

104
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,530
Go back and tell your master,

105
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,380
that I agree to this matter.

106
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,230
Tell him to wait for my good news.

107
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,860
Then we thank you, Chief.

108
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,540
You guys should also leave now.

109
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,950
Just leave these things behind.

110
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,970
What are you doing? Move!

111
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,180
So annoying.

112
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,850
Why can you listen and I can't?

113
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,690
What does it have to do with you?

114
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,730
How do you know it has nothing to do with me?

115
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,510
Are you able to catch the Night-Spirited Hero?

116
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,730
If I can't, can you?

117
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,050
Let me tell you. Only I'm able to accomplish such a task.

118
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,230
Who is outside!

119
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,020
You need only to see Night-Spirited Hero use his Black Tiger Clawed Out Heart and then add in his Monkey Steals the Peach!

120
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,220
He is too despicable!

121
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,260
Exactly! He is too despicable!

122
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,990
But it's a good thing I have good reflexes. I just did a backflip and dodged both moves.

123
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,890
At that very moment, I used my Descending Dragon Over the Sea.

124
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,660
Night-Spirited Hero is also not a "vegetarian." (Weak)

125
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,290
Night-Spirited Hero's fists are fast but my legs are even faster.

126
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,830
You can hear a "pa" sound and he flew up!

127
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,010
What's going on?

128
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,770
You're exaggerating again?

129
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,650
Old Wu, you've never fought the Night-Spirited Hero

130
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,650
so you don't know how formidable he is.

131
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,950
If you were to fight the Night-Spirited Hero, I am afraid you wouldn't even be able to touch him.

132
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,530
Who are you looking down on?

133
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,790
What happens if I touch him?

134
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,020
Then that's all you're capable of.

135
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,550
You--

136
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,170
What's all the noise about?

137
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,830
Chief.

138
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,060
We were just chatting.

139
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

140
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,620
I happen to have something I would like to discuss with you guys.

141
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,760
Please speak, Godfather.

142
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,500
The Salt Gang wants us to help catch the Night-Spirited Hero.

143
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,420
- Catch the Night-Spirited Hero?
- Catch the Night-Spirited Hero?

144
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,350
That Night-Spirited Hero has been in Qingzhou for many years,

145
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,600
but no one has been able to catch him to this day.

146
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,220
This is not an easy job.

147
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,420
Such nonsense!

148
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,120
If it were easy, would they ask for our help?

149
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,230
That's true.

150
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,900
Godfather, are we only helping?

151
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,430
We can't accept a job where we are at a loss.

152
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,040
I know what you are thinking about.

153
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,140
But I have heard that Night-Spirited Hero comes and leaves without a trace.

154
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,090
His martial arts methods are very skilled.

155
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,520
I'm afraid that the only person in our fort who is a match for him

156
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,260
is you, Master Xiao Bao.

157
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,420
Thank you, Godfather.

158
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,760
Don't be too happy just yet. Capture him first.

159
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,330
Godfather, if I capture the Night-Spirited Hero...

160
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,060
There obviously will be benefits.

161
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,600
The Salt Gang has already said that it really didn't matter whether we captured him dead or alive.

162
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,720
However, if we can catch him alive,

163
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,260
they will give 500 taels... of silver.

164
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,230
- That much?
- That much?

165
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,500
Wasn't it gold?

166
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,390
Chief, actually you can also consider letting me go.

167
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,290
Godfather, I don't want money.

168
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,950
Then go by yourself.

169
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,460
What do you want if you don't want money?

170
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,420
If I catch the Night-Spirited Hero,

171
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,720
I hope that you can give your blessing to me and Xiao Wanzi.

172
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,390
Absurd!

173
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,020
Hurry up and leave. Go, go.

174
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,290
You are too absurd!

175
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,730
Xiao Bao, are you really dumb or are you faking it?

176
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,780
You obviously know Nan Xiang really likes you.

177
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,330
Godfather, since I was young,

178
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,460
I only treat Nan Xiang as my younger sister.

179
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,930
Godfather is my benefactor.
(T/N: Lit. Treats me favorably as much as a mountain.)

180
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,860
I have also worked tirelessly for the fort during these years.

181
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,620
What?

182
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,460
You want to ask for credit?

183
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,820
If you are angry, hit me or punish me.

184
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,880
But I really don't want to keep secrets from you, Godfather.

185
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,730
I don't want you to think that I am disloyal.

186
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,360
I really don't want anything other than Xiao Wanzi.

187
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,330
Do you like Xiao Wanzi that much?

188
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,270
Perhaps... Perhaps this is fate.

189
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,490
Xiao Bao, you are still young.

190
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,570
When you have money, what kind of women can you not get?

191
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,670
So why must you do this now?

192
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,030
Godfather, Xiao Wanzi, she...

193
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,400
she is different from other women.

194
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,760
If you were to ask me how she's different,

195
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,220
I cannot answer that.

196
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,190
But she is just different from other women!

197
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,900
Fine.

198
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,530
Since you like Xiao Wanzi that much,

199
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,820
I will fulfill your wish.

200
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,340
Really?

201
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,900
When you catch the Night-Spirited Hero,

202
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,730
you and Xiao Wanzi will get married.

203
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,690
Thank you, Godfather!

204
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,990
I will definitely catch the Night-Spirited Hero!

205
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,300
Fresh flowers paired with a beauty.

206
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,400
A beauty paired with a hero.

207
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,530
The flowers can stay,

208
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,700
but the person can leave.

209
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,430
I have good news though.

210
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,470
Are you sure you want me to leave?

211
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,490
Tell me.

212
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,020
Could it be that my father got released?

213
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,550
No, guess again.

214
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,240
Chief has let me go?

215
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,500
Really?

216
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,170
But... I have to help him with something.

217
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,500
After I accomplish it, he promises that you won't have to marry him.

218
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,290
That is great!

219
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,930
I don't need to be worried anymore

220
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,630
or color my face to look like that every day.

221
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,900
Then, what is he asking you to do?

222
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,370
Will you be in danger?

223
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,570
Is it a bad matter?

224
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,700
Are you worried about me?

225
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,160
Nothing, I just have to find a person for him.

226
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,330
Don't worry! There is no danger.

227
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,140
But others cannot do it, only I can.

228
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,440
All right, all right! Only you are competent.

229
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,300
Xiao Wanzi, listen to me.

230
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,030
Godfather promised me that as long as I do this for him,

231
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,460
he will let you marry me.

232
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,800
But don't worry, I won't force you.

233
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,400
Whether or not you will marry is your own choice.

234
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,410
I only hope...

235
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,290
that you don't need to marry my godfather and suffer.

236
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,640
Are you sure? If I don't marry you, you won't get mad?

237
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,690
Of course! I am a man!

238
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,500
What has been said cannot be unsaid.

239
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,990
I swear one day,

240
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,330
I will let you like me wholeheartedly.

241
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,260
Alright then! I have big things to do now.

242
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,950
I'm leaving.

243
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,720
Don't act so recklessly from now on. Do you understand?

244
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,180
What did I do?

245
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,390
These matters are not a child's game of playing house.

246
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,190
How am I playing a game of house? I'm sincerely trying to help you.

247
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,590
I don't need you to. Rest early.

248
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,670
What are you doing?

249
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,200
I don't want to see you again.

250
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,360
Unless you take back what you just said.

251
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,840
What I said was right. You should reflect upon yourself.

252
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,970
You don't know how to be grateful at all. I'm never talking to you again!

253
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,020
Fine, I won't bother with him anymore.

254
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,820
If I don't see you, I won't feel annoyed.

255
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,010
Sweet and sour pork ribs?

256
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,830
Beggar's chicken?

257
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,550
There's also West Lake fish in vinegar gravy!

258
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,400
- Princess.
- Sweet and sour pork ribs!

259
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,490
Prince Consort specially bought all this from Ruyi Restaurant.

260
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,700
- He bought it?
- Yes.

261
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,550
If I eat this, wouldn't I lose my pride?

262
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,960
Why aren't you eating it? I bought it specifically for you.

263
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,780
I'm not hungry.

264
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,340
If you're not hungry, then I'll eat it.

265
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,390
- Young Master, we should wait for the Princess—
- She said she's not hungry!

266
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,760
It's so delicious.

267
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,500
Princess, Prince Consort bought all of these for you.

268
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,920
Prince Consort is amazing.

269
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,370
He knows exactly what you like to eat.

270
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,380
As long as you recognize your wrongs and change, that's fine.

271
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,400
I'm not hungry at all. You all eat them yourselves.

272
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,750
It's so delicious.

273
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,690
Did you argue with her again?

274
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,730
Shut up. Siheng.

275
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,330
Eat all of this. You're not allowed to leave any leftovers.

276
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,670
Weren't Princess and Prince Consort fine a few days ago?

277
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,790
Why are they suddenly...

278
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,780
It's difficult to avoid clashing when living together.

279
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,880
Wait for me. I'll ask if there's an issue.

280
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,030
- Go.
- "When the city gate catches on fire,

281
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,990
the fish in the moat are in danger."
 (T/N: innocent bystanders are harmed in a calamity)

282
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,020
This is so tragic!

283
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,010
But it's fine.

284
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,150
I feel like I've gotten fat from eating so much meat usually.

285
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,130
It's all right to change up my diet sometimes.

286
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,670
Xiao Wanzi, what happened between you and Prince Consort?

287
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,080
What did you do wrong now?

288
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,070
I... It's him who is looking down on me.

289
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,330
That's why I'm punishing him.

290
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,480
From what I see, you're the one being punished.

291
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,790
I'll make you something good to eat in a moment. I'll make a lot.

292
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,560
Really? You're the best.

293
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,660
Hasn't the Prince Consort's temper always been like this?

294
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,130
Take a step back and the sky is your limit. If you don't endure the trivial things, the bigger plans will fail.

295
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,230
That's why you just need to be the bigger person and everything's fine.

296
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,260
Oh right! Are there still any sweet and sour pork ribs left?

297
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,590
Why is there none left?

298
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,070
Looks like I'm really the one being punished.

299
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,340
What is this?

300
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,680
Whoa!

301
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,770
What is this?

302
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,040
I originally wanted you to change into male clothes to do something for me.

303
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,190
It looks like you don't like it. I'll just go get Siheng.

304
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,920
No, no. I'll do it. Siheng is really busy. Let me do it.

305
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,570
Then you need to listen to my orders and not act on your own accord.

306
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,290
Don't worry! I'll listen to you. Speak now and I'll listen carefully.

307
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,230
First, you need to find a small vendor who sells contraband salt.

308
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,210
Take him to a secluded place and I'll take care of the rest.

309
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,340
No problem. That's easy. Leave it to me.

310
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,090
High-quality snowflake salt!

311
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,280
Come on, everyone! Take a look, take a look!

312
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,330
The price is only half of the official salt!

313
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,350
Excuse me, excuse me.

314
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:44,310
If we could afford the official salt, we wouldn't be buying it from here.

315
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,870
- Can you make it even cheaper?
- Cheaper?

316
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,420
This is already the cheapest price.

317
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,660
You're right.

318
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,820
The crime is pretty hefty for selling contraband salt.

319
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,030
We'll quietly buy and he'll quietly sell.

320
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,720
Let's be more understanding of each other. Line up, line up!

321
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,650
Don't push. Come, come on! Since it's available now,

322
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,670
hurry and buy some. I heard that

323
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,880
the Night-Spirited Hero specifically targets those that sell contraband salt.

324
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,770
That's right. Say, do you think he has nothing else to do?

325
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,150
Why are you like this?

326
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,270
The Night-Spirited Hero was almost arrested by the officials for catching those who were selling contraband salt.

327
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,090
Are you treating him fairly by saying that?

328
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,100
He's good-for-nothing, preventing us from buying cheaper stuff.

329
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,640
That's right. We, commoners, don't have time to be vigilantes.

330
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,820
- That's right.
- You guys are just gaining some small benefits right now.

331
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,840
Later on when you can't buy any more of the official salt,

332
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,140
just wait and see the price jump up in contraband salt.

333
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,640
We, commoners, just like buying cheap goods.

334
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,180
A wen saved is still worth something.

335
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,150
- That's right!
- That's right. We won't care too much about it.

336
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,460
- Here, here! Pour some for him.
- Give me some!

337
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,320
- Why are you all so unreasonable?
- Here, here.

338
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
If I ever encounter the Night-Spirited Hero,

339
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,560
I'll definitely capture him and bring him to the local authorities.

340
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,800
You?

341
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,180
What about me? If you're not going to buy anything, why are you here causing trouble?

342
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,600
Who are you? Look at your smooth skin.

343
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,750
You don't look like a poor fellow. What are you here for?

344
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,630
Was he sent by the government to catch those selling contraband salt?

345
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,320
We're not selling anymore tonight!

346
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,760
- Please don't!
- What are you standing around for? Hurry and leave.

347
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,700
- Sell us some!
- Let's go.

348
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,100
Don't leave! Don't leave!

349
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,560
I'm sorry. I messed up again.

350
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,630
It's fine.

351
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,760
We can think of something else next time.

352
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,830
You worked hard all day. You must be hungry, right?

353
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,850
I made you some porridge.

354
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,450
Thank you.

355
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,650
Why are you unhappy? Are you still mad at me?

356
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,680
No. I'm just thinking

357
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,250
if what the Night-Spritied Hero is doing is actually right or not.

358
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,810
Did you hear what the commoners were saying?

359
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,860
They weren't wrong.

360
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,740
We work hard all day

361
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,400
just to fill our bellies and live.

362
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,440
If they can't afford official salt then they can only buy contraband salt.

363
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,070
Then the person who sells salt for a cheap price

364
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,130
is considered a good person for the day.

365
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,240
That's why everyone wanted to protect the good guy.

366
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,340
So actually,

367
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,050
to us commoners,

368
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,260
nothing is more important than having enough to eat and surviving.

369
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,660
"When the granary is full, people will observe conduct and principles."

370
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,350
What?

371
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,580
It means that only when people are full

372
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,620
can they have time to think about other things.

373
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,610
Correct, that's what I meant.

374
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,930
But actually, you weren't wrong either.

375
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,120
- I wasn't wrong?
- Yes.

376
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,660
You're the Night-Spirited Hero, and different from us commoners who only care about a full stomach and surviving.

377
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,210
You have to take care of many other things.

378
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,730
The more contraband salt sold, then the less demand for official salt there will be.

379
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,890
The harder it is to buy something, the more expensive it is.

380
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,360
Even though right now it seems like

381
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,970
contraband salt is sold at a cheap price and all is good,

382
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,850
it's actually us commoners who will lose out in the end.

383
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,240
So you're not wrong.

384
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,430
Who knew you would understand so much.

385
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,170
I heard you and Siheng talking about it last time.

386
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,680
But you shouldn't feel bad either.

387
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,530
You're the Night-Spirited Hero. You're different.

388
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,780
The Night-Spirited Hero wears a mask and black clothes.

389
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,040
He only appears at night.

390
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,840
Even though a majority of the people may not know what you do

391
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,180
or even not know how much good you've done for them,

392
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,260
the Night-Spirited Hero is someone who carries the darkness

393
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,690
and walks toward the sunlight.

394
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,930
You have always been the

395
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,730
most idolized great hero in my heart.

396
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,810
"Someone who carries the darkness and walks toward the sunlight."

397
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,920
- Put it over there.
- Here.

398
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,790
Master Bao is here.

399
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,590
- Xiao Bao, where are you going?
- What does it have to do with you?

400
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,460
I heard you're trying to catch the Night-Spritied Hero day and night. Why haven't I even seen a strand of his hair?

401
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,740
That's because he's lucky. Otherwise, I would've already caught him.

402
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,820
Stop boasting. If you can't handle it, just tell me.

403
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,640
I'm still willing to help you.

404
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,330
Help me?

405
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,140
I'm also willing to help you.

406
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,790
Say, your martial arts are so bad.

407
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,220
If you have time to sit here and drink wine, why don't you go practice your martial arts skills?

408
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,430
Worse comes to worst, I can teach you.

409
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,320
I'm worried about your marriage. You may not be in a rush but that Boulder-Shattering Chest may be in a rush.

410
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,760
Based on your speed, when you catch the Night-Spritied Hero,

411
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,360
that Boulder-Shattering Chest will have become an old lady.

412
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,010
Old Wu, after I catch the Night-Spirited Hero,

413
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,240
all of you will need to kneel, kowtow,

414
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,030
and call me "Lord."

415
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,740
Xiao Bao, you!

416
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,220
Wanzi, look at what I got you!

417
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,140
Xiao Bao, you were looking for me?

418
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,260
I brought you the most delicious green bean cake in the entire Qingzhou City.

419
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,680
You went to do a job for Nan Batian yet you even bought this for me. Thank you.

420
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,480
As long as you're happy, I'm willing to do anything for you.

421
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,870
Xiao Bao, I can see that you have been frowning lately.

422
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,510
Is this job difficult?

423
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:14,640
How is that possible? Nothing in this world can trouble me.

424
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,980
Actually, I heard Master Wu

425
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,870
and the others taunting you in the courtyard. What's going on?

426
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,550
They are just having a moment of satisfaction.

427
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,730
I'm different from them.

428
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,810
I'm shouldering the responsibility of the important task of our marriage.

429
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,340
I won't stoop to the same level as them.

430
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,220
All right. Hurry and try it.

431
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,300
Xiao Bao, you know we...

432
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,040
I do. You can't accept me right now.

433
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,360
But if I don't try,

434
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,500
I won't give up.

435
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,130
Don't worry, I will definitely catch the Night-Spirited Hero.

436
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,200
What? You're trying to catch the Nigh-Spirited Hero?

437
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,630
Yeah. That way you can be free.

438
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,280
You can't catch him.

439
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,340
I heard my father say the Night-Spirited Hero has won the heart of the people in Qingzhou and does good deeds every day.

440
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,390
Good deeds every day?

441
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,010
I don't believe that.

442
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,480
Could he possibly only do good deeds and no bad deeds since birth?

443
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,380
Your words suddenly reminded me.

444
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,360
I know how to lure him out.

445
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,980
Wait here, I know how to catch him.

446
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,890
- Bad guy! Bad guy!
- Let go of our tutor.

447
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,030
By doing this, you are a disgrace to the scholarly people.

448
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,340
You will serve as a model in this way.

449
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,470
This is the weasel-haired brush used by the Night-Spirited Hero.

450
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,900
Keep it, and take care of it well!

451
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,040
[Wine]

452
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,010
Stop yelling!

453
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,200
Fire! There's a fire!

454
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,980
- Fire!
- Come, there's a fire!

455
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,060
I, the Night-Spirited Hero, just want to tell you to close your door tighter when taking a bath!

456
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,180
Someone come! Night-Spirited Hero...

457
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,090
Why are you peeking at us while we take a bath?

458
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,510
Why is it like this?

459
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,000
Uncle, how did this shop burn down?

460
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,750
Last night, the Night-Spirited Hero burned it down.

461
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,950
Night-Spirited Hero?

462
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,630
Did the Night-Spirited Hero really do this?

463
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,150
Of course!

464
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,270
I saw him with my own eyes holding the torch

465
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,680
and spreading fire everywhere!

466
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,760
I even heard he drew all over the Qingfeng School Headmaster's face.

467
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,120
I heard he was being a pervert at Chunfeng Inn.

468
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,730
He peeked at the ladies bathing.

469
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,310
- He's such a low-life!
- There's no way.

470
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,450
These things were definitely not the Night-Spirited Hero's doings.

471
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,660
This is clearly someone trying to ruin his reputation.

472
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,940
How can you prove that he didn't do all this?

473
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,590
- Do you know him?
- That's right! How do you know him?

474
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,840
Miss, you don't even know him. How can you say he didn't do it?

475
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,640
That's right!

476
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,700
Someone is clearly trying to ruin your reputation.

477
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,870
They should believe you!

478
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,070
Young Master, did you hear the news?

479
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,440
Someone is purposely trying to ruin the Night-Spirited Hero's reputation.

480
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,230
The despicable Salt Gang.

481
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,500
They're using such dirty tactics to lure you out.

482
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,390
Young Master, we found out that the Salt Gang colluded with Green Dragon Fort.

483
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,360
You must be careful.

484
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,140
This is so detestable.

485
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,010
Let's catch the bastard pretending to be Night-Spirited Hero right now!

486
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:02,030
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

487
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:09,500
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

488
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:16,790
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

489
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:23,410
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

490
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,540
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

491
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,460
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

492
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:38,610
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

493
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:42,260
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

494
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,030
♫ My treasured memories ♫

495
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:53,200
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

496
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,770
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

497
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,650
♫ It's me missing you ♫

498
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:06,520
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

499
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:25,640
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

500
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:31,830
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

501
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:40,420
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

502
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:47,710
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

503
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,350
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

504
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:55,200
♫ My treasured memories ♫

505
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,320
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

506
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,020
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

507
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,850
♫ It's me missing you ♫

508
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:18,730
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫
