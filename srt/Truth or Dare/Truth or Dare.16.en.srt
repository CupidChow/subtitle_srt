4
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,050
Have you fallen for Prince Consort?

5
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,790
You... Wait...

6
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,120
W-What are you saying? H-How could I...

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,640
How could I like him? He's a big idiot. I hate him.

8
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,350
Then, why are you acting so out of character?

9
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,240
What exactly happened last night?

10
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,790
I-I already told you.

11
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,440
Last night, I j-just accidentally fell into the water when I was walking around.

12
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,450
Stop asking. I can't possibly have feelings for Third Young Master Mei.

13
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,590
I hope that is the case. After all, Third Young Master Mei

14
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,900
is in a marriage with the princess as appointed by the emperor.

15
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,180
Once she returns, you must give him back.

16
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,510
That's right. I...

17
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,490
We talked about this from the beginning.

18
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,200
I know.

19
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,320
Have you fed the horses?

20
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,400
Daughter!

21
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,120
I was so worried. Hurry and come sit.

22
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,950
Come.

23
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,980
- Uncle He, how is your body?
- It's fine!

24
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,830
Um... How are you all doing?

25
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,340
- Nan Batian promised not to marry me.
- That's good.

26
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,430
But... his condition is for Xiao Bao to capture the Night-Spirited Hero.

27
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,640
Night-Spirited Hero?

28
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,590
Night-Spirited Hero is very skilled at martial arts.

29
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,920
- Capturing him will be difficult.
- Yes.

30
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,890
Xiao Bao failed a few times before.

31
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,060
He almost couldn't escape in one piece this time.

32
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,950
More importantly, I think Night-Spirited Hero is a good person.

33
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,030
I don't want to drag him down because of my own matters.

34
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,410
Let me ask you something.

35
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,670
Did Xiao Bao get hurt?

36
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,120
All right, all right.

37
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,650
Since Xiao Bao is injured then that means they won't do anything for now.

38
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,560
We must use this opportunity to flee.

39
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,760
We failed all the other times we tried to escape.

40
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,010
How is it that easy?

41
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,640
- Do you know why you failed?
- Why?

42
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,650
I only found out when I was coming to the fort this time around.

43
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,820
They have a maze outside the fort.

44
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,220
That's why no one can escape.

45
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,960
A maze? Since it's a maze,

46
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,480
can't we escape if we find the diagram for the maze?

47
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,700
But where could that diagram be?

48
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,580
Uncle He, this diagram has to do with Green Dragon Fort's survival.

49
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,750
Nan Batian must be personally guarding it.

50
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,720
- How about I go look for it?
- Right, right.

51
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,420
You go see Nan Batian?

52
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,220
No, no! That's too dangerous. We must target someone else.

53
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,640
Then... Then I'll go see Nan Xiang.

54
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,890
Have you lost your mind? Nan Xiang wants to kill you.

55
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,480
If you go to her, aren't you just delivering yourself to death?

56
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,270
But we have no other choices now, Uncle He.

57
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,260
Nan Batian hasn't been here at the fort these past few days.

58
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,310
I'll go take care of Nan Xiang.

59
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,780
- It's might work if he's not here. Then you—
- Hey, are you two done yet?

60
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,760
Yes, yes! We'll be done right away!

61
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,170
Uncle He, trust me.

62
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,950
- Then be careful.
- Okay.

63
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,000
Father, take care!

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,090
I got it! You take care too!

65
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,320
Take good care of yourself!

66
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,490
Come on, come on. Make your bets.

67
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,480
Let's bet.

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,530
Come on, come on. Hurry.

69
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,150
Eldest Miss.

70
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,900
What are you doing here?

71
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,310
I want to be friends with you.

72
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,150
What? Are you tired of living?

73
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,780
I'm warning you, stay far away from me.

74
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,040
Look! My hands are all better. My illness is long gone.

75
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,770
If you keep picking on me, Xiao Bao will dislike you more and more.

76
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,660
Whether he dislikes me is my problem.

77
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,980
What does it have to do with you?

78
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,670
I can make Xiao Bao fall in love with you.

79
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,660
- Leave!
- Go go go.

80
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,370
- Wait, then my—
- Just wait.

81
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,750
Are you sure you're not lying to me?

82
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,720
Why do you want to help me?

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm going to marry your father sooner or later anyway.

84
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,700
I don't want to keep fighting with you like this.

85
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,700
Why not help each other right now instead?

86
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,320
Then... are you sure you can make Xiao Bao fall in love with me?

87
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,440
If we can become friends and get along,

88
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,200
he will definitely be happy.

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,400
Also, he'll think you are magnanimous and understanding.

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,120
- He will definitely have good feelings for you.
- Nonsense!

91
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,540
Xiao Bao and I grew up together.

92
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,160
If he wanted to like me, he would have long ago.

93
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,690
Why would he wait until now?

94
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,720
Look. I've only known him for a short period of time. Right?

95
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,200
But he already likes me, right?

96
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,940
So, you must trust me.

97
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,280
I can help you.

98
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,080
Fine.

99
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,970
Then starting from now, I'll protect you.

100
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,210
You make Xiao Bao fall in love with me.

101
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,450
This is what men do.

102
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,450
Women just hold hands.

103
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,220
We are just in a mutually beneficial relationship.

104
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,840
Don't touch me.

105
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,880
Since I promised to help you win Xiao Bao's heart,

106
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,750
from now on, you must listen to me.

107
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,190
You are too unfeminine.

108
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,490
Xiao Bao wants a gentle wife,

109
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,770
not a brother to fight alongside him.

110
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,400
You—!

111
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,780
Come on! Come with me.

112
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,580
Maintain a smile.

113
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,280
Let's go.

114
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,480
- What are you doing?
- Exactly.

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,000
What's wrong?

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,960
Look. Wow.

117
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,460
Just tell me what you want to learn and I'll teach you.

118
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,860
I just want to learn whatever Xiao Bao likes.

119
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,640
He will definitely like you.

120
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,140
What's going on?

121
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,860
Why is she dressed like that?

122
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,470
What's going on with you two?

123
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,090
Am I still asleep?

124
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,190
Why did you pinch me?

125
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,740
Looks like it's not a dream.

126
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,520
- Xiao Bao, did you rest well?
- Not bad.

127
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,920
Xiao Bao, are you all right?

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,120
Come here, I have something to say to you.

129
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,000
I—

130
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,470
Is Nan Xiang bullying you again?

131
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,000
No.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,920
Don't be afraid. If she bullies you, just tell me.

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
She really isn't!

134
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,920
Then, what's going on with you two?

135
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,730
I live every day here in fear.

136
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,150
Having another friend is better than another enemy, right?

137
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,130
That's true.

138
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,750
No matter what, I support you.

139
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,360
Don't worry. I will definitely capture Night-Spirited Hero.

140
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,570
Then, Godfather won't...

141
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,260
I know. You don't like hearing me say I'll capture Night-Spirited Hero.

142
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,690
But... I think...

143
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,390
What you need to do now is recuperate.

144
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,810
Don't think about anything else, okay?

145
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,840
- What are you two talking about?
- Nothing.

146
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,850
You two get back to what you were doing.

147
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,280
- Go go go.
- Come, let's go talk in my room.

148
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,570
Your woman has even learned to protect herself now.

149
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,330
Xiao Bao, Xiao Bao.

150
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,000
You must do better.

151
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,940
This suits you.Take a look.

152
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,830
Choose one.

153
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,460
Candied hawthorns.

154
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,970
Is this street very fascinating to watch?

155
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,600
Big Brother Situ, what a coincidence! Are you also here to eat wontons?

156
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,390
Yes, I had nothing to do and came out for a stroll.

157
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,980
Miss, may you honor me by allowing me to share the table with you?

158
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,470
Please have a seat, Big Brother Situ.

159
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,450
Thank you.

160
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,640
What's wrong? Is something on your mind?

161
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,810
You look unhappy.

162
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,090
You've noticed?

163
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,330
It's a long story,

164
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,460
so I don't know where to start.

165
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,220
You've got something on your mind.

166
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,920
Then you can only wait. Wait for the fog to clear and everything will become clear.

167
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,490
Yes, all I can do now is wait.

168
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,260
I can't do anything else.

169
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,460
I can only hope... that there's good news soon.

170
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,900
But you must remember that no matter what you come across,

171
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,730
I'll surely support you.

172
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,280
Thank you, Big Brother Situ.

173
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,500
You're such a nice person.

174
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,590
Then I'll treat you to wontons today.

175
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,700
I guarantee you'll be full.

176
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,290
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

177
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,710
Boss, two bowls of wontons!

178
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,160
No, we want four bowls!

179
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,490
- Five bowls of wontons, five!
- Okay.

180
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,160
Five bowls? Can you finish that much?

181
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,090
I'm not eating. They are all for you to eat.

182
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,170
- All for me?
- Yes, so you'll eat until you're fat.

183
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,620
All right, I'll do my best.

184
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,010
- You have to eat as well.
- I can't. I ate a lot earlier.

185
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,510
Where are you going?

186
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,690
I just remembered that I needed to tell Qiao Yun to do something.

187
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,950
Just have Siheng go.

188
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,950
My... brain isn't working.

189
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,350
I already told her earlier. I already told her.

190
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,830
Have a seat and drink some tea.

191
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,420
- I'm not thirsty.
- Not thirsty?

192
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,890
It seems you've drank a lot of tea in the morning.

193
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,430
What do you mean by that?

194
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,810
Qingzhou is just that big.

195
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,580
I already know.

196
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,350
You drank tea with another man at a tea house.

197
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,950
Are you talking about Big Brother Situ?

198
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,650
He and I are just regular friends. Don't misunderstand.

199
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,870
You call him "Big Brother Situ"?

200
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,870
That's right.

201
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,010
He's a few years older than me, is it wrong for me to call him big brother?

202
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,030
You are a dignified princess as well as the wife of a general,

203
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,030
how could you casually call someone big brother?

204
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,420
You're being so strange.

205
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,220
I— What's wrong with me calling him big brother?

206
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,530
You're not jealous, are you?

207
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,010
Are you kidding? How could I possibly be jealous?

208
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm concerned for your personal safety, got it?

209
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,610
What danger could I be in?

210
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,690
He and I are just regular friends, he doesn't even know my identity.

211
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,590
If he wants to know your identity, that would be extremely easy.

212
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,830
Even if he knows, he wouldn't have any ulterior motives.

213
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,590
In any case, stay far away from him.

214
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,450
You... Older Brother Situ is modest, enthusiastic, and friendly.

215
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,910
Unlike you, cold and friendless.

216
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,690
Is that how I am in your heart?

217
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,890
Did I cross the line just now?

218
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,880
Indeed.

219
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,460
Wait a second.

220
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,950
- Did your young master make you investigate the contraband salt?
- Yes.

221
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,980
How's the investigation?

222
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,320
Nevermind. If he won't allow you to speak about it, then I won't put you in a difficult spot.

223
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,390
- Then you go talk to the young master.
- Yes.

224
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,160
I have already arranged for informants to keep an eye on this matter.

225
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,690
Once they discover any contraband salt movements, they will report back immediately.

226
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,980
This time, the enemies are coming fiercely.

227
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,120
We must plan before acting.

228
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,920
Relay my instructions. Have A'Rou keep a close watch on Green Dragon Fort.

229
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,490
The quieter the Green Dragon Fort is these days, the more closely we have to watch.

230
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,790
Yes.

231
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,370
Also, once the person trying to capture the Night-Spirited Hero appears,

232
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,470
we must capture him.

233
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,730
Yes. Rest assured, Young Master.

234
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,970
Who might this be?

235
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,000
Siheng, this...

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,940
Look! The paint is chipping.

237
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,000
Hurry and get someone to fix it.

238
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,630
Are you concerned about the progress of the investigation, or are you concerned about me?

239
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,160
W-Why would I be concerned about you?

240
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,610
I, Xiao Wanzi, am most concerned about eliminating violence to bring peace

241
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,690
and upholding justice.

242
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,790
- Siheng.
- Yes.

243
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,830
- Recently, new chefs have joined the Ruyi Restaurant.
- R-Right!

244
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,090
I heard they have braised pork ribs, West Lake fish with vinegar,

245
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,200
crab roe with bean curd, and things like that.

246
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,270
Fortunately, I came. Otherwise, this table of food here would have been wasted.

247
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,940
Young Master, this chicken isn't bad.

248
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,700
These pork ribs are—

249
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,490
Young Master. Princess. Do today's dishes suit your taste?

250
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,190
They suit my taste especially well. Especially this... Especially these sweet and sour ribs.

251
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,930
My goodness, they're so delicious. I'm going to go crazy.

252
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,730
Young Master, I have something to tell you.

253
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,900
Go ahead, what is it?

254
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,960
Don't worry about her, all she knows to do is eat.

255
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,880
Through this period of investigation,

256
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,830
the Salt Gang most likely bribed the Green Dragon Fort to capture the Night-Spirited Hero.

257
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,570
I, for one, want to see how long they can last

258
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,640
in this cat-and-mouse game.

259
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,020
If you trust me, then just say so.

260
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,660
You make me sound like a starving wolf.

261
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,160
Customer, this way, please.

262
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,920
Older Brother Situ?

263
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,370
Greetings, Junior General and Princess.

264
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,120
Older Brother Situ indeed knows my identity.

265
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,430
Chief Situ, I have long heard of your name.

266
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,200
What a coincidence, Older Brother Situ.

267
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,860
Are you here to eat, too?

268
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,670
Yes. I won't bother you two any further.

269
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,110
This—

270
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,190
By the way, the Qingzhou Merchants Guild will be holding a celebration in three days.

271
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,570
I wonder if you two would honor us by coming.

272
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,430
What kind of celebration?

273
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,900
It's a big event here in Qingzhou.

274
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,130
Although Qingzhou is an important military area

275
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,000
because it's a safe place, many merchants are willing to come here for business.

276
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,170
So, they'll definitely come that day.

277
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,530
Princess, you have to come, too.

278
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,160
At the time, there will be lots of good food and entertainment. There will also be performances.

279
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,030
Really?

280
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,360
I'll definitely be there.

281
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,730
I've already had someone deliver your invitations to the manor.

282
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,600
When we get back, remember to give me my invitation.

283
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,730
Chief Situ, please take a seat upstairs.

284
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,770
Did you hear me?

285
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,800
This way, please.

286
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,340
Remember to give me my invitation when we get back.

287
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,230
Do you hear me?

288
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,430
Why'd you hit me?

289
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,270
You— The invitation!

290
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,560
That hurt.

291
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,010
So you feel pain?

292
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,960
Of course.

293
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,500
Don't interrupt and give me the invitation.

294
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,700
Do you want to go that much?

295
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,800
Of course, I want to go. Do you not?

296
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,180
They hold this celebration every year. I'm already bored of it.

297
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,500
Besides, didn't you grow up in Qingzhou? Have you not been to it before?

298
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,100
I actually haven't.

299
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,870
All these are for rich people like you.

300
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,370
How would poor people like me get the chance to attend?

301
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,220
Do you want to attend the celebration or to go meet up with that Situ?

302
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,600
Both.

303
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,630
Since he's invited me, why can't I go?

304
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,940
Your current identity is the princess.

305
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,200
If you go now, you might blow your cover.

306
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,060
It's because I need to do a good job acting as the princess.

307
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,650
So more reason I should go.

308
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,660
Or else, if I don't accept his invitation, it will raise even more suspicions

309
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,740
and reveal loopholes. Right?

310
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,640
Qiao Yun, prepare a set of clothes for me to wear to a celebration.

311
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,060
- Yes.
- I—

312
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,680
It's fine, it's fine.

313
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,930
It's fine, it's fine.

314
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,580
Young Master, there's something I don't understand.

315
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,050
What is it?

316
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,360
Regarding the Salt Gang. A'Rou already found out

317
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,350
that Situ Lin might be involved in this.

318
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,940
Continue.

319
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,610
Recently, the princess has crossed paths with him often.

320
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,930
Why don't you tell her?

321
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,630
She's... She's naive

322
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,000
and doesn't realize how complicated people are. Also, regarding the Salt Gang,

323
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,510
the less she knows, the safer she is.

324
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,390
Young Master, you can actually tell the princess

325
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,880
you don't like her interacting with Situ. Just say

326
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,420
you're jealous.

327
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,610
Don't get mad, I spoke too much.

328
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,530
Am I jealous?

329
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,150
Am I that petty? Would I not like her interacting with Situ Lin?

330
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,720
Young Master, you don't have to explain to me.

331
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,700
Mei Siheng.

332
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,250
Recently, I've noticed that you're always making me mad.

333
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,090
Have I?

334
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,500
I am the one at fault for everything!

335
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,100
- I shouldn't have spoken your thoughts aloud.
- It's your fault?

336
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,450
All your fault.

337
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,330
In any case, you—

338
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,730
Watch over him closely. You must find evidence.

339
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,320
Yes.

340
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes? You're still laughing?

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,500
All you know to do is giggle and laugh all day instead of working.

342
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,650
Have I? Have I really?

343
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,640
Am I that kind of person?

You are so graceful and elegant.

346
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,470
You are indeed Mei General Manor's

347
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,630
female master.

348
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,640
Your father doesn't like to attend these types of events.

349
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,990
When we are out, we represent the Mei Manor's reputation.

350
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,720
We cannot let others look down on us, right?

351
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,230
It's the Merchants Guild's celebration.

352
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,340
Inevitably, noble families from the capital will be there.

353
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,230
I hope they can see my son's talents

354
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,960
and arrange your marriage. That's my purpose.

355

Thank you, Mother.

356
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,810
Mother, Shiqing and the princess aren't going. Right?

357
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,810
I have already ordered the maids in the manor to go find out.

358
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,950
Princess wants to go,

359
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,880
but Mei Shiqing will not allow her to.

360
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,160
As long as that stubborn donkey doesn't go, all the well.

361
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,540

362

When you dress up, you really look the part.

366
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,170
But is it all right if the third young master does not go?

367
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,370
We already said we will go.

368
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,120
Even if we must thicken our skin, we still need to go. Or else, we'll lose face.

369
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,370
My heart seems to have a drum inside.

370
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,200
It keeps on beating and beating. I...

371
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,640
Don't worry. After we get there,

372
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,330
we will leave after greeting everyone. There won't be a problem. Let's go.

Your appearance is tacky.

376
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,850
Do you think by criticizing me like this, I won't go? This tactic is useless to me.

377
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,470
Prince Consort, do you want to go together?

378

No.

I didn't think I would see you here, Madam.

Nothing. I just want to ask...

392
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,410
Did Third Young Master and Princess not come with you?

393
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,010
Shiqing doesn't like to go to social events.

Naturally, it's not convenient for the princess to attend.

Chief Situ, you are too polite.

Wait! Why is she here?

If she steals the limelight, won't that just make Mei Shiqing proud?

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,580
to write an inscription for us.

422
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,630
Your second brother always wrote the inscription before.

423
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,470
- It will probably still be him.
- This time is no exception.

424
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,510
But most importantly, we have invited the princess this time.

- I-I am new to Qingzhou...
- That's right.

432

I'm not familiar with the celebration either.

433
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,080
Hence, I think it's better to have Second Brother do it.

434

Well said.

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,780
"Moralities of Business."

485
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,380
When doing business, it's about fairness

486
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,540
and "moralities of business."

487
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,230
Everyone, regardless of high or low status,

488
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,940
can steal this flower wreath with one's own capabilities.

489
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,250
Whoever grabs the flower wreath can have a year of good fortune.

490
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,210
Good fortune? Chief, you believe in such things?

491
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,390
Of course. I also want to

492
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,570
gift this good fortune to the princess.

493
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,770
Princess?

494
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,190
- What does this mean?
- Exactly.

495
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,710
Since this is such a fun game,

496
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,730
why don't you play with me?

497
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,190
Third Young Master, do you also have such refined interests?

498
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,590
Naturally, I should gift this good fortune

499
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,190
to my wife.

500
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,140
I shall obey instead of declining politely

501
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,190
Wait for me.

502
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,210
Look at these two. On the surface, they seem to be learning from each other.

503
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,960
but secretly, they are competing.

504
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,260
Between men, other than competing for power and benefits,

505
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,450
they're competing for a woman.

506
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,220
What do you think?

507
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,970
- Chief Situ, your martial skill is not bad.
- I do business all over the place

508
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,470
so, of course, I had to learn some martial arts for self-defense.

509
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,720
I won't go easy on you then.

510
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,410
Sorry if I offend you.

511
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,640
Older Brother Situ, are you all right?

512
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,850
Excellent! Well fought!

513
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,410
Excellent! Well fought!

514
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:09,620
Your martial arts is amazing, Third Young Master. I admire you.

515
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,490
- Great skill.
- Excellent.

516
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,250
It's just a game.

517
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,930
Shiqing, why did you have such a heavy hand?

518
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,840
That's right, Shiqing. You used too much force.

519
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,130
Why are you so competitive?

520
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,890
It's supposed to be a happy occasion. Look at what you've

521
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,020
done to Chief Situ.

522
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,780
Fists are ruthless. Thank you, Chief Situ, for the good fortune

523
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,710
and letting me win.

524
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,630
Please don't say that.

525
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,180
- Princess! Princess!
- Go.

526
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,760
Princess, don't be angry.

527
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,290
Don't be angry. You misunderstood Young Master.

528
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,040
I know you don't like him

529
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,520
but you shouldn't have used so much force.

530
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,340
I didn't do it on purpose.

531
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,470
You had the intention.

532
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,340
Princess.

533
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,320
Young Master, she doesn't know anything.

534
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,060
Why don't you explain it to her?

535
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,830
Unreasonable. Return to the manor.

536
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,350
You are a dignified junior general yet you laid your hands on a commoner.

537
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,990
Is it just because you don't like me being friends with him?

538
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,980
I can use my life to guarantee that the situation is not what it looks like.

539
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,050
Moreover, this Situ Lin is not a good person at all.

540
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,100
- Let me tell you the truth. Situ Lin—
- Shut up!

541
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,130
How is Situ Lin a bad person? Explain it clear.

542
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,970
This doesn't concern you two. Leave now.

543
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,780
You are not done talking.

544
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,010
Why do you think Older Brother Situ is not a good person?

545
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,890
Do you care about that Situ Lin that much?

546
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,480
He's my friend so, naturally, I care about him.

547
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,010
Why did you hurt him?

548
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,010
Since you think I hurt him, what use is it for me to explain?

549
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,790
It's obviously your fault yet you have this attitude.

550
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,520
You're so disappointing!

551
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,020
I must remind you of something.

552
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,820
What?

553
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,780
Siheng is right. Stay away from that Situ Lin!

554
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,660
Do I not even have the right to make friends?

555
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,930
Some things aren't as simple as they appear.

556
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,810
His business is not that "clean" (legitimate).

557
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,910
I won't listen to you! He's my friend and I trust him!

558
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,000
You—

559
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:55,800
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

560
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:03,340
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

561
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:10,760
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

562
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,130
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

563
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,310
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

564
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,360
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

565
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:32,470
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

566
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,200
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

567
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,810
♫ My treasured memories ♫

568
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:47,110
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

569
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,630
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

570
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,540
♫ It's me missing you ♫

571
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:01,480
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

572
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:19,410
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

573
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:26,910
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

574
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:34,190
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

575
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:41,490
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

576
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,170
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

577
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,120
♫ My treasured memories ♫

578
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:56,120
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

579
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,850
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

580
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,690
♫ It's me missing you ♫

581
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:13,290
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫
