[The Princess Returns to the Capital]

4
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,940
- I want to go out to play.
- Princess! Prince Consort!

5
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,850
- Bad news!
- What happened?

6
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,710
A letter from the palace came saying that Third Young Master made a contribution in destroying the bandits,

7
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,440
and you're to return to the capital to be rewarded a title, and they're asking—

8
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,870
They're also asking for the princess to visit her family immediately. You're to set off immediately.

9
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,830
What to do? What to do? We're going to be exposed! What do we do?

10
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,160
What are we going to do, Prince Consort? Housekeeper Liu is the one coming to escort the princess.

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,190
Housekeeper Liu is His Highness' confidant. If he discovers the princess, it will be doomed!

12
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,640
Qiao Yun, rest assured.

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,880
Young Master will definitely find a way.

14
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,210
Let's do this. You two, hurry and bring Young Master Bao and the princess back.

15
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,330
Then, have Qiu Hua stall Housekeeper Liu.

16
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,150
- We'll wait for the princess' return.
- Yes.

17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,060
All right. We'll go find the princess right now!

18
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,700
Hurry.

19
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,480
What do we do?

20
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,150
What if we don't find her?

21
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,480
What if the people of the palace discover me?

22
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,570
It's fine. I'm here through all of this.

23
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,040
Once this matter is resolved, I'll have you

24
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,840
marry me rightfully and properly as Xiao Wanzi.

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,550
As Xiao Wanzi? Really?

26
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,020
This is the responsibility I must take for you.

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,280
Miss Qiao Yun, I am the biggest expert in riding and battle.

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,440
Share my horse and don't worry.

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,780
I can definitely protect you.

30
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,440
All right.

31
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,200
What are you doing? We're about to leave!

32
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,780
Lady Qiao Yun, I am the biggest expert in riding and battle.

33
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,670
Share my horse and don't worry.

34
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,880
I can definitely protect you.

35
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,700
Miss Qiao Yun, get on.

36
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,020
What are you staring at? We're leaving.

37
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,200
If we don't go now, we'll be late.

38
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,520
Miss Qiao Yun really is bold and valiant!

39
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,490
A different kind of girl, as expected.

40
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,160
Follow her! Come on!

41
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,930
I am feeling slightly unwell today.

42
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,600
I have chest pain and a cough.

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,090
- Please understand, my husband.
- Unconvincing.

44
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,690
- How is it unconvincing?
- It just...

45
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,980
Then, what do I do?

46
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,300
How do I say it?

47
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,180
Princess, are you feeling unwell?

48
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,350
I'm fine, Father.

49
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,210
- You're coughing like this and still say you're fine. Hurry and find a physician!
- Yes.

50
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,420
- No need! No need!
- No need!

51
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,830
Do need to worry, Father. The princess is just...

52
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,080
just suffering from an old illness.

53
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,020
She'll recover after taking medicine for a few days.

54
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,850
Princess, people from the prince's manor are arriving tomorrow.

55
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,560
You have to take care of your health.

56
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,900
Shiqing! Why didn't you take good care of her?

57
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,740
I understand now, Father.

58
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,220
Also, you cannot offend the members of the prince's manor.

59
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,540
You must prepare lots of presents to give to Ninth Prince.

60
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,670
Your manners must be impeccable.

61
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,300
Don't worry, Father.

62
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,480
Everything's prepared well.

63
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,570
Princess.

64
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,400
Princess, you must take care of your health.

65
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,360
If His Highness sees you like this tomorrow,

66
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,690
he'll believe we treated you improperly.

67
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,830
Father, please rest assured.

68
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,840
All right, all right. Shiqing, take good care of her.

69
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,620
Take care, Father.

70
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,680
He's gone, he's gone.

71
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,350
Impressive. You even fooled Father.

72
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,680
It's not enough to trick Father. Most importantly, I must trick

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,530
Ninth Prince Manor's people.

74
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,120
Xiao Wanzi, Housekeeper Liu isn't easy to deal with.

75
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,610
You have to prepare well.

76
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,670
You've worked hard, Housekeeper Liu. Was it a smooth trip?

77
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,470
For the princess,

78
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,800
my old bones can endure it.

79
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,530
The princess isn't feeling well today. Please settle in first, Housekeeper Liu. Rest well.

80
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,030
What? She isn't feeling well?

81
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,280
Then I have to see her even more.

82
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,380
Greetings to Princess and Prince Consort.

83
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,900
Congratulations to the two on being joined together in harmony and good fortune, and I wish you a happy and long marriage.

84
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,230
Thank you for taking the trouble to come on this trip, Housekeeper Liu.

85
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,420
I thank the princess very much for her concern.

86
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,770
- Princess, you are—
- Recently, the princess'

87
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,900
skin cannot bear the light, and she coughs nonstop.

88
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,650
The princess is unwell. Have you seen a physician?

89
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,500
- Has the physician—
- The princess is feeling unwell.

90
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,090
You must also be tired from the trip.

91
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,860
Why don't you go down and rest a bit?

92
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,270
Prince Consort, you must be confused. Our Princess of Ninth Prince Manor

93
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,490
has been raised delicately since childhood like a precious treasure.

94
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,750
His Highness only allowed the princess to marry lower because he was moved by Old General Mei's loyalty,

95
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,850
but now the princess is unwell.

96
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,160
You bold, wicked servant, why didn't you report this to Your Highness immediately?

97
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,510
Housekeeper Liu, are you blaming Mei Manor

98
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,020
for not taking care of the princess?

99
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,960
I don't dare.

100
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
The capital's physicians are highly skilled in medicine.

101
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,220
Why don't we send the princess back to be cured as soon as possible?

102
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,200
The trip is tiring. She's unfit to go back to the capital.

103
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,010
In order to escort the princess back home,

104
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,060
His Highness specifically chose an auspicious day. It can't be delayed.

105
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,440
The princess is delicate nobility. Whenever she returns to the capital

106
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,450
will be an auspicious day because of it.

107
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,310
I know that you are worried for the princess,

108
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,710
but sickness progresses as rapidly as an avalanche. It can't be delayed!

109
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,460
Housekeeper Liu is right. I am certainly worried about the princess' illness.

110
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,320
How about this?

111
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,530
We leave tomorrow.

112
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,710
Prince Consort, you certainly care for the princess.

113
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,340
Then, let us leave tomorrow.

114
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,520
Shoot, why did you agree to him?

115
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,500
This Housekeeper Liu is too suspicious.

116
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,600
If I keep refusing, he'll only grow more suspicious.

117
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,940
It's better to agree for now. We'll still have time to think of a plan on the way to the capital.

118
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,280
I hope Qiao Yun can bring back the princess and Xiao Bao soon.

119
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,340
I never thought I could live such a carefree life.

120
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,230
I also never thought I could meet a woman I would love so much,

121
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,410
and be able to live a normal life with her.

122
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,420
While Xizhou isn't as prosperous as Qingzhou and the capital,

123
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,430
but... I think it's still quite fun.

124
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,330
If you like it, let's stay a few days longer.

125
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,000
Really? Then, let's stay here for a few more days

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,150
and appreciate the culture and customs here.

127
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,870
Wife,

128
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,550
I just think... I won't be able to give you a very wealthy life.

129
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,270
You're suffering grievances by being with me.

130
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,800
Don't think like that. Didn't I tell you before?

131
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,260
As long as I can be with you, I'll do anything.

132
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,500
Are you hungry?

133
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,840
I'm a little hungry.

134
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,080
- Then...
- Right!

135
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
I know Xizhou has gourmet food that's very delicious!

136
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,420
- Really?
- Yes.

137
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,190
It's a noodle house. I was willing to rush over here from Green Dragon Fort specifically to eat here and then go home.

138
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,130
Then let's go eat it!

139
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,800
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

140
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,680
- Wife, you have to eat a lot later on.
- All right.

141
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,000
Let me tell you. Their bowls of thick noodles are really good.

142
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,340
Xiao Bao?

143
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,650
Enemies really are bound to meet anywhere. You turned me into this.

144
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,980
So you'd better not think you can live well!

145
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,850
Boss, two bowls of noodles.

146
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,990
All right. Please sit first. It'll be ready soon.

147
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,760
Wife, let me tell you. The noodles here are really delicious!

148
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,600
- Really?
- I've eaten it for many years already.

149
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,500
I often come just to eat noodles.

150
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,740
I'm expecting great things.

151
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,290
- That's right! There are many delicacies around here still. I'll take you to eat them all later.
- All right.

152
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,740
Selling flowers!

153
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,840
There are flowers!

154
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,430
There's rain!

155
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,020
- Little girl!
- Wife!

156
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,310
I want to buy some flowers.

157
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,050
Today is the day you two die.

158
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,330
- How do you sell?

- Thank you.

Eat.

166
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,790
What's wrong?

167
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,090
I don't eat coriander.

168
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,480
Give it to me. I'll eat it for you.

169
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,230
- Hurry and try it.
- Let me smell it.

170
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,490
It smells delicious!

I've finally found you!

175
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,650
Why are you here?

176
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,550
Something terrible has happened!

177
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,560
Hurry and come back to Qingzhou with me!

178
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,300
Ninth Prince Manor is sending someone to welcome you back home.

179
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,650
I'm afraid Housekeeper Liu is almost at Mei Manor already.

180
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,920
Let's go back to Qingzhou right now.

181
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,500
Let's go.

182
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,150
Let's go.

183
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,720
Even if I chase you to the end of the world, I won't let you two go!

184
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,920
Just wait!

185
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,730
What's wrong? It's rare seeing you up so early.

186
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,650
I couldn't sleep at all.

187
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,020
Qiao Yun still hasn't sent news yet?

188
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,590
They just left yesterday.

189
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,550
Even if they arrived at Xizhou and found her, they can't be back so quickly.

190
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,460
They can't have run into some trouble, right?

191
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,860
What nonsense are you saying?

192
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,070
Don't worry. We'll hear from them very soon, all right?

193
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,050
Don't worry.

194
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,200
Rest assured. It'll be fine.

195
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,570
We're leaving soon.

196
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,940
Why aren't Qiao Yun and the others here yet? What if I pretend to be ill?

197
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,500
I'll pretend to be ill and refuse to get on the sedan chair. Then, Housekeeper Liu and the others won't be able to do anything with me.

198
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,350
The traveling time is two days. It's already enough time for us to swap people.

199
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,110
I'll write a letter to Siheng telling them the precise time and place.

200
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,880
Then, what if they can't find the princess? What will we do?

201
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,670
Rest assured. I'll definitely get you through this unharmed.

202
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,290
Princess. Prince Consort. Everything is ready.

203
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,320
Let's leave immediately.

204
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,080
- All right.
- All right.

205
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,360
Shiqing, you must take good care of the princess along the way.

206
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,130
Once you reach Ninth Prince Manor, send my regards to Ninth Prince.

207
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,830
I know, Father.

208
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,190
Stay well.

209
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,190
Be extra careful.

210
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,630

- Young Master.

Tell the rest. We'll rest here tonight.

214
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,800
It's still early right now. If we keep traveling,

215
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,630
we'll be able to reach Jiangzhou before nightfall.

216
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,220
Everyone is tired already.

217
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,780
If we force them to keep traveling, we won't reach Jiangzhou by nightfall.

218
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,860
Besides, bandits come and go along the way.

219
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,890
- Housekeeper Liu, are you really brave enough?
- Well...

220
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,890
I will listen to you for everything.

221
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,380
- All right. Tell the rest.
- All right.

222
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,490
I'll go check on the situation first.

223
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Don't worry. Rest assured.

224
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,090
Young Master left us a letter.

225
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,680
They've already set off for the capital.

226
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,820
[Once the princess is back, immediately start traveling to the posting station ahead of Jiangzhou. We will reunite there.]

Let's set off immediately for the capital.

228
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,860
Let's meet them at the posting station ahead of Jiangzhou.

229
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,960
All right. Then let's set off immediately.

230
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,050
I'll go take a look. You must stay hidden.

231
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,460
Rest assured. I'm here.

232
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,410
Who is it?

233
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,840

Come in!

236
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,110
- How is it? Have they all come back? Where's your Princess?
- They're all back.

237
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,790
They're right outside the posting station. I came in first to investigate the situation.

238
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,090
Then, what are we waiting for? Let's go over and swap places now.

239
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,910
No hurry. There are too many people right now. Ahead of us,

240
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,390
there is still a thick forest. It wouldn't be too late to swap places there.

241
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,830
Qiao Yun, tell Princess and Xiao Bao to wait for our news.

242
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,080
- All right.
- Go.

243

00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,090
I'll drink if you don't.

Stop!

Why have we stopped?

Princess and Prince Consort, what happened?

249
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,580
The princess isn't feeling well and wants to rest.

250
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,290
Prince Consort, we'll be there after crossing this mountain.

can you take responsibility?

Why aren't they here yet? Could something have happened?

- Rest assured. I've prepared everything.

It was you two.

and destroyed the entire mountain fort.

It's your fault I have no home.

269

I followed you two the whole way

270
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,750
just to kill you bastards personally!

271

You're asking me to wake up?

From the beginning, all I'd done was like you, Xiao Bao!

For this woman. For her,

you colluded with outsiders to slaughter the entire fort! Did you let a dog eat your conscience?

They've been gone for so long! It's almost dark!

Most importantly, we must know what happened.

303

They wouldn't have run into trouble. Right? I'm scared.

Your Highness is right. I will use all of my strength to take care of the princess so she can recover soon.

Father wants to see you.

319
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,660
Your Highness.

320
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,970
The princess is heavily ill. I'm afraid there's a danger to Your Highness.

321
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,860
Assassin!

322
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,520
- Guards!
- Your Highness!

323
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,430
She's not an assassin!

324
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,890
Mei Shiqing, who's this woman? Where's the princess?

325
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,480
Your Highness, let me explain.

326
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,240
Stop!

327
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,440
Daughter, what happened here?

328
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,680
Father, it's a long story.

329
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:14,210
Father, that's how everything happened.

330
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,330
It's a strange matter that is completely unheard of.

331
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,220
The crime of deceiving royalty is not a light joke!

332
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,290
Father, Third Young Master and Xiao Wanzi love each other.

333
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,290
- It's not—
- Quiet.

334
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,180
Don't mention this again.

335
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,790
Then... what do you think of Xiao Bao?

336
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,070
Xiao Bao did meritorious work in protecting you.

337
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,760
The Ninth Prince Manor will award him greatly.

338
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,460
I'll thank Father for him.

339
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,540
I would like to meet this Xiao Bao.

340
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,210
Ask him to come to Ninth Prince Manor.

341
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,440
Then I'll go invite him right now.

342
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,110
Immediately send someone to ask General Mei to come here right now!

343
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,940
Yes, Your Highness.

344
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,870
Why aren't they back yet?

345
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,200
The prince won't kill all of us, will he?

346
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,160
How are you in the mood to drink tea right now?

347
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,490
Don't be so agitated.

348
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,080
How can I not be agitated? We're about to die!

349
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,270
Have I ever told you that I have figured out a little bit of

350
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,170
- the art of divine fortune-telling?
- What's that?

351
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,790
Before departure, I helped them perform it.

352
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,060
Their trip will definitely turn all bad luck into good luck.

353
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,800
Really?

354
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,390
You can choose whether or not to believe it.

355
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,500
I might believe others, but yours...

356
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,590
Here, here, here. Drink some tea and calm yourself.

357
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,750
I can't stomach it.

358
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,610
Princess!

359
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,790
You're finally back!

360
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,720
What did Ninth Prince say?

361
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,440
He still wishes for me to switch back with Xiao Wanzi.

362
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,710
This is the only way for both families to guarantee alliance,

363
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,770
and we won't be convicted of deceiving royalty.

364
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,270
Like I said, your words couldn't be believed.

365
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:26,290
Human fortune-telling can't compare to Heaven's. There are many things that have been pre-determined.

366
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:31,300
That day, when I was going to swap identities with you in the thick forest, who could've known Nan Xiang would pop up halfway?

367
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,880
If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't have ended up here.

368
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Then how did you escape from her that day?

369
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,100
Nan Xiang!

370
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
Nan Xiang!

371
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,400
Nan Xiang!

Nan Xiang!

374
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,150

[Nan Xiang's Burial Plaque]

376
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,390
Nan Xiang, I'm sorry.

377
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,370
I can only bury you here.

378
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,930
Ever since youth, I've always seen you as my biological little sister.

379
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,840
I never thought the ending would be like this either.

380
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,890
I know you still hate me.

381
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,100
Hate that I betrayed the mountain fort.

382
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,220
I'm thinking... if I had left the mountain fort a little earlier,

383
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,980
would the ending be different?

384
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,920
This slap is what I owe to you.

385
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,780
Xiao Bao, don't do this. All of this was because of me!

386
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,190
If I hadn't married the wrong person back then, none of this would have happened.

387
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,880
Yaoyao, this isn't your fault. Don't blame yourself.

388
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,210
Nan Xiang,

389
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,010
I hope you can forget your suffering

390
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,360
and be relieved of everything earlier.

[Nan Xiang's Burial Plaque]

392
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,820
There must be fortune after a great calamity. I hope we can all turn this bad luck into good things.

393
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,030
Then, what are your next plans?

394
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,800
My father should already know of my relationship with Xiao Bao. He wants to meet Xiao Bao.

395
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,870
Then will Ninth Prince accept you and Xiao Bao being together?

396
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,640
We'll only know if we try.

397
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,550
You and Xiao Bao truly love each other. I'm sure Ninth Prince will definitely agree.

398
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,520
Then I'll go bring Xiao Bao to meet my father right now.

399
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,980
What are you doing?

400
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,630
I used two hands to calculate it just now. This time,

401
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,780
they will definitely succeed.

402
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,250

Wife, you say, I'm just a bandit.

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,610
How can I have the nerve to go meet Ninth Prince?

407
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,930
How come? Do you plan on never meeting your father-in-law your entire life?

408

Let's go.

Greetings, Your Highness!

412

Xiao Bao. Is that your name?

413
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,980
What's your surname?

414
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,250
Your Highness! I, Master Bao...

415
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,910
was an orphan since young. Orphans don't have surnames.

416
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,420
If that's the case, then gift a surname to Xiao Bao, Father.

417
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,770
If Your Highness is willing to gift me a surname, this would be a great fortune that I wouldn't be able to return in three lifetimes!
