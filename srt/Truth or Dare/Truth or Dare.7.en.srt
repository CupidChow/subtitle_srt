[Protecting each other's secrets]

4
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,980
Mei Shi— Mei Shiqing, you liar!

5
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,460
You pretended to be blind? Do you know how much I suffered?

6
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,100
I had to serve you water and tea, and take care of you!

7
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,620
I also had to cook your food, brush your hair, and help you dress!

8
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,070
I even had to help you walk!

9
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,880
Do you even know how I bustled around

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,190
and spun around you? Were you absolutely delighted watching me do that?

11
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,680
That's not how it was! Listen to my explanation! It's not what you see!

12
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,640
- It's not what you think!
- Then, how is it?

13
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,970
Everyone says that only married couples with one heart can...

14
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,530
can break huge boulders, but what about you?
(Overcome great obstacles)

15
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,250
You also said you're an elegant man, but you're not one at all!

16
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,950
You're just a shameful villain! Shameful and perverted!

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,230
I-I'll compensate you, all right?

18
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,080
Compensate me?

19
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,990
What compensation?

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,290
Speak. What do you want?

21
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,260
Silver? Gold?

22
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,200
Gems?

23
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,800
Not accepting would be a waste. In the future, my father and I—

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,300
- Do you want it or not?
- Yes, yes, yes. I want it all!

25
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,460
That's fine.

26
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,600
- Also...
- Also?

27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,440
Also, all those things you made me do before,

28
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,820
you have to do them again! If I tell you to look east, you have to look east.

29
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,640
You can't even glance westward!

30
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,120
If I tell you to stand, you can't sit. If I tell you to drink water, you can't drink tea!

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,840
You have that many requests?

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,720
Aren't you afraid you'll have to face the consequences?

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,530
Are you threatening me?

34
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,110
Do you believe that right now I can... I can tell everyone about your bogus blindness?

35
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,780
All right.

36
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,810
Then I'll mention my requests as well.

37
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,820
You dare to have requests? Do you have the right?

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,020
Do you not have anything you're deceiving me about?

39
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,780
I—

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,590
- I don't.
- You don't?

41
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,170
First. Why did you peek at me bathing?

42
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,510
I didn't! That wasn't on purpose.

43
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,310
I was just drunk, and I—

44
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,110
Then look at this.

45
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,080
How do you explain this?
[Boulder-Shattering Chest]

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,800
What is this?

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,880
Wh-Who drew this? So ugly...

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,340
This bastard faked being blind

49
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,350
and even watched me draw turtles with his own eyes.

50
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,280
And all of those things in the past... He saw everything!

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,290
All right. Then I'll call Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua over and ask them.

52
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,070
I believe the Ninth Prince misses you as well.

53
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,870
I'll have Siheng write a letter to tell him to come and visit his relative.

54
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,420
How about it?

55
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,750
- Siheng!
- Don't! Don't! Don't!

56
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,090
- I-- Young Master!
- What?

57
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,650
I'll tell you! I'll tell you everything,

58
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,710
but I beg you to please spare Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua!

59
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,150
- They really are innocent!
- Then I'll have to listen

60
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,510
to exactly what happened.

61
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,510
My name is Xiao Wanzi. My father's name is He Yizhi.

62
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,920
We rely on street performances to live,

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,380
but my father lost money gambling, and to pay back his debts,

64
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,500
I was sold to the Green Dragon Fort to become a bandit's wife.

65
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,080
Then the people from Green Dragon Fort brought me to the Ruyi Restaurant to bathe.

66
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,220
I originally planned on seizing that opportunity to escape, but I met the princess there.

67
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,160
It's the same as what she said before. It seems like she isn't lying.

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,790
Even if you are telling the truth,

69
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,190
you still committed the crime of deceiving the emperor by pretending to be the princess.

70
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,070
Do you know that?

71
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,220
It's true that beauties have sorrowful fates and the heavens are jealous of geniuses!

72
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,820
I think I won't be able to see my father ever again in this lifetime!

73
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,090
But, Third Young Master, I beg you!

74
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,860
I-I-I don't know... I don't know why you faked blindness

75
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,760
and I don't want to know why you did it!

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,680
You don't have to let me go, I mean, it's best if you let me go,

77
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,940
but I beg you to please spare Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua! They truly are innocent!

78
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,730
Are you threatening me?

79
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,090
I don't dare! I don't dare! I-I-I swear

80
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,170
I truly, sincerely want to make it up to you!

81
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,510
I-I beg you! I beg you, please spare me!

82
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,960
All right then!

83
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,530
Then I'll watch your performance tomorrow.

84
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm tired. Let's go to sleep.

85
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,250
I'll go and make your bed!

86
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,130
Breakfast is ready.

87
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,410
Siheng! I'll do it!

88
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,840
I'll take care of Young Master.

89
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,280
Y-Young Master, drink some congee first.

90
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,180
It's a bit hot.

91
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,900
How's the taste?

92
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,990
It tastes fine, a little bland.

93
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,320
Then let's eat some side dishes.

94
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,300
- It's too salty.
- Then let's switch to a different one.

95
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,240
Switch to a different one.

96
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,650
This isn't right.

97
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,860
Here.

98
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,480
Princess, did you not sleep well last night?

99
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,650
That's right. I'm tired to death.

100
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,320
I was toiling all night.

101
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,210
The whole night?

102
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,220
T-Then when did you two go to sleep, Princess?

103
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,830
Only once the sun came up.

104
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,440
Here, Young Master. Drink some more congee.

105
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,310
Qiao Yun and Siheng, you two can leave first.

106
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,130
I can take care of Young Master myself.

107
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,880
All right!

108
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,730
Young Master Mei, have you decided yet?

109
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,760
All it takes is a sentence from you!

110
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,720
You can either report me to the officials or let me go.

111
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,360
I want you to continue acting as the princess

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,110
until the situation is resolved.

113
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,900
Wait, but...

114
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,880
Isn't that just the difference between killing me now versus killing me in autumn?
(T/N: Criminals were often killed in autumn or winter due to superstition)

115
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,360
Just tell it to me straight!

116
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,180
No! Can't you just let me go?

117
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,920
- I beg you.
- You aren't satisfied?

118
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,560
Fine.

119
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,130
If you aren't satisfied, I have other methods of resolving this.

120
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,120
Other—

121
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,470
No, no, no, no!

122
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,190
I am very satisfied! Completely satisfied! I couldn't be more satisfied!

123
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,210
I am so thankful! Thank you, thank you. Thank you, Third Young Master Mei, for your kindness!

124
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,460
I... will never forget!

125
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,370
- No regrets?
- No regrets!

126
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,920
A verbal agreement doesn't mean anything.

127
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,080
How about we sign a contract?

128
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,050
Sign a contract?

129
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,290
[Xiao Wanzi talks too much. Signing a contract may not be useful either.]

130
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,490
Surely this isn't a contract to sell me?

131
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,980
How could it be?

132
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,470
You aren't regretting this, are you? If so, I'll take this away.

133
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,010
No, no, no!

134
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,430
I'll sign it. Why would I fear you?

135
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,620
Let me warn you! Don't you dare change it randomly.

136
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,740
Don't worry. You just have to act out your fake princess well.

137
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,560
Also, the fact that I can see

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,620
and the fact that you're pretending to be the princess cannot be found out by others.

139
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,940
Especially those two friends who keep giving you ideas.

140
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,220
- All right. Accompany me on a walk.
- No!

141
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,680
You're full, but I'm not full yet.

142
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,130
You sure changed your attitude pretty fast.

143
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,640
Since I have to act convincingly as the princess,

144
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,880
I naturally have to have the stature of a princess.

145
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,820
Acting must be done all the way, understand?

146
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,120
Come here! I want to drink congee.

147
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,980
All right, Princess, Your Highness.

148
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,310
This congee is a little hot. Let me blow on it for you.

149
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,540
If I climb the wall and leave, they probably wouldn't be able to catch up to me. Right?

150
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,510
But Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua are so good to me.

151
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,700
If I do this, wouldn't it be too disloyal?

152
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,850
W-Wait!

153
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,920
Wait! What are you doing?

154
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,770
Xiao Wanzi, tell us the truth! What did you do to Prince Consort last night?

155
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,140
What do you mean, what did I do?

156
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,200
Qiao Yun already told me everything! Didn't you two do the thing?

157
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,210
What thing?

158
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,920
- Just—
- This morning, you were extremely caring and respectful of Prince Consort.

159
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,370
Could it be that last night, you two...

160
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,640
did that thing!

161
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,760
What kind of thoughts are you having? My goodness!

162
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,930
Then, what's going on?

163
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,300
I can't tell them what happened last night.

164
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,620
I'm sorry, Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua. I'm not deliberately trying to trick you.

165
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:10,460
It's Mei Siheng. He tattled on me, saying my handwriting is ugly!

166
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,900
O-Of course... Of course, I had to cover up for that.

167
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,850
In the end... In the end, I was forced to practice writing the whole night!

168
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,410
Then, did Prince Consort suspect you?

169
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,670
He didn't! Or else, why would I

170
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,760
work so hard to serve him?

171
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,430
Xiao Wanzi, you sure have your ways.

172
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,520
You are even able to tame Prince Consort.

173
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,140
Of course.

174
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,420
No matter what, I can't let him find out I don't know how to write.

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,920
Otherwise, wouldn't we all be exposed?

176
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,920
Xiao Wanzi, actually you could just tell the truth.

177
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,500
After all, you two have been alone together for so long.

178
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,530
It's understandable if something happens.

179
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,880
Non-Non-Nonsense!

180
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,620
If I'm lying, something bad will happen to me!

181
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,860
Or if I tricked you, I swear!

182
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,620
I-I'll... be struck by Heaven's wrath!

183
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,150
All right then. Since you've already sworn,

184
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,400
we'll believe you for now.

185
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,920
I'm trying so hard to cover for you,

186
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,290
yet you two suspect me! You're not human!

187
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,500
Qiu Hua, have you found out where the princess is?

188
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,790
I'm guarding Third Young Master Mei every day!

189
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,280
After all, my beautiful looks are here for all to see.

190
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,310
Say, what if one day, he is unable to control himself

191
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,980
and does something to me? Then my situation will be very dangerous!

192
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,830
Anyway, you must put the big picture first!

193
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,350
You aren't allowed to seduce Prince Consort. Got it?

194
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,480
According to my investigation, I've gone many times to no avail

195
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,120
and not only did I not find anyone, but I also lost many silver taels.

196
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,280
You two had the nerve to brag about being used to royalty.

197
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,150
You even said you only got into Prince Manor after a very careful selection process.

198
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,480
With your speed, how long is it going to take for us to find my father?

199
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,920
Why don't you go if you're so great?

200
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,260
This isn't the capital and we're new here.

201
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,790
It's also so big here. Is it easy to find a person?

202
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,520
Right! You can go look for Omniscient Old Lai!

203
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,010
Who's Omniscient Old Lai?

204
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,670
He's a beggar, but there's no one he doesn't know in Qingzhou City.

205
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,820
Then... where do we find him?

206
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,620
Winter Wind Wine Manor.

207
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,880
If you see someone

208
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,460
dressed in tatters, tipsy, acting crazy

209
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,970
with a stick and broken bowl in his hands, then it's definitely Omniscient Old Lai.

210
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,480
Dressed in tatters, tipsy, acting crazy

211
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,900
with a stick and broken bowl in his hands...

212
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,430
One step... two steps...

213
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,220
[Winter Wind Wine Manor]

214
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,730
It's the middle of the night. How long will I have to wait?

215
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,220
Dirty and tipsy.

216
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,890
Wine, stick, and gourd. Omniscient Old Lai!

217
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,920
One step, two steps! One step, two steps!

218
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,570
- One step, two—
- Are you Omniscient Old Lai?

219
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,450
- Who?
- Omniscient Old Lai!

220
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,350
Go away!

221
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,260
Don't disturb me!

222
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,130
Dressed in tatters, dirty, and tipsy.

223
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,850
If it's not you, then who could it be?

224
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,390
I know! You're here to ask for debt repayment from the gambling house, right?

225
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,040
Go away! Go awa--

226
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,380
What are you talking about? I'm a servant from the Mei Manor.

227
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,350
Do you know Xiao Wanzi? She wants—

228
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,090
How did you know I, He Yizhi, like to eat meat? Get me some more food!

229
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,780
You aren't Omniscient Old Lai? You're He Yizhi?

230
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,330
- Who's He Yizhi?
- Are you actually He Yizhi or not?

231
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,850
Listen to me. Xiao Wanzi is very safe right now.

232
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,120
Come with me. Trust me!

233
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,260
- I'll take you to find her. Let's go!
- All right, all right, all right.

234
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,830
- Let's go!
- Wait a second! Wait a second!

235
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,160
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

236
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,870
As if I'd believe you! Xiao Wanzi was kidnapped a long time ago!

237
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,180
Mister! Xiao Wanzi is actually looking for you!

238
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,950
Mister!

239
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,180
You said you met my father?

240
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,330
He said his daughter's been kidnapped to Green Dragon Fort.

241
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,960
He also said I was sent by the gambling house to trick him out of his money.

242
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,400
Then chances are it really was my father.

243
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,090
How is he? Is he all right?

244
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,590
Well... although he's a bit dirty and his clothes are a bit tattered,

245
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,740
his body doesn't seem to have any problems.

246
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,900
He ran super fast. I couldn't even catch up to him.

247
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,730
Then I can rest assured.

248
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,560
Xiao Wanzi, I know you're worried about your father.

249
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,290
We'll continue looking as well.

250
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,860
Once everything is settled, that will be the day you can reunite with your father.

251
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,190
I hope that day arrives soon.

252
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,210
Boss! Boss, let me ask you something.
[Tea]

253
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,320
Do you know how to get to Green Dragon Fort?

254
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,650
Green Dragon Fort?

255
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,010
Others can't even hide from it even though they wish to,

256
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,350
yet you're heading there on your own initiative?

257
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,790
Do you know or not?

258
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,090
What are you going there for? To be a bandit?

259
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,720
You seem pretty old yourself.

260
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,310
Why are you trying to be a bandit?

261
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,380
Do you know or not?

262
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,390
I— Of course, I don't know.

263
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,450
Then if you didn't know, why'd you talk so much nonsense?

264
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,790
Isn't it all for your good?

265
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,950
Don't get into my business!

266
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,800
When the time comes, you won't even know how you died!

267
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,050
Spare me, warrior! Spare me, warrior!

268
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,620
Old man, tell us.

269
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,730
Why are you looking for Green Dragon Fort?

270
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,560
Speak clearly and we'll leave your body whole.

271
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,060
That...

272
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Warrior, listen to me. My name is He Yizhi.

273
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,270
I owe gambling money to the Qingzhou City's gambling house.

274
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,180
I couldn't pay it, so they kidnapped my daughter, Xiao Wanzi,

275
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,120
to Green Dragon Fort to be with some Master Xiao Bao—

276
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,860
Don't move! Put down that knife!

277
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,850
Father-in-law! I'm Xiao Bao!

278
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,840
Who knew that I'd be so blind as to not recognize you

279
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,070
and offend you! Great Father-in-Law,

280
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,370
please accept my respects!

281
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,860
Don't! Don't! Don't!

282
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,300
You are the Xiao Bao of Green Dragon Fort?

283
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,620
Yes, that's me! That's me! Father-in-Law!

284
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,820
- How is Xiao Wanzi?
- Your daughter's doing great!

285
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,390
In our fort, she enjoys the best of everything!

286
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,170
I'm there to protect her, so no one bullies her!

287
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,320
That's great! That's great! Thank goodness I met you!

288
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,760
Or else, I don't know when I would be able to meet my daughter.

289
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,720
Father-in-Law, it's all right! It's all right.

290
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,240
I... actually just came out to investigate the situation.

291
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,190
Then I got tired, so I drank some herbal tea at the tea stand,

292
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,910
but then I heard that someone was inquiring about our Green Dragon Fort,

293
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,430
so I wondered, "Who is that"?

294
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,190
Who knew it was you, Father-in-Law!

295
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,290
We got into a conflict because we couldn't recognize each other!

296
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,970
We are family but we don't even know each other!

297
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,850
Father-in-Law, I'll take you to Green Dragon Fort right now?

298
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,590
- Come this way, please. I'll take you there.
- All right. Let's go, go, go!

299
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,060
Let's go. Come on. This way.

300
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,000
Hey, Xiao Bao. Why is your mountain fort full of twists and turns?

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,980
I looked for so long, I even thought I was a ghost knocking into walls!
(T/N: Person walking around in circles as if controlled by spirits)

302
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,670
Ours is called a natural barrier. It's easy to protect and hard to attack.

303
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,920
[Green Dragon Fort]

304
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,590
Come over.

305
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,630
- Put that over there.
- Let's have some drinks.

306
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,790
- Don't worry.
- Seriously.

307
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,420
Father-in-Law, this is our Green Dragon Fort.

308
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,360
Master Bao is back!

309
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,790
Father-in-Law, this is it. Your daughter is inside.

310
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,930
You all can leave now.

311
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,970
- Wanzi! I've brought your father!
- My father?

312
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,240
I think she fell asleep.

313
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,370
We're coming in!

314
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,240
- We're coming in!
- Xiao Wanzi!

315
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,890
You...

316
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,090
Father-in-Law, have you gone dumb from missing your daughter?

317
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
That's right! Yes, yes, yes!

318
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,730
- Xiao Wanzi! Missing you made me go dumb!
- Father!

319
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,990
I missed you to death!

320
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,000
I missed you to death!

321
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,390
I thought I'd never see you again! Are you here to save me?

322
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,860
That's right, that's right.

323
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,080
Let's talk privately.

324
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,550
Stop crying, Father. It's all right, it's all right. Xiao Bao,

325
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,240
I haven't seen my father in so long.

326
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,360
May I talk to him privately for a while?

327
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,170
Sure. Sure, then you two talk.

328
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,270
I'll get Father-in-Law some food.

329
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,260
All right. Talk for a while, talk for a while.

330
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,400
I missed you to death!

331
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,630
- Why are you pretending to be my daughter!
- Why are you pretending to be my father!

332
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,840
Speak. Who are you?

333
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,690
It's like this. I'm the Princess from Ninth Prince's Manor.

334
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,490
- I was going to marry—
- Your Highness!

335
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,080
It's enough, it's enough. Sit first, Uncle.

336
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,510
All right, all right, all right.

337
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,280
It's like this. I was originally supposed to be married to the Mei Manor,

338
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,930
but I met a young girl in the Ruyi Restaurant. She should be your daughter.

339
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,060
There was a mishap,

340
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,630
and I was wrongly married into this mountain fort.

341
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,580
As for your daughter, she should be in Mei Manor right now.

342
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,750
No. Wait a second, Princess.

343
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,980
You're saying... you are here now,

344
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,370
and my daughter went to...

345
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,850
to Mei Manor?

346
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,590
It's over!

347
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,720
It's over, over, over, over! It's all over!

348
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,550
A few days ago, I saw someone who stopped me to ask

349
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,680
me about a princess and Mei Manor.

350
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,470
I thought they were looking for debt repayment, you know? So I didn't pay them any mind!

351
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,030
Was that person tall and skinny, sort of like a girl?

352
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes, yes, yes! He also had a sword!

353
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,970
That should be Qiu Hua...

354
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,860
Uncle, if you meet him again, can you tell him

355
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,030
to hurry and send someone to save me?

356
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,090
How about this, Princess? As long as I leave the mountain again,

357
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,180
I'll go to Mei Manor.

358
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,000
Thank you, Uncle.

359
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,220
Let me ask you, Princess. How is my daughter, Xiao Wanzi?

360
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,180
- The one who has two buns on her head!
- Like this?

361
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,780
- Yes, yes, yes! How is she?
- You're talking about Xiao Wanzi?

362
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,750
Yes, yes, yes!

363
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,220
She's super cute! She runs really fast you know.

364
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,790
Really?

365
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,850
I haven't broken a boulder in so long.

366
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,890
I've lived a comfortable life for so long. Now I don't know if I can successfully crush it in one shot.

367
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,850
I also don't know how my father's doing...

368
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,050
If he's unable to find me, will he be unable to eat properly?

369
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:05,250
What if he's caught by the people from the gambling house?

370
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,600
I really can't keep waiting like this.

371
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,000
I must take the initiative.

372
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,910
Only by taking initiative can I escape Third Young Master Mei's claws.

373
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,830
We'll see if he dares to say I'm a big turtle again.

374
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,760
Let's see who's really the idiot turtle.

375
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,040
Siheng! Siheng!

376
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,550
Where are you going?

377
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,230
I'm going to change this robe for Young Master.

378
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,620
The shopkeeper got the dimensions wrong, so I have to hurry and have them make a new one.

379
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,170
Really? I'll go for you.

380
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,990
No, no. Young Master ordered me

381
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,690
to not let you leave.

382
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,540
He doesn't let me leave because... because he's worried for me.

383
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,930
He's worried I'll get lost since I'm unfamiliar with the place.

384
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,820
But think about it. We are still husband and wife, after all.

385
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,410
Yet I've never done anything for him.

386
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,260
This... This makes me very sad.

387
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,520
So I plan to order clothing that only belongs to us two.

388
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,630
Only belongs to you two?

389
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,260
On this clothing, the character "Qing"

390
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,670
and "Yao" will be embroidered.

391
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,640
Don't I have to tell the shopkeeper myself

392
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,390
in order to receive a satisfactory product? Right?

393
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,100
Tell me. Isn't that romantic?

394
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,000
Romantic. Romantic, romantic.

395
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,560
- Then let me go.
- All right. No, not all right!

396
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,250
What do you mean not all right? Even if it isn't all right, it must be!

397
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,630
I'm a princess!

398
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,450
I'm a princess! How can I not even have the authority to do this?

399
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,690
I must go! We can talk about the rest after I get back!

400
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,720
- No!
- Seriously!

401
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,660
The princess has so much strength.

402
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,620
However, the matter of embroidering the clothing

403
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,630
is indeed romantic.

404
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,160
Long time no see, freedom!

405
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,750
Here, here, here!

406
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,580
Old Yao!

407
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,280
What are you doing? I'm still gambling money!

408
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,210
Let me ask you! Have you seen my father?

409
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,290
Xiao Wanzi!

410
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,360
I was just looking for your father!

411
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,020
I have at least been friends with your father for several months,

412
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,840
yet your father tricked me over five wen?

413
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,360
Now that you've come today, ask your father to

414
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,090
return the money he owes!

415
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,140
I left in a hurry and didn't bring money.

416
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,820
Why does it seem like this father-daughter pair

417
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,120
are deliberately working together to trick others?

418
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,220
We really aren't! I'll return it next time. I'm leaving. Bye!

419
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,200
[Mei Manor]

420
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,160
It's over now! It's over!

421
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,880
The sun is about to set.

422
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,230
Why has the princess still not returned?

423
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,230
It's over.

424
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,600
I should tell Young Master the truth.

425
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,900
Young Master, I was wrong. Please punish me however you like.

426
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,600
What happened? You're covered in sweat.

427
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,450
It's like this. This afternoon, I was about to leave to have clothes made for you,

428
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,090
but I was blocked by the princess.

429
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,820
She said she had to give you a surprise and wanted to go have the clothes made for you in my stead.

430
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,610
I wasn't willing in the beginning, but she got angry.

431
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,380
I wasn't able to block her at that moment and let her leave.

432
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,010
How troublesome!

433
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,390
Siheng, guard the door and don't let anyone else in.

434
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes!

435
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
I left too hastily.

436
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,400
I didn't take anything valuable out of the Mei Manor.

437
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,600
I don't even have the money to stay at an inn.

438
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
It's my mistake.

439
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,900
I have the beauty of a flower. What happens if I run into a pervert?

440
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,000
I am an ugly monster!

441
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
Don't rob me. I don't have money nor beauty! I don't have anything.

442
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,800
I beg you to spare me. Don't capture me, don't capture me.

443
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:07,010
Don't be afraid, Miss. It's me.

444
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Night-Spirited Hero, Night-Spirited Hero.

445
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,400
Turns out it was you.

446
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,000
I thought it was a pervert who wanted to violate me.

447
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,800
Scared me to death.

448
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,800
It's already so late. Why don't you hurry and get home early, Miss?

449
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,800
I don't have a home.

450
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,100
Isn't Mei Manor your home?

451
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,000
Don't mention Mei Manor to me.

452
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,400
I'm so angry. That Third Young Master Mei was totally pretending to be blind.

453
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,800
Besides, he knows about my pretending to be the princess.

454
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,400
If I return to Mei Manor, I will really be walking a road to death.

455
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,000
Didn't he tell on you?

456
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Not only did he not tell on me,

457
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
he even signed a contract with me saying that we would pretend to be husband and wife.

458
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Tell me about it! Pretending to be husband and wife.

459
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,000
I really don't know what he's scheming.

460
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I am in great danger.

461
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Miss, you're overthinking. Please stop dreaming.

462
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Stop calling me, "Miss, Miss."

463
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,200
We've already drunk wine

464
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
and had a heart-to-heart talk after all. You calling me that makes it seem like we're strangers.

465
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,600
In the future, you can call me Xiao Wanzi.

466
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Xiao... Xiao Wanzi?

467
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,700
This is the first time I've ever thought my own name sounded so good.

468
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,000
You see, we are connected by so much fate.

469
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
In the future, you can bring me

470
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,400
to travel Jianghu and be a pair of night heroes.

471
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,800
Wandering around in Jianghu

472
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,200
is not impossible, but you must promise me one condition.

473
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,600
Tell me! No matter what the condition is,

474
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,100
even if you want me to pluck a star for you, I would be willing.

475
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
It's really simple.

476
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,400
You must do as you say and you must be true to your word.

477
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,400
Don't worry.

478
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,400
I, Xiao Wanzi, have a reputation in Jianghu that's the best of the best.

479
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,300
I keep my promises. No matter what the condition is,

480
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,000
I can definitely...

481
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,000
I...

482
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,200
I... I really didn't mean to break the promise this time.

483
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,400
It's just that Third Young Master Mei is too hard to interact with.

484
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
If you can't do it, then don't force it.

485
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,800
No.

486
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,000
Isn't it just to face that stinking face of Third Young Master Mei every day?

487
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,200
For you, I will endure it!

488
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,200
I heard that...

489
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,400
this Third Young Master Mei is really brave and good at fighting.

490
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,000
He protects the people of Qingzhou's

491
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
longterm-safety. This kind of military talent is hard to come by.

492
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
He's not bad.

493
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,400
I think he's more like a Chinese pickle.
(T/N: "Military talent" and "Chinese pickle" sound similar.)

494
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
I should eat him with my congee.

495
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,200
He really doesn't have a bit of merit? Not even a little bit?

496
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,800
Merit?

497
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,400
I'll reluctantly...

498
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,000
say that he can be considered handsome.

499
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
As for his physique,

500
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,400
it's fine, but, of course, not as good as yours.

501
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,600
You m-must not misunderstand.

502
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,400
I am not one of those shallow girls who is only attracted by appearance.

503
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,360
I just think that Third Young Master Mei

504
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,200
looks quite handsome when he saves people.

505
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,400
But it's just...

506
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,600
he really doesn't know how to express his feelings.

507
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,400
Also, he always pushes everyone so far away; he's like an iceberg.

508
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,700
Let's not talk about this. Night-Spirited Hero,

509
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,200
I am going to return to the Mei Manor to fulfill my promise. Wait for me.

510
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Goodbye. I'll see you next time.

511
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Not escaping anymore?

512
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,600
If I run away, what will happen to Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua?

513
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,000
Besides, regardless of how bad Third Young Master Mei is, he did rescue me several times.

514
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I cannot be so ungrateful and treacherous.

515
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,800
That's loyal. Then I'll send you home.

516
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,600
No, no, no.

517
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
If someone from the Mei Manor sees

518
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,700
a strange man sending me home, this will easily cause people to gossip.

519
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,400
If that's so, I'll take my leave first.

520
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
He really left.

521
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
How could he just leave like that?

522
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,000
It even would've been fine if he had escorted me up to the alley in front of the Mei Manor.

523
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,800
He doesn't have any understanding of how to be tender towards women.

524
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,600
Miss Qiao Yun.

525
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,200
Move out of the way. I am here to help the princess wash up.

526
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,800
Young Master said that no one may enter.

527
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Are Princess and Prince Consort in the room together?

528
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,000
No comment.

529
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,500
They haven't even had dinner yet. What are they doing?

530
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
No comment.

531
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Besides, "no comment," can't you say something else?

532
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,900
Are you hiding something from me?

533
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,500
Look into my eyes and say it again. Come on.

534
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,000
- Miss Qiao Yun.
- Get out of the way.

535
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,200
You...

536
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,600
Brother Siheng,

537
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,000
how about you tell me what happened?

538
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,200
After all, there are only the two of us here at the moment. All right?

539
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,400
Don't... Don't be like this.

540
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
All right?

541
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,200
Don't ask me. I don't know. I don't know anything.

542
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,000
Older Brother. Older Brother.

543
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Who's out there?

544
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,400
It's Miss Qiao Yun. She here to help the princess wash.

545
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,000
Fine, come in.

546
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,600
Yes.

547
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,400
Open the door.

548
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,600
Open it, hurry.

549
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,100
- Thank you.
- Please.

550
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,000
Prince Consort, I am here to help the princess wash.

551
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
Where is the princess?

552
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,800
I am coming. I am right here. I am coming.

553
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
The princess has returned?

554
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,600
If you had taken longer to return,

555
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,400
I would've sent the Mei family army to seal the city in order to find you.

556
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,200
I-I-I originally wanted to take care of some matters and relieve my boredom while I was out,

557
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,400
but I didn't realize Qingzhou City was this big. I walked around and around and got lost!

558
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,000
It's all my fault for making you worry about me.

559
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,200
Qiao Yun, you can leave this to me. You may leave now.

560
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,800
Yes.

561
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,900
Xiao Wanzi, no matter how he punishes you,

562
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,600
you must endure it.

563
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,800
You can't admit that you wanted to run away no matter what.

564
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,400
Thank you for coming back.

565
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,600
Are you sick?

566
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,400
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

567
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:28,000
