[The Last Moments]

4
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,080
She is a dignified princess who has been kidnapped to the mountain.

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,810
If the prince finds out, what would we do? If the emperor finds out, what would we do?

6
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,230
If they blame the princess for tarnishing the imperial family's reputation, what would we do?

7
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,460
If you and Third Young Master Mei really fall in love,

8
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,210
where should the princess go when she returns?

9
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,260
I know I'm pretending to the princess.

10
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,260
Don't worry.

11
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,210
I will definitely give her an explanation.

12
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,060
Once the princess returns,

13
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,390
I will leave on my own accord.

14
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,090
Really?

15
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,420
Really.

16
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,220
Xiao Wanzi.

17
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,440
Don't blame me for forcing you.

18
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,170
I hope you can keep your word.

19
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,720
I will keep my words for sure.

20
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,250
Here.

21
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,790
Brother Six, what's wrong with Xiao Bao?

22
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,290
This is not good. The medicine did not lessen the effects of the poison.

23
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,800
Then... is he getting worse?

24
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,870
Xiao Bao! Xiao Bao, can you hear me?

25
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,320
Xiao Bao!

26
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,490
Xiao Bao, you cannot sleep! Can you hear me, Xiao Bao?

27
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,760
What should we do, Brother Six?

28
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,090
I believe there is an antidote for this poison.

29
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,050
This type of poison can enter the body through a person's skin.

30
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,080
The person who poisoned him can easily get poisoned as well.

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,970
I think Nan Xiang must have the antidote.

32
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,730
She's just unwilling to hand it over.

33
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,910
Nan Xiang isn't willing to hand over the antidote

34
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,430
so what should we do now?

35
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,860
Right now, we can only ask Chief to step forward.

36
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,970
It's a pity that my words carry little weight.

37
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,950
Brother Six,

38
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,190
I'll go the chief myself.

39
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,930
Xiao Bao,

40
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,250
you promised you'd never leave me behind.

41
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,410
Didn't you say you'd protect me?

42
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,120
If you... If you abandon me now, then you're a stinky bastard!

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
I'll definitely get the antidote for you, wait for me.

44
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,600
Brother Six, take good care of him.

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,160
All right.

46
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,700
- Come on.
- Come on.

47
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,170
Look.

48
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,540
Where is she going?

49
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,090
Isn't it obvious?

50
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,650
Master Xiao Bao doesn't have long to live. This lady

51
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,810
is finding herself another backing (man).

52
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,600
Don't believe me? If you don't believe me, just wait and see.

53
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,290
If she becomes our bandit chief's wife, I'll see whether you all dare say nonsense about her.

54
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,710
That won't happen. The new bandit chief wife will surely

55
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,250
be Young Lady and the future bandit chief will naturally

56
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,050
be you. Am I right, Bros?

57
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,670
- That's right!
- Exactly!

58
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,000
Toast to our future chief.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,530
Cheers.

60
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,780
C'mon.

61
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,810
What's happening?

62
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,800
Nan Xiang! Nan Xiang!

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,280
Father?

64
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,520
Why are you here as well?

65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,180
Look at the troubles you create. Hand over the antidote.

66
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,960
I don't have it.

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,580
You wretched girl! What time is it yet you're still messing around?

68
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,560
If Green Dragon Fort loses Xiao Bao,

69
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,800
then it will be like a blind eagle, toothless tiger, crippled horse,

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,420
or what is that thing?

71
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,250
Anyway, are you trying to

72
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,720
destroy everything I've built?

73
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,680
- Father!
- Shut up!

74
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,130
Good child,

75
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,980
Xiao Bao is about to die. Hurry and give me the antidote, all right?

76
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,350
Father, have you been blinded?

77
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,050
It is all her fault Xiao Bao is like this.

78
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,900
Come back!

79
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,940
This Nan person!

80
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,990
If I don't teach you a lesson today,

81
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,490
then you won't even know that your father's name is Nan Batian (what your father is capable of).

82
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,480
I am fine with not carrying the surname Nan.

83
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,090
Fine.

84
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,170
Ten taels.

85
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,840
Twenty taels.

86
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,060
- Five taels.
- This cost five taels?

87
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,150
You forced me to do this.

88
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,820
Chief, don't!

89
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,310
What are you doing?

90
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,830
If you want to hit someone, then hit me.

91
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,370
Why are you here?

92
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,320
Nan Xiang, hurry and give him the antidote.

93
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,400
Shut up! I don't have it!

94
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,320
You wretched girl, if you don't hand over the antidote,

95
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,830
I will never let this go.

96
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,940
Father! Are you forcing me?

97
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,200
So what if I am?

98
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,450
- You're forcing me too, aren't you?
- I'm not.

99
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,950
You!

100
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,790
All of you are forcing me, aren't you?

101
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,280
Move!

102
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,440
Hurry and leave. Quickly!

103
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,680
What are you doing?

104
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,570
- Put down the sword.
- I don't want to live anymore.

105
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,480
Aren't you just messing around now?

106
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,970
Nan Xiang, don't be rash. Chief, don't force her or else

107
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,710
her life will be in danger.

108
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,550
You put down the sword.

109
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,450
Let go.

110
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,260
You wretched girl!

111
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,110
Think about it.

112
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,350
If you hand over the antidote...

113
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,020
Get out!

114
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,170
Use your brain to think.

115
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,880
If you give her the antidote,

116
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,910
she saves him,

117
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,440
and I marry her, then wouldn't he be with you?

118
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
Father! In the end, everything you do is in order to marry her.

119
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,630
You never thought about me and Xiao Bao. Selfish!

120
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,920
- Bu—
- I never want to talk to you again.

121
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,690
That not it.

122
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,200
I don't want to talk to you either.

123
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,700
Why are you here?

124
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,610
Why are you fighting with your father?

125
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,380
You worried me to death just now, do you know?

126
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,360
Get out. Get out!

127
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,670
I protected you just now in vain.

128
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,950
That brat is getting ridiculous!

129
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,880
She's completely irrational!

130
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,100
How did I— What part of her resembles me at all?

131
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,440
I—

132
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,920
What are you doing here?

133
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,630
In front of all those people just now,

134
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,720
especially in front of Xiao Wanzi, you have embarrassed your father, do you know?

135
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,380
You have the nerve to scold me?

136
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,630
You wanted to hit me in front of that many people,

137
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,120
especially in front of that boulder-shattering person.

138
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,280
Are you the father or am I?

139
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,030
Aren't you my father? I'm not your father!

140
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,110
Enough, don't say anymore.

141
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,060
- What is this?
- The antidote.

142
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,080
Didn't you refuse to give it to me earlier?

143
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,090
Who told you to force me to seek death?

144
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,010
What do you mean by this?

145
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,120
I was going to give it to him anyway.

146
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,720
I just don't want to give in when I'm in front of that street performer.

147
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,330
Don't you understand?

148
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,820
- Do you want it or not?
- Yes.

149
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,370
It'll work, right?

150
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,380
Nan Xiang, in your heart,

151
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,430
are you unable to let Xiao Bao go?

152
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,800
Father, weren't you just saying nonsense now?

153
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,160
I wanted to give you the antidote a long time ago.

154
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,440
I never imagined that street performer to get one step ahead of me.

155
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,660
That Xiao Bao.

156
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,760
You! You are the same as your mother!

157
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,570
Your mouth is sharp as a knife but your heart is as soft as tofu.

158
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,650
If your mother didn't...

159
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,740
I won't say anymore.

160
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,930
Father, I never wanted to make Green Dragon Fort lose Xiao Bao.

161
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,970
If there's nothing else...

162
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,010
I'll leave now.

163
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,710
But in regards to you wanting to hit me,

164
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,310
I'll get back at you later on.

165
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
Women...

166

How am I supposed to answer when you ask so many questions?

327
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,800
You are awake?

328
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,300
Are you well now?

329
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,400
I don't die easily.

330
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,000
Yamla cannot take me.
 (ruler of the underworld)

331
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,600
I'll go get Brother Six so he can look you over.

332
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Brother Six, Xiao Bao is awake!

333
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,600
Xiao Bao is awake?

334
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
Let's me check.

335
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,580
Not bad. He is recovering nicely.

336
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,400
However, because you took the antidote late,

337
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,800
the poison has spread throughout your body.

338
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,400
For a while, you must rest well

339
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,500
until all the poison leaves your body.

340
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Thank you.

341
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,600
Why are you thanking me? You need to thank Xiao Wanzi.

342
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,400
If it weren't for her,

343
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,600
you would've reported to Yamla long ago.

344
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,300
You two talk. I still have things to do so I'm leaving.

345
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,600
so I'm leaving now.

346
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,200
I... have nothing to repay you with.

347
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,200
I can only give my body to you.

348
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,600
You start joking around the minute you get better.

349
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,400
You need to recuperate first.

350
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Then I will cook you something delicious.

351
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Once you finish eating, I will take you to see your brothers here.

352
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,000
Come and look.

353
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,200
Come.

354
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,000
It's Master Bao.

355
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,600
Master Bao, how is it? You have recovered enough to have a pretty lady accompany you.

356
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,200
That's right!

357
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Stop joking around. Go do what you need to do. Go back to gambling.

358
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,700
Fine, fine. We won't say anymore.

359
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,600
Let's go. Let's go.

360
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
If I knew you would treat me so nicely,

361
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,500
I would happily be poisoned 100 times.

362
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,500
Are you mad?

363
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:56,380
As long as you are well, I won't ever get mad again.

364
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,600
I am not used to you suddenly

365
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,000
being so nice to me.

366
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
All right, let's go.

367
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,000
Nan Xiang.

368
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,400
Nan Xiang.

369
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,200
Do you need something?

370
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,200
No matter what happened, I want to thank you for the antidote.

371
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,130
Let me tell you something.

372
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,600
I don't need your fake thank you.

373
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,000
Nan Xiang, we grew up together.

374
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,200
I have always seen you as my younger sister.

375
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,600
I never saw you as my older brother.

376
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,300
Besides, I don't need an older brother like you.

377
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,600
It's fine that you don't see me as an older brother.

378
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,600
You can see me as a friend, right?

379
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,800
Friend?

380
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,200
All the people of the fort are my friends.

381
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,100
I am not lacking any.

382
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
Xiao Bao,

383
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,200
so much has happened lately so she may need time to process.

384
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,400
I wonder what triggered this sister of mine.

385
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
Don't mind her.

386
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,700
Wanzi,

387
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,800
once I'm fully recovered from this poison...

388
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,200
Will you still be this nice to me?

389
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,400
Is Xiao Bao cured of the poison?

390
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,810
Uncle He, you seemed to know a lot about what's going on out there while being locked up.

391
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,600
Before, you did not come when something happened to Xiao Bao.

392
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,200
So I figured that you hadn't come around these days must have been because something had happened to Xiao Bao again.

393
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Uncle He, you are right about one more thing.

394
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,100
What is that?

395
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,100
I... I think I have really fallen for Xiao Bao.

396
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,400
I think the Matchmaking God's red thread is made of steel.

397
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,000
It actually managed to link you two together.

398
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,470
My goddaughter,

399
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,600
I think it's quite difficult in life

400
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,900
for a person to meet someone who makes their heart flutter.

401
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,300
Treasure it while you can.

402
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,000
Uncle He,

403
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,000
what should I do if we can't be together now?

404
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,800
I, your Uncle He, am not that wise.

405
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
But I have one principal.

406
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,800
It is "When the water rises, we use the earth to keep it back; when the soldiers arrive, we use a general to keep them off."

407
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,200
The most important thing right now is persuading Xiao Bao to head down the mountain with us.

408
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Once he has recovered, we will leave together.

409
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Leave together. For that, I will eat more.

410
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,000
I need to eat more

411
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,400
to replenish energy so we can leave together.

412
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Wanzi!

413
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,000
What are you doing?

414
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,200
Didn't I... Didn't I give this to you?

415
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,700
That's right.

416
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,900
Do you like it?

417
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Let me put it on for you.

418
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,800
All right.

419
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,600
♫ Leading you to hide in the dream ♫

420
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,200
♫ That's how much I like you ♫

421
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,200

422

426
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:57,370
