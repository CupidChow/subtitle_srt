4
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,000
T-The soup doesn't taste good when it's cold.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
Why would you give it to me if it doesn't taste good?

6
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,340
Sorry, I'll go serve you up a new bowl.

7
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,120
Did you poison it?

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,640
How could I?

9
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,040
We are husband and wife, the closest to each other.

10
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,320
Then, why did you take my soup?

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,440
After smelling its fragrance, I want to drink it.

12
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,310
Is that not allowed?

13
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,840
How does it taste?

14
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,780
- Pretty good.
- Anything wrong with it?

15
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
- No.
- If nothing's wrong with it, why would you steal my soup?

16
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,950
Whenever I'm h-hungry, I have no energy. You know that.

17
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,980
Moreover, I'm helping you taste it in case it tastes bad

18
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,380
and you become unhappy.

19
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,050
I'll go serve you a new bowl.

20
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,730
How is it? Are you all right?

21
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,890
As I expected, this princess is definitely abnormal.

22
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,280
- What happened?
- I'm not too sure.

23
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,290
The princess suddenly can't stop vomiting.

24
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,210
Could it be that the princess is expecting?

25
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,480
- Impossible!
- Impossible!

26
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,820
You'd best go see a physician.

27
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,900
No need.

28
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,030
I'm perfectly healthy.

29
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,050
It's just that I ate too much over these past few days.

30
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,910
It'll be fine once I throw up the retained food.

31
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,920
The princess is a noble member of the imperial family. Our Mei Manor

32
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,030
cannot allow you to suffer any accidents.

33
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,170
- Siheng, bring a physician.
- Don't!

34
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,240
I still have the ability to run about. I'm seriously fine.

35
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,710
After throwing up, my body even feels lighter.

36
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,930
My steps are more graceful as well.

37
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,170
What are you nervous about?

38
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,400
Am I nervous?

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,570
It's good if you're not.

40
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,430
Siheng, let's go.

41
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,070
Yes.

42
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,230
Are you sure you don't have to see a physician?

43
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
More trouble—

44
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,680
More trouble is worse than less trouble.

45
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,980
Don't you think Third Young Master Mei is kind of strange?

46
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,810
Is he?

47
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,460
I went to smell the medicinal materials Second Madam brought over.

48
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,420
Who knows how long they've been left out for? They're completely inedible.

49
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,700
She brought over tonics that have been left out for who knows how long?

50
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,020
This wicked woman.

51
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,480
She harmed me so severely.

52
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,500
I can't! T-Toilet! Hurry!

53
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,470
Let's leave quickly.

54
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,580
- Greetings, Second Madam.
- Greetings, Second Madam.
- How is the princess?

55
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,450
I heard her condition wasn't well, so this morning,

56
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,500
I came specifically to visit her.

57
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,890
Second Madam, you're so considerate.

58
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,760
Princess,

59
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,970
how are you feeling? Do you need me to help you find a physician?

60
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,830
I have just been wanting to ask you, Second Madam.

61
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,820
The items you asked people to send over. Was it medicine or poison?

62
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,460
What do you mean, Princess?

63
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,980
It's because I ate your medicine that I started vomiting and having diarrhea!

64
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,000
How could I harm you?

65
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,870
Could it be that the servants took the wrong items?

66
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,670
Did you mix up the gifts I sent to the princess with the things that needed to be thrown away?

67
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,820
Then, Madam, you were very careless.

68
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,920
Remember that the medicine was meant for Shiqing's use.

69
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,570
Princess, what are you trying to say?

70
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,880
Even though Shiqing isn't my biological son,

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,310
I've always treated him like he was.

72
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,330
This is definitely a misunderstanding.

73
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,220
No one would believe you.

74
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,220
Put away that false face of yours.

75
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,070
Everyone in the manor knows that you and Shiqing don't get along.

76
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,250
If you say you gave Shiqing a good gift, who would believe that?

77
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,120
Princess, you know that Third Young Master and I don't get along,

78
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,560
but you still accepted my gift.

79
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,910
If word of this were to get out, at most, it would be...

80
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,600
"The princess teamed up with Second Madam to kill her husband."

81
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,970
You're shameless!

82
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,810
I only wanted to have you join me. I didn't expect you

83
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,570
to be so loyal and affectionate to that blind man.

84
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,160
If that is so, I have nothing more to say.

85
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,880
Second Madam is going too far!

86
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,220
What's so great about this?

87
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,880
- Return it all to her!
- Yes,

88
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,870
I'll take it all over right away.

89
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,880
We can't accept this gift!

90
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,760
She gifted it to me, so it's mine.

91
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,170
I swear that I won't help her do anything bad.

92
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,500
Xiao Wanzi!

93
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,290
Look at how gold and shiny it is, how innocent and cute it is!

94
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,910
Can you bear to bring it back to that wicked woman's side?

95
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,050
Princess, Prince Consort is here to see you!

96
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,520
Let go! Let go!

97
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,790
Greetings, Prince Consort. Then, I'll go and make the princess some porridge now.

98
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,640
Careful.

99
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,690
Siheng, go and help Qiao Yun.

100
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,260
Yes.

101
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,690
I've warned you before to stay away from Second Madam.

102
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,860
I've never been close to her anyway.

103
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,510
There's a limit to my patience, so you better listen to me.

104
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,240
- Do you not trust me?
- I don't.

105
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,480
Mei Shiqing, there's also a limit to my patience!

106
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,400
If I wasn't concerned for your safety, I wouldn't have stolen that bowl of soup from you and drank it!

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,600
I should've also let you taste the flavor of vomiting and diarrhea!

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,450
Fine, I won't beg you to be grateful to me either.

109
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,620
After all, you're just someone who doesn't know how to be grateful.

110
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,160
Whatever, I'll treat it as losing weight.

111
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,200
If you knew something was wrong with that bowl of soup, why didn't you throw it out?

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,970
What do you mean by that?

113
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,360
The literal meaning.

114
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,580
What's important is that I saved you. Nothing else matters!

115
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,720
Is that so?

116
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,680
I've warned you long ago,

117
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,180
you cannot accept things from Second Madam.

118
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,220
I'm so furious! Not only are his eyes blind, but his heart is also even more blind!

119
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,340
No wonder why he couldn't get a wife.

120
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,460
Aren't you his wife?

121
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,460
I'm not his real wife.

122
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,810
Whoever marries him must've been unlucky for 8 lives!

123
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,960
Be quieter. If anyone hears you, do you even want your life?

124
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,360
Xiao Wanzi, now what happened?

125
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,040
Mei Shiqing is a huge idiot!

126
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,100
This Prince Consort has the mindset of a youth.

127
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,170
Be more understanding.

128
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,980
I miss my father.

129
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,440
Rather than suffer from the bullying of others,

130
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,570
it would be better to escape together.

131
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,760
That cannot be!

132
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,610
Yes, Xiao Wanzi, this is something that relates to life and death!

133
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,520
Besides, you have already promised us that you'd wait until the plan is finished.

134
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,220
Don't change your mind suddenly!

135
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,330
I was just saying.

136
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,840
How could I, Xiao Wanzi, not keep my word?

137
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,180
Since I have already promised you two that I would protect the princess's wedding,

138
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,040
then I, Xiao Wanzi,

139
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,720
definitely will not admit defeat!

140
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,480
A moment's toleration will bring calm winds and waves.

141
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,180
Take one step back and you will find the vast oceans and skies.

142
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,960
But, Third Young Master Mei doesn't trust me at all.

143
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,350
Then, gain his trust, all right?

144
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,680
I don't have the confidence.

145
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,140
Tomorrow, the monthly payment will be distributed.

146
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,530
Leave it to me!

147
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,320
Isn't it just trust?

148
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,830
Are you kidding me?

149
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,210
Young Master, you still haven't forgiven the princess?

150
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,630
What if she really didn't do it on purpose?

151
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,830
What I'm suspicious of is her identity.

152
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,460
Are you saying that... she's not the princess?

153
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,920
The Princess of the Ninth Prince Manor is well-known for her scholarliness.

154
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,760
Yet the princess who married into our manor doesn't know how to write.

155
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,670
I'm not sure if the Ninth Prince Manor is lying,

156
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,640
or if...

157
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,770
Three-way, nine.

158
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,780
So you were here, Shiqing.

159
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,420
Looking for you was so hard!

160
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,630
- Greetings, Princess.
- What were you looking for me for?

161
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,920
Last time, it was my fault.

So I have decided to make up for it by using good deeds.

Princess, don't make things hard for Young Master.

Don't worry. This time, I will make it right here and you will drink it right here.

Leave the letter that the princess wrote a while ago here with me.

Later, help me deliver it to the Song Manor in the west of the city.

help me check if this letter was written by you or not.

Yes, yes, yes. This is the letter. Go deliver it.

I want to amend the contents of the letter.

178

Siheng, prepare paper and ink for the princess.

Don't let the black smoke billow near our princess. It will cause her to have a headache and faint.

Yes.

183

- What's wrong with the princess?
- dizzy?

186
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,510
It must be because the princess cannot inhale smoke

187
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,360
so she has become weak and fragile.

188

Princess, what's wrong with you now?

192

Something really seems to be wrong with the princess.

It's fine. Just wait and observe the changes.

194

Surely he's not suspecting my identity?

195
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,590
If this is really the case,

196

even if my identity is not exposed,

197
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,450
he will ensure that life is worse than death for me.

This won't do. This won't do.

Gold and money are precious but life is more precious.

Moreover, if my father can't find me, he will be very anxious.

Fortunately, I'm naturally intelligent and talented and took precautions.

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,040
that I could be with you... I grew up listening to your legends.

323
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,970
- Am I that old?
- Hey!

324
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,470
Anyway, I have always dreamed of being like you,

325
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,740
flying across rooftops and hopping over walls, seeking justice and helping the weak.

326
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,770
Wandering around Jianghu.

327
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:54,680
But I think you should become a great chef.

328
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,490
Hey, are you looking down on me? Do you know what my unique skill is?

329
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,180
What is it?

330
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,450
The Boulder-Shattering Chest.

331
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,550
The Boulder-Shattering Chest?

332
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,930
Isn't it impressive?

333
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,090
It's quite unique.

334
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,750
Since I was a child, as soon as I was full,

335
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,970
I would have great strength.

336
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,550
However, if I didn't eat enough, I would not have any energy and I couldn't do it.

337
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,910
When I was five years old, my father would tell me,

338
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,950
"Say, Xiao Wanzi, you eat so much that I can't afford to raise you.

339
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,640
You might as well not idle around. Go shatter boulders with your chest!

340
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,840
Don't you know you need to earn your own money to support yourself?"

341
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,860
That was when I started to follow my father

342
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,320
performing and selling them on the streets.

343
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,950
Then I learned a great many martial arts along the way.

344
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm no worse than you.

345
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,560
Isn't it just street performing?

346
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,500
What do you mean just "street performing"? That sounds really bad.

347
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,800
What I am doing is called m-m-martial arts conjuring!

348
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,230
All right, then why aren't you shattering boulders with your chest now?

349
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,440
I won't lie to you. Right now when I met you,

350
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,580
I had just escaped from the Mei Manor.

351
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,260
Why did you go to the Mei Manor?

352
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,780
My father loves gambling.

353
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,910
After he lost money gambling, he didn't have any money to pay his debts.

354
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,830
So I was pawned to some, some

355
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,280
Green Dragon Fort to become a bandit's wife.

356
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,830
Eventually, they took me to the Ruyi Restaurant

357
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:24,040
and then at the Ruyi's Restaurant, I met another girl who was also supposed to marry someone, just like me.

358
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,970
So in conclusion, coincidentally,

359
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:31,090
the two of us ran into the wrong rooms and I married into the Mei Manor.

360
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,610
That girl... Anyway, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

361
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:38,830
Then... did anyone recognize you after you got to Mei Manor?

362
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,540
I only found out after I entered the Mei Manor.

363
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,540
That girl was actually a princess!

364
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,300
She was specifically betrothed to that

365
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,330
Third Young Master Mei.

366
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,510
I was about to run away. After I heard this news, I got scared to death and tried to escape,

367
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,240
but a maid and a guard

368
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,010
wouldn't let me leave no matter what! They pulled on my sleeves and yelled that they couldn't let me go.

369
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,630
They cried and begged me to stay. They wanted me to...—

370
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,250
Do you know that losing a princess is a crime punishable by beheading?

371
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,020
So I'm a person who

372
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,170
really dislikes seeing people...

373
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:14,230
really dislikes seeing people in dire situations. I thought to myself, "Seeing how pitiful they are, I need to help them!"

374
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,820
That's how I stayed behind and pretended to be the princess.

375
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,690
So that's what happened.

376
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,240
That's right.

377
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,620
Then after you married that Third Young Master Mei,

378
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,480
how did he treat you?

379
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,460
Just mentioning it makes me so angry. He's just a huge villain!

380
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,540
He's seriously so hard to interact with. No, no...

381
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,040
It's not only that he's hard to interact with. He's absolutely unreasonable!

382
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,230
He's both heartless and tasteless!

383
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,340
He doesn't have anything. Having to serve him every day is so pitiful.

384
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,890
Just thinking about it makes me miserable.

385
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,270
I am so pitiful.

386
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,980
Really? Is he really that bad of a person?

387
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,340
More than terrible.

388
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,630
I've already been speaking mercifully.

389
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,690
He's really not even a human.

390
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,310
But, properly speaking,

391
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,740
I don't despise him that much.

392
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,170
There are times where he takes care of me a little bit. Just a little bit.

393
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,020
Stop drinking. You've already drunk a lot.

394
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,060
No. I can still drink.

395
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,430
Really. I will take you home, all right?

396
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,650
I'm not going back!

397
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,170
- I'm not going back.
- Why not?

398
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,680
I need to wait for my father.

399
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,660
My father.

400
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,870
This is our secret meeting point.

401
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,500
In the past, whenever something happened,

402
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,580
I would tell my father and we would meet here.

403
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,950
But...

404
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,610
Th-Then where is your father?

405
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,350
I don't know where my father went!

406
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,250
I can't find my father.

407
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,240
Yes, yes! Stop crying.

408
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,340
Stop crying. How about this? How about this? How about this?

409
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,030
Stop crying, I will take you... Didn't you want to fly above buildings and run over walls?

410
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,590
I will take you flying. I will take you flying.

411
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,190
- Flying?
- Yes.

Then since it's so late,

427
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,430
I am going back to the Mei Manor, Night-Spirited Hero.

Good.

429
