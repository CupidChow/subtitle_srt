3
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,550
Do you mean to say that this matter has nothing to do with you?

4
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,280
Chief!

5
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,930
If I did something like this, the heavens will strike me!

6
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,630
Strike you to death.

7
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,590
Very well.

8
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,250
Very well.

9
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:07,340
The country is governed by its laws. The fort is governed by our rules.

10
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,380
He is your subordinate.

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,780
How do you think we should deal with him?

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,210
You're far too bold, aren't you?

13
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,800
- You!
- Master Wu, I won't do it again!

14
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,150
- I will never dare to do it again!
- I dare you to steal for me again!

15
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,590
Chief, based on the rules of the Green Dragon Fort,

16
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,000
we must chop off one of his hands to give closure to our brothers.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,570
What is he thinking?

18
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,840
Godfather!

19
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,630
Although he has made a mistake,

20
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,560
he could have had unspeakable difficulties.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,970
What if we give him a beating, starve him for a couple of days, and be done with it?

22
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,430
Rules are rules.

23
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,180
If anyone who makes a mistake...

24
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,610
is granted leniency,

25
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,480
how would my Green Dragon Fort still uphold its dignity?

26
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,470
I need to show all of you.

27
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,180
This is what happens to people who hide contraband goods for themselves!

28
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,820
Drag him out, execute the punishment.

29
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,110
Yes!

30
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,230
Big Boss, I know my faults now, Big Boss!

31
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,650
I won't do it again, Big Boss!

32
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,210
- Move!
- Master Wu, help me!

33
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,450
My Lord, have you heard?

34
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,420
Third Young Master and Princess were out all night.

35
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,480
They made the servants in the manor so anxious.

36
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Out all night?

37
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,330
That's right. I can understand.

38
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,410
You say, they are a young married couple in their most affectionate moments.

39
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,450
Nonetheless, they can't just be out all night without telling anyone.

40
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,760
Everyone at the manor went searching for them all night.

41
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,610
I am truly concerned. You see, Shiqing doesn't tell us anything.

42
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,980
In the long run, the Mei Manor

43
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,360
will lose its unity.

44
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,220
Father.

45
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,580
I heard that you didn't return at all last night. Where did you go?

46
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,770
It was a spontaneous plan. I realized that Princess has not experienced the local scenery and customs of Qingzhou,

47
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,270
I took her sightseeing.

48
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,340
Sightseeing?

49
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,230
- Why didn't you come home at night then?
- It's like this!

50
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,750
We went into the mountains last night, and it suddenly started pouring.

51
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,420
The road downhill was slippery. So we found shelter along the path and avoided it for the moment.

52
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,080
It turned out that the rain fell all night.

53
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,690
We had no choice but to make do with spending the whole night in a cave.

54
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,160
Mei Shiqing, you are not a kid anymore.

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,210
Yet you still act so crazy every day.

56
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,200
Next time you take the princess out and don't come home at night, I will break your leg!

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,540
You're a deranged adult. You'd better spend more time thinking about

58
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,670
your future prospects.

59
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,360
Additionally, given that you are married, you'd better think more about

60
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,640
- producing an heir to carry on the lineage.
- What?

61
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,150
Understood. We will leave now.

62
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,140
My Lord, speaking of which,

63
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,110
the two of us haven't gone for a spring hike in a long time.

64
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,290
- How about we...
- You are already so old. How outrageous!

65
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,840
Outrageous?

66
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,120
So we no longer have feelings for each other?

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,670
Siheng, we don't need you here anymore. You can go back now.

68
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,160
Sure. Get some good rest.

69
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,820
Don't worry about it. I'm here to take care of him.

70
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,610
Is your cut hurting again? Let me fetch a physician for you.

71
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,010
No need for that.

72
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,760
I don't want to cause more trouble.

73
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,550
Then, let me dress your wound again.

74
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,850
Let's go.

75
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,130
Watch out.

76
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,100
Xiao Wanzi, did you really go sightseeing with Third Young Master Mei?

77
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,930
Th-That's right.

78
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,290
Hiking is good. It helps with furthering your relationship.

79
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,220
Aren't I right, Qiu Hua?

80
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,470
R-Right... That's right.

81
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,760
Besides, after returning from this,

82
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,780
our Xiao Wanzi and Third Young Master Mei have had huge changes in their attitudes.

83
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,150
- I think that's pretty good.
- You could just say what you mean directly.

84
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,020
A lone man and a woman

85
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,280
spent the whole night in a cave.

86
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,460
After returning, they'd also became very intimate.

87
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,970
- Isn't this obvious?
- What?

88
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,310
You're overthinking it.

89
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,270
I didn't do anything that would be unjust for the princess.

90
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,090
Then it's good.

91
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,420
I was worried that your relationship might grow with time.

92
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,280
After all, when you return to your rightful positions, wouldn't you be the one who gets hurt?

93
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,020
I-I-Isn't the medicine done? It's already burned.

94
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,980
It's burned.

95
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,480

The Third Young Master Mei belongs to Lu Yingyao.

The Night-Spirited Hero is also Third Young Master Mei.

What is?

109
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,120
It's strange that the Xiao Wanzi who is normally so lively

110
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,580
also has moments of silence and deep thought.

111
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,530
What's wrong with that? Are optimistic people not also allowed to contemplate life?

112
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,090
Are you contemplating on what to have for dinner?

113
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,840
Do you really think food is the only thing in my life?

114
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,970
Then tell me, what else is there?

115
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,780
It's... It's nothing.

116
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,210
I'm guessing

117
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,600
you are worried that one day when the real Princess returns, you will need to go back to being Xiao Wanzi.

118
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,890
Then...

119
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,330
How did you know?

120
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,230
Rest assured. My heart already has an owner. That will not change.

121
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,420
I cannot.

122
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,660
I promised Qiao Yun. If the princess finds out,

123
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,460
what should I do?

124
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,570
It's not like that.

125
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:18,060
I was actually thinking about when your wounds will be healed.

126
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,950
I'm much better.

127
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,180
Didn't you promise earlier that you'd take me to eat at the Ruyi Restaurant?

128
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,940
Even now, you can't forget about food.

129
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,940
What's wrong with that? Are you breaking your promise?

130
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,750
No. I happen to have some business to take care of at Ruyi Restaurant.

131
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,330
Let's go.

132
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,630
Thanks for visiting. Hope you come again.

I want to eat sweet and sour pork ribs, West Lake fish in vinegar, Beggar chicken...

Anyway, give me one of each signature dish!

I'm very happy that the young master could find a soulmate.

142

My wife is one of us, you can say what you'd like around her.

143
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,230
That's right.

145
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,810
Any updates on the contraband salt case?

146
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,160
They wouldn't be willing to give up so easily.

147
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,310
They are not some average Jianghu criminals.

148
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,130
During my investigations,

149
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,040
I found quite a number of people involved in the selling of salt.

150
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,990
However, I never would've imagined they would all commit suicide by biting their tongues.

151
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,710
There must be someone very ruthless behind this.

152
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,440
I see.

153
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,110
Let's suspend the investigations for now. They will come looking for us themselves.

154
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,600
Understood.

155
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,980
I would have never guessed that this is how the Night-Spirited Hero does his business.

156
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,480
If there's nothing else, let's go back.

157
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,760
I haven't had the sweet and sour ribs. That would be a waste of this trip.

How come it's still not here?

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,150
I want to come here again.

162
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:15,150
I can enjoy the sweet and sour ribs, and also participate in your chivalrous deeds.

163
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,740
You're doing it for the food, aren't you?

164
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,940
You've changed into new clothes?

165
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,690
Of course!

166
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,820
How do I look? Pretty, right?

167
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,020
Very pretty!

168
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,710
But it's a shame.

169
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,910
What's the shame?

170
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,920
It's a shame that all you think about is Master Xiao Bao.

171
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
But the boulder-shattering girl is the only one in Xiao Bao's heart.

172
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,790
Nonsense! Xiao Bao has already come back around.

173
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,300
This new outfit is a gift from him.

174
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,100
Stop sowing discord between us.

175
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,120
Fine. I admit it.

176
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,380
It was me who put the things in his room that night to frame him.

177
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,440
But have you thought about this? If he were in his room that night,

178
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,020
would I have succeeded?

179
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,880
Think again. If Xiao Bao were not in his room during the night, where would he have gone?

180
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,220
He...

181
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,960
What do his whereabouts have to do with you?

182
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,060
Nan Xiang, you can't be so naive.

183
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,530
Let me tell you the truth.

184
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,060
That night, he went into the room of that boulder-shattering girl. He didn't leave all night.

185
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,550
You thought he brought things back for you because he changed his mind and was being good to you.

186
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,720
The truth is that you and your father were both deceived by that brat.

187
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,790
The two of them are displaying their affection for each other right under your eyes.

188
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,580
That bitch! Just you wait!

189
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,820
Princess.

190
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,560
You say, we truly did save Xiao Bao this time,

191
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,330
but what should we do next?

192
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,650
Uncle He, that day, I had no choice but to prioritize him.

193
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,640
It's not what I meant.

194
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,180
I heard that this time, Xiao Bao didn't hurt a single person when they robbed that merchant group.

195
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,030
I was thinking...

196
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,890
You must have a place in his heart.

197
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,000
Should we find a way to use some effort on Xiao Bao?

198
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,560
He grew up here. It would be difficult to change him.

199
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,340
Moreover, I don't think the weight I hold over Xiao Bao's heart is very heavy.

200
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,760
I don't agree.

201
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,320
Look at Nan Batian. That revolting thing.

202
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,420
I think Xiao Bao and him will have a fallout sooner or later.

203
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,440
I also hope Xiao Bao finds out who he really is soon.

204
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,890
Then, he can return to the right course.

205
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,360
Freeze!

206
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,690
You! The boulder-shattering one.

207
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,420
You saw that Xiao Bao turned back to me,

208
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,350
so you seduced him into your room.

209
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,690
You even made Xiao Bao so mesmerized that he's become crazy.

210
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,890
You have no shame!

211
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,100
Stop spitting allegations here. Stop slandering me!

212
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,500
I'm slandering you? How dare you talk to me like this?

213
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,900
You clearly seduced Xiao Bao, yet you won't even admit it.

214
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,560
Damn it! You are disgusting.

215
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,890
- You are so unreasonable, you!
- Well...

216
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,340
Your face has healed, hasn't it?

217
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,150
You used this face to seduce Xiao Bao, is that right?

218
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,900
I must disfigure you today!

219
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,540
Hold on! Run!

220
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,430
- Let go!
- Miss Nan Xiang, let's calm down and have a talk.

221
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,160
Get out of my way! Or else, I will beat you up too.

222
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,460
Your father wouldn't allow it!

223
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,610
- Don't run!
- I can't see!

224
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,140
It's all dark! Help!

225
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,200
Boulder-shattering onel! Show yourself!

226
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,590
If you've got the capability, never come out for the rest of your life!

227
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,100
I don't believe I won't be able to find you!

228
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,320
Still wanting to run?

229
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,790
I'll ruin your face!

230
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,690
Xiao Bao, tell me the truth.

231
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,700
That night, were you in the room of the boulder-shattering one?

232
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,820
Don't bother about that right now.

233
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,730
Nan Xiang, tell me what you were trying to do?

234
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,430
I...

235
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,030
I am protecting our fort.

236
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,530
They wanted to escape and report us to the officials!

237
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,730
Does this woman mean more to you

238
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,270
than our whole fort? More than me?

239
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,030
Even if they were trying to escape,

240
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,630
you cannot do something so cruel!

241
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,000
How dare you yell at me?

242
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,700
Very well. You forced my hand.

243
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,830
I'll tell my father!

244
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,200
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

245
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,730
Father!

246
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,770
- Someone bullied me.
- Let's leave.

247
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,390
Who dares to bully my darling daughter?

248
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,180
I was strolling around just now,

249
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,610
but I saw that boulder-shattering one and He Yizhi.

250
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,480
Guess what? The two of them were trying to run away.

251
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,380
Thus, I made my move to stop them,

252
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,130
but Xiao Bao arrived.

253
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:11,490
Who would've expected it? He helped that boulder-shattering one, not me, and then he helped her scold me.

254
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,620
Your daughter has such a hard life! Father!

255
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,730
Outrageous!

256
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,090
Guards!

257
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,820
Bring Xiao Bao here.

258
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,580
Godfather, no need! I'm here!

259
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,920
You! You!

260
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,010
Your daughter bullied me!

261
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,670
Look at the three of them! They look like a family! Father!

262
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,730
Brat!

263
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,490
How dare you bully Nan Xiang?

264
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,220
Godfather, you can't be biased.

265
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,230
- If you are impartial—
- Nan Xiang has told me everything.

266
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,080
She said they were trying to escape.

267
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,240
Is that right?

268
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,790
That's not true, Godfather! They were just taking a nice walk in the courtyard.

269
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,900
Your daughter appeared out of nowhere and started beating them up before assessing the situation.

270
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,820
If I didn't get there in time, both of them would've been beaten to death long ago.

271
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,930
Chief, you are wise.

272
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,550
We really were just taking a walk.

273
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,610
Old man, are you saying that

274
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,650
I beat you for no reason?

275
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,970
It's clear that I only beat you because you were trying to escape!

276
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,030
It's slander, Father!

277
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,120
Can I not even trust my daughter's words?

278
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,330
Chief, I...

279
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,330
We really weren't trying to escape.

280
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,570
You are saying...

281
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,250
that my daughter is lying?

282
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,600
No, no.

283
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,020
She... She... Everything she says is correct.

284
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,440
Then you are at fault.

285
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,380
I have provided you with good food and shelter.

286
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,260
Yet you still want to escape.

287
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,690
Although you are Xiao Wanzi's father

288
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,160
and my future father-in-law,

289
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,190
I wouldn't dare!

290
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,060
if you make me angry,

291
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,670
even the king of the heavens wouldn't get away with it.

292
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,860
- Guards!
- Present!

293
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,840
Confine him.

294
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,330
No... Stop... Chief! Wait!

295
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,750
Chief, my father is old. He cannot suffer through this.

296
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,840
Don't worry.

297
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,780
I will give him food and water.

298
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,800
Xiao Wanzi.

299
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,450
Xiao Wanzi.

300
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,820
Your face is almost healed, right?

301
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,250
I wonder whether your body...

302
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,560
It's still very severe on my body. Nothing has healed.

303
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,830
Don't test my patience.

304
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,470
Attend to your illness.

305
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,180
Once I marry you,

306
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,040
I will naturally release your father.

307
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,690
Xiao Bao, don't you see?

308
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,170
If you are not nice to me

309
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,520
and you are nice to the boulder-shattering one,

310
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,780
I'll tell my father. Right, Father?

311
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,720
I've always been nice to you. You were overthinking.

312
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,380
- Father.
- Enough.

313
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,280
Disperse.

314
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,240
Godfather, I'll escort Xiao Wanzi back.

315
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,140
Father!

316
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,240
You are the best.

317
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,170
Can't you let me worry less?

318
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,070
Father! They were clearly bullying me.

319
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,290
Fine. Fine.

320
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,740
Nan Xiang,

321
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,560
do you know what part I like about you?

322
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,810
What?

323
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,290
Stay a little farther from me!
(Pun - the Chinese words for "part" and "a little" are the same)

324
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,860
Give me some peace!

325
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,750
I don't know whether this Nan Batian

326
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,620
will give Xiao Wanzi's father a hard time.

327
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,520
Wanzi, it's me, Xiao Bao.

328
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,980
Xiao Bao, what are you doing here?

329
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,940
I know you must be worried about your father, right?

330
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,500
I'll take you to visit him.

331
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,080
Really?

332
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,590
But we need to be careful and cautious.

333
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,320
My godfather cannot find out about this.

334
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,080
Is that for my father?

335
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,810
That's right. That's all the dishes he likes. You can just pass them to him. Let's go.

336
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,060
That's surely a good thing. Wait!

337
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,950
Master Bao. You are...

338
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,670
Let her go in and send some food.

339
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,780
Wait, but the Chief said that regular people are not allowed to enter as they please.

340
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,580
Not allowed to enter as they please? I understand.

341
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,320
This...

342
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,820
We will pretend you never came.

343
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,900
- Be good. Have a seat.
- Thank you, Master Bao.

344
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,880
Miss, you are here. Come here, come here.

345
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,860
- Have a seat.
- Uncle He.

346
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,070
I was worried you were being wronged, so I brought you some food.

347
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,550
Here's an egg, too. I wanted to treat your injuries.

348
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,210
I can do it myself, Miss. Thank you, thank you.

349
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,920
Uncle He. Thank you for today.

350
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,930
If it weren't for your help...

351
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,110
Don't mention it. Although you are not my biological daughter,

352
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,120
I can't bear the sight of another man's daughter experiencing troubles.

353
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,860
Uncle He,

354
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,910
you must really miss your daughter.

355
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,860
How could I not? She's my daughter, after all.

356
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,690
I'm envious that Xiao Wanzi has a father like you.

357
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,550
Listen to yourself.

358
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,730
How could there be any parents who don't love their own daughters dearly?

359
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,270
Although I grew up in the Ninth Prince's Manor,

360
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,760
my father just used me as a pawn that could garner him great gains.

361
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,790
So I am truly envious of Xiao Wanzi.

362
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,710
Well...

363
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,290
Say, Princess... I think

364
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,490
each person has their own fate. You are such a beautiful girl.

365
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,050
You are also smart and capable. In the future, you'll definitely meet

366
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,990
a person who will protect and love you. It's fine.

367
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,480
By the way, Princess, about escaping,

368
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,590
let's postpone it for now.

369
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,050
You should protect yourself in these next few days.

370
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,940
Don't let that Nan Xiang plot against you again.

371
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,400
I'll let my eye heal in these next few days.

372
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,490
Uncle He,

373
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,110
I'll leave now. Take good care of yourself.

374
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,150
Sure. Go, go.

375
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,050
Go. Wait.

376
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,670
Princess... well...

377
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,600
Princess.

378
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,440
How should I put it? If you don't mind,

379
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,410
I'll take you in as a daughter.

380
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,300
I don't have any other intentions. In this fort,

381
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,240
you can have one more person to protect you.

382
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,990
So for your poor father,

383
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,620
you must protect yourself!

384
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,370
Uncle He, protect yourself too.

385
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,150
Don't worry about it. Hurry. Listen. Go.

386
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,840
Go ahead.

387
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,450
That's how it is this time.

388
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,920
Thank you.

389
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,560
Wanzi!

390
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,170
Wait.

391
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,820
What's wrong?

392
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,320
Nothing.

393
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,700
Come. I'll take you somewhere.

394
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,390
Where are we going?

395
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,960
Why did you bring me here?

396
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,500
What do you think? Isn't this beautiful?

397
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,660
Yes.

398
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,690
Every time I felt down,

399
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,580
I would spend some time here alone.

400
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,800
Do you also have times where you feel down?

401
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,870
Of course.

402
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,720
When my godfather said he wanted to marry you,

403
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,230
I came here every now and then.

404
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,800
Watch what you are saying!

405
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,310
I obey.

406
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,610
So...

407
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,520
Can you spend some time with me here?

408
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,320
Sure.

409
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,120
What are you thinking about?

410
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,300
I'm thinking about how the stars in the night sky

411
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,980
can shine freely in the Milky Way,

412
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,130
but I have been with my father since young.

413
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,100
Even today, we are not living the life we dreamed about.

414
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,480
Me too.

415
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,890
I grew up here.

416
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,530
But that wasn't something I could choose.

417
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:29,270
Xiao Bao, have you ever thought about changing the way you live?

418
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,990
Changing?

419
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,470
The truth is that I wanted to persuade you before.

420
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,730
Not for me or my father,

421
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,070
it's truly for you.

422
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,240
I think there are places in this world that belong to you more.

423
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,610
But I'm just a bandit.

424
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,240
If I leave here,

425
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,350
where can I go?

426
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,130
A good young man can have the ambition to make a name for himself anywhere. You need to believe in yourself.

427
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,670
Besides, there are so many wonderful places in this world.

428
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:09,160
I trust that you can become the kind of person you want to become.

429
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,950
The stars are so beautiful.

430
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:29,030
I really hope that everyone can be as carefree as them.

431
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,780
How do I look? I designed this night-traveling cloak myself.

432
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,340
Isn't it very beautiful?

433
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,730
Doesn't it look very smart?

434
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,140
What are you doing?

435
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,340
What? It doesn't look cute?

436
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,940
What if I change the style or the color?

437
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,280
If I changed it to pink, would I have more of an air of a female hero?

438
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,000
Doing chivalrous deeds is not crushing boulders on your chest!

439
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,960
How am I crushing boulders on my chest? It's clearly very pretty.

440
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,450
Isn't it very noble, dignified, and awe-inspiring?

441
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,790
Is it not?

442
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,190
Your Ladyship, what exactly do you want?

443
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,670
I just want to be your good helper.

444
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,120
In the future, I'll be your left and right arm! The two of us will

445
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,070
stomp out violence for the safety of the kindhearted and commit acts of chivalry!

446
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,860
Here, I'll cut off both arms myself. Stop adding to the trouble, okay?

447
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,840
How am I causing trouble?

448
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,550
I'll be very helpful! In the future, I'll help you

449
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,650
wipe out all kinds of enemies, no matter who shows up!

450
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,360
Enough. Just shut up.

451
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,540
Go back. Wash up and sleep.

452
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,820
Young Master, bad news!

453
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,420
Someone went to the government manor to report the Night-Spirited Hero for colluding with the Green Dragon Fort

454
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,250
and robbing traveling merchants.

455
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,980
How handsome.

456
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,610
They dare to counter with a false accusation?

457
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,980
Looks like the mastermind behind this isn't easy to deal with.

458
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,680
Tell A'Rou to keep an eye on the accuser.

459
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,340
Don't attack him. Monitor him closely.

460
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,010
Yes.

461
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,420
There will be action tonight?

462
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,550
You won't bring me along?

463
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,420
I'll see how you can act alone today!

464
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,040
My head hurts.

465
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,810
They dance well.

466
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,960
Yes, it's true.

467
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,820
The accuser is named Guo Baiwan.

468
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,070
He is a silk merchant in Qingzhou city.

469
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,380
He accused the Night-Spirited Hero of colluding with the Green Dragon Fort

470
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,760
to loot all the high-quality silk products he ordered.

471
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,720
Guo Baiwan is just an errand-running underling.

472
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,460
The mastermind behind this is someone else.

473
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,310
Since he has already made a move, wouldn't it be boring if we don't take action?

474
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,150
How dare they countercharge with untrue allegations?

475
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,960
They must have already laid a trap out to wait for you, Young Master.

476
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,460
Do you have Guo Baiwan's whereabouts for today?

477
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,550
They're all recorded here.

478
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,870
[Guo Baiwan frequently entered and exited Qingzhou days ago. Five days ago, the merchants guild imported a batch of goods, storing them in Yuanxing Cloth House and Hengtai Grain Shop. Our secret lines confirm all of these goods are contraband salt]

479
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,280
Well done.

480
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,360
Leave the rest to me.

481
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,920
Young Master, you must be careful.

482
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,550
These people are cunning fugitives.

483
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,470
I'm afraid that they are harder to deal with

484
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,350
than those bandits from the Green Dragon Fort.

485
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,360
- You are the Night-Spirited Hero?
- If not me, who?

[Under the Moon by Zhang Zining]

487
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:52,540
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

488
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:59,970
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

489
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:07,390
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

490
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:14,010
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

491
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,950
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

492
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,020
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

493
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:29,090
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

494
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,800
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

495
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,730
♫ My treasured memories ♫

496
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:43,650
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

497
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,330
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

498
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,230
♫ It's me missing you ♫

499
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:58,040
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

500
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:16,120
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

501
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:23,550
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

502
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:30,900
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

503
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:38,180
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

504
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,940
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

505
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,780
♫ My treasured memories ♫

506
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,750
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

507
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,540
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

508
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,270
♫ It's me missing you ♫

509
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:11,220
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫
