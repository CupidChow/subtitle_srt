1
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,959
(Truth or Dare)

2
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,840
(Episode 25)

3
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,719
(Killing Third Master Mei)

4
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,159
- Your Highness. - I'm coming.

5
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,640
Xiao Wan Zi.

6
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,959
I'm here to give you this.

7
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,560
Thank you. Come on in.

8
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,879
All right.

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,799
I brought all of these from the Mei Manor.

10
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,439
I thought you might like it.

11
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,159
That's very thoughtful of you.

12
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,120
So?

13
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,359
Were you happy being a princess?

14
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,120
It's boring being a princess.

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,879
I can't do this or that.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,090
I have to mind my manners all the time.

17
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,879
I can't even eat properly.

18
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,919
Actually, it's not that hard being a princess.

19
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,759
To be a princess,

20
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,919
you just need to be picky.

21
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,280
Be picky?

22
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,159
This or that won't do.

23
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,960
Don't like this or that.

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,039
That's it.

25
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,039
That's it?

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,039
Then it looks like I've been too casual.

27
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,810
I heard from Xiao Bao...

28
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,960
that Third Master Mei...

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,000
is known for looking cold.

30
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,319
Is it true?

31
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,439
Of course.

32
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,560
Let me tell you about his cold face.

33
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,520
He looks at people with the eyes of a dead fish.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,840
He glares at you like that.

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,680
His coldness just whooshes out.

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,120
Even on a hot day,

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,080
his glare will freeze you to death.

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,840
His mouth is the scariest.

39
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,319
He is relentless and blunt with his words.

40
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,879
The worst thing is he always bullies me.

41
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,319
He always makes me practice writing.

42
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,520
He's so scary.

43
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,159
Then what do you like about him?

44
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,719
I don't know.

45
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,919
Well...

46
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,280
It's like this when it started.

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,719
As we got to know each other,

48
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,919
I realized that he was kind on the inside.

49
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,439
He just puts on a cold face.

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,680
Well, it's kind of cute.

51
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,680
Then you two are perfect for each other.

52
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,439
That's not true.

53
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,599
Enough about me.

54
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,159
Tell me about Xiao Bao.

55
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,120
Well, he...

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,800
He speaks with no filter.

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,439
And he's very unhygienic.

58
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,120
He would pick up the food that fell on the ground and eat it.

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,680
It's nothing. I do that too.

60
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,080
And he's a big talker.

61
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,120
Anyway,

62
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,599
if you don't hold him back,

63
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,080
he'll just go wild.

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,039
Then what do you like about him?

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,879
That's right.

66
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,080
What do I like about him?

67
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,039
Maybe love doesn't need a reason.

68
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,610
I guess that's love.

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,120
Anyway,

70
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm very happy every day when I'm with him.

71
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,399
I guess that's love.

72
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,519
To be a princess,

73
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,560
you just need to be picky.

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,639
This or that won't do.

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,079
My lord, Your Highness. The food is ready.

76
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,240
This pastry is bad.

77
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,399
Change it.

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
How is it bad?

79
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,050
The shape doesn't look good.

80
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,839
The shape doesn't look good?

81
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,360
It's a round pastry.

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,879
It will get on my nails.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,399
It's not convenient for me to eat.

84
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,199
What's wrong?

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,610
Nothing. Qiao Yun.

86
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,959
Have it exchanged.

87
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,959
All right.

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
This one too.

89
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,079
All right.

90
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,639
Have some Osmanthus wine.

91
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,879
I made it myself.

92
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,279
What's wrong?

93
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,720
I don't like this cup either.

94
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,759
What's wrong with the cup?

95
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,399
The wine should be paired with a jade cup.

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Yes.

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,800
A good wine should be paired with a good cup.

98
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:05,240
It's mainly to match my outfit today.

99
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,720
What's wrong with her?

100
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
She wasn't like this before.

101
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,600
What are you mumbling about?

102
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,000
It's nothing.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,519
I was thinking of going to Ruyi Inn.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
Stay here.

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,680
Me too.

106
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm going too.

107
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,079
You don't need to go. Be good.

108
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,160
Wait.

109
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,160
Are you mad at me?

110
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,720
I didn't mean it.

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
I just wanted to be...

112
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,439
more like a princess.

113
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,160
That way, I won't get exposed.

114
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,279
Was it Lu Ying Yao who taught you that?

115
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,240
Just be yourself.

116
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,800
Right, are you going to Ruyi Inn...

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,680
because you got new information?

118
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,839
Before Tao Ju Zheng died,

119
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,519
he said my mother's death...

120
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,680
is related to my father's annihilation of the Salt Gang.

121
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,680
So I told Rou to look into what happened back then.

122
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,480
Hurry and go then.

123
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,480
Come on. I'll buy you delicious food.

124
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,040
Rou, how's the investigation going?

125
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Young Master.

126
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
Back then,

127
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,079
there was indeed a Salt Gang...

128
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,399
that occupied Qingzhou for a long time.

129
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,959
During their heyday,

130
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,480
even the officials feared them.

131
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,439
The leader of the Salt Gang is called Li Tian Long.

132
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
His power cannot be compared to today's Salt Gang.

133
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,319
He had occupied Qingzhou for a long time...

134
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,079
and was the person who called the shots.

135
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,160
Even Qinglong Clan had to bow down to them.

136
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,399
Then, General Mei was stationed here with his troop.

137
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,920
That's when he started to annihilate the Salt Gang.

138
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,920
Li Tian Long got injured in the battle...

139
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,680
and died later on.

140
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,160
Since then,

141
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
the Salt Gang started to fall apart.

142
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,560
Did you find out how Li Tian Long...

143
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,800
is related to Qinglong Clan?

144
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,600
It has been some time since then.

145
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,279
Further investigation is still pending.

146
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,759
Just ask your father.

147
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,279
He is involved in it.

148
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,639
Him?

149
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,319
With his temper,

150
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm afraid he'll kick me.

151
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,360
Just try asking.

152
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,040
He might not have told you before,

153
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,000
but you've reconciled with your father now.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,519
He might be willing to tell you.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,160
I'll try my best.

156
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,920
Right, there's something important I have to tell you.

157
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,210
As you ordered,

158
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,039
spies have been stationed at all the stalls of the Salt Gang.

159
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,210
They recently found out something new.

160
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,519
What is it?

161
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,090
They found a significant portion of the Salt Gang's funds...

162
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,679
were secretly transferred to a business...

163
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,799
under the name Fulongchang.

164
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,330
The business is in the capital.

165
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,720
The owner is someone named Dong Da Man.

166
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,120
Doesn't Fulongchang sell pastries?

167
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,759
That means...

168
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,919
selling pastries...

169
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,399
is just a front.

170
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,240
They are actually a channel to sell illegal goods.

171
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,480
I got it. That's what you call...

172
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,000
carrying out evil deeds under the banner of virtue.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Am I right?

174
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,360
Those black money...

175
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,090
went into Fulongchang's account in the capital.

176
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,639
That means...

177
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,559
there is someone in the capital...

178
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,279
backing up the Salt Gang in Qingzhou.

179
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,210
Then Dong Da Man...

180
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,279
He can't be the one behind it.

181
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,360
As for who the mastermind is...

182
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,919
and how much power he holds,

183
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,519
we don't know anything yet.

184
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,879
So we have to be more cautious from now on.

185
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,720
It's getting dangerous.

186
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Father.

187
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,600
Shi Qing, you're here.

188
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,840
What's the matter?

189
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,960
You never come here without a reason.

190
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,450
Did you come here to chat with me?

191
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,159
I just want to know something.

192
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,330
Back then,

193
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,279
you wiped out the Salt Gang...

194
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,559
and my mother was murdered.

195
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,120
How are these matters related?

196
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,450
It has been...

197
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,919
over a decade since then.

198
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,679
I don't want to talk about it.

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Father.

200
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,210
Father.

201
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,679
For my mother's sake,

202
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,919
please tell me the truth.

203
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,440
Ten years ago,

204
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,919
Salt Gang was arrogant and domineering.

205
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,240
They committed any crime imaginable.

206
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,320
I was young and naive.

207
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,399
I sent a letter to the court to wipe out the Salt Gang.

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,679
I knew very well...

209
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,240
that their leader, Li Tian Long,

210
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,399
was ruthless.

211
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,960
It was the night before the purge...

212
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,279
when I put you and your mother...

213
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,080
in a small house in a remote place.

214
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
I didn't expect...

215
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,360
news of it to leak.

216
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,559
Fortunately, in that misfortune,

217
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,000
you escaped.

218
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,679
But...

219
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,279
But your mother...

220
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,919
Your mother...

221
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,120
was murdered.

222
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,639
All these years,

223
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,279
I've been haunted by this incident.

224
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,360
I've let your mother down.

225
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,399
I've let you down.

226
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
I wasn't a good father.

227
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,159
Looks like Father doesn't know yet...

228
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,039
that my mother's murderer is still at large.

229
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,080
If I tell him now,

230
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,759
it'll only break his heart more.

231
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,360
Situ.

232
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,279
How have you been?

233
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,639
I'm still waiting...

234
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,279
for Third Master Mei's head.

235
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,440
I've been incompetent.

236
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,240
But I had my reasons.

237
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,559
There have been some changes in my stronghold recently.

238
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,960
I heard about your godson.

239
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,080
He stole your woman.

240
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,840
That's misinformation.

241
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,000
I haven't married her yet.

242
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,399
She's not my woman.

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,519
But I will definitely rip him to pieces.

244
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,200
That's your matter.

245
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,559
It has nothing to do with me.

246
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,840
What I want to know is...

247
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,240
when will Third Master Mei die?

248
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,559
Don't worry.

249
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,440
I've already looked into it.

250
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,080
He often goes to Ruyi Inn.

251
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,759
I'll set up an ambush...

252
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,720
in the next few days and kill him.

253
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,600
Third Master Mei is skilled in martial arts.

254
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,039
Do you have anyone who can do it?

255
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,960
This person has fought with Third Master Mei before.

256
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,600
He knows him well.

257
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,559
Don't disappoint me this time.

258
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,279
I've prepared a hot pot for everyone today.

259
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,559
Do you all like it?

260
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,759
- Yes. - Yes.

261
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,080
Had I known Ruyi Inn served such good food,

262
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,960
then I wouldn't have been a bandit.

263
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,759
That's enough. Stop talking.

264
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,879
Let's eat.

265
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,559
- All right. - Here.

266
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,679
Mr. He.

267
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,320
- Here. Thank you. - Here.

268
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
I'll put them in.

269
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,360
- This too. - Put in the meatballs too.

270
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,519
And that vegetable.

271
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,879
- This? - I want to eat it.

272
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,639
- All right. - Young Master.

273
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,279
- We've questioned Old Freak Chen. - Eat more.

274
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,480
- But we didn't get any information. - Bring it here.

275
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,639
- Eat up. - Keep interrogating him.

276
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,000
Eat that.

277
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,679
Eat this.

278
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,000
It's good.

279
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,600
- More vegetables. - Eat more.

280
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,320
Here, have some more.

281
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,120
Bottoms up.

282
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,159
- Let's drink. - This is really delicious.

283
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Kill!

284
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,600
Did Nan Ba Tian send you?

285
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,600
What exactly happened to my mother's death?

286
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,360
Tell me!

287
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,159
Soon,

288
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,960
someone will tell you.

289
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Shi Qing!

290
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,039
- Shi Qing. - Young Master.

291
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,200
Are you all right?

292
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,240
Your eyes.

293
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,399
Are you all right?

294
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,759
Si Heng.

295
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,919
We'll go home and get a physician.

296
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,200
You should go. Leave the rest to me.

297
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,839
- I'm counting on you. - Hurry!

298
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
How could this happen?

299
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,799
My dear.

300
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,410
The physician has stopped Third Young Master's bleeding.

301
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,599
His injury has stabilized for now.

302
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
But...

303
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,519
his eyes were severely injured.

304
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,279
I fear...

305
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,200
These quacks.

306
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,650
At the critical moment,

307
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,170
they are of no use at all.

308
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,170
Looks like you aren't faking it this time.

309
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,000
If you don't shut it, I'll put you in the woodshed!

310
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,480
My dear.

311
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,440
Why don't we head back first?

312
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,759
Let Third Young Master rest.

313
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,599
I'll think of ways too.

314
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,720
I'll find some well-known physicians to treat him.

315
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,279
Don't worry.

316
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,650
You two can go ahead.

317
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,720
I need to talk to Shi Qing.

318
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
All right.

319
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,839
Let's go.

320
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,650
What exactly is going on?

321
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,680
How did this happen?

322
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,960
How can you still laugh?

323
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,440
It must be Qinglong Clan.

324
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,039
Yes.

325
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,359
Shi Qing.

326
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,920
I don't want to nag you,

327
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,799
but you're already married to the princess.

328
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,240
You should be working towards a bright future,

329
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,759
not getting yourself into trouble with the outlaws.

330
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,319
Look at you now.

331
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,480
Qinglong Clan is causing trouble for the people.

332
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,599
I won't let them be.

333
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,799
Besides,

334
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,240
they are related to my mother's death.

335
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,559
All the more I won't let them get away!

336
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,319
Didn't I tell you?

337
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,920
It was the Salt Gang...

338
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,720
that killed your mother.

339
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,960
I annihilated them 10 years ago.

340
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,799
I decapitated Li Tian Long myself.

341
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,519
You've been fooled for 10 years.

342
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,519
I have found a lead.

343
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,319
The person who killed my mother is still out there!

344
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,890
And he is related to Qinglong Clan.

345
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,240
The Salt Gang was wiped out 10 years ago.

346
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,440
Now, they have come back from the dead.

347
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,410
Can't you see any of that?

348
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,039
My eyes may be blind, but not my heart!

349
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,650
You punk.

350
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,359
So you won't believe anything I say?

351
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,839
I...

352
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,480
I am the reputable general of Qingzhou.

353
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,890
How could I not know what happened here?

354
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,200
Father, it's true.

355
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,279
We saw the people who smuggled salt.

356
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,440
It's all true.

357
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,720
Your Highness, you don't have to take his side.

358
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,279
This punk...

359
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,279
has never been one to listen to anyone.

360
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Father.

361
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,119
If you insist on pretending to be blind,

362
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,960
there's nothing I can do about it.

363
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,680
I'm blind?

364
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,599
You're the one who's blind now, you brat!

365
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,200
Your Highness.

366
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,319
Take good care of him.

367
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,410
I'll search for renowned physicians.

368
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,119
No matter what,

369
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,440
we have to cure this punk's eyes.

370
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,720
I won't accept your kind offer!

371
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,200
Are you trying to anger me to death?

372
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,559
Talking to you is like talking to a wall!

373
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
I'm so mad.

374
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,480
Shi Qing.

375
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,519
We have to get your eyes treated first.

376
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,720
Once we catch Situ Lin and his men,

377
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,170
General Mei will believe you.

378
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,319
Mr. He.

379
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,119
Can you stop pacing about?

380
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,319
Pacing about?

381
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,599
Who am I pacing about for?

382
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,119
It's all my fault.

383
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,119
Third Master Mei must be implicated...

384
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,759
because Nan Ba Tian wants to get back at us.

385
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,000
I wonder what will happen to his eyes.

386
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,759
Xiao Wan Zi.

387
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,079
What if Young Master Mei becomes blind?

388
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,119
Mr. He.

389
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,240
If you can't wait,

390
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,170
I'll go to the Mei Manor.

391
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,000
All right. Xiao Bao, let's go.

392
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,119
Wan Zi.

393
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,519
How is it?

394
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,650
Xiao Wan Zi.

395
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,720
Just tell us if there's anything.

396
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,039
We'll solve it together.

397
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,920
He has seen many physicians.

398
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,799
They all say Shi Qing's eyes can't be cured.

399
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,480
Your Highness.

400
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,890
What should I do?

401
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,920
He can't become blind.

402
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:45,759
He's blind?

403
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,559
There's a blind physician I know.

404
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,759
He might be able to heal his eyes.

405
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,240
All right. A blind physician is good.

406
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,960
Wait, Mr. He.

407
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,559
Isn't a blind physician...

408
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,720
blind?

409
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,920
A blind physician can't see!

410
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,119
That's right.

411
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,799
How can a blind man treat the eye?

412
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,200
He specializes in treating the eyes.

413
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,559
A few years ago, he came to the capital to cure people,

414
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,720
but he offended a dignitary.

415
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,400
Then he was blinded by someone.

416
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,680
After that, his personality completely changed.

417
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,160
He became isolated and peculiar.

418
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,960
Then a rumor spread that he also came to Qingzhou.

419
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,960
However, he has abandoned his practice.

420
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,160
He doesn't see patients anymore.

421
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,960
I'll find him.

422
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,440
I'll make sure he heals Shi Qing's eyes.

423
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,119
Wan Zi, I'll go with you.

424
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Mr. He.

425
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,160
He is very hot-tempered.

426
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,039
He will be upset easily.

427
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,960
- Then... - It's better if Wan Zi goes alone.

428
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,880
I'll go alone.

429
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,839
Be careful, Xiao Wan Zi.

430
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,799
Is anyone there?

431
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,039
Is anyone there?

432
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,119
Who are you looking for?

433
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,480
You...

434
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,960
Are you...

435
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,000
Are you the blind physician?

436
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
No.

437
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,200
I've never heard of him.

438
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,799
I've asked around.

439
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,799
You came from the capital.

440
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,799
Then you should know...

441
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,400
that I no longer treat people.

442
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,519
The one I'm asking you to save...

443
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,880
is Young General Mei of Qingzhou.

444
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,759
He was blinded after a fight with the bandits.

445
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,680
Even if it was the emperor who came,

446
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,279
I still wouldn't treat him.

447
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,759
Then have you heard of Night Warrior who fights for justice?

448
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,960
Aren't you going to save a warrior like that?

449
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,279
No means no.

450
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,720
All right. You can save your breath.

451
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,279
Go.

452
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,720
I'm not leaving.

453
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,519
I'll stay here until you agree...

454
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,920
to see him.

455
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,279
Do whatever you want.

456
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,160
But don't disturb my cultivation.

457
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,480
Let go.

458
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,880
Unless I die.

459
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,720
Otherwise, I won't let go.

460
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,279
All right then.

461
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,920
Since you're willing to risk your life to save him,

462
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,599
then show me how sincere you are.

463
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,359
I have a bottle of poison here.

464
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,839
You'll die after drinking it.

465
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,680
If you drink it,

466
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,079
I'll treat...

467
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,440
Young General Mei's eyes.

468
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,839
Keep your word.

469
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,119
If you can't cure him,

470
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,240
I will haunt you even after death.

471
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,319
Father.

472
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,440
I'm unfilial.

473
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,559
I'll repay you in the next life for raising me.

474
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,160
Reward?

475
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,319
Yes, there is.

476
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,680
To cure Shi Qing's eyes,

477
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,960
I'm willing even if I die.

478
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,759
I finished it.

479
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,799
Can you save him now?

480
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:30,799
Interesting.

481
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,319
Interesting.

482
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,079
All these years,

483
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,720
you are the first person to drink this poison.

484
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,559
All right then.

485
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,960
I'll go with you.

486
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,960
May I ask?

487
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,240
How much time do I have before I die?

488
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,960
Can I still see my husband and father?

489
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,519
Are you going or not?

490
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,079
If you don't go,

491
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,440
you won't be able to meet anyone.

492
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,440
You kneeled all night.

493
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,000
I only made you drink...

494
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,440
the herbal tonic I've been making for myself.

495
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,839
You're lucky.

496
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,319
What?

497
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,440
Are you going or not?

498
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,559
I'll go.

499
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Let's go.

500
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,960
Father.

501
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,720
I haven't been home all night...

502
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,160
because I went to find this physician.

503
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,920
He can heal Shi Qing's eyes.

504
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Shi Yuan.

505
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,039
He's blind.

506
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,599
Your Highness.

507
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,279
He should treat his eyes first.

508
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,039
You can't judge people by their appearance.

509
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,920
We'll have to try to see if it's possible or not.

510
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Your Highness.

511
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,559
No matter how grave the matter is,

512
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,079
we can't be in disarray.

513
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,440
Look at him.

514
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,079
What kind of physician did you look for?

515
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,400
He was blinded by the dignitary,

516
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,119
not because he was incompetent.

517
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,240
If he was skilled enough,

518
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,119
why would he be harmed by a dignitary?

519
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,680
He must have bragged about his medical skills,

520
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,480
but he couldn't cure the patient's eyes.

521
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,359
So he was blinded as revenge.

522
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,640
Your Highness.

523
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,839
You're still young.

524
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,039
You don't know how to read people.

525
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,480
You'll be fooled easily.

526
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,319
Father.

527
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,720
Please give this physician a try.

528
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,119
Your Highness.

529
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,079
I understand how you feel.

530
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,119
Go back and get some rest.

531
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,680
I'll take care of him.

532
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,599
Father, don't you trust me?

533
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:42,799
Your Highness.

534
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,119
Do as he says.

535
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,720
Let him treat me.

536
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,039
Medical practitioners serve the people.

537
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,680
Shi Qing.

538
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,319
We don't know much about him.

539
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,839
- What if... - It's fine.

540
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
I trust him.

541
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
All right.

542
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,119
Then we'll give him a chance.

543
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Thank you, Father.

544
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,559
Come on.

545
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
Sir.

546
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,839
How are my son's eyes?

547
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Qiao Yun.

548
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,599
Go and get the medicine.

549
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,720
Si Heng, get the money.

550
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Send him back.

551
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,119
Yes.

552
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Give it back.

553
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:51,319
I thought it was some kind of miracle drug.

554
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,000
They're just common herbs.

555
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,359
You can't tell what their specialty is,

556
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,240
yet you say they're mediocre.

557
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,799
Sir, you can see, but you're blind in the mind.

558
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,440
- What a shame. - What...

559
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,960
- You... - Stop.

560
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,519
Father, the prescription...

561
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,279
Qiao Yun, get the medicine.

562
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,839
Mother.

563
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,400
The princess...

564
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,839
told me about the blind physician.

565
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:27,960
I'm sure it will be fine.

566
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,519
If he can't cure your eyes,

567
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,359
we'll find another physician.

568
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,559
I'm going to fix your eyes no matter what.

569
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,359
Do you know how worried I was?

570
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,440
If you had come home a little later,

571
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,079
I would've gone to look for you.

572
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
I'm sorry.

573
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,279
If there's anything in the future,

574
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,599
I will discuss it with you first, all right?
