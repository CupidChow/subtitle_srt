[Blooming Flowers and a Full Moon]
(T/N: idiom for Marital Bliss)

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
Bestow Xiao Bao with a family name.

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,700
If Your Highness bestows me with a family name,

5
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,000
it's really a blessing that I can't cultivate for three lives.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,800
What a bold thief.

7
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Ninth Prince Manor is not a place you can seek connections with.

8
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Someone!

9
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Capture this mountain bandit who's guilty of evil crimes.

10
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,000
Father, what are you trying to do?

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,500
You may be muddle-headed but I will not be muddle-headed with you.

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,400
You can't ruin your future because of them

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,300
and ruin the entire Ninth Prince Manor!

14
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,800
Them?

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Are you going to capture Xiao Wanzi, too?

16
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,200
Why are they still not back yet?

17
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,700
Young Master, I was late to escorting the princess and Master Xiao Bao.

18
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,900
I didn't do my job well and, thus, attracted trouble.

19
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,970
This is not your fault.

20
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,890
Are you worried that Ninth Prince won't easily give this a rest?

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,600
I was thinking it is very suspicious of Ninth Prince

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,800
to suddenly summon us to the capital.

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Suspicious?

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,600
Although the Salt Gang has been eliminated, all the clues

25
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,800
point towards the court and people of the capital.

26
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,400
This has already dragged everyone into this muddled business.

27
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
Young Master, are you saying

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,200
that the emperor has summoned you in regards to the Salt Gang?

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Before, A'Rou found out that

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,700
a sum of money flowed to Fu Longchang.

31
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,600
Regardless of who is here in the capital, we need to act first in order to gain the upper hand.

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,400
Understood.

33
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,800
Go to Fu Longchang to arrest Dong Daman immediately.

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
Young Master, don't worry.

35
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,200
I will definitely find the truth behind all this.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,600
What are you all doing?

37
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,000
As expected.

38
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Shiqing! Shiqing, they want to take me!

39
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,400
Shiqing!

40
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,700
Prince Consort,

41
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,800
don't give me a hard time.

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm under orders to do this.

43
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,200
If you want to take her, you can. Just take me as well.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,300
Are you crazy, Shiqing?

45
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,400
Fine. I will listen to you then. Capture both of them.

46
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,100
Yes.

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,600
What are you doing?

48
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
Shiqing.

49
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Third Young Master, you are locked up here, too?

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,200
Are you an idiot?

51
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Why did you come to prison with me?

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't worry. I'm here.

53
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,900
Right now, I'm worried about my Yao Yao.

54
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,100
She's out there alone. Who knows what her father will force her to do?

55
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,300
Yao Yao!

56
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,100
Yao Yao, why are you here, too?

57
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,400
Your father is too cruel.

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,600
I asked to be here.

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,200
I think it's safer for us to be together.

60
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,600
Since the princess has decided, let's live and die together.

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,900
All right.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Damn!

63
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,600
It's you, Brother Situ.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,900
I thought I encountered some bad people.

65
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,600
Is there any arrangement from the people above us?

66
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Hence, you knocked them unconscious as you are afraid they will overhear.

67
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Do you know what happened in Qingzhou?

68
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Master is very troubled.

69
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,800
He wants you to close down Fu Longchang for now.

70
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Close it?

71
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Then... where will I go?

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,400
Master has ordered you to leave the capital immediately.

73
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,600
The farther you go, the better.

74
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Understood! Understood.

75
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,200
It's a critical time, right? I will leave right away.

76
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,500
I have to see you off

77
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,700
so I can report back.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
You...

79
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,000
Brother Daman, have a good journey.

80
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,600
Dong Daman! Dong Daman!

81
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,800
Damn. I'm still one step behind.

82
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,100
[Master]

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
How did it go?

84
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,200
Reporting Prince. Dong Daman is already on his way.

85
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I failed to do well regarding things in Qingzhou.

86
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Please punish me.

87
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,800
You are still too young and have no foresight.

88
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,000
You do not understand the principle of

89
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
immediately clearing the weeds.

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,200
Yes. You are right in your teachings.

91
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,000
I watched you grow up.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
After all, your father, Li Tianlong,

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
worked for me in the past.

94
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,500
It is a pity that Third Young Master Mei is now at the Ninth Prince Manor.

95
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,000
Even so, I'm willing to kill him for you.

96
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,800
It's unnecessary to use a bull-slaughtering knife to kill a chicken.
 (T/N: No need to use great efforts to complete an easy task.)

97
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,400
They are here in the capital now because of my strategy

98
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,000
in praising Third Young Master Mei for wiping out

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,500
the Salt Gang

100
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,200
after his marriage to the princess.

101
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,800
The emperor is ecstatic so he wanted to see them.

102
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,600
But I heard from the spy that

103
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
the real Lu Yingyao has returned to Ninth Prince Manor.

104
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,400
Young Master Mei won't that be foolish enough to bring the fake princess to His Majesty, right?

105
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,600
As long as there are rumors about a fake princess

106
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,400
and I deliver the rumors

107
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
to His Majesty, it's enough.

108
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm stupid. Prince, please be specific.

109
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,100
Once His Majesty hears that the Mei Manor

110
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,200
allowed the princess to be trapped in the mountain fort

111
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,400
and someone to impersonate her,

112
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,830
he will become furious for sure.

113
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,600
Then, he will definitely have me

114
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
bring men to capture and bring him to the Hall of Supreme Harmony for interrogation.

115
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
I will say that this Third Young Master Mei

116
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,400
did a few great deeds in Qingzhou, taking credit and becoming arrogant.

117
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,800
However, his father was demoted and punished.

118
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,000
He was very discontent from the beginning

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and even gave birth to evil intentions,

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,800
openly attacking my guards.

121
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,500
Eventually, I couldn't help but carry out a death sentence on the spot.

122
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,600
You are indeed wise, Your Highness.

123
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,200
It's just that, would the emperor think there are only verbal statements and no physical evidence?

124
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,400
All of my guards will witness it.

125
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,700
Besides, they are all associated with the Ninth Prince Manor.

126
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,200
If that still doesn't work, then you can slash me with your sword.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,200
I dare not. I dare not.

128
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,600
Look at how cowardly you are. If I take the sword to my body,

129
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,200
then it further proves that Third Young Master Mei attacked my guards.

130
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,600
I understand now

131
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
and ask that you give me orders.

132
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,340
Master, General Mei is here.

133
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,880
Mei Changyun, do you know you have committed a heinous crime?

134
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,320
I know my crimes and am willing to be punished.

135
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,510
How could you let this happen?

136
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,410
Prince, I have never met the princess in the past.

137
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,700
I only found out when I received your secret letter the day before.

138
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,900
Forget it, forget it. The priority now

139
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,190
is to find a solution to resolve this matter immediately.

140
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,090
Prince, how do you want to resolve this?

141
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,520
Have Yingyao and Shiqing marry according to the original plan

142
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,940
and let this matter pass.

143
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,320
Prince, I fear the children will not agree to this.

144
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,930
Are you senile?

145
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,350
They have to go give thanks to His Majesty the day after tomorrow.

146
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,890
Do you want them to defy imperial orders and be disrespectful? Do you have nine heads?

147
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,360
Or do I have nine heads to be beheaded?

148
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,100
Prince, how could I dare to deceive the monarch? It's just...

149
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,810
What? You don't want them to complete their marriage?

150
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,980
I know my son Shiqing.

151
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,950
He and Xiao Wanzi have great affection for each other.

152
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:54,140
If we separate them now, they would rather die than live in hell.

153
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,200
Would you not care for the well-being of the Mei family for a girl who performs on the street for a living?

154
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,520
Since it has come to this stage, I have an idea.

155
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,210
Speak. I will take Xiao Bao as my son. Then, he will be a member of the Mei family.

156
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,630
Let him marry the princess. That way, this matter will be resolved.

157
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,730
Listen to what you have just said.

158
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,670
You are going to take a mountain bandit as your son

159
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,640
and want my daughter to marry a mountain bandit?!

160
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,290
Prince, this is the only way to resolve this matter.

161
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,870
Prince, please grant this.

162
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,190
I'm warning you. Don't oppose me.

163
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,420
Do you know how serious of a crime you two have committed?

164
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,660
Deceiving the monarch is not a child's game.

165
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,310
I'm willing to bear the consequences.

166
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,950
Please do not be angry, Father. It was not my intention to commit such a crime.

167
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,120
It truly was a strange combination of circumstances and out of my control.

168
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,450
The ones who deserve the death for their crimes are the mountains bandits who kidnapped you

169
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,360
and that liar who impersonated a princess.

170
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,030
It's a small matter to play tricks with the Ninth Prince Manor and General Manor.

171
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,240
Deceiving the monarch is a serious matter!

172
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,260
These kinds of evil people should be sentenced to death immediately.

173
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,390
Father, if you kill Xiao Bao, I won't want to live either.

174
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,460
Xiao Wanzi and I will live and die together.

175
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,240
Why are you both as muddle-headed as General Mei?

176
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,940
You are going to give thanks to His Majesty tomorrow.

177
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,030
Father, why must you bitterly force me this way?

178
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,510
Can you really bear to see me and Junior General regret for the rest of our lives?

179
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,380
You are my biological father.

180
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,690
Could it be that, from the start till the end,

181
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,290
you really regard me as a tool for this manor?

182
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,420
I know now.

183
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,720
Speak. What must I do for you to spare Xiao Bao and Xiao Wanzi?

184
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,720
As long as you both are willing to complete the marriage,

185
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,520
I can spare their lives.

186
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,920
Fine. I promise you.

187
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,740
I promise as well.

188
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,830
All right. Go now.

189
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:58,140
Prince, will you really spare that mountain bandit and girl?

190
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,660
Now that it has come to this, what other solution is there?

191
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,190
Prince, sparing them may bring troubles later on.

192
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,210
After all, our princess was taken to their mountain fort.

193
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,720
If outsiders know about this,

194
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,430
how will our manor gain a foothold?

195
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,530
Are you saying...

196
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:25,620
Prince, the princess and prince consort are going to see His Majesty tomorrow.

197
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,220
Why don't we...

198
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,920
take care of them?

199
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,390
[Thousands of Auspicious Gatherings]

200
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,800
Princess, the carriage is ready.

201
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,960
Why don't you go to the palace with Prince Consort together?

202
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,390
I have one more matter to attend to.

203
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,160
I want to see Xiao Wanzi and Xiao Bao.

204
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,320
Princess, the auspicious time can't be delayed.

205
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,030
I want to explain to them about Junior General and me,

206
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,860
asking them to look at the bigger picture.

207
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,430
I want them to know that I don't have a choice in certain matters.

208
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,830
That way I can have them give up hope.

209
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,850
Housekeeper Liu, you watched me grow up.

210
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,820
You would let me say a few words to them, right?

211
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,800
You are the prince's daughter and are filial.

212
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,240
How could I not empathize with you?

213
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,640
Escort the princess to the prison.

214
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,040
Yes.

215
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,090
- Xiao Bao.
- Yao Yao.

216
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,350
Shiqing.

217
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,860
Say, why did you two disappear in the morning?

218
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,890
You are finally back.

219
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
Aren't I back?

220
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,760
Yao Yao, I didn't see you all morning. I missed you.

221
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,960
Wait. Why are you two here?

222
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,440
Did your father think it through and want to release us?

223
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,830
My father wants to make use of the time when we are at the palace to harm you.

224
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,230
We are here to save you.

225
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,330
After we save you,

226
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,630
I will settle you two into the home that my wet nurse left me.

227
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,690
After we return from the palace, we will discuss what to do next.

228
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,200
Is it just you? Where's the princess?

229
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,740
Over there.

230
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,640
Stop!

231
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,700
How bold of you, Third Young Master Mei. This is the Ninth Prince Manor.

232
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,730
You are not allowed to behave wildly here.

233
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,190
Princess, didn't you promise the prince?

234
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,390
Housekeeper Li, I overheard your conversation with my father.

235
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,970
Then, I won't be polite. Take them down.

236
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,730
Leave this to me. Leave now.

237
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes. Let's go.

238
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,580
General Mei, you have gone too far.

239
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,560
Mei Changyun!

240
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,800
You dare to create a ruckus at a prince's manor.

241
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,260
Have you lost your mind?

242
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,930
Prince, I have an important matter

243
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,270
I want to report to you.

244
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,120
This is the small home that I acquired for my wet nurse.

245
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,300
She's now back in her hometown with her family.

246
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,700
Thus, no one knows of this place.

247
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,210
Xiao Bao, you and Xiao Wanzi can wait here.

248
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,140
We must enter the palace to see His Majesty now.

249
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,180
Wife, will it be safe for you two to enter the palace now?

250
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,470
After all, you just released us.

251
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,600
The prince is furious.

252
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,480
What should we do if he tells His Majesty?

253
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,190
That's right. There is General Mei, too.

254
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,280
Will anything happen to him at the Ninth Prince Manor?

255
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,820
Don't worry. My father regards keeping face as a life and death matter.

256
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,750
He won't let anyone know that his daughter entered a mountain fort before.

257
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,340
My father has an even more important matter to tend to.

258
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,760
An even more important matter? What is it?

259
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,190
Capture the rebel, Third Young Master Mei!

260
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,950
Yes!

261
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,060
Situ Lin? You didn't die?

262
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,260
Not only am I alive but I'm living well, too.

263
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,240
Sixth Prince, why are you here? You are even with Situ Lin.

264
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,910
What is it? After seeing me,

265
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,270
aren't you surprised?

266
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,630
Then that means Your Highness wants to see us surprised, is that right?

267
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,970
Smart. Smart.

268
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,170
What a pity. What a pity.

269
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,260
Thank you for your consideration. You are a great planner, Prince.

270
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,030
You dispatched my father to Yongzhou and summoned us here to the capital.

271
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,870
You came to this home that belonged to the princess's wet nurse so quickly.

272
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,150
I am guessing that since we entered the capital, we were constantly being watched by you.

273
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,980
You are very clear about my matters.

274
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,350
I fear that I'm more clear of your matters than you think.

275
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,720
Could it be that you can give me more surprises?

276
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,640
You are very decisive. You knew I wanted to find Dong Daman.

277
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,910
You were one step ahead of me.

278
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,970
This is my capital, after all.

279
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,510
Unfortunately for you, it is more convenient for me to do things than you.

280
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,540
Your capital?

281
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,860
All the lands in the world are the emperor's.

282
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,720
Saying that, aren't you afraid that others will hear?

283
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,800
You all are people who are about to die anyway.

284
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,690
It is of no worry for me to say these things to you.

285
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,410
Sixth Prince, this is the capital.

286
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,950
I was just about to enter the palace with Third Young Master Mei to thank His Majesty.

287
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,120
If you do anything to us, His Majesty will never let you off.

288
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,700
Moreover, he will also investigate why you are doing this.

289
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,740
Say, Princess,

290
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,530
don't think that I'm not aware

291
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,070
of this girl substituting you to be with Third Young Master Mei this whole time.

292
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,700
You are wrong.

293
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,690
Third Young Master and I are the pair granted a marriage.

294
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,690
Besides, it's time to thank His Majesty.

295
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,300
You are not wrong.

296
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,640
You are stronger than my useless Ninth Brother.

297
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,000
However, I have long reported the misunderstanding

298
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,800
that you speak of to the emperor.

299
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
His Majesty heard that the Mei family

300
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,840
abandoned you at the mountain fort without a care

301
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,370
and even found someone to impersonate you. His Majesty is furious.

302
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,700
He ordered me to take you all back for interrogation.

303
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,830
What a pity.

304
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,940
A pity that you won't be able to go.

305
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,150
Third Young Master Mei, explain.

306
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,600
Why is that?

307
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,820
Naturally, it's because I've become arrogant after taking credit for a few deeds I've done in Qingzhou

308
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,530
and is discontent with the emperor for demoting my father.

309
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,670
After everything was exposed, the emperor sent men to capture me

310
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,820
yet I have evil intentions and attacked Your Highness.

311
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,190
There's no choice but to execute me on the spot.

312
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,880
Yes. That's right.

313
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,180
However, you missed one thing.

314
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,220
This matter began with the princess, thus, you lost your mind and used your sword to kill

315
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,450
the pitiful princess who escaped from the mountain fort.

316
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,850
You also want to fight me to the death!

317
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,090
This injury will confirm

318
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,180
your crime of attacking me.

319
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,440
I have already sent soldiers to capture your father.

320
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,520
Third Young Master Mei, you deceived the emperor, committing a heinous crime.

321
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,480
Today, Sixth Prince will capture you all on behalf of the emperor.

322
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,970
Situ Lin, you've committed so many evil deeds.

323
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,490
You won't have a good ending!

324
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,550
I previously gave you a chance

325
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,460
but you chose Third Young Master Mei.

326
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,450
Since that is the case, then you two can die together!

327
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,020
Whoever dares to harm Young Master today,

328
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,060
regardless of who you are,

329
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,230
you need to step over my corpse first.

330
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,280
Fine. Then I shall step over your body today.

331
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,680
Prince, I have something to say.

332
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,230
Tell Yamla then!

333
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,810
Let him speak.

334
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,890
Prince, you may not know that

335
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,040
I know divination.

336
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,720
This is interesting.

337
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,180
How about I use the word "ruler" to divine something for Your Highness
 (T/N: "ruler" also means "prince")

338
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,890
to see if your plan will succeed?

339
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,620
Fine.

340
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,870
[Ruler]

341
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,800
Prince, please take a look.

342
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,250
The three horizontal strokes of "ruler" (王) are the "sky," "Earth," and "people," respectively.

343
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,570
There is a straight line down the middle.

344
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,460
If you step forward one more step, then you will have your glory

345
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,270
and become a master (主).
 (T/N: similar to character for "ruler" but with a stroke on top)

346
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,980
If my guess is right,

347
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,140
Your Highness's illicit salt business

348
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,680
is to collect money for your grand future plans.

349
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,660
You don't want to be a prince.

350
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,490
You want to be the master instead.
 (T/N: the emperor is referred to as master of the empire)

351
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,350
What else do you know?

352
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,470
Prince, don't be anxious. I'm not done with the divination.

353
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,250
However, it's a pity that

354
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,790
this "ruler" character has the same pronunciation as the first character in "death (亡命)."

355
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,940
If Your Highness wants to forcibly claim glory,

356
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,520
then I'm afraid you'll only end up with your head on the ground and dead.

357
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,780
What nonsense are you spouting?!

358
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,300
Prince, the divination that I gave

359
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,590
is the worse of the worst fortunes there are.

360
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:24,880
Tell me. How do you know of all that?

361
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,170
Do you think killing Dong Daman

362
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,680
will make everything fine?

363
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,010
Dong Daman. Dong Daman!

364
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,880
Dong Daman.

365
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,200
Tell my wife to leave the capital immediately.

366
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,490
In regards to whatever you want to know,

367
00:26:54,490 --> 00:27:01,340
ask my wi... my wife...

368
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,560
Where are the items?

369
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:31,000
Of course, they are at the place you are most worried about, in front of His Majesty.

370
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,330
Mei Changyun, are you telling the truth?

371
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,320
Prince, this is concrete evidence.

372
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,030
Sixth Prince is doing all he can to kill

373
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,040
all who knows of this matter.

374
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,440
No wonder he incited me to summon Princess and Third Young Master Mei to here.

375
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,030
He was setting a trap.

376
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,510
Prince, I fear Sixth Prince

377
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,410
has reported the impersonation of the princess to His Majesty.

378
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,160
He won't easily spare our families.

379
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,910
Prince, can you still not tell?

380
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,480
Sixth Prince is trying to overthrow the emperor.

381
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,300
That is a heinous crime!

382
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,390
Please act immediately, Your Highness, or else this will be the disaster of the century.

383
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,440
Since it's come to this, we can only gamble everything.

384
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,290
You come with me to the palace to see His Majesty right away.

385
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,860
All right.

386
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:27,570
Turns out you have a bright mind.

387
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,240
If you want me to die,

388
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,080
it's not that easy.

389
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,480
Kill him!

390
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,800
Sixth Prince, His Majesty already knows about your matters.

391
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,180
He ordered me to take you back for interrogation.

392
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,340
Prince.

393
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,930
Stop right there!

394
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,220
Shiqing.

395
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,700
Shiqing!

396
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,540
Sixth Prince's rebellion has been settled.

397
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,880
Because of you people, His Majesty summoned Ninth Prince to the palace.

398
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,160
Ninth Prince has returned in disappointment.

399
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,820
What did His Majesty say?

400
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,100
Impersonating the princess is a crime of deceiving the monarch.

401
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,800
It's a matter that could have the entire family executed.

402
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,480
Fortunately, His Majesty took into account that

403
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,190
you took care of the Salt Gang and cleared out the bandits of the Green Dragon Fort.

404
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,390
You even found concrete evidence of Sixth Prince's rebellion.

405
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,240
Your achievements make up for your crimes, so he won't punish you all anymore.

406
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,790
But...

407
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,330
What is it?

408
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,900
Your mistaken marriages have not been resolved yet.

409
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,000
Could it be that His Majesty wants Shiqing and the princess to complete their marriage?

410
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,370
Xiao Wanzi, I'm not done talking.

411
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,840
Fortunately, the empress spoke nice things on your behalves.

412
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,990
Hence, His Majesty is willing to fulfill your wishes.

413
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,090
He conferred Xiao Wanzi as a princess and to marry General Mei Shiqing of Qingzhou.

414
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,400
He conferred Xiao Bao as a vice general and to marry Princess Lu Yingyao.

415
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,430
This is great!

416
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,120
Let me tell you. At this moment,

417
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,610
Ninth Prince is currently sitting inside with the imperial decree not knowing what to say.

418
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,210
Of course, His Majesty's decree is the highest.

419
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,040
Xiao Wanzi!

420
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,340
Qiao Yun!

421
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,680
You all have suffered many troubles. Today,

422
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,400
the clouds have finally part so the moon can shine through.
 (T/N: the silver lining is upon them)

423
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,600
Flowers are blooming and it's a full moon.
 (T/N: marital bliss)
