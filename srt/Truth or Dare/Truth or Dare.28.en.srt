1
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,480
(Truth or Dare)

2
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,719
(Episode 28)

3
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,640
(Revealed Truth)

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,239
Wan Zi!

5
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,439
Shi Qing!

6
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,680
You want to annihilate Qinglong Clan?

7
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,280
I'll send you to the king of the underworld.

8
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,599
I'll kill you!

9
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,810
Wan Zi!

10
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,090
I...

11
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,199
killed your mother.

12
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,599
Now, I killed your woman.

13
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,719
I'll do you a good deed.

14
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,159
I'll send you off to them.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Shi Qing!

16
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,039
Are you all right?

17
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,039
Father, why are you here?

18
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,199
If anything happened to you,

19
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,080
how am I going to face your mother when I'm gone?

20
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,919
Are you all right?

21
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,120
Nan Ba Tian.

22
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,960
Qinglong Clan has been annihilated by the Mei family's army.

23
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,960
Today is the day you die.

24
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Cut the crap.

25
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,960
Take me if you can.

26
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,159
Nan Ba Tian.

27
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,879
Did Li Tian Long order you to kill my mother?

28
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,960
Nobody can order me.

29
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,719
He was persistent in annihilating the Salt Gang back then.

30
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,240
His next step was obviously annihilating Qinglong Clan.

31
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Otherwise, I wouldn't have joined hands with Li Tian Long...

32
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,560
to teach your father a lesson.

33
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,960
I didn't expect...

34
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,719
that you still got away in the end.

35
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,400
Nan Ba Tian.

36
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,719
Today,

37
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,719
I will make you pay an eye for an eye!

38
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,600
My dear.

39
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,279
Shi Qing and I...

40
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,720
have avenged you today.

41
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Wan Zi.

42
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,279
Shi Qing.

43
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,759
Shi Qing.

44
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,519
Shi Qing.

45
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,120
Young Master.

46
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,079
Young Master, you're awake.

47
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,480
You fainted after you killed Nan Ba Tian.

48
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,000
The general brought you home.

49
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,120
He's on his way to Yongzhou with his troop.

50
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,439
What about Xiao Wan Zi?

51
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,720
Where is Xiao Wan Zi?

52
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,319
Young Master.

53
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,600
I've sent people to search the mountain.

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,079
Did they find her?

55
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,120
Did they find her or not?

56
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,199
Where is she?

57
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,759
Young Master.

58
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,279
They...

59
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,800
They couldn't find her.

60
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,800
Useless.

61
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,040
You're all useless! I'll find her myself!

62
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,120
Young Master.

63
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,720
Young Master.

64
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,959
- Move! - Young Master.

65
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Young Master.

66
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,240
- Young Master. - Wan Zi.

67
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,040
- Wan Zi! - I've sent people to look for her.

68
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Go home and get some rest.

69
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,240
- Young Master. - Wan Zi!

70
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,639
You're hurt. Go back and rest.

71
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
She's alive.

72
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,959
She's right there.

73
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
She's still alive.

74
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,839
I can find her. She's still alive.

75
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,519
Do you know that she's still alive?

76
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,160
Can you stop being so silly?

77
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,079
She's up ahead. Someone has saved her.

78
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,399
Do you know that you're injured?

79
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,680
Someone has saved her! I need to find her!

80
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
- Let's go back. - Shut up!

81
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
- Young Master! - Si Heng.

82
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Si Heng.

83
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,600
Have you found Xiao Wan Zi?

84
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,519
No.

85
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,639
Qiao Yun.

86
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,680
Mr. He is injured. Go back and take care of him.

87
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
If...

88
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,800
If Mr. He asks about this, what do I tell him?

89
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,199
If he asks, just tell him we'll bring Xiao Wan Zi back.

90
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,639
You must reassure him.

91
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
All right.

92
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,639
Rou.

93
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,879
Let's split up and search.

94
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
All right.

95
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Yao Yao.

96
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,360
I'll check on Third Master Mei.

97
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,240
- Your Highness. - Come on, let's go.

98
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Wan Zi!

99
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Third Master Mei!

100
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,680
- Wan Zi. - Third Master Mei.

101
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
Your body is still weak.

102
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,480
Go back and get some rest.

103
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,639
We'll help you look.

104
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,920
If it was the princess,

105
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,040
what would you do?

106
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,450
Third Young Master!

107
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,090
Wait for me, Third Young Master!

108
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Third Young Master!

109
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720
- Third Young Master. - Wan Zi.

110
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,919
Hold on.

111
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,090
A letter came for you.

112
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,519
I can't thank you enough.

113
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,399
Wait.

114
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,679
Xiao Wan Zi is still alive,

115
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,799
but she's in Situ Lin's hands.

116
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,759
Let's go together.

117
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,330
We'll rescue Xiao Wan Zi with him.

118
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,330
No.

119
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,039
It says Third Young Master must go alone.

120
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,159
Otherwise, Wan Zi will die.

121
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,600
As long as he can see Xiao Wan Zi again,

122
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,159
even if it's the fiery pits,

123
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,559
he will still barge in without hesitation.

124
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,519
You're awake.

125
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,759
Here, you're very weak now.

126
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,000
Have some medicine. Come on.

127
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,360
Just tell me what you want.

128
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,480
- Stop pretending. - I...

129
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,879
I went through so much to save you.

130
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,279
But you're saying I'm pretending?

131
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,799
Is my sincerity that worthless?

132
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,080
If you're trying to threaten Mei Shi Qing with me,

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,559
just give up.

134
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,279
I have nothing to do with Mei Shi Qing anymore.

135
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
You don't?

136
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,399
There is an irreconcilable grudge between us two.

137
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,000
He won't save me.

138
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,799
Mei Shi Qing hates me.

139
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
That's great.

140
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,120
In that case, just be with me.

141
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,919
You're not a real princess anyway.

142
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,360
How did you know that I'm not?

143
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,320
I don't care if you're a real princess or not.

144
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,759
As long as you're with me,

145
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,159
you'll be the happiest woman in the world.

146
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,960
- Be with me! - You're crazy!

147
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,799
He's already your enemy.

148
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,399
Why do you still want to be with him?

149
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,960
You're crazy!

150
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,600
You don't care about me at all!

151
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,840
Why is he the only one who can win your heart?

152
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
You're mad.

153
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,639
Are you taking his side now?

154
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,799
Are you afraid that I'll kill him?

155
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,080
Tell me!

156
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:10,879
Mei Shi Qing is here.

157
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,039
Didn't you say...

158
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,960
he's your enemy?

159
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,799
Why did he come to save you?

160
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,960
I want you to watch him die.

161
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Shi Qing.

162
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,559
What are you doing here? Go back.

163
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,759
Go back!

164
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,600
Go back! Now!

165
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,519
Don't be silly.

166
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,559
I won't let him leave.

167
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,639
What are you waiting for?

168
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,919
Get him!

169
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Shi Qing!

170
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,559
Shi Qing!

171
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Shi Qing!

172
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Third Master Mei.

173
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,879
I'm going to kill you today...

174
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,039
to pay my respects to my father.

175
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Your father?

176
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
That's right.

177
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,480
My father is Li Tian Long.

178
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,840
I knew it.

179
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,080
I changed my name and lived in disgrace...

180
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,879
just so I could kill you one day...

181
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,519
and the whole Mei family.

182
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,799
I want all of you to have a taste...

183
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,039
of a fate worse than death.

184
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Shi Qing.

185
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,320
If you let him go,

186
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,879
I'll do anything you ask.

187
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,519
Just let him live.

188
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,039
How could I forget?

189
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,360
You have explosives on you.

190
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,840
In just a few minutes,

191
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,279
they will explode right in your face.

192
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,679
Then you'll be blown to pieces.

193
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,679
Shi Qing.

194
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Promise me.

195
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Be well.

196
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,320
What do you mean?

197
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,480
- Stop it. - Let go.

198
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,159
Let go!

199
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,320
Run!

200
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,919
How is my father?

201
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,320
The physician said he bled too much,

202
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,799
but the wound wasn't fatal.

203
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
He'll be fine with some rest.

204
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,919
I've thought it through.

205
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,720
When my father regains consciousness,

206
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,519
we'll leave.

207
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,639
Don't think too much.

208
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,639
Come with me.

209
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,840
Your father is waiting for us.

210
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,920
Father.

211
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,890
Wan Zi.

212
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,680
Are you all right? Sit.

213
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
I'm fine, Father.

214
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,039
All right. That's good.

215
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,319
You scared me to death.

216
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,170
I was afraid you'd be retributed...

217
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,559
for my sins.

218
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,599
I've been praying in my dreams...

219
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,410
for the heavens to take my life...

220
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,799
instead of yours.

221
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,000
Father, what are you talking about?

222
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,119
I'm fine.

223
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,410
All right.

224
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,319
Third Master Mei.

225
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,960
The matter really has nothing to do with Xiao Wan Zi.

226
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,240
Can you not blame her?

227
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,519
I can cut my ties...

228
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,359
Father, stop it.

229
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Third Master Mei.

230
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,440
You're badly injured.

231
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,240
Take care of yourself first.

232
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,410
Third Master Mei.

233
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,039
As long as you don't blame Xiao Wan Zi,

234
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,119
I'm willing to do anything and serve you.

235
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,960
Let me ask you something.

236
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,890
Back then,

237
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,519
what exactly happened?

238
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,200
Back then,

239
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,200
I owe the gambling house a lot of money.

240
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,759
But I didn't have money to pay them back.

241
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,650
They threatened me with Xiao Wan Zi...

242
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,599
and had me look for the hideout of a madam of a wealthy family.

243
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:27,039
They said they wanted to steal some stuff...

244
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,839
when no one was around.

245
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,240
I didn't know who she really was.

246
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,890
She...

247
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,410
- Father. - She was your mother.

248
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,650
On the day of the incident,

249
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,200
they forced me to be on the lookout.

250
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,839
Only when we got there,

251
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,319
did I find out...

252
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,720
that they were there to kill.

253
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,519
If I had known what they were up to,

254
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,759
I wouldn't have gone with them.

255
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,170
So that day,

256
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,599
you've been on the lookout the whole time?

257
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,319
When they killed her,

258
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,039
I was so scared I wanted to run away.

259
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,960
But at that moment,

260
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,559
I saw a little boy in the house.

261
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,319
He seemed about Xiao Wan Zi's age.

262
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,599
I thought that...

263
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,799
I couldn't let him die in this mess.

264
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,960
So I hid the boy.

265
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,279
After those people left,

266
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,039
I left as well.

267
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,039
And the little boy...

268
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,119
You're that little boy.

269
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,410
Mother.

270
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,960
You saved me.

271
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,599
Good lord.

272
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Father.

273
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,960
I'm sorry, Third Master Mei.

274
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,119
Father.

275
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,119
Even if you weren't involved,

276
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,759
they still could have found where we were.

277
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Besides,

278
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,839
you saved me twice.

279
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,880
It's all my fault, Third Master Mei.

280
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Father.

281
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,400
Father, get up.

282
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:29,839
Father.

283
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
That's strange.

284
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,720
What's strange?

285
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,000
You're usually very noisy.

286
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,279
Why are you so quiet today?

287
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,839
So much has happened.

288
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,240
I just don't know what to say right now.

289
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,599
Stop pretending.

290
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,720
Do you know why I dragged you out?

291
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,039
No.

292
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,119
Look at the people on the street.

293
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,279
No matter what happened to them yesterday,

294
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,880
as long as the sun rises,

295
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,680
they still continue to live their lives well.

296
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,759
Live their lives well?

297
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
Take a look.

298
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,839
- It's all in the past. - Candied apples.

299
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,559
Do you know?

300
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,319
I kept looking for you in the valley...

301
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,519
that night.

302
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
I kept looking and looking.

303
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
I didn't dare to stop.

304
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,720
Then I realized...

305
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,559
my greatest fear...

306
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,160
was losing you.

307
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,200
You promised me...

308
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,559
that you'd always be by my side.

309
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,880
I hope you keep your promise.

310
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,680
Are you sure?

311
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,039
Do you not mind?

312
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,200
Do you still not get it?

313
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,160
You're the one I care about the most.

314
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,160
I don't want to leave you either.

315
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,599
I want to be with you forever.

316
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,599
I have one more thing to say.

317
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,599
What?

318
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,599
I'm hungry.

319
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,559
Let's find something to eat then.

320
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Wonton stall.

321
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,160
This is what I often eat.

322
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,480
I'll take you there.

323
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,519
All right.

324
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,599
Come on.

325
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,200
- Let's go. - All right.

326
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,640
(Wonton)

327
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,759
Come on.

328
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,680
Sir, two bowls of wontons.

329
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
All right.

330
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,119
- Go away. Don't steal the wontons. - Sir.

331
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,160
- Sir. - Go.

332
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,960
I'll take all the wontons you have today.

333
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,000
Sure.

334
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,240
Can you eat them all?

335
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,200
If I can't finish them, they can.

336
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,400
Although I also used to do that all the time,

337
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,680
it is wrong.

338
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,519
When you want to eat wontons in the future,

339
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,960
just come to both of us.

340
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,519
- Thank you. - Thank you.

341
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,079
Where are your parents?

342
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,920
Our parents were from Changlong Pharmacy.

343
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,480
When they were out transporting herbs,

344
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,680
they were killed by the bandits of Qinglongzhai.

345
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,640
So we're orphans now.

346
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,799
I won't let you starve from now on.

347
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,839
Why are you so nice to us?

348
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,200
Because children need to be taken care of.

349
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,279
Eat slowly.

350
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,039
There's more.

351
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,799
Let's eat the wontons again next time.

352
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,799
- Of course. - Young Master.

353
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,039
Master has returned from Yongzhou.

354
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
- Come on. - All right.

355
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,720
- Father. - Father.

356
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,839
Is everything well?

357
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,279
Don't worry.

358
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,680
Father, you led the army to Qinglongzhai.

359
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,000
What did the royal court say?

360
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,359
I received the emperor's order...

361
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,519
when I was in Yongzhou.

362
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:00,079
It's only a demotion.

363
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
I'm not filial.

364
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,880
Shi Qing.

365
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
As long as I see that you and the princess are fine,

366
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,279
I am relieved.

367
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,960
This time,

368
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,240
you annihilated Qinglong Clan...

369
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,599
and eliminated the Salt Gang.

370
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,720
You have done a great thing...

371
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
for the people of Qingzhou.

372
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,880
Actually, the matters with the Salt Gang aren't over yet.

373
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,039
I just found out that...

374
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,960
Situ Lin has contacts in the capital.

375
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,480
Besides,

376
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,720
we don't know if he's still alive.

377
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,599
Evil will never prevail over good.

378
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,279
It's a truth that will never change.

379
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,759
Shi Qing.

380
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,920
From today on,

381
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,079
no matter what you do,

382
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,079
I'll support you all the way.

383
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Thank you, Father.

384
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
How about this?

385
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,160
Invite all your friends here.

386
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,480
I'll hold a feast...

387
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,599
and treat them to a nice dinner.

388
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,839
General Mei.

389
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,839
Madam Mei.

390
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,279
I am the princess's best friend.

391
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,400
You can call me Xiao Wan Zi.

392
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,400
- All right. - Xiao Wan Zi.

393
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,799
Xiao Bao.

394
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,599
We were able to take Qinglongzhai...

395
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,759
all thanks to your heroic assistance.

396
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,119
You flatter me, General Mei.

397
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,559
You could reward me with a few hundred of gold.

398
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,680
It won't be a trouble.

399
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,720
He...

400
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,799
just can't change his uncivilized habits.

401
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,319
Don't take him seriously.

402
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,559
All right.

403
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,119
My dear.

404
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,559
Xiao Bao might be very blunt.

405
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,839
But on the battlefield,

406
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,359
he is valiant and courageous.

407
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,039
He is a rare talent.

408
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,519
You flatter me, General Mei.

409
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,400
Xiao Bao.

410
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,680
The Mei family is able to have a reunion today.

411
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,119
You deserve all the credit.

412
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Xiao Bao.

413
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,160
We might not be able...

414
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,319
to give you a few hundred of gold,

415
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
but...

416
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,680
there's something...

417
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,519
we would like you to see.

418
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Come.

419
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,359
Xiao Bao.

420
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,039
His Majesty bestowed me this armor...

421
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,720
when I pacified Qingzhou back then.

422
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,839
Would you like it?

423
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,200
Yes.

424
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,880
This is worth a lot of money.

425
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,720
All right, get seated.

426
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,920
Let's have a good time today.

427
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,400
- Come. - Drink to your heart's content.

428
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,359
It's too valuable.

429
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,960
- Are you jealous? - What nice armor.

430
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:21,119
But I would rather have 300 taels of gold.

431
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,559
- Not bad. - I'll sell it to you for 300 taels.

432
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,079
- I can't afford that. You keep it. - No way, make it 500 taels.

433
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,799
It's Xiao Bao and Xiao Wan Zi's first time in the manor.

434
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,440
Let's raise our glasses.

435
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
Here.

436
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,720
- Cheers. - Cheers.

437
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:38,799
Dig in.

438
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,119
Make sure you eat and drink a lot today.

439
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,119
Go on.

440
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,039
- Thank you. - Don't be shy.

441
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,160
- Here, Master. - Mother, eat this.

442
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,279
My dear, have some of this.

443
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Thank you.

444
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,119
Father, this one is big.

445
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,599
Everything is finally over.

446
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,960
We'll be able to rest for a while.

447
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,880
Why don't you just stay here?

448
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,759
I don't think that's appropriate.

449
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,000
What's wrong with that?

450
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,759
We'll drink and celebrate every day.

451
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,960
It's decided then.

452
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,119
Third Young Master.

453
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,160
Do you know how to play the finger-guessing game?

454
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,799
No.

455
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,240
What about Chinese dominoes?

456
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,079
No.

457
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,599
Then what can you do?

458
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,720
Calligraphy.

459
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,160
I know a good place.

460
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,759
I'll take you to play.

461
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,279
Let's find a place to have fun then.

462
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,519
- All right. - Let's go.

463
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,599
- Let's go. - Let's go.

464
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,920
(Qingcheng Tower)

465
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Look over there.

466
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
You didn't expect this, did you?

467
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,839
That such a place existed in Qingzhou...

468
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
where you could overlook the whole city.

469
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,599
Third Master Mei.

470
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,160
Yao Yao and I have thought about it.

471
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,200
We want to leave Qingzhou for a while.

472
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,960
The world is so big.

473
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,599
We want to go out and see it.

474
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:00,160
But we just got united.

475
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,319
Growing up,

476
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,920
I've led a life of seclusion.

477
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,960
I've never seen the scenes of springtime...

478
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,319
that were written about in the poems.

479
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,759
I think it's heaven's way of letting us live differently.

480
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,599
So now we'll live a carefree life.

481
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,119
All right.

482
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,440
Then I wish...

483
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,720
that you'll get to travel the whole world...

484
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,160
and have good food everywhere.

485
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,160
But remember to visit us...

486
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,680
when you're back.

487
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Of course.

488
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,720
Such bliss.

489
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,319
Qiao Yun.

490
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
What's wrong?

491
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,319
I just think it has been so tough for the princess.

492
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,440
She wouldn't marry a fine young master...

493
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,920
but chose to wander the world with a bandit.

494
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,200
You don't understand.

495
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,960
Look at the princess.

496
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Isn't this the happiest we have ever seen her?

497
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,559
Come and visit us when you're back.

498
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,359
Please take good care of yourself too.

499
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,839
Also,

500
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,799
please take care of Qiu Hua and Qiao Yun for me.

501
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,319
Don't worry.

502
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,839
All right.

503
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
All right now.

504
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,920
Actually, the Mei Manor is quite boring.

505
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,680
I'm used to being free-spirited.

506
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,720
You don't have to be sad.

507
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,680
- Of course, if... - All right.

508
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,960
A man doesn't nag.

509
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,079
Living unrestrained and freely.

510
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,400
That's the Xiao Bao I know.

511
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,319
I just like how cold you are.

512
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,559
Take care.

513
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,960
Shi Qing, I'm bored.

514
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,239
Take me out to play.

515
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,679
Later.

516
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,920
I still have to play chess with Father.

517
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,639
If I continue to be bored,

518
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,119
I'm going to smash a stone on my chest.

519
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,809
If you're that bored,

520
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,119
go and practice writing.

521
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,440
The other day,

522
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,960
you said your head, chest, and back hurt.

523
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Everywhere hurt.

524
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,289
You've rested for three days.

525
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,079
I don't care. I'm going out.

526
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,719
My lord, Your Highness!

527
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,840
There's bad news!

528
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
What's wrong?

529
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,880
A letter came from the palace...

530
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,559
saying you were meritorious for annihilating the bandits.

531
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,119
They want you in the capital to receive your reward.

532
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,119
They...

533
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,840
They even asked the princess to visit her family...

534
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,039
and depart right away.
