[Saving the Princess]

4
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,180
Princess, this person is very suspicious.

5
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,430
Let me interrogate him!

6
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,450
Princess, please give me justice!

7
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,870
He has delivered so many meals to the princess, what is there to be suspicious about?

8
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,090
As for you, so murderous,

9
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,440
you dare to point the sword at Princess! How dare you!

10
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,710
Miss Qiao Yun, spare me!

11
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,510
Hurry and take the food in first.

12
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,670
If it gets cold, you won't have a good ending.

13
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,280
- Go!
- Y-Yes.

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,970
Princess, let's go as well.

15
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,480
Let's go.

16
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,490
Miss Qiao Yun, was I murderous?

17
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,770
But that person really l-looks familiar.

18
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,770
I just can't remember where I saw him beofre.

19
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,120
Do you think he looks familiar or are you blind?

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,150
Then, are you familiar with every food delivery person?

21
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,320
Father, didn't I ask you to meet outside? Why did you come in?

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,340
Isn't this an urgent matter? Otherwise, I wouldn't have taken the risk of coming in.

23
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,900
- You!
- Miss Qiao Yun.

24
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,660
By the way, Qiu Hua told me about your plan.

25
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,690
It is a good plan.

26
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,050
But I have to be the one to personally save Master Bao.

27
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,910
No! If you go, it is too dangerous!

28
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,730
Listen to me, Daughter. Look at my current identity.

29
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,720
I'm a small-time waiter so no one will be suspicious, right?

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,440
Besides, I know this Master Bao.

31
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,860
I'm confident I can persuade him to leave with me.

32
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,290
Xiao Wanzi, I also think it is more suitable for Uncle He to go.

33
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,900
This Uncle He is indeed the most suitable person.

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,550
Daughter, I know that you worry about me.

35
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,090
But we should think of the bigger picture, all right?

36
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,120
We just went to the prison to figure out the situation.

37
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,740
Lord Mei won't be home these few days. There is only one guard

38
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,060
to keep watch during lunch.

39
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,800
The prison keys are also in that person's hands.

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,970
So, later, when you come,

41
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,050
I will pretend to be bringing food to Third Young Master Mei. Then I can take you in there.

42
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,650
Then, I will pretend to be hit unconscious.

43
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,940
So then you can take Xiao Bao and leave.

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,760
Not a bad idea!

45
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,870
But how do I leave after I get Xiao Bao?

46
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,540
Don't worry, I already thought of how to get out.

47
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,630
After you exit the prison doors,

48
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,520
turn right and soon there is another set of doors.

49
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,400
Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua will meet you there.

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,130
I will secretly keep watch and Qiu Hua will let you fellows out.

51
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,980
You have to be careful.

52
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,410
If something happens to you, I also won't live.

53
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,280
Look at what you're saying.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,850
What type of situation have I not seen before?

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,070
[Blessed by Virtuous Spirits]

56
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,360
Princess, all the guards have gone to have lunch.

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,850
- Second Young Master Mei won't allow anyone to come in or go.
- How dare you?!

58
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,620
Am I, the princess, just anyone?

59
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,280
- Second Young Master Mei has said--
- Said what?

60
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,950
I don't care. I want to bring food to Third Young Master Mei. Move!

61
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,720
Princess!

62
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,520
Let's go.

63
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,820
Second Young Master Mei, you're quite busy.

64
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,570
You've come again? Who let you in?

65
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,220
You still want to use my father to trick me?

66
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,370
What are you delivering?

67
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,890
Hurry and get out!

68
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,010
I-I am worried that Shiqing isn't eating well.

69
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,120
I especially ordered food from the restaurant so he has something different to eat.

70
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,920
Here, Mei Manor's kitchen takes care of all the food.

71
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,950
There is no need for you to care.

72
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,560
How dare you! Who am I?

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,080
I am the princess, a part of the imperial family.

74
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,260
I can go wherever I want to. What do you care? Move!

75
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,180
Who cares who you are?

76
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,200
Come bac--

77
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,000
Go, go, go!

78
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,030
- Father-in-Law!
- I'm here!

79
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,170
Father-in-Law, why are you here?

80
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,980
We'll talk after we get out.

81
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,610
- You did this?
- We'll talk later. Later.

82
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,400
Wait.

83
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,200
I have a really important person I need to see.

84
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,450
Who are you? Guards!

85
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,400
Young Master, what orders do you have?

86
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,440
How did you get out, you mountain monkey?

87
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,820
Naturally, some noble person let me out.

88
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,710
But... I am smart and my martial art skills are no match for others.

89
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,970
I can enter and leave your Mei Manor many times without problems.

90
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,140
Let's go! Stop talking.

91
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,330
- Who is that?
- W-Well.. take care.

92
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,140
Farewell.

93
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,990
Looks like there really are Green Dragon Fort spies in this Mei Manor.

94
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,880
Father-in-Law, look at how angry Mei Shiqing was.

95
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,220
Wait! Am I supposed to go this way after getting out

96
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,010
or this way? This way is left! This way is right.

97
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,200
Isn't the door over there?

98
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,550
My ancestor, wait!
 (Term used to call a higher status someone you cannot control)

99
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,560
My A-Ancestor, not so hard!

100
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,330
- There's a secret signal.
- What secret signal?

101
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,320
Chest. Chest.

102
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,760
Chest. Where are you touching?

103
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,710
Not my chest.

104
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,830
Don't-Don't, Master Bao.

105
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,380
There's someone.

106
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,420
- Brother, you like chests?
- Hurry and go.

107
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,100
- Many thanks.
- You forgot the secret signal.

108
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,840
It's enough time, right?

109
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,300
I really can't continue this act.

110
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,370
Guards! Is there someone there?

111
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,110
Guards!

112
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,120
- Shiqing! Shiqing!
- What happened out there?

113
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,660
I-I also don't know. That bandit got rescued by someone.

114
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,020
Then... There was a group of them.

115
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,800
I didn't eat so I was weak and got beaten into unconsciousness.

116
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,740
Unconscious? Is your head all right?

117
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,280
- It's fine.
- Then that's good.

118
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,940
You aren't smart in the first place, what if you become dumber from getting hit?

119
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,800
Then, are you smart to marry an idiot?

120
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,860
Let me ask you something important. Where are the others who are outside? Where are the guards?

121
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,430
I don't know. Second Young Master is still lying on the floor unconscious.

122
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,430
I also don't know what happened.

123
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,430
Hurry and find Siheng. Quickly.

124
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,940
All right.

125
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,700
What is Uncle He doing? Why isn't there any noise?

126
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,310
Don't be anxious. Xiao Wanzi is pretty smart.

127
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,280
Everything's probably all right.

128
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,780
Qiu Hua.

129
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,080
That Qiu Hua is dressed quite appropriately.

130
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,110
Guards!

131
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,900
Guards! Guards! Someone help!

132
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,980
Guards!

133
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,450
What was that noise?

134
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,780
Did something happen?

135
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,150
Let's go take a look.

136
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,150
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

137
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,550
Princess, are you all right?

138
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,650
Report! The bandit is missing. Only Third Young Master is still there.

139
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,990
Notify everyone that no one is allowed out of Mei Manor.

140
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,700
In addition, seal off the city and search!

141
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,180
Yes!

142
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,220
Princess, don't you know the food delivery man?

143
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,150
I don't really know him. He seemed quite normal before.

144
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,540
Was there anything else that was strange?

145
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,300
Nothing was strange.

146
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,720
I brought him to deliver the food, got hit, and then became unconscious.

147
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,340
The moment I woke up...

148
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,050
Good thing Shiqing is fine.

149
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,390
Then I ran out to get help and you came.

150
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,350
- Then that food delivery man--
- Stop asking!

151
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,590
Princess was just startled so she needs to rest now.

152
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,060
Princess, are you all right?

153
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,520
Let's go rest for a bit.

154
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,220
I was scared to death.

155
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,170
- Xiao Bao!
- Yes?
- Not bad, you went to rob the general's manor.

156
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,870
You're better. Father-in-Law, how did you get in there?

157
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,220
I do have some Jianghu tricks.

158
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,350
It's a shame I didn't manage to abduct the princess.

159
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,070
But with her looks, my godfather probably would not like her.

160
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,650
What do you mean by that?

161
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,220
I don't understand. What's wrong with that princess?

162
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,020
I think that princess is great!

163
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,570
She's fair and chubby. She's cute and jubilant.

164
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,980
- Father-in-Law.
- Yes?

165
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,410
If you like her, I can abduct her for you next time.

166
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,280
I just think your daughter, my wife,

167
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,670
is a true beauty.

168
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,090
Don't talk about this now. I need to knock him unconscious first and then think of a way to make the exchange.

169
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,330
There's wine. Have some to block your sticky mouth.

170
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,430
Thank you, Father-in-Law.

171
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,680
Have I been too tired lately?

172
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,090
Why do I feel sleepy?

173
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,590
Xiao Bao, Xiao Bao. You walked to your own death in the Mei Manor

174
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,800
so you cannot blame me.

175
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,900
Master Wu, without Master Bao,

176
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,360
the Green Dragon Fort will be yours from now on.

177
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,090
Of course.

178
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,690
From now on, my brothers, you will all eat and drink well.

179
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,360
Thank you, Master Wu.

180
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,120
Master Wu, if we don't save him, how are we going to explain it to the big boss?

181
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,000
Who said we aren't going to go save him?

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,520
We fought a tough battle with the Mei Army.

183
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,660
We only came back because we couldn't beat him, got it?

184
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,950
Got it.

185
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,800
What do you understand?

186
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,540
Stand up.

187
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,230
I understand, Master Wu!

188
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,390
Not so hard.

189
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,170
Stop! Stop fighting.

190
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,670
Isn't this Master Wu? What a coincidence.

191
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,160
Old man, what are you doing?

192
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,070
I went to buy some things from down the mountain for my daughter.

193
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,760
Master Wu, well...

194
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,890
Here's a token of my appreciation. Go eat and drink with your brothers.

195
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,900
You're going to be our chief's father-in-law in the future. How could I dare take your money?

196
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,230
Master Wu, what are you saying?

197
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,990
If you don't guide me,

198
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,760
I won't even know the way up the mountain.

199
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,220
Don't worry! Someone will meet up with you. Go on.

200
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,660
I'll take my leave first then. You've worked hard, Brothers.

201
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,450
Let's go.

202
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,820
I'm leaving now.

203
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,650
Thank goodness he didn't find anything.

204
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,350
Wait!

205
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,030
Search the cart.

206
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,430
Master Wu, someone is here.

207
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
I just knew it.

208
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,430
Your precious daughter is so worried to death now, yet you had the mood to go shopping?

209
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,360
Moreover, you saw me and didn't ask anything, so there must be a problem.

210
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,490
Xiao Bao, it's Heaven that wants your life today.

211
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,490
Master Wu! Aren't you afraid of Nan Batian?

212
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,690
It's you, old man,

213
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,390
who hated Xiao Bao for hogging your precious daughter.

214
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,830
So in your anger, you killed him. What does it have to do with me?

215
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,500
You!

216
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,600
Stop!

217
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,000
- Nan Xiang.
- What are you doing?

218
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,190
Xiao Bao! Xiao Bao!

219
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,090
What's going on?

220
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,820
It was this old man! He knocked Xiao Bao out! He must have ulterior motives!

221
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,830
- No.
- We must get rid of this evil old man.

222
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,290
My Lady, I worked so hard to rescue Xiao Bao.

223
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,200
Master Wu wanted to kill him as soon as he saw him!

224
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,990
- Tell the truth—
- Shut up!

225
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,660
Old man, tell the truth.

226
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,630
Did you save Xiao Bao?

227
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,490
Truth? That is the truth.

228
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,470
So this old man was a step ahead of me in saving him.

229
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,460
Master Wu, we are all brothers.

230
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,120
It's fine if you don't help, but why do you want to kill him?

231
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,760
I didn't, I...

232
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,300
Liar! If I didn't come along,

233
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,590
Xiao Bao would be dead by now. Right?

234
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,590
He wouldn't be. We...

235
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,900
Enough!

236
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,430
Stop talking. If you have anything to say, go explain it to my father.

237
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,530
- Father definitely won't spare you.
- I...

238
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,930
Xiao Bao! Xiao Bao? Xiao Bao.

239
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,300
Father. Second Madam.

240
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,470
Princess, please be at ease. Your body is more important.

241
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,290
I'm fine now. I have made you worry, Father.

242
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,520
Princess has already been startled twice in a row now.

243
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,890
The physician said she needs to recuperate.

244
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,360
It's not serious.

245
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,470
Father, has the person who rescued the prisoner been caught?

246
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,000
I have already sent people to investigate.

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,470
I heard that the leader is a forty- to fifty-year-old middle-aged man.

248
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,190
I already ordered them to search the entire city, but there has been no news.

249
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,640
I'm afraid they already left Qingzhou City.

250
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,860
I wonder how Shiqing is.

251
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,430
With something so serious happening, Father, why not let Shiqing come help?

252
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,690
I heard you bring food and drinks to Third Young Master every day.

253
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,660
You serve him very well.

254
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,860
My Lord, even if you let him out now,

255
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,870
he might not even be grateful.

256
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,060
Princess, what parent doesn't care for his child?

257
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,530
His Lordship and I also have no choice.

258
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,460
Everything is for his own good.

259
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,000
Princess, being compassionate to a husband is pardonable.

260
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,930
However, Shiqing is extremely stubborn.

261
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,690
He just won't learn.

262
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,160
Princess, from now on, there's no need to bring him food. Just let him starve for three days.

263
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,660
Let's see whether he knows he was wrong or not.

264
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,430
But, Father, I—

265
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,130
Princess, rest well.

266
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,500
Leave everything else to us.

267
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,900
- Take good care of the princess.
- Yes.

268
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,130
Yes, rest well. My Lord.

269
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,400
Father and Second Madam, take care.

270
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,830
I didn't expect this Second Madam to kick someone while he was down.

271
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,360
Don't bother about it. Right now, we are in danger.

272
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,700
No one discovered my father when he broke into the prison, right?

273
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,930
I remember Qiu Hua and I stayed at the door the whole time.

274
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,400
We didn't see Uncle He and that bandit.

275
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,840
Then the person dressed as a guard by the door wasn't Qiu Hua?

276
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,840
What are you talking about? Qiu Hua was always with me.

277
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,230
No wonder that person ran away as soon as he saw me.

278
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,760
How strange. Who could it be then?

279
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,630
Could it be that person saved Uncle He?

280
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,660
Then does that mean someone else in the manor wanted to save that bandit?

281
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,210
This is the Mei Manor.

282
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,000
Then, how could there be someone from Green Dragon Fort in here?

283
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,630
You say you can't drink yet you drink.

284
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,850
You fool.

285
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,370
- That's...
- You!

286
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,950
What's wrong with Xiao Bao?

287
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,850
Ask your father.

288
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,810
It's just that my wine was too strong.

289
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,330
It's all right. He will be fine after some sleep.

290
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,890
All right. I must take Xiao Bao to Old Six to see if he's injured or not.

291
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,300
Let's go.

292
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,750
- Uncle He.
- Yes?

293
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,400
Did you meet with Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua?

294
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,030
- I did.
- What did they say?

295
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,590
We were planning on kidnapping Xiao Bao and exchange him for you, but we bumped into Master Wu.

296
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,480
Why didn't you notify the Mei Manor so they could bring soldiers to save me?

297
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,340
We're doing this to save your reputation, Princess.

298
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,790
But don't worry.

299
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,480
I will think of another way and rescue you for sure.

300
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,810
Uncle, you're so nice. We are neither kith nor kin, yet you're still so considerate of me.

301
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,640
Princess, you're exaggerating. This is nothing.

302
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,340
As long as I am here, I will help you escape.

303
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,010
Are they opening new wine? How come today's wine

304
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,210
- smells better than the ones from before?
- Uncle He, haven't you drunk enough?

305
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,320
Come on! Come on! Brothers!

306
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,140
Today is a happy day.

307
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,790
Raise your glass

308
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,170
to celebrate Master Xiao Bao's safe return!

309
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,160
Yes!

310
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,240
Cheers! Cheers!

311
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,080
- Sit down!
- Come on!

312
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,250
Sit, sit!

313
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,550
Godfather, I can return safety this time all thanks to Uncle He.

314
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,680
Is that so?

315
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,530
Then make a toast to my father-in-law!

316
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,910
Pour the wine!

317
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,060
I will pour it for you.

318
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,160
Come on.

319
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,030
Sit, sit! Sit down and drink.

320
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,000
Godfather, you drink.

321
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,340
Come on.

322
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,900
Xiao Bao, the person you really should toast to

323
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,420
is me.

324
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,900
If I hadn't made it in time,

325
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,460
I'm afraid your life would have been sacrificed to the Yellow Spring.

326
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,510
Isn't that right, Master Wu?

327
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,780
Life sacrificed to the Yellow Spring?

328
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,770
Mei Shiqing doesn't have that ability.

329
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,130
This time I should be more thankful to Uncle He. What does it have to do with you?

330
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,030
- Let's drink.
- "What does it have to do with me?"

331
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,870
You will know soon enough what it has to do with me.

332
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,890
You have to make a toast to me now.

333
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,310
Fine, fine.

334
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,880
Godfather, I'm going to drink with the brothers.

335
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,380
Go on.

336
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,100
Drink, drink.

337
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,090
Come on, brothers.

338
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,870
Cheers, cheers.

339
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,660
Then... I will take these vegetables away first.

340
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,440
You all drink up.

341
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,430
Here. I know you don't like to eat oily things.

342
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,100
I specifically brought you a bowl of vegetables.

343
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,570
Here.

344
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,910
Thank you.

345
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,730
Thank you. If it weren't for you, I would probably be dead.

346
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,130
Why thank me? I'm not the one who saved you.

347
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,340
I already know. You went to beg Nan Xiang.

348
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,770
Then Nan Xiang went down the mountain to save me; otherwise, I would be dead.

349
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,800
Old Six told me.

350
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,720
Can Master Wu save Xiao Bao like this?

351
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,380
Isn't it clear? It's not about can or cannot.

352
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,030
It's whether Old Wu wants to save him or not.

353
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,830
How about we talk to Nan Xiang?

354
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,630
Nan Xiang hates you. Will she listen to you?

355
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,910
There's no time. Saving Xiao Bao is most important now.

356
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,910
Wait! Wait!

357
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,210
What are you doing? Stay away from me!

358
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,600
I don't want to get your weird disease.

359
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,920
I head Master Wu is going to go save Xiao Bao. Do you think he will do all that he can to save him?

360
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,750
The men of our Green Dragon Fort are all righteous.

361
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,650
Stop spouting nonsense trying to sow dissension!

362
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,600
Master Wu and Xiao Bao never get along well.

363
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,020
He wants Xiao Bao to lose his life in Mei Manor.

364
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,250
That way he can righteously marry you

365
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,600
and inherit this Green Dragon Fort. Didn't you know that?

366
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,380
Stop spouting nonsense!

367
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,430
Do you really think I wouldn't dare to touch you?

368
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,720
All right. Xiao Bao is about to have his life sacrificed to the Yellow Spring anyway

369
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,860
and I'm going to marry your father. Is this how you should talk to your mother?

370
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,070
You! You're dreaming!

371
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,150
My father would never marry you. Besides,

372
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,050
Xiao Bao is mine as well. Once I save him this time,

373
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,680
he will have a change of heart.

374
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,340
You just wait!

375
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,970
I knew you cared about me.

376
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,110
Who cares about you?

377
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,020
It's just a shame that I couldn't abduct the princess for my godfather

378
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,740
so I could make him give up on you.

379
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,970
What? You went down the mountain for me?

380
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,210
Why else? For myself?

381
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,000
I already have you. Why would I want some princess?

382
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,750
Are you dumb? You dare to do something without any sign of success?

383
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,480
Are you sure you don't care about me?

384
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,910
I'm sure I don't care about you. At the time, I was just thinking,

385
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,880
if you went down the mountain and something happened to you,

386
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,310
I would be alone in this mountain fort

387
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,250
and no one would keep me company.

388
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,860
So you're afraid of being alone.

389
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,050
All right. Don't worry. I will find a way to solve things with my godfather.

390
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,500
I won't let you suffer.

391
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,280
Then, I'm leaving now. The festivities aren't over yet, it will be bad if they notice I'm gone.

392
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,810
I'm leaving now.

393
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,590
Go on.

394
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,360
Shiqing, drink some water.

395
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,620
I don't want any.

396
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,720
You haven't eaten anything for three days. How can your body handle it if you continue like that?

397
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,240
Go beg Father to let you out.

398
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,670
Beg him?

399
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,460
I would rather starve or thirst to death than beg him.

400
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,340
I don't understand you two.

401
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,460
They wouldn't let me bring any food in here.

402
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,050
So I secretly snuck a bun in for you. Eat it for now.

403
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,870
You eat it yourself. I can see you've lost weight. I appreciate the thought.

404
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,560
Then I'll leave it here for you.

405
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,610
You can eat it whenever you want.

406
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,500
I really don't understand you and your father. Both are so stubborn.

407
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,580
I've actually thought about it for a long time now.

408
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,960
According to what you say,

409
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,570
that waiter is someone from Green Dragon Fort.

410
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,220
Then the mysterious person with the mask,

411
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,980
must be someone from Mei Manor.

412
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,640
Who do you think it could be?

413
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,650
That person ran away once you discovered him.

414
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,920
Then the search guards went to investigate but didn't manage to find anything.

415
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,860
In any case, he was a mole in Mei Manor and has run away.

416
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,530
If you were there,

417
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,160
you would have been able to find out who it was for sure.

418
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,100
I asked Father to release you so you could go and investigate, but...

419
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,660
That old man just doesn't want me to succeed.

420
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,820
Besides, this hardship is nothing. Not a big deal.

421
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,780
I can stick my neck out.

422
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,530
I'll go and beg Father. I will kneel before him.

423
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,330
If he doesn't agree to let you out, I won't get up.

424
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,660
I won't allow you to go beg him!

425
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,400
- Promise me.
- I promise. I promise, all right!

426
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,930
I need to find a way to get Father to release Third Young Master Mei.

427
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,450
Princess, please quickly get up.

428
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,470
I won't get up. I won't get up until Shiqing is released.

429
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,130
- My Lord.
- Has the princess gone back?

430
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,320
I've already tried to persuade her but the princess won't listen.

431
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,370
She insists on kneeling there until you agree to release Third Young Master Mei.

432
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,110
The princess has been spoiled since childhood.

433
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,670
She cannot bear much hardship,

434
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,040
so she'll kneel for just a little longer before she returns on her own.

435
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,540
Shiqing went too far this time.

436
00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:00,100
He dared to deceive me. I must teach him a good lesson.

437
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,370
[Winds Through the Pine and Bamboo]

438
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,870
The princess won't give up until she gets her way.

439
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,400
My Lord, she's forcing you to concede.

440
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,690
She is a princess after all. If something happens to her,

441
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,700
how do I explain it to the Ninth Prince?

442
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,170
But where is our face as elders?

443
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,430
My Lord. My Lord.

444
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,170
- Is the princess still kneeling?
- She's still kneeling.

445
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,640
She's kneeled for a day and night.

446
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,950
Go and release Shiqing.

447
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,550
Tell the princess not to do this again.

448
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,900
Yes.

449
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,160
My Lord, I am not trying to overstep,

450
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,080
but spoiling the princess like this now, how will it be

451
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,420
in the future?

452
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,310
The princess treating Shiqing this way,

453
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,380
makes me... quite happy.

454
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,900
Happy?

455
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,080
- Get up.
- Shiqing? You've been released?

456
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,520
Didn't I tell you not to come and see him?

457
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,270
I am fine. It's good that Father released you.

458
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,240
I already told you. Why won't you listen?

459
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,420
Why are you angry at me?

460
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,990
Not a word of thanks, that's fine. But you're even yelling at me.

461
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,310
A waste of my kindness.

462
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,340
You're even pointing at me!

463
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,390
It's all good now. You rescued me from the bandits.

464
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,750
I rescued you from prison. We are even now.

♫ The moon stains the night with spots of light ♫

480
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,200
♫ My heart is like fire, burning for you, even my tears are hot ♫

481
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,100
What are you doing?

482
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,200
If you don't want to lose your legs then don't move.

483
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,700
Is it that serious?

484
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,020
I'll do it myself.

♫ How does one conceal the vulnerability in one's heart? ♫

486
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,230
It won't hurt. Endure it for a bit.

487

♫ It was when you and I brushed past each other ♫

488
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,470
♫ There was warmth ♫

489
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,460
♫ My heart and soul melted ♫

490

♫ Look and remember fondly the scenery as night slowly falls ♫

491
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,410
I really don't understand you.

492
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,930
Clearly, your heart is kinder than anyone else's,

493
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:38,030
yet you always make others think you're hard to get close to.

494
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,780
But I've finally managed to get you released.

How is it? Do you feel better?

499

505
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:09,660
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

506
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:17,180
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

507
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:24,520
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

508
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:31,120
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

509
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,180
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

510
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,180
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

511
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:46,310
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

512
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:49,940
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

513
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,920
♫ My treasured memories ♫

514
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:00,920
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

515
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,490
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

516
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,370
♫ It's me missing you ♫

517
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:14,030
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

518
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:33,270
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

519
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:40,770
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

520
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:48,110
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

521
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:55,420
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

522
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,080
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

525

♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

♫ It's me missing you ♫
