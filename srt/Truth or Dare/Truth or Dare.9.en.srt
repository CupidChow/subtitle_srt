These are way harder than yesterday! How am I supposed to write them?

I doubt I'll be able to leave today.

If you want to continue staying in the Mei Manor,

you must learn these three characters first.

It's up to you whether you believe it or not.

Well, it's a relief that your princess is really smart.

In order to keep those bandits away from her,

132
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,980
she used some type of ointment.

133
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,490
And after applying it on her face, she was covered in little spots.

We'll definitely find a way to save the princess.

142
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,860
How about if we tell the truth to Third Young Master Mei?

143
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,840
We can make him break into the fort with an army and save the princess directly.

144
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,670
But Third Young Master Mei has never wanted to marry the princess.

145
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,180
If he finds out about this, he'll definitely break the marriage!

146
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,470
Also, if we break into the fort with an army,

147
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,670
the whole city will know that the princess has been staying there!

The less people that know of this, the better.

I... shouldn't have drawn an ugly monster

161
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,030
along with the three characters "Mei Shiqing".

162
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,130
I also shouldn't have left Mei Manor on my own accord without permission.

163
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,530
But I learn from my mistakes.

164
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,720
In order to make up for my mistakes, I've decided that tonight,

165
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,290
I'll definitely learn how to write "Mei Shiqing".

166
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,990
If I don't learn them, I won't sleep.

167
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,640
- Really?
- I do what I say.

168
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,660
The door's over there.

169
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,110
If I don't learn them, I won't go to sleep!

170
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,090
Xiao Bao, what's wrong with you?

171
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,670
Old Wu's gambling house brings money up the mountain every month!

172
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,020
You just have a poor pawnshop!

173
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,790
Why isn't there even a shopkeeper anymore?

174
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,090
Godfather, don't be mad anymore.

175
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,720
How could I not be?

176
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,890
It's all because of that Night-Spirited Hero sneak-attacking our pawnshop some time ago,

177
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,090
making everyone anxious. Not a single person dares to take the position.

178
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,490
No one is willing to do such a lucrative job?

179
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,150
Xiao Bao, if your people can't do it, let me deal with it.

180
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,430
Wait, Old Wu. Godfather's here.

181
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,350
No matter what, it isn't your turn to speak.

182
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,650
If even you two can't get along,

183
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,090
how can my Green Dragon Fort be in the same mind?

184
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,030
Bastards.

185
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,590
You still aren't leaving?

186
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,660
Nan Xiang, sit.

187
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,360
Read the room and get up!

188
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,090
Xiao Bao, actually you can't be completely blamed for what happened at the pawnshop.

189
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,450
Don't take it to heart.

190
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,160
What you are saying is that Godfather is in a bad mood?

191
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,090
So, he's not mad because of what happened at the pawnshop?

192
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,530
- Stop comforting yourself, it's exactly—
- Shut up!

193
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,000
Is it any of your business?

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,970
I'm not sure what he's mad about,

195
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,790
but I know how to put out the fire.

196
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,350
What is it?

197
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,960
Give the boulder-shattering one to my father

198
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,700
and then marry me. How does that sound?

199
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,520
Xiao Bao!

200
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,330
No— What use is it to get agitated at me?

201
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,860
Anyhow, once that boulder-shattering one's face is healed, she'll have to marry my father!

202
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,900
Nan Xiang, you're right.

203
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,560
For real?

204
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,460
- Master Bao.
- Master Bao.

205
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,620
Here.

206
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,460
Master Bao, what's up?

207
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,230
- You're in a bad mood?
- No.

208
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,690
What were you all talking about?

209
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,640
Master Bao, we were just about to tell you.

210
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,070
Didn't that Third Young Master Mei marry the Princess of the Ninth Prince Manor?

211
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,730
We were just debating over who was prettier between Xiao Wanzi and her.

212
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,330
What's the use of the princess being pretty?

213
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,620
Could it be that you want to kidnap her to become your bandit wife?

214
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,290
Even if I wanted to marry her, it would not be my turn. She'd definitely be given to Master Bao.

215
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,000
That's true.

216
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,830
Master Bao, if you could really kidnap the princess to here,

217
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,460
our Green Dragon Fort would have two simultaneous happy events!

218
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,260
It's just a princess, what's so special about it?

219
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,500
I'll capture her now and present her to my godfather right away.

220
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,090
Once he has the princess, Godfather will naturally stop thinking about my Xiao Wanzi.

221
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,230
I can also take revenge on Third Young Master Mei for his sudden attack on me.

222
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,090
[Mei Manor]

223
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,060
[Mei Shiqing]

224
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,030
Mei Shiqing!

225
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,460
What stupid name is this? It's so hard to write.

226
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,190
I'm so sick of it.

227
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,400
It's even worse than if you had no name.

228
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,930
Being named "No Name" would be great.

229
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,530
I will first take a break for a moment and come back shortly after.

230
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,570
How did I fall asleep? Seriously.

231
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,830
- Since you're so tired...
- Oh!

232
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,110
Are you planning to spare me this once?

233
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,300
The heavens are really looking out for me! Even the big ice mountain

234
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,730
has a time when he sympathizes with women.

235
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,100
Why don't you use that old painstaking method of tying your hair to the house beam? (People did it to keep awake when studying)

236
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,860
How does that sound?

237
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,060
You're not even human.

238
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,730
I'm warning you, don't mess around!

239
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,560
Wait, let me go— Wait!

240
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,500
Y-You! What kind of punishment is this?

241
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,380
T-T-Too harsh!

242
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,240
Once you have mastered the characters,

243
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,340
I'll let you down.

244
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,890
No, I'm seriously begging you.

245
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,250
I'm begging you. L-L-Lord Mei! Lord Mei!

246
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,780
Xiao Wanzi will kneel. I c-c-c-can't kneel.

247
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,620
I-I-I'll kneel.

248
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,760
I'll kneel and beg of you.

249
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,560
I beg you, I beg you to grant me mercy! This is really painful. I'm begging you!

250
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,920
I'm really begging you, all right?

251
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,290
Mei Shiqing! I'm warning you.

252
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,070
You're crossing the line, you know?

253
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,240
You can't do this.

254
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,110
I-I'm your wife. Right.

255
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,910
You are not fit to be my husband.

256
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,150
- By doing this, you—
- Save it.

257
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,630
You're so rowdy, it's making my head hurt.

258
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,130
Practice well. I'm coming back to check.

259
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,690
This—

260
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,140
Stop right there! Come back!

261
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,470
I won't write! I'm telling you!

262
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,640
I'm telling you I won't write! Come back!

263
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,020
If you don't come back, I'll take this house apart!

264
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,340
The general's manor really has a lot of tricks.

265
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,950
Mei Shiqing, I'm warning you.

266
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,380
This isn't funny at all!

267
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,130
Judging by looks, this must be the princess.

268
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,030
Looking at her from behind, her figure is very average.

269
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,300
My Xiao Wanzi is indeed the prettiest.

270
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,960
I'm counting to three, are you listening?

271
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,240
One.

272
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
Two—

273
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,170
I was wondering who it was.

274
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,340
Turns out it was you, you monkey.

275
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,450
It is me, your grandpa.

276
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,210
What are you here for?

277
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,700
Speak!

278
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,430
Mei Shiqing, so you weren't blind?

279
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,140
- Father, hurry and look! He was pretending all along!
- I can see.

280
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,550
Little thief, you dared to break into my Mei Manor alone at night.

281
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,960
You sure are daring.

282
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,700
- Take him away!
- Yes!
- Yes!

283
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,090
Let's go!

284
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,960
Go!

285
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,030
Father,

286
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,470
Shiqing actually has his difficulties.

287
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,200
Enough.

288
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,190
There's nothing much to explain.

289
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,400
Take this unfilial son to prison!

290
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,860
Father—

291
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,630
Move!

292
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,710
Young Master.

293
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,650
Did you know long ago that Prince Consort was faking blindness?

294
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,590
Y-Yes.

295
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,450
I-I-I made a promise with Third Young Master Mei.

296
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,090
As long as I didn't reveal that he was faking blindness,

297
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,310
- he wouldn't reveal my fake princess identity.
- What?
- What?

298
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,250
He even knows that you're a fake princess?

299
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,090
- Not possible.
- Yes.

300
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,700
H-However, he's kept his word.

301
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,030
- He didn't do anything to us.
- He's just letting us go like this?

302
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,740
Why didn't you even tell us?

303
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,790
What if Third Young Master Mei turns back on his word?

304
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,450
He won't. I even... even signed a contract with him!

305
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,570
Contract?

306
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,910
I understand.

307
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,270
Maybe the Mei Manor doesn't wish to leak the news about the princess being lost, either.

308
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,250
So, Prince Consort also doesn't want to disclose this, so he made an agreement with you.

309
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,910
- Right now, our main mission is to save the princess.
- Right.

310
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,540
Did you think of a plan?

311
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,040
This is our only way. I asked around and the captured Master Xiao Bao

312
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,590
is Green Dragon Fort's Third Boss and Nan Batian's godson.

313
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,700
So, as long as we save Master Xiao Bao and get him out, we can exchange him for the princess and save her.

314
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,800
That plan sounds good.

315
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,600
I'll use my identity as the princess to enter the prison.

316
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,800
Then, without anyone knowing, we will get Master Bao out.

317
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,330
Then we will exchange with them and the princess will definitely be saved.

318
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,480
Exactly.

319
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,740
Xiao Wanzi,

320
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,440
- this time, it's is all on you.
- Don't worry.

321
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,720
Tomorrow, I will go to the prison to see the situation.

322
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,040
Princess, please.

323
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,280
Thank you for saving me last night.

324
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,990
No need to thank me.

325
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,650
I heard last time, you were imprisoned for 3 months.

326
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,980
How about we make a bet?

327
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,690
How long will I be imprisoned this time?

328
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,400
I won't bet on it.

329
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,670
Now that you've been imprisoned, I'm happily free, as no one will force me to practice writing anymore.

330
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,810
Have you learned those three words?

331
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,530
Of course.

332
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,920
I don't believe you.

333
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,230
How is it?

334
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,150
Not bad, really not bad.

335
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,840
Piece of cake.

336
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,420
Shiqing and the princess are pretty romantic.

337
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,980
What time is it now? You two are still playfully flirting in prison?

338
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,350
Shiqing, Father...

339
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,990
Father really treated you too harshly.

340
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:31,380
You have suffered. I feel bad. I feel bad!

341
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,840
Mei Shiyuan, what are you doing here?

342
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,470
I also didn't want to come.

343
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,220
But Father is leaving the manor for a few days, so I came to interrogate this bandit.

344
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,670
Then, how do you two plan on dealing with him?

345
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,360
You're in prison yourself, yet you still have a mind to care about someone else?

346
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,800
Father ordered while leaving that you should reflect on yourself here.

347
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,190
You unfilial son.

348
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,080
Princess, that seems like enough. It's time to leave.

349
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,430
Reflect on yourself, you!

350
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,040
Also, I have learned many characters.

351
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,270
The thing you wrote on the contract was that I talked too much.

352
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,640
Me!

353
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,620
But saying you "talk too much" is not wrong!

354
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,660
Speak.

355
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,780
What did you come to our Mei Manor for?

356
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,430
Speak!

357
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,550
Why did you capture me, bandit?

358
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,830
This princess has such average looks.

359
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,580
I will mess around with her first.

360
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,220
If you really want to know why, you can,

361
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,260
but I will only tell her.

362
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,000
Did I show you too much respect?

363
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Surely he didn't find out my identity?

364
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,670
Will you listen or not?

365
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,450
I...

366
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,380
Closer. Even closer!

367
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,590
Go over there!

368
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,260
Say, as a princess,

369
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,310
you really don't look very good.

370
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,940
Your figure is the same.

371
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,170
It's hard to describe. If you really want to know why,

372
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,440
then follow me, Master Bao, up the mountain.

373
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,900
- I'm going to kill you!
- Princess!

374
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,390
Princess! Princess!

375
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,730
I... I!

376
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,650
Wait! What did you say to her?

377
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,820
This rascal didn't have anything decent to say. His dog mouth couldn't spit out ivory!

378
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,190
I told her everything!

379
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,890
He's cunning! He's very cunning!

380
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,170
You don't want to tell me? If that's the case,

381
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,670
you can go outside. You don't need to come here anymore.

382
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,320
Go out!

383
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,820
What did you tell her?

384
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,730
What did you tell her?

385
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,140
- How did it go?
- I'm furious!

386
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,000
That bastard said my looks are plain and my figure was average!

387
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,410
Is he blind?

388
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:52,660
Those things aren't important. How are things going inside?

389
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,900
He's tied up in his own house's prison, so he's quite comfortable.

390
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,250
Lord Mei isn't going to be in the manor for the next few days.

391
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,370
We need to hurry and devise a plan to kidnap the bandit.

392
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,370
I don't usually see anyone use that door. What is it for?

393
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,230
It is for the dung car to come and go.

394
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,930
So no one passing by usually uses it.

395
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,010
That's perfect.

396
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,900
Did Qiu Hua go to inform my father?

397
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,340
He went just now. He should be coming back by this time.

398
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,180
Then let's hurry back. Let's go.

399
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,950
Chief, that Xiao Bao is always creating trouble for you.

400
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,970
Of all the people he could've angered, he just had to go anger the Mei family!

401
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,660
Did he ingest the heart of a bear and the gall bladder of a leopard? (T/N: Where did he suddenly find the courage?)

402
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,690
He dared to make trouble at Mei Manor all by himself?

403
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,100
You all didn't stop him?

404
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,100
Boss, Third Young Master Mei just married the princess into his family.

405
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,450
Master Xiao Bao said he was going to kidnap her for you

406
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:56,040
to be your wife!

407
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,670
Wh-What?

408
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,810
He was going to snatch the princess and make her your wife!

409
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,190
Old Wu, go down the mountain and save Xiao Bao.

410
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:13,380
Chief, that is General Mei's manor. Saving a person

411
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,690
won't be easy.

412
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:24,000
What? Are you afraid to go?

413
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,160
Father!

414
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,840
Father! Xiao Bao got captured by the one with the surname Mei! I'm going to save him!

415
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,310
Just stay right here, Young Great Aunt! Don't run around!
(Great Aunt - slang name used when someone is acting arrogant)

416
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,810
Old Wu going is enough.

417
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,270
No!

418
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,050
Father! I must go personally!

419
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,810
Have you ever fought in a war?

420
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:51,180
- Have you ever fought against General Mei before?
- I—!

421
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,560
S-Stop creating more trouble!

422
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,690
It's enough for me to go. I will definitely bring Xiao Bao back.

423
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,110
Swear!

424
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,680
I swear! I'll bring Xiao Bao back even if it means I will die, all right?

425
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,400
No!

426
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,310
I don't care if you die.

427
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,240
If you don't bring Xiao Bao back, you shouldn't return either!

428
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,700
- Hurry and go!
- Why don't you hurry and go!

429
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,720
Go, go, go.

430
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,970
I heard Xiao Bao got captured.

431
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,920
Why does he always do things so rashly?

432
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,270
I wonder how he's doing.

433
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,190
That's not right. He's just a bandit. Why should I worry about him?

434
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,530
But now that I think about it, he treated me pretty well before.

435
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,190
This is called... This is called knowing how to treat people!

436
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,990
It's normal to care about him.

437
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,780
He treated me well in the past after all.

438
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,750
That's right. This is called repaying a favor.

439
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,110
How about I go ask about him now?

440
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,950
I'll go and ask!

441
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,470
Nan Xiang, Nan Xiang, I heard Xiao Bao got captured!

442
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,650
Yes! Xiao Bao was captured!

443
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,440
He wreaked havoc at the general's manor and got captured by Third Young Master Mei.

444
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,080
- Master Wu is going to save him already.
- You're not going?

445
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,100
First of all, I am the eldest daughter of Green Dragon Fort.

446
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,260
You were just sold here to repay your father's debt!

447
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,450
You have no right to meddle in my business!

448
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,570
I was just thinking how hard it'd be to save someone from Mei Manor.

449
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,620
They need a smart, clever eldest daughter like you with them!

450
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,720
You can help Master Wu strategize!

451
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,860
You're not wrong.

452
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,680
But when it comes to our fortress's matters,

453
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,270
you have no right to tell us what to do!

454
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,200
Got it?

455
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,790
Lord Siheng.

456
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,390
Who is this?

457
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,820
A delivery man from a restaurant. The princess was so shocked that she didn't have an appetite,

458
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,470
so I specifically went to the restaurant to order some dishes she likes to eat.

459
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,240
Qiu Hua, during abnormal times like these,

460
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,580
you must not let down your guard.

461
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,820
Why do you look familiar?

462
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,160
L-Lord, I often deliver food on the street.

463
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,910
Perhaps you have seen me before.

464
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,280
That's right.

465
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,220
What happened?

466
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,280
Princess, this person is very suspicious.

467
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,390
Let me interrogate him!

468
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,010
Princess, please give me justice!

00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:45,080
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

477
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,730
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

478
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,600
♫ My treasured memories ♫

479
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,620
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

480
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,300
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

481
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,130
♫ It's me missing you ♫

482
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:13,010
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

483
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:32,050
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

484
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:39,520
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

485
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,860
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

486
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:54,130
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

487
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,790
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

488
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,680
♫ My treasured memories ♫

489
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,760
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

490
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,470
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

491
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,240
♫ It's me missing you ♫

492
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:24,780
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫
