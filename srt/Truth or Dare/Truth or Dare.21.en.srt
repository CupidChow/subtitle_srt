[Third Young Master Rescues Wife]

3
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,190
Elder Brother Situ!

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,660
- Princess?
- Just now, I saw someone following you.

5
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,900
You should be careful.

6
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,470
Thank you, Princess.

7
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,780
Older Brother Situ?

8
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,560
What are you doing?

9
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,480
Let me go immediately!

10
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,660
So stupid. After everything, you still don't know who I am.

11
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,110
You and Wang Biao are colluding with each other.

12
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,310
You rat.

13
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,110
Do you want to live?

14
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,580
As long as you answer a few of my questions, I'll let you go immediately.

15
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,110
I am the princess.

16
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,550
You actually dare kidnap the princess. You're audacious and have no care for the royal laws!

17
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,270
Let me go immediately!

18
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,760
Since I dared to kidnap you, I obviously have some backing.

19
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,630
Who exactly is the Night-Spirited Hero?

20
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,090
Speak!

21
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,100
I will never tell you.

22
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,780
Tell me!

23
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,570
Who exactly is the Night-Spirited Hero?

24
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,360
Don't waste your energy. I won't tell you.

25
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,260
Why did you come? Leave quickly! Don't worry about me!

26
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,370
He can't touch me. I am the princess.

27
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,560
Night-Spirited Hero.

28
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,210
Let's see how capable you are in daylight.

29
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,340
The resentments between us have nothing to do with her.

30
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,930
First, let her go.

31
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,480
Let her go?

32
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,210
How could I? Only when she's here,

33
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,020
will things be more interesting!

34
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,530
You really are a shameful thing.
(T/N: He is literally saying "You really shouldn't be seen in light", usually used to describe rats or criminals)

35
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,160
Let me see your real image.

36
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,950
Let him go!

37
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,550
Some people are just greedy.

38
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,580
You clearly already live and own the general's manor...

39
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,390
Don't move!

40
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,240
Yet you still want to be the venerable hero that thousands look up to.

41
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,220
Is this the person you like?

42
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,530
From what I see, he's just a villain as cowardly as a mouse!

43
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,130
What about me isn't up to par with him?

44
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,710
You're not up to par with him anywhere!

45
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,910
At least, Third Young Master Mei would never take advantage of the misfortunes of others.

46
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,510
All I know is that the winner takes all and the loser gets nothing!

47
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,740
Here and now, whatever I say goes.

48
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,480
Kill me or torture me as you like,

49
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,590
as long as you let her go.

50
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,820
Third Young Master Mei is the romantic type!

51
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,780
Let him go!

52
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,620
However, you're currently on the brink of death.

53
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,630
In the future, the princess—

54
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,700
Don't move!

55
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,610
In the future, let me

56
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,740
- take care of the princess!
- You dare!

57
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,930
Situ Lin, if you dare to kill Third Young Master Mei,

58
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,860
your death won't be far away either!

59
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,710
What?

60
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,660
It was not easy for me to capture him. How could I kill him so easily?

61
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,640
I want to torture him.

62
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,610
That would be satisfying.

63
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,530
You psychopath! Madman!

64
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,430
You hypocrite!

65
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,810
If you have the capability, just kill me!

66
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,900
Neither of us will die.

67
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,850
I am the person who loves you the most.

68
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,980
I am also the person who understands you most.

69
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,530
I'll give you one last chance.

70
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,530
I can spare this rascal his life.

71
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,840
But in the future, you have to become my woman.

72
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,010
If you let him go...

73
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,090
Don't believe him.

74
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,660
Speak.

75
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,830
Speak! Speak!

76
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,380
Just kill us. Kill us

77
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,160
and we can be together for eternity.

78
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,950
You ungrateful brat.

79
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,840
I am going to kill you.

80
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,510
I am going to kill you both!

81
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,420
I will have you all killed!

82
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,350
Are you okay?

83
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,490
Wanzi! Wanzi!

84
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,290
Get better quickly.

85
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,960
As long as you get better, I'll never get mad at you again.

86
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,000
Really?

87
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,430
You're awake.

88
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,800
You're finally awake!

89
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,460
I'm not dreaming, right?

90
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,880
I'll go find Old Six right now.

91
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,860
It's fine.

92
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,340
I saw Yama just now.
(T/N: Yama is the god of the underworld in Buddhism. Seeing him means you have died.)

93
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,990
I told him there was someone I still couldn't let go of in this world.

94
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,870
He said "Fine."

95
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,550
"Since you are so handsome,

96
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,250
I'll let you live for a few more years."

97
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,360
Are you dumb?

98
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,170
Is this a time for jokes?

99
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,070
Wanzi, I've thought it through.

100
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,760
As long as you want to leave here, I'll send you off even if I must use my life to do it.

101
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,780
Xiao Bao, I really don't want to see you like this. It's all my fault.

102
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,510
If it weren't for me, how would you end up like this?

103
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,570
Don't speak nonsense.

104
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,340
Being... Being able to take the poison for you

105
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,900
makes me really glad.

106
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,330
Besides, Old Six will definitely find a way.

107
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,300
He's been thinking of ways.

108
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,550
We will definitely detoxify the poison. We definitely will.

109
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,760
It's all right.

110
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,080
Being able to see you so worried about me

111
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,290
makes my whole life worth it.

112
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,370
- That's enough, Wanzi.
- What's wrong?

113
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,530
Quickly help me get to Old Six's place.

114
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,140
No, you rest here.

115
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,880
I'll go help you find him.

116
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,650
It's fine.

117
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,450
I can go find him myself.

118
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,450
Who let you walk around?

119
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,560
This will speed up the spread of the poison. You—

120
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,530
Enough, Old Six.

121
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,550
Have you come up with the antidote?

122
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,420
I made a portion, but I don't know if it will work.

123
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,750
But let's just try it first.

124
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,240
Whether it works or not, I won't blame you.

125
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,700
- I'll go decoct it.
- Remember, combine three bowls of water to make one. You must simmer it slowly on low heat.

126
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,220
Got it.

127
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,280
Come.

128
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,560
Seriously! What were you thinking?

129
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,230
Old Six.

130
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,530
Do me a favor.

131
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,740
I want to take Xiao Wanzi down the mountain.

132
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,860
Don't do this. You may not want to live but I don't want to die yet.

133
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,150
If Big Boss finds out, what are we going to do?

134
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,250
Old Six, I don't have much time left.

135
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm not scared of death.

136
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,560
But I'm scared... I'm scared that Xiao Wanzi will have no one to protect her.

137
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,160
So I want to send her down the mountain.

138
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,190
Tell me. How do I help you?

139
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,060
Make... Make me an especially effective medicine.

140
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,960
That way, I can definitely hold on until we're down the mountain.

141
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,870
If you push your body and go down the mountain,

142
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,590
not only will she be unable to make it, but you'll also definitely die.

143
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm willing to use all of my vitality

144
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,430
in exchange for Xiao Wanzi's safety.

145
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,480
How did she bewitch you to the point where you don't even want your own life anymore?

146
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,470
I'm begging you, fulfill my wish.

147
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,280
Fine, fine, fine. It's your life. What you say goes.

148
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,790
Thank you, Brother.

149
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,960
Am I pretty?

150
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,020
Pretty. No matter how I look, it's not enough.

151
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,260
Then just wait

152
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
until Brother Six finds the cure.

153
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,330
Once your body heals, you can look all you want.

154
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,530
Wanzi,

155
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,730
if you could get off the mountain, what do you have planned?

156
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,460
I want to go somewhere with the ocean.

157
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:52,020
I heard that the sunlight during sunset by the ocean is golden.

158
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,320
- Wanzi.
- Yes?

159
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,000
No matter where you go, I hope you can be happy.

160
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,500
Find a good man.

161
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,270
A man who is willing to sacrifice his life to protect you.

162
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,460
♫ I'll exchange the rest of my life for heartfelt words
This is my only consideration ♫

163
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,110
Take the medicine.

164
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,960
♫ Although our love threads are two lines,
moon shadows in pairs  ♫

165
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,930
♫ Once we gaze into each other's eyes,
life and death don't matter ♫

166
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,040
♫ I only fear that I can't wander with you ♫

167
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,590
♫ If I miss out on that, I’ll go crazy ♫

168
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,130
♫ I ask that my diligence becomes the floral scent ♫

169
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,300
♫ that is reluctant to leave your body ♫

170
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:53,630
♫ Go through thick and thin together,
experience the hardships together ♫

171
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,610
♫ The lonely geese whose heart are ignited
will protect each other, ignite them once again ♫

172
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,460
♫ Never forget each lit lamp ♫

173
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,930
You may not want to live but I don't want to die yet.

174
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,060
If Big Boss finds out, what are we going to do?

175
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,540
I'm not scared of death.

176
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,270
But I'm scared... I'm scared that Xiao Wanzi will have no one to protect her.

177
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,410
So I want to send her down the mountain.

178
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,060
If you push your body and go down the mountain,

179
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,330
not only will she be unable to make it, but you'll also definitely die.

180
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,230
I'm willing to use all of my vitality

181
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,820
in exchange for Xiao Wanzi's safety.

182
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,790
How did she bewitch you to the point where you don't even want your own life anymore?

183
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,920
Old Six, I'm begging you, fulfill my wish.

184
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,020
Fine, fine, fine. It's your life. What you say goes.

185
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,930
Thank you, Brother.

186
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,920
Master Bao, here, drink some water.

187
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,370
Old Six.

188
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,430
Why am I still so weak?

189
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,830
Did you give me that strengthening medicine or not?

190
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,120
I did, I did.

191
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,450
Old Six, are you not going to listen to me?

192
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,340
Listen. Of course, I'll listen to you.

193
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,530
Tell me. What's going on?

194
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,020
I've had enough of you two.

195
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,800
Let me tell you.

196
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,860
Brother Six.

197
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,600
Is there something wrong?

198
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,450
I heard what Xiao Bao said earlier.

199
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,660
Can you not do what he said?

200
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,760
You two. One says he wants to go down the mountain and one says she wants to save the other.

201
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,660
Can you two come to an agreement before seeing me?

202
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,820
Brother Six, if he takes me down the mountain, only one of us can make it alive.

203
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,480
But if I stay here and we try different medicines to cure him, then perhaps we'll both be fine.

204
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,690
Okay. I'll listen to you.

205
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,060
Let's stay and look for a cure.

206
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,720
That's what happened. Say, between you two,

207
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,610
one wants to save the other and one wants to go down the mountain.

208
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,660
But I think she's right. Saving you is the most important.

209
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,160
So we didn't give you that strengthening medicine.

210
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,510
Why is she so dumb?

211
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,800
Before, she wanted to leave so much.

212
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Now she doesn't want to leave.

213
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,400
To her, saving you

214
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,100
is more important than anything else.

215
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know how much longer I can last.

216
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,200
Just give me the strengthening medicine first. I want to take her away.

217
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,400
Don't rush. Everything must proceed step-by-step.

218
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,200
Besides, the effect you're looking for needs to be developed slowly.

219
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,600
Moreover, precious medicines are hard to find.

220
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,400
There aren't that many lingzhi and ginseng on the mountain.

221
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,000
Xiao Bao!

222
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,600
I heard you got poisoned and do not have much time left.

223
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
I came specially to see you.

224
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,400
Old Wu, are you looking forward to me dying?

225
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,000
I especially ordered my brothers to get you some ginseng.

226
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Thank you, you've outdone yourself. This is a first, right?

227
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,600
Come, come. Have a seat.

228
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
Don't be polite. Make yourself at home.

229
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,700
I'm guessing it won't be of much use.

230
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,000
This poison doesn't have an antidote.

231
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,700
Who said there isn't an antidote?

232
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,300
There's an old saying, treating an illness is like making silk.

233
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,600
We aren't in a rush. We'll take care of it slowly.

234
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Then I'll trouble you, Miss Boulder Shattering Chest, to take care of my brother.

235
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,500
Naturally so there's no need for you, Master Wu, to worry.

236
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,800
Farewell.

237
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,900
Go on. I won't see you off then.

238
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,000
How is Xiao Bao?

239
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,100
Even if he doesn't die, he would only have half a life.

240
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,200
Old Six and that boulder-shattering girl are treating a dead horse as if it's alive.

241
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,600
He can't forget her even when he's dying.

242
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,400
If he wants to die that much,

243
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,700
then just let him go die. Why did you gift him ginseng?

244
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,400
Men.

245
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,000
I have to let our brothers know that I'm a good friend.

246
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,500
Master Wu.

247
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,380
Do you think I made a mistake?

248
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,400
I clearly know that Xiao Bao doesn't like me

249
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,400
yet I want to wholeheartedly treat him well.

250
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,600
I clearly know he thinks I'm annoying

251
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,500
yet I keep forcing him to marry me. Am I silly?

252
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,600
Silly, you really are so silly.

253
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,800
So silly you have forgotten how cute you are,

254
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,200
how pretty, how likable you are.

255
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,500
Look at all the brothers of this fort.

256
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,600
Who doesn't cherish and treat you like a princess?

257
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,500
Why are you hanging yourself on Xiao Bao, that one tree?

258
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,400
Who says I'm trying to hang myself on one tree?

259
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,600
The one who is dying is him, not me.

260
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,800
All right, I won't say more.

261
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm leaving.

262
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,600
I wonder if I can completely defeat that damn Xiao Bao.

263
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,600
Has the princess woken up yet?

264
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,700
Young Master, you've already asked that ten times today.

265
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,200
Once the princess wakes up, I will tell you immediately.

266
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,600
Young Master, rest assured.

267
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,800
The princess, a blessed person, has Heaven on her side.

268
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,900
The only thing that eases a few my worries right now

269
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,800
is confirming that Situ Lin is the chief of the Salt Gang.

270
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,270
He exposed his identity so he will not do anything for now.

271
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,200
Next, we should find all of the Salt Gang's shops in the city.

272
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,700
Young Master, you are right.

273
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,400
Please rest assured. I have ordered people to investigate all the shops in the city.

274
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
All right.

275
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
After that, arrange our scouts to infiltrate

276
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,700
each of their shops.

277
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes.

278
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,200
When can our princess wake up?

279
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,600
The princess is not in any serious condition.

280
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
She injured her head and that is why she has been unconscious.

281
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,400
She will be fine after resting for a few days.

282
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

283
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Isn't Xiao Wanzi someone who was trained to shatter boulders on her chest?

284
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,200
Why was she so easily defeated?

285
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,800
She trained for a boulder-shattering chest, not a steel head.

286
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,800
Heavens, bless us. Please do not let her continue to be unconscious.

287
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,600
What if.... What if His Highness finds out?

288
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,200
I hope Xiao Wanzi wakes up soon. Nothing can happen to her.

289
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,200
Princess! Princess!

290
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,400
Thank the heavens and the earth, you are finally awake.

291
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Are you thirsty?

292
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Are you hungry? I can pour you some water.

293
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
Princess!

294
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,400
♫ Scene after scene flashes by ♫

295
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,400
♫ Lifting my head, I gaze at the galaxy ♫

296
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,000
♫ I diligently become more persistent little by little ♫

297
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,100
- Princess.
- Princess, be careful.

298
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,400
Wear your shoes first. Don't catch a cold.

299

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Shiqing. Shiqing!

302
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,600
I'm here.

303
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,800
♫ "Whom does your heart cling to?" ♫

311
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,200
When I woke up, I didn't see you. I thought you were dead.

312
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,800
Don't worry, I'm very blessed.

313
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,200
Just like in the stories,

314
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,200
only the bad people die. Heroes won't die.

315
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,600
It's so great that you are all right.

316
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,220
I'm not dreaming right?

317
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,230
Of course not.

318
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,400
Good thing you are all right.

319
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,200
I'm fine.

320
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,200
The saying, "two of a kind," is about them, right?

321
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,400
Nonsense! If you don't know how to talk, then don't speak at all.

322
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,800
Miss Qiao Yun, are you unhappy?

323
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,600
Nonsense. I am more than happy that the princess has recovered.

324
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,900
It doesn't look like that to me.

325
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,600
Young Master, that is about enough. It is time to change the dressing on your wound.

326
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
All right.

327
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
I'll help you.

328
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,010
Princess, you just recovered.

329
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,600
The doctor said that you need rest and take care of yourself.

330
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,400
I know. I'll be careful.

331
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,800
Let's go.

332
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,200
Miss Qiao Yun, since we have nothing to do now,

333
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,900
how about we go take a walk in the garden together?

334
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,000
Go with Qiu Hua.

335
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,600
But—

336
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,300
My Lord, your calligraphy improved again.

337
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,000
Look at those strokes, full of vitality.

338
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,200
Whether the calligraphy is nice is something to be debated.

339
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,200
However, you seem to be in a good mood today.

340
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,600
If you know the news, you would be in a good mood as well.

341
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,000
What good news?

342
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,900
The servants just reported that the princess has woken up.

343
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,600
The princess is awake?

344
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
That is indeed good news!

345
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,000
Then tell the kitchen

346
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
to prepare some delicious food for our daughter-in-law who loves to eat

347
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,800
and can eat a lot.

348
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,600
My Lord is so nice.

349
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,700
Look at how meticulously considerate you are of the children.

350
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,000
It is a pity that these children do not understand us, parents.

351
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,400
Princess has already woken up but she hasn't come to greet you.

352
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,200
It is a waste of your concerns for the past few days.

353
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,500
Madam, those are trivial matters.

354
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,400
Yes, yes! Just trivial matters.

355
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,200
It is just that Shiqing and Princess...

356
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,200
How do you think they sustained such serious injuries?

357
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,100
They did not even come to explain it to you.

358
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,200
They really do not respect us, parents.

359
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Madam, I want to quietly practice my calligraphy right now.

360
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,400
You can go now. Go on.

361
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,390
When I was unconscious these days,

362
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,540
did anything happen? Have you found Situ Lin?

363
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:28,300
He is a sly fox. Would he be found so easily?

364
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,950
But him knowing that you are the Night Spirited Hero,

365
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,890
would he wait for a chance to secretly get back at you?

366
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:38,350
Rest assured. I have already strengthened the manor's defense. Don't be afraid.

367
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,680
I feel like you have changed lately.

368
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,020
How so?

369
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,470
You've become adorable.

370
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,400
When have I not been adorable?

371
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,470
You should answer me seriously now.

372
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,230
You also like me, right?

373
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,450
Look at my eyes.

374
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,580
If you like me, then you like me.

375
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,730
Third Young Master.

376
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,000
Third Young Master. Princess. The general has invited you to his study.

377
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,260
All right. I got it. We will go after we change.

378
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,640
All right. Sorry to trouble you, Third Young Master and Princess.

379
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,370
That...

380
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,240
General Mei must have asked to see you because of Situ Lin.

381
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,500
Then, how should we tell him later?

382
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,320
It will be all right. Just follow my lead later.

383
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,880
My Lord, Third Young Master and Princess have arrived.

384
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,240
- Let them in.
- Yes.

385
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,670
- Father.
- Father.

386
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,210
I wonder what you have asked me here for.

387
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,650
How are you two recovering?

388
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,750
Thank you, Father, for your concern. We are almost fully recovered.

389
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,050
A few days ago, you both got injured and I did not ask.

390
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:54,540
What exactly happened?

391
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,630
Father, it is just a trivial matter.

392
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:03,270
A few days ago, there was a drunk who was harassing the princess. I-I had a dispute with him because of that.

393
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,140
So then we got some light injuries.

394
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,030
Mei Shiqing,

395
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:14,890
in Qingzhou, there are only a handful of people who can injure you.

396
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,690
Father is right. There are indeed very few who can injure me.

397
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,950
However, I was careless that day.

398
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,120
I forget there will always be someone better than me.

399
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,340
That person is an expert at martial arts who was just passing by.

400
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,760
I ate a small loss.

401
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,460
Is that so?

402
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,980
If Father does not believe me, that day we were at

403
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,700
Ruyi Restaurant. You can go ask.

404
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,940
I heard that you don't get along with the chief of Qingzhou Merchants Guild.

405
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,850
It is not because of him, is it?

406
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,200
Those are just rumors.

407
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,470
Pleas do not believe in them easily, Father.

408
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,920
Mei Shiqing, you are a dignified junior general after all.

409
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,130
Do not be out of practice with your martial arts after getting married.

410
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,510
Yes, I should follow your teachings, Father.

411
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,720
I will take my leave now.

412
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,620
Let's go.

413
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,680
This brat. You want to fool me.

414
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,000
That scared me. Should you let A'Rou know?

415
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,600
Rest assured. I am already prepared.

416
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,810
Why didn't you tell the truth?

417
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,950
Let General Mei send men to capture Situ Lin.

418
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,150
First, I am worried that word will get out.

419
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,890
The fewer people who know, the better.

420
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,910
Second, many people are involved in this.

421
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,250
I'm afraid Situ Lin has people backing him.

422
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,970
Father should not be involved in this mess.

423
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,680
Just asy what you want to say.

424
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,700
You actually took the time to explain it to me.

425
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,460
If you would like, all my time from now on is yours.

426
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,170
I brought your cloak.

427
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,200
You must take care of your body after just recovering.

428
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,680
Qiao Yun, take the princess back to rest.

429
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,300
Yes.

430
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:40,540
Xiao Wanzi, didn't you promise to return the prince consort to the princess

431
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:44,630
and will have no improper thoughts towards him? Did you or did you not?

432
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,740
I know. I know I broke my promise from back then.

433
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,450
But I really cannot control myself.

434
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:57,170
I do feel guilty. However, the more I deny my feelings, the more I cannot control them.

435
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,910
I am also conflicted.

436
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,510
She is a dignified princess and she was kidnapped to a mountain fort.

437
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,220
If the prince finds out, what should we do? If the emperor finds out, what should we do?

438
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,390
If the princess is blamed for tarnishing the imperial family's reputation, what should we do?

439
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,780
If you and Third Young Master Mei really fall in love,

440
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,740
then where should the princess go when she returns?

441
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,670
I know I am pretending to be the princess.

442
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:23,160
Rest assured. I will surely give the princess a proper explanation.
