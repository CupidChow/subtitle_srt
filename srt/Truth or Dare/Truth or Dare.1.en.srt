[Blind Groom]

3
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,680
Qingzhou. Although it is a seemingly peaceful place,

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,150
the Salt Gang was causing disorder among the common people.

5
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,060
During this time, a black cloaked,

6
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,340
cat-shaped faced figure with a four-edged sword

7
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,800
would appear during the night.

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,070
To the people of Qingzhou, he was

9
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,890
looked up to by everyone

10
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,690
as the "Night-Spirited Hero".

11
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,980
Who goes there?

12
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,310
Tell your leader that if he tries to inflate the price of salt again,

13
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,090
it will be his head that I take with me!

Outside the city of Qingzhou,

15
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,110
the remaining bandits, those who had survived against the persecution of the General's Manor, many years ago,

16
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,660
took possession of the mountain,

17
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,160
- forcing the merchants who passed by to avoid the area.
- Stop!

18
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,210
Meanwhile, the one who had the strength to rival them

19
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,610
was Third Young Master Mei of the Mei Army,

Mei Shiqing.

21
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,050
Mei Shiqing, I'd say you're just a junior general. Even if your father came,

22
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,430
he'd still have to call me, "Master Bao".

23
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,070
Siheng, save the people!

24
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,470
Yes!

Young Master, are you all right?

27
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,410
Didn't I tell you long ago,

28
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,310
that using my tactic was great? What is the point of fighting for so long?

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,450
My Lord, calm down. Don't let anger harm your health.

165
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,120
Shiqing, seriously.

166
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,970
Your marriage is the priority, so why would you go around fighting bandits during this time?

167
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,180
If the princess sees your current condition, she definitely won't want to marry you!

168
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,530
Since I have turned out like this, I'm afraid I'm not a good match for the princess.

169
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,630
I ask you, Father, to clarify the situation to the Ninth Prince Manor and withdraw from this marriage early.

170
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,200
This is a marriage conferred by the emperor!

171
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,660
How can I allow you to take hundreds of Mei family lives as a joke?

172
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,790
I told you to take the imperial examination, but you took the military exam instead!

173
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,090
I told you to marry the princess,

174
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,110
but you— you're blind!

175
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,090
Fine! Are you trying to anger me to death?

176
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,690
My Lord, first and foremost, Shiqing is now injured.

177
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,370
Second of all, he never wanted to unite with the Ninth Prince Manor through marriage in the first place.

178
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,990
As I see it, how about...

179
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,160
betrothing the princess to Shiyuan?

180
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,200
Exactly, Father. Betroth her to me.

181
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,760
Shut up!

182
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,730
As someone who roams brothels and gambling houses all day, how shameless would you have to be to marry the princess?

183
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,890
Father, at least I can see the princess,

184
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,090
- not like Shiqing—
- This is a bestowed marriage! How can you be allowed to mess with it?

185
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,120
If Shiming were still alive,

186
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,430
would you two good-for-nothings even have had a chance?

187
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,320
If Eldest Brother were still alive,

188
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,270
he also would be a chess piece used by you to "climb the ranks"!
(T/N: To literally, "climb on the dragon to hang onto the phoenix")

189
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,460
Fine! I see you dare to teach your father now!

190
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,770
Bring out the family disciplining tool!

191
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,060
My Lord!

192
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,290
Young Master spoke rashly for a reason!

193
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,770
- Today is First Madam's death anniversary!
- Quiet!

194
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,930
The marriage is soon. If your blows injure Young Master, how will you explain it to the princess?

195
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,930
I am willing to take the punishment in his place!

196
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,100
Mei Shiqing, this is a marriage bestowed upon us by the emperor.

197
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,890
Regardless if you're a good match or not, you have to marry her!

198
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,160
You're just a blind person. I'll see how long you can remain arrogant.

[Ninth Prince Manor]

200
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,230
Have a seat, Father.

201
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,960
All right.

202
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,090
- Does this feel good?
- Yes.

203
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,860
Daughter, take a look at your home.

204
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,660
It doesn't look anything like how an imperial family's home ought to look.

205
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,150
The house is empty and all that's left is the empty title of "Prince Manor".

206
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,530
Father, I heard you asked the emperor for the marriage.

207
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:33,310
Then, can you also ask him to cancel it?

208
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,500
That's nonsense!

209
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,290
This is a marriage that was personally bestowed by the emperor.

210
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,770
Refusing the marriage would be refusing his order! You must marry him.

211
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,940
Father.

212
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,760
Qingzhou General Mei's Third Young Master, Mei Shiqing,

213
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,430
is a talented youth known far and wide.

214
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,630
If you marry him, it would be a match made in Heaven.

215
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,760
Father, Qingzhou is a remote land and the Mei family are military leaders.

216
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,130
Are you really just going to marry your daughter off like this?

217
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,970
I—

218
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,040
Father, I think you're attracted to their wealth

219
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,370
and military power, aren't you?

220
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,330
Since ancient times, imperial sons and daughters

221
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,600
have never been able to marry whoever they personally decide upon.

222
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,230
You must get married.

223
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,810
Qiao Yun, attend the princess and get her ready for her wedding.

224
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,900
Yes.

225
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,000
Father!

226
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,800
Father!

227
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,030
Princess, get up now.

228
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,640
I've already told you that you've tried this tactic one too many times. It's no longer useful.

229
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,400
Didn't the prince already say it?

230
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,760
The Mei family's Third Young Master is a talented youth known far and wide.

231
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,000
Perhaps this might even be a good marriage.

232
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,490
What talented youth?

233
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,380
I've never even seen him.

234
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,460
What if he's an ugly monster?

235
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,170
What if he's a drooling idiot?

236
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,630
How about this? I'll escape the marriage by running away from home.

237
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,180
Absolutely not! This is a bestowed marriage!

238
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,110
If you try escaping the marriage, the nine familial exterminations will be carried out

239
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,390
on everyone in the manor, Miss!
(T/N: In imperial China, the most egregious of crimes to be punished by having the entire clan/extended family of the perpetrator exterminated. Guilt by association.)

We didn't make a single wen. How will we eat?

242
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,480
Think about it this way, Wanzi. Wasn't it very energizing to teach that group of people a lesson today?

243
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,140
- Energizing?
- Yes.
- But I'm so hungry that I'm out of energy.

244
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,510
How about this? There's a steamed bun booth up ahead. Let's hurry a few steps

245
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,520
and I'll buy you two big meat buns.

246
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,270
Sound good? Let's hurry.

- What's wrong, Wanzi?
- What's that smell?

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,100
What's that smell? It smells so good.

sweet and sour fish, braised ribs...

255

Stop thinking about it, Wanzi. This isn't the place for poor folks like us to eat in.

Father, so this is the legendary Ruyi Restaurant.

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,220
Wait... Wait for me.

259
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,990
I'll just smell the fragrance.

Let me have a cup as well, Father.

Don't drink too much. Your face is already bright red.

You should drink less, Daughter.

If there's nothing else, don't let others disturb us.

The general still thinks highly of you.

282

He put a lot of effort into this marriage.

283
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,700
For every day that the remaining evil of Green Dragon Fort has not been eliminated,

284
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,330
how can I be in the mood to think about these other things?

285
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,070
Besides, my father is a person who,

286
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,120
ten years ago, abandoned me and my mother, without a care for our safety, in order to obtain military merit.

287

Today, even if my leg broke,

288
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,400
he would definitely still force me to marry,

289
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,790
if it means that he and the Mei family will gain more power.

- She's performing downstairs. She'll be coming up soon.

00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,290
Young Master, what happened to your eyes?

292
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,470
Young Master and I went to catch the bandits of Green Dragon Fort,

293
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,200
but we fell into their trap, so his eyes...

294
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,050
Third Young Master, you brought me, once a performer who was looked down on by others,

295
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,690
into the Ruyi Restaurant. You not only allowed me to sing and dance,

296
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,430
but also let me manage this Ruyi Restaurant.

297
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,280
I will never forget your kindness to me.

298
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,590
I am willing to stay by your side and serve you forever.

299
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,610
I'm not really blind. Quickly, get up!

300
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,800
Young Master, why do you have to pretend to be blind?

301
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,710
Could it be... to break off your engagement?

302
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,720
My actions today are a military secret.

303
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,180
I didn't expect the Green Dragon Fort to actually set a trap to frame me.

304
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,690
That mole most likely leaked our information to them.

305
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,870
Thus, I'm playing along

306
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,170
by appearing weak so that I can secretly catch the mole.

307
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,940
The Mei Manor has always been strictly managed.

308
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,480
I didn't expect such a thing could happen.

309
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,800
How is your progress on the matter I asked you to investigate?

310
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,710
I found a location where the contraband salt is being hidden.

311
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,410
Ever since Li Tianlong's Salt Gang collapsed,

312
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,660
it's already been decades since Qingzhou

313
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,730
has ever again encountered the buying and selling of contraband salt.

314
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,250
Looking at the current situation, this business of buying and selling contraband salt

315
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,850
is the sign of a resurgence.

316
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,330
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!

317
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,890
- What's going on?
- I'll go check.

318
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,180
Good! Good! Good!

319
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,270
What a unique skill!

320
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,280
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!

321
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,540
If you add one more tael of silver right now,

322
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,260
we'll perform it one more time!

323
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,950
Good! Good! Good!

324
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,810
It's fine, Young Master. It's just a little girl who drank too much. A bunch of people are watching her perform.

325
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,620
I didn't expect there to be a hidden talent in our Ruyi Restaurant.

326
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,250
We need to be more careful.

327
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,720
We worried you, Young Master. I'll go with Siheng to take a look.

328
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,190
Where is that delicious food?

329
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,350
That smell of sweet and sour pork ribs?

330
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,790
Who is it?

331
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,710
Turns out you were in here.

332
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,550
Who are you? Get out.

333
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,650
Are you blind?

334
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,290
You look really familiar.

335
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,590
Don''t we know each other?

336
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,960
But how can you eat if you're blind?

337
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,660
Since we know each other, I'll take care of you.

338
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,300
I'll feed you.

339
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,130
Siheng!

340
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,810
Siheng!

341
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,580
Open your mouth.

342
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,870
Don't you want to eat?

343
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,050
So strong!

344
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,400
Open your mouth.

345
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,160
Why is she this strong?

346
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,040
Why aren't you eating?

347
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,500
Such a strong wine smell!

348
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,760
Are you that...

349
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,700
that... young General Mei?

350
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,340
The young General Mei?

351
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,790
The beggar?

352
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,450
You ungrateful, backstabbing scumbag!

353
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,050
I clearly saved you, but you're still being fierce with me?

354
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,060
I don't care if you are fierce,

355
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,030
but you also disrespected me!

356
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,020
I'll let you know

357
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,330
what is...

358
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,320
Xiao Wanzi's rage!

359
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,880
What impudence! Pull her away!

360
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,210
Hurry up and get out!

361
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,790
Young Master, are you all right?

362
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,000
A'Rou, don't let that crazy women appear here in Ruyi Restaurant in the future!

363
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,410
Understood, Young Master.

364
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,690
Lunatic.

365
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,900
Get out! Scram!
[Ruyi Restaurant]

366
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,880
Are you all right, Wanzi?

367
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,150
How could you push someone?

368
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,800
Look at you two!

369
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,790
If you don't have money, don't come to Ruyi Restaurant to eat.

370
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,890
We aren't some charity organization.

371
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,750
- Let's go!
- We came! What are you going to do about it?

372
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,540
We'll just come and smell your restaurant's food every day!

373
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,800
Right? We'll just come to smell their restaurant's food every day!

374
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,190
Are you all right, Wanzi?

375
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,280
Let's go!

376
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,530
- Bye-bye.
- Let's go home.

377
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,690
The sweet and sour ribs were delicious.

378
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,080
Daughter, you enjoyed yourself.

379
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,250
- Tonight, we will have to sleep on the street again.
- Delicious...

Night-Spirited Hero! Night-Spirited Hero!

381

What's wrong? What's wrong, Daughter? Wanzi!

Wait for me! It's me!

Luckily, she's not here.

390
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,800
It actually is you.

391
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,650
I really like you.

392
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:35,100
I really... I really like you.

393
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,380
Can you take me with you in the future

394
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,030
so we can uphold righteousness together?

395
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,570
We're a match made in Heaven.

396
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,780
Wicked.

397
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,620
Wanzi! Wanzi!

398
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,840
Father, the Night-Spirited Hero is right here.

399
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,150
Wanzi, where did you go?

400
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,100
Where's the Night-Spirited Hero?

401
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,120
What do you have on your mind all day?

402
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,700
Let's go!

403
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,600
Big! Big! Open! Open!

404
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,140
Father, I'm really hungry.

405
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,830
I really want to eat West Lake fish in vinegar and sweet and sour ribs again.

406
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,880
Wait a moment, Daughter. This round is all set for me.

407
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,790
- Still big. Big! Big! Big!
- Small! Small!

408
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,160
They must have been cheating. I, your father, am very good, is he not?

409
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,280
Brother Feng.

410
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,130
He Yizhi, you've lost everything again.

411
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,940
When are you going to pay back all the money you owe?

412
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,750
That's right! I'll go get you the money.

413
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,210
- Trying to run away, are you?
- No, no.

414
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,760
You're a stinking old man, so you probably can't pay back the money.

415
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,950
However, your daughter looks just like you, doesn't she?

416
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,230
- Wh-What are you trying to say?
- She'll sell for the money.

417
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,800
- No, no, no.
- Father, save me!

418
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,940
I, He Yizhi, will pay back the money I owe by myself.

419
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,910
This has nothing to do with my daughter. All right, Brother Feng?

420
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,300
Are you able to take on that responsibility?

421
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,150
Just wait until I'm full and energized.

422
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,240
I'll beat you to death!

423
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,040
- Wanzi!
- So noisy.

424
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,540
- Plug her mouth and take her away.
- Hey!

425
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,830
- Go.
- Father, save me!
- Give me a chance!

426
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,260
- I can still turn things around!
[Green Dragon Fort]
- It's all your fault!

427
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,430
We couldn't catch Third Young Master Mei, and now we're being punished to clean squat toilets!

428
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,880
It's all your fault! If it weren't for you, would I end up like this?

429
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,300
If I hadn't used my tactic to blind him, would you have been able to come in contact with Third Young Master Mei?

430
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,680
- You're disgusting! You're the most disgusting!
- Get out of the way!

431
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,280
Xiao Bao.

432
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,250
Drink the medicine.

433
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,590
Nan Xiang, I beg you, spare me.

434
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,760
Xiao Bao, this medicine has to be drunk while warm. Otherwise, I'll have to feed it to you!

435
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,850
- Save me!
- Let me feed you, Brother Bao!
- It's just a silly injury. Is that really necessary? Goodness.

436
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,010
- Wait for me! Don't run!
- Save me! Save me!

437

You're the Second Boss of our Green Dragon Fort.

438
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,150
- We cannot let that brat Master Xiao Bao benefit.
- Things will get better if you drink it, Master Bao!

439
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,470
Nan Xiang likes him, so what can I do?

440
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,960
I have good news that I'm not sure if I should tell.

441
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,470
What news?

442
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,800
An illness-banishing wedding ceremony?
(T/N: A ceremony held for the very sick/injured in a belief that the ceremony would counteract bad luck and hasten recovery)

443
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,720
People from down the mountain at the Paradise Gambling House told me that

444
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,770
there's an old man who owes a lot of debts.

445
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,910
He has a daughter who has a "Boulder-Shattering Chest".

446
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,310
Her figure is awesome.

447
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,340
She could give birth to a whole litter in one pregnancy. I have a feeling that

448
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,270
she'd suit Xiao Bao especially well.

449
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,630
What do you mean, "a litter in one pregnancy"? Is she a sow?

450
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,340
Hey, Old Wu, I just knew you liked that type!

451
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,040
- I hope you'll have an entire room full of descendants.
- I was talking about you.

452
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,070
Xiao Bao, we are talking about getting you a wife.

453
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,850
Your injury is partially healed already.

454
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,050
Why am I marrying, Godfather?

455
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,010
I'm still young. I'm not in any rush.

456
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,590
I feel Old Wu is being reasonable.

457
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:04,230
Then... Then you've got to find me a good girl.

458
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,320
I already heard you talk about the one who can shatter boulders with her chest.

459
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,150
I don't want a shrew.

460
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,790
You need to find someone who can heal your bad temper.

461
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,200
Firstly,

462
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,970
it would help our fort banish illness.

463
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,860
Secondly, it will give you an heir.

464
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,580
- Godfather...
- Get out!

465
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,780
Are you the chief or am I the chief?

466
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,330
Thanks, Brother.

467
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,200
Hey, Xiao Bao!

468
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,890
I know you don't like to eat bitter things,

469
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,370
so I specifically prepared sweet fruits.

470
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,640
- Quick! Try it.
- I'm not eating. Stop bothering me.

471
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,950
What's wrong? Just eat one.

472
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,790
Eat one.

473
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,330
Give it to them to eat!

474
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,420
Xiao Bao! Where are you going? Wait for me!

475
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,310
Looks like this daughter of mine

476
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:11,090
really likes Xiao Bao.

477
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,640
You say that this brat

478
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,540
keeps ignoring Nan Xiang.

479
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,610
Does he think my daughter isn't good enough?

480
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,130
Then I'll find him the one who can shatter boulders with her chest!

481
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,040
Find an auspicious day. Bring her up the mountain.

482
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,880
I've already worked it out.

483
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,020
Three days from now, there is an extremely rare and incredibly auspicious day.

484
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,990
You're a really capable kid!

485
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,890
Then three days from now,

486
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,070
our Green Dragon Fort will have an illness-banishing wedding ceremony!

487
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,970
Chief, I'll get people to prepare for it right now!

488
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,370
Say, they don't even feed us.

489
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,560
They also aren't killing us.

490
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,110
What exactly are they planning to do?

491
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,580
Don't think too much.

492
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,860
We will take appropriate measures

493
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,540
as needed.

494
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,730
They're bringing food!

495
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,240
Brother Feng. Brother Feng. Brother Feng.

496
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,780
- Brother Feng.
- Food.

497
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,510
How have the two of you been doing these past few days?

498
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,360
Not well.

499
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,370
You don't let us bathe nor do you feed us.

500
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,100
That bun you gave us was so small and didn't fulfill us.

501
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,970
- Give us more food, will you?
- You are so strong.

502
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,660
Wouldn't you run away if we gave you enough food?

503
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,570
- We wouldn't.
- No.

504
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:42,060
But don't worry. In a bit, I will take you to go get a good bath.

505
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,600
Bath?

506
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,910
Great! A bath...

507
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,770
- A bath?
- Wait...

508
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,580
Th-This, what does this mean?

509
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,260
Have you heard of Green Dragon Fort?

510
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,110
The Chief Nan Batian's godson, Master Xiao Bao, is interested in your daughter.

511
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,770
Hey, Brother Feng. That's not allowed!

512
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,170
M-M-My daughter is a maiden. How could she enter a bandit's den?

513
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,960
This is not up to you.

514
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,660
- Father! Father!
- Wanzi! Wanzi!

515
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,680
Father!

516
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,450
I advise you to behave.

517
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,140
Your daughter is marrying Master Xiao Bao

518
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,870
because of a stroke of good luck.

519
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,340
Moreover, no matter how strong you are,

520
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,040
you still won't be able to escape the army, even after you get into the bandit den.

521
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,740
Let's see who dares to harm my Wanzi!

522
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,800
I'll fight you at any cost!

523
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,110
Father! Stop hitting my father! Stop hitting him!

524
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,640
I'll marry! I'll marry! I'll, I'll marry!

525
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:06,620
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

526
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:14,080
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

527
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,460
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

528

♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

529
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,150
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

530
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,150
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

531
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:43,130
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

532
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,900
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

533
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,760
♫ My treasured memories ♫

534
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,660
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

535
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,480
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

536
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,220
♫ It's me missing you ♫

537
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:11,190
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

538
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:30,210
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:37,580
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:44,940
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

541
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:52,140
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

542
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,980
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

543
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,780
♫ My treasured memories ♫

♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

546
