[Unexpected Vinegar (Jealously) Blessed From the Sky]

4
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,820
Thank you for coming back.

5
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,950
Are you sick?

6
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,770
You're the one who's sick.

7
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,750
I beg you, I beg you! Don't send me to the officials.

8
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,410
This time, I r-really really was lost.

9
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,240
I swear next time I will honestly stay here.

10
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,140
Who said I wanted to send you to the officials?

11
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,060
Then why did you say...

12
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,960
"Thank you for coming back"? Such strange words.

13
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,830
All right, I will help you wash your face and go to sleep now.

14
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,690
No need.

15
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,840
You are only my contract wife,

16
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,030
not a maid.

17
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,360
All right, I will remember that.

18
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,810
But... since you are my wife,

19
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,990
then you should...

20
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,300
do things that a wife should do.

21
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,070
W-What are you doing? We are just a pretend couple!

22
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,940
I'm talking about practicing calligraphy. What were you thinking?

23
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,780
Practicing calligraphy?

24
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,750
Why practice calligraphy all of a sudden?

25
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,650
You obviously know that I don't know how to write.

26
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,720
I know and that's why I'm telling you to practice.

27
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,950
If someone else in Mei Manor finds out,

28
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,120
what will you do?

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,350
Then let's practice. I'll practice t-tomorrow.

30
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,690
Princess, I feel that this Xiao Bao is easy to talk to.

31
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,470
Later, I will ask him to let me go down the mountain.

32
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,150
Uncle He, this is Green Dragon Fort.

33
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,180
How is it that easy to escape from here?

34
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,990
Look at what you are saying. Aren't I doing it for you?

35
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,770
If you want to go down the mountain, he definitely won't allow that.

36
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,550
But who will care if an old man like me leaves?

37
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,760
My hairpin looks a bit ugly.

38
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,630
- Father-in-Law!
- Yes?
- I brought you a jug of good wine.

39
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,150
Why are you here, Xiao Bao? We were just talking about you!

40
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,250
Here, here! Have a seat.

41
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,140
Look, I happen to have something to talk to you about.

42
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,050
- Go ahead. What is it?
- It's like this.

43
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,830
I have come to this mountain for some time now.

44
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,150
I see that my daughter is well and I feel assured.

45
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,230
So I was thinking, I should go down the mountain.

46
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,540
- You want to go back down the mountain?
- Yes.

47
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,590
- Impossible.
- Why?

48
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,240
Father-in-Law, it's not that I'm trying to stop you from leaving.

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,690
It's just that our fort has rules.

50
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,180
Outsiders that enter our fort can only enter and not exit.

51
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,900
But don't worry, I promise that you won't have any worries in regards to food and clothing.

52
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,610
I'll even take care of you until old age and send you off well.

53
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,290
Well, Bao, I knew you were a filial child.

54
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,080
I appreciate your filial piety.

55
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,420
Oh, right. Aren't you and Xiao Wanzi getting married soon?

56
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,740
In any case, as your father-in-law, I should go down the mountain to get the wedding dowry.

57
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,490
- Right?
- That's right! We are about to get married!

58
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,330
You are right when girls get married, they need a wedding dowry.

59
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,380
Right!

60
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,590
Then, Father-in-Law, tell me what you need.

61
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,960
I will have my brothers go down the mountain to steal it.

62
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,700
It's a great joyous day. To be stealing...

63
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,740
Th-That is inauspicious.

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,860
Well, I also happen to have other matters to take care of.

65
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,060
- Father-in-Law.
- Yes?

66
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,350
Why do I feel...

67
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,190
like you just want to go down the mountain?

68
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,480
- You found out?
- What?
- No...

69
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,690
It's like this.

70
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,310
It's like this.

71
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,530
My father is used to moving about freely once down the mountain.

72
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,190
Keeping him here at the fort, he feels trapped and uncomfortable when you don't have joyous things to do all day.

73
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,270
Right, Father?

74
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,760
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable again!

75
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,480
- Oh no!
- I have been inconsiderate! I have been inconsiderate!

76
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,250
How did I not think of that? Old men need to find joy.

77
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,770
I will prepare something. I will be back soon.

78
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,490
- No, what joy is he finding?
- Don't mind him.

79
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,470
When facing these bandits, you can't be too honest with them.

80
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,530
The more you want to leave, the more you have to pretend that you want to stay.

81
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,690
Father-in-Law, I have finished preparing!

82
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,770
Wait! Where are you taking me!

83
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,330
My goodness.

84
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,890
All of my brothers, wake up!

85
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,770
Wake up! Wake up!

86
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,390
Put the swords down. Put them down.

87
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,060
This is my future father-in-law.

88
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,030
Gamble some money, play some cards.

89
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,680
Everybody wake up!

90
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,980
- Wake up! Wake up! Brothers!
- Wake up!

91
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,970
- Wake up!
- Wake up!

92
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,050
Wake up!

93
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,470
Come on! Come on!

94
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,290
Look! Play your cards!

95
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,720
Xiao Bao, look at my hand—

96
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,550
Wait! Everyone wait!

97
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,580
I was wondering why you kept winning!

98
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,620
- You were cheating!
- I didn't! I didn't!

99
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,690
- Use strength to hit him!
- Stop hitting me!

100
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,470
- What is it, Xiao Bao?
- Stop, stop, stop.

101
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,420
- Great Father-in-Law.
- Yes?

102
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,460
Why did it seem to me like

103
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,920
- you threw down that card?
- What?

104
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,620
- How could it be me?
 - Come back! Stop right there!

105
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,860
You can eat something wrong, but you can't say something wrong.

106
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,980
If they knew about this, they would beat me to death. All right?

107
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,730
All right, all right. Let's not play anymore. If we continue, the fort will be in chaos.

108
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,010
- No, I was just having fun.
- Let's go, let's go.

109
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,540
- Let me play two more rounds.
- Let's go, let's go.

110
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,150
[At birth...]
(She's practicing the first verse of "Three Character Classic.")

111
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,350
- That should be about enough!
- I've never seen someone as lazy as you.

112
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,260
How am I lazy? It has already been 4 hours.

113
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,000
Look at you! Holding the brush like pig knuckles would.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,860
Write well.

115
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,720
Mud ball!

116
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,680
Are you going to give up just because I said a few words?

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,380
Re-write it.

118
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,950
Prince Consort. Princess. You may both eat now.

119
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,420
Let's go!

120
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,870
If you don't write it well, you can't eat!

121
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,410
Qiao Yun, save a portion for Princess.

122
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,880
- She will eat later.
- Yes.

123
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,480
Mei Shiqing, don't go overboard!

124
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,060
I will have Siheng come and check later.

125
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,260
- If it does not meet the standards, then starve.
- Yes.

126
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,180
- I–!
- Endure. Endure it for a little!

127
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,970
Young Master, let's train a little since we're full.

128
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,780
Qiao Yun!

129
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,550
If anyone brings food to the princess,

130
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,090
they will be punished with the family discipline tool.

131
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,100
Prince Consort, I only brought the princess a cloak, not food.

132
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,680
Cloak?

133
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,880
Xiao Wanzi, you must persevere for your dream.

134
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,870
The Night-Spirited Hero is still waiting to wander the Jianghu with you.

135
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,520
It seems like keeping you hungry does work.

136
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,780
Don't be too smug.

137
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,920
It's this that gave me strength.

138
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,550
So it's because of a man.

139
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,920
What do you mean?

140
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,980
As someone's wife, do you think it's appropriate to wear

141
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,490
another man's clothes?

142
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,480
Our relationship is bogus.

143
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,960
Then, is the relationship between you and him real?

144
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,250
He's heroic, righteous, and honest.

145
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,770
He's much better than you, an overbearing, rude,

146
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,610
selfish, and cold person!

147
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,950
I'm selfish and cold?

148
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,610
Then, who burns with passion for you?

149
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,150
How is who I'm passionate about any of your business?

150
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,330
Besides, you're just a pretend husband. What right do you have to interfere with my life?

151
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,930
Who are you to me!

152
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,450
That's right! I'm nobody to you!

153
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,490
Then go find the person you like!

154
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,440
I am going to go find the person I like.

155
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,170
He's gentle, considerate, and thoughtful. He's a thousand times better than you. Oh, that's not right.

156
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,140
Actually, any random man outside of the Mei Manor is a thousand times better than you!

157
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,440
Young Master, why are you doing this?

158
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,310
If the princess runs away from home out of anger again, won't you have to go find her again?

159
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,460
This time, I definitely will not go to find her.

160
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,580
Just let her find someone one thousand times better than me!

161
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,500
Young Master, Young Master.

162
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,460
For some things, if there's a first time, there'll be a second time.

163
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,790
Why am I angry?

164
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,430
- How was it? Did my father have a good time yesterday?
- What?

165
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,010
Yes. I think he had quite a good time.

166
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,430
That's great. My father

167
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,160
has just one flaw. He likes to gamble.

168
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,600
Just have your brothers in the mountain fort gamble with him more often then he'll definitely be reluctant to leave.

169
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
No! Wait!

170
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,290
I mean...

171
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,310
Father-in-Law gambling every day, how boring? He'll eventually get tired of it.

172
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,140
Does he have any other hobbies?

173
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,450
Other hobbies?

174
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,230
He likes to drink.

175
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,680
I heard that the fort has excellent aged wines.

176
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
Why don't you get him two jugs?

177
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Aged wine? We do have that.

178
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,440
But only my godfather can drink the well-aged wine. Others can't touch it.

179
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,690
Master Bao, Master Bao! Something bad has happened! Quickly come and take a look!

180
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,480
Hurry! Let's go! Let's go!

181
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,680
What's wrong?

182
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,820
- Wait! What's going on here?
- Master Xiao Bao, you're finally here!

183
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,850
Hurry and go see!

184
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,810
- Let's go, let's go.
- Carry him back.

185
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,600
Stop running!

186
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,940
Lad, I've been watching you for a long time now.

187
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,330
I've noticed you have a unique bone structure and have the requirements to practice martial arts.

188
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,940
Come on, learn from me!

189
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,380
Father-in-Law! Father-in-Law!

190
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,660
Father-in-Law, let's not waste our breath on these rascals.

191
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,650
All of them aren't capable.

192
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,920
Bao, to tell you the truth,

193
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,020
I'm just so bored and lonely here on the mountain.

194
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,340
My only daughter is about to marry you.

195
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,020
Say, I must find someone to pass down

196
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,120
- my martial arts skills to, right?
- Hurry! Hurry!

197
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,740
- I can't! I can't!
- Stay, stay.

198
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,140
- I can't! I really can't!
- You have the basic requirements for it!

199
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,300
Say, we mountain bandits

200
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,020
shouldn't steal business from you. Right?

201
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,740
Let's do this. I'll take you to have some drinks.

202
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,790
Forget it.

203
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,080
Your wine here tastes bad. It's like drinking horse pee.

204
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,050
What are you saying?

205
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,340
Would I take you to go drink bad wine?

206
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,520
Those rascals are the ones drinking bad wine.

207
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,130
I'll take you to taste our prized ones.

208
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,300
Are they really prized?

209
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,340
Let's go!

210
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,140
Then... I'm taking Father-in-Law to go drink wine.

211
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,670
All right.

212
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,350
This way! This way!

213
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,270
Please come in, Father-in-Law! This is our Green Dragon Fort's wine cellar!

214
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,210
Take a look on your left side. They are the ones you say taste bad.

215
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,310
We usually drink those.

216
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,360
On your right side are the slightly older wines

217
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,450
that we drink at celebrations.

218
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,440
Then, take a look at this. This wine is exclusive to our fort.

219
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,180
- Exclusive?
- This is called Lamb Wine.

220
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,360
When we make it, we add lamb meat to it. The taste

221
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,670
is extremely smooth.

222
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,720
- Smooth!
- Right.

223
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
Wait, wait, wait!

224
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,820
- What type of wine is that? This is different.
- Father-in-Law.

225
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,230
Father-in-Law, this wine has a great story behind it.

226
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,830
This wine is said to have been personally

227
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,100
fermented by my godfather

228
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,540
when he created our Green Dragon Fort.

229
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,280
- Oh, personally fermented?
- According to my godfather's words,

230
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,740
our fort has the fire element so we need it to suppress our fiery characteristics. Although I don't quite understand...

231
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,910
- Then, we can't drink it?
- We can't drink it.

232
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,210
Father-in-Law, I've prepared a better wine for you.

233
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,760
- Sure, Sure. Sure.
- Come try it.

234
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,950
Father-in-Law, come, please sit.

235
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,780
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

236
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,640
This wine is great.

237
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,710
It's called Jade Lake Wine.

238
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,310
It's said to be fermented by an emperor's consort.

239
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,250
Its age is extremely old.

240
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,910
- Only godfather, me, Nan Xiang, and that brat, Lao Wu, can drink it.
- Who cares who drank it before!

241
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,930
- Here.
- Here, here, here.

242
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,490
Today, we won't return to our rooms unless we're drunk.

243
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,940
- Let's taste it.
- We've wasted some...

244
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,490
Consort Wine of Jade Lake!

245
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,080
- Good!
- Let me pour some for you.

246
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,050
It's gone! What is there to pour?

247
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,850
Wait a bit...

248
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,000
- I-I need to go to the toilet. Toilet.
- Father-in-Law.

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,410
- Let me tell you.
- This is to drink.

250
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,910
- This is really...
- Cannot drink this.

251
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,630
- ...the first time...
- The one we cannot drink. The one we cannot drink.

252
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,390
Cannot drink this.

253
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,480
This is the first time I'm falling for someone.

254
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,030
Father-in-Law...

255
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,970
- Can't drink anymore. Can't drink anymore.
- Are you done?

256
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,400
Hurry--

257
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,920
Oh my god!

258
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,120
You can't pee in there! Oh my god!

259
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,170
We're leaving! Leaving!

260
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,990
- Get down! Let's go!
- I can still drink!

261
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,380
Xiao Bao? What happened to my father?

262
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,240
Your father is great...

263
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,770
The person you should be concerned about is me.

264
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,630
But weren't you two having fun?

265
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,110
Yes. Your father was truly having fun.

266
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,460
But what about me? If I keep playing like this,

267
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,370
I'll be killed by my godfather.

268
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,460
- Did you guys create trouble?
- Create trouble?

269
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,610
Your father...

270
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,470
Your father almost destroyed our Green Dragon Fort all by himself.

271
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,560
This won't do. I must take him back down the mountain.

272
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,380
That's not a good idea, is it?

273
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,340
My father just got used to this mountain fort.

274
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,520
He probably doesn't want to leave the mountain yet.

275
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,110
This won't do. This can't wait! My life is on the line.

276
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,670
I'll take your father back down the mountain right now!

277
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,350
Father-in-Law. Wake up, wake up!

278
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,600
Slowly, slowly.

279
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,910
Er Gou, help!

280
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,700
Father, you have to take good care of yourself. I will miss you.

281
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,890
Wanzi, don't worry.

282
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,580
After some time, I will let you, father and daughter, see each other again.

283
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,320
Brother, take my father-in-law away.

284
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,770
You have to treat him well.

285
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,080
Don't worry, Master Bao.

286
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,150
Let's go, let's go.

287
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,020
You're sending the old man back down the mountain so quickly?

288
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,760
Godfather!

289
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,280
Uncle He has become bored here at the fort these past few days.

290
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,930
He wants to go back down the mountain to buy some things.

291
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,010
He will return after a few days.

292
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,160
Xiao Wanzi,

293
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,890
your face is already better.

294
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,820
Such a big matter, why did you...

295
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,140
not tell me?

296
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,870
Chief, my body is still covered with it.

297
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,780
See.

298
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,750
All right then. You should recuperate in peace.

299
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,510
No, wait! Your face is already well so we can...

300
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,070
have the wedding ceremony first.

301
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,390
- We don't have to rush to have the wedding night.
- It's not just my arm.

302
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,170
My whole body is covered with it. It still has not gotten better yet.

303
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,980
- Godfather.
- Huh?
- Girls like to be pretty.

304
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,850
Just be understanding.

305
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,820
Who doesn't wish to be pretty when getting married? Right?

306
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,610
All right. Xiao Wanzi,

307
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,260
you should recuperate in peace. All right?

308
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,910
Don't worry.

309
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,440
I will definitely hold a

310
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,250
grand and magnificent wedding for us.

311
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,280
Recuperate well!

312
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,390
Uncle He, it is all up to you to help me out of this situation.

313
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,690
Let's go.

314
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,860

Don't move! Uncle He, you're awake?

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,750
- Where are we?
- This is Qingzhou City.

317
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,080
Qingzhou? Why are we in Qingzhou?

318
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,710
Our Master Xiao Bao was afraid you would be bored at the fort.

319
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,650
So he especially asked us to bring you down the mountain.

320
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,590
That's right.

321

Fine. Fine.

322
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,940
Uncle He, slowly.

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,620
- You guys can leave first.
- Then... let's go, let's go.

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,500
- All right.
- Go, go, go.

N-Nice to meet you. Y-You...

Thank you, Young Master.

330
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,410
I am really sorry. Just now, I saw that the situation was dangerous,

331
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,780
so I had to offend you. Please forgive me.

332

No, no, no.

Then, you're fine now?

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,690
I'm all right now. Thank you, Young Master.

This is the princess's handwriting, where did you get this from?

342
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,890
The doorkeeper just brought this to me.

343
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,890
He said that the person who delivered this is still waiting at the door.

- That's me.

It is already so dark out...

370
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,960
The princess didn't eat before she left.

371
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
I wonder if she is hungry right now.

372
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,080
Usually, at this time, it's the time for late-night snacks.

373
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,290
The princess is out alone so I wonder if she will encounter danger.

- Princess--
- Get out.

Yes.

It looks so pretty!

After eating, one's mood indeed is better.

I haven't yet asked what your name is.

We just met by chance so why the need to know each other's names?

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,770
When we meet next time, it won't be too late for introductions.

That's very interesting to say, Miss.

In any case, thank you Brother Situ for treating me...

to one, two, three, four, five big bowls of wontons.

385
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,800
I was in the wrong first so why mention this?

386
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,500
When I saw you in the afternoon, you seemed to be deep in thought so there must be something bothering you.

387
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,910
I always believe in one point.

388
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,460
As long as you are full, everything is half-solved.

389
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,960
What a coincidence, I also think that.

390
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,750
Really?

391
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,670
I will be honest with you, I was also born poor.

392
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,190
Being hungry was a common occurrence in the past.

393
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,760
So naturally, I know the importance of having your stomach full.

394
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,360
No way!

395

I see you spend money so generously, Brother Situ.

396

You are also wearing such luxurious clothes.

397
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,520
I can't believe you are also someone who has suffered before.

398
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,450
Because of being poor, I was forced to separate from my love.

399
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,180
After that, I worked hard to earn money.

400
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,290
Once I had money and could take care of my loved one...

401
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,590
Then, what happened to you two afterward?

402
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,760
It was too late. Everything stayed the same but the people had changed.

403
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,270
Ever since then, no one has entered my heart.

404
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,690
I can't believe that in this world there are good men who love so deeply.

405
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,430
Actually, you are a little similar to her.

406
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,520
That is why I feel especially familiar with you.

407
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,020
All right. It's late now.

408
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,060
Let me escort you home.

409
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,790
It's all right, I live very close.

410
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,320
I can walk home by myself.

411
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,920
Let me give you a gift then.

412
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,390
What is this?

413
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,600
In the future, no matter what happens,

414
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,820
take this to the Qingzhou Merchants Guild to find me.

He's fine!

438
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,600
He has seen the princess, too. He told us you can find him at the usual spot.

Then let's go tomorrow morning—

You actually went to eat at a cheap roadside stall.

You were following me?

447

Who was following you?

448
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,200
Look at yourself. You reek of the smell of the roadside stall.

449
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,200
Mei Manor has whatever you want so why wear such a poorly made bracelet?

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,300
- Come on, take it off.
- Let go!

Why do you care? I'm going to sleep!

00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,600
I still need to go out tomorrow morning to see someone.

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,000
Who are you seeing?

454
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Do you really care?

455
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You are at least my wife in name.

456
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,200
You'd better behave!

457
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,300
What? Do you want to trap me here and not let me out?

458
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Why did I dare to speak to Third Young Master Mei with such an arrogant tone?

459
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,400
I'm finished! He definitely won't spare me!

460
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,300
Nor will he let us out!

Night-Spirited Hero! How did I forget him?

462
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,800
We can ask him to take us out!

463
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,600
First, it was a cloak. Now it's a bracelet.

464
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,000
Xiao Wanzi, I think you've really been bewitched!

465
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,600
Even if he really gave you these things,

466
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
it's broad daylight right now. How will he get you out?

467
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,500
That's true...

468
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,600
What should we do then? My father is waiting for me.

469
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,200
How about you beg Third Young Master Mei?

470
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,400
Perhaps he'll let you out.

471
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,600
How should I beg?

472
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,400
I can't possibly use the excuse

473
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,000
that I've really been bewitched and want to go up the mountain to find a master, right?

474
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,100
That counts as an excuse.

475
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,800
I might as well depend on myself instead of others.

476
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,200
Let's say... We'll secretly sneak out.

477
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,700
Third Young Master Mei is practicing martial arts at this hour so w-why don't we leave now?

478
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,600
We're indeed good sisters who go against Third Young Master Mei together.

479
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,000
Indeed we have bells in our hearts that ring together at the same time.

480
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,200
It's "tacit understanding in the heart with commonality."
(T/N : Great minds think alike.)

481
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,000
Isn't that the same thing? Come on!

482
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,000
Let's go!

483
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,200
Good morning, Princess.

484
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,900
Good morning, Shiqing.

485
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,000
Aren't you practicing martial arts? Why are you sitting here?

486
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,600
I've finished.

487
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,600
Sitting here, am I obstructing your way out?

488
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,400
Shiqing, you're so funny!

489
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,600
I heard there's a really effective temple in the western part of the city!

490
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
I was going to go there with Qiao Yun to pray.

491
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,300
Is that so? I happen to be free.

492
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,500
I'll go with you.

493
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,600
But it is a nunnery!

494
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,500
It's not suitable for men to go.

495
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,200
A nunnery?

496
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,800
Siheng, is there a nunnery in the western part of the city?

497
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,700
Young Master, I've never heard of one.

498
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,700
There isn't? Look at this brain of mine, I remembered it wrong!

499
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,200
Princess, Longyu Merchant House just got a batch of new blush and lip stains.

500
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,600
How about we go to have a look?

501
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,000
Good idea! I happen to be out of them.

502
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What a coincidence! Siheng happens to know the shop owner!

503
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Siheng, invite the shop owner here.

504
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,600
Have him bring the newest products so that the princess can choose.

505
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,200
All right.

506
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
- Shiqing.
- Yes?
- Come, Shiqing.

507
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,700
So nice.

508
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,800
Are you purposely not letting me out?

509
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
We both willingly entered into this contract.

510
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
I didn't restrict your freedom.

511
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm warning you, don't go overboard.

512
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,600
Or else... Or else, I'll tell everyone you're pretending to be blind and turn you into the laughingstock of the manor!

513
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
Are you sure?

514
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
Third Young Master Mei.

515
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,800
Just treat me as a fart and let me go!

516
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,800
These days, my mind must be bewitched. I've been speaking so arrogantly.

517
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,000
I think this won't do, so please spare me. I was wrong.

518
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,400
If you want to go out, that is possible.

519
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,200
If you have any conditions, please feel free to voice them.

520
