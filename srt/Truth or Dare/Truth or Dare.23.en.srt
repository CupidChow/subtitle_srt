He Youtian?

36
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,450
Having fields and land would be so comfortable!
(T/N: "Youtian" means "To have fields")

37
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,080
It's not that good. So much land!

38
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,390
Wouldn't it tire Young Master Bao?

39
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,120
He Youcai? Rich!
(T/N: "Youcai" means "To have riches")

Bad! Bad!

41
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,930
That's too strong! It'll weigh down Young Master Bao!

42
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,240
He Bi! This is definitely fine.
(T/N: "Bi" means "to finish")

43
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,670
- This one's good! This one's good!
- How is it good?

44
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,580
It doesn't sound good!

45
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,910
Wait. What's your name?

46
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,260
Master Bao, how could you not know my name?

47
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,820
My name's Xu Ergou!
(T/N: "Ergou" means "Second dog")

48
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,270
Xu Ergou! Xu Ergou! Xu Ergou! Xu Ergou!

49
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,690
Even with such a name, you still dare to make fun of the name I come up with!

50
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,750
Master Bao! Master Bao! Bandit Master wants you to go to Loyalty Hall. He has something important to discuss with you.

51
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,310
-All right. I got it. Go ahead.
- All right.

52
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,430
Pick 50 names before I get back.

53
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,740
If it's not enough, you can't eat.

54
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,700
It'd be better to be named Ergou!

55
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,720
Godfather, you called for me?

56
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,660
Xiao Bao, how have your injuries healed?

57
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,960
They're all better now. It wasn't anything serious.

58
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,290
Let me introduce you.

59
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,160
This is the mighty Chief of Qingzhou's Merchants Guild, Situ Lin.

60
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,020
Back then, he was the good brother of mine who took on the world with me.

61
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,680
Brother Situ, he is Xiao Bao, my godson.

62
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,060
Nice to meet you.

63
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,260
So you are Master Xiao Bao.

64
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,850
I have heard of you already.

65
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,120
I heard Master Bao is unparalleled in martial arts with far-reaching fame.

66
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,750
Nice to meet you. I will have to ask for your help this time.

67
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,060
Don't be so polite, everyone. Sit!

68
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,250
All right. Sit.

69
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,520
Here's the situation.

70
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,890
In the past, Brother Situ

71
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,420
asked us to help capture the Night-Spirited Hero.

72
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,450
So it was you.

73
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,560
Yes.

74
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,750
Before, I asked you two to help me capture the Night-Spirited Hero.

75
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,840
But... I've yet to see his silhouette.

76
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,590
Brother Situ, you can't blame this on our bandit chief.

77
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,620
Xiao Bao was in charge of this.

78
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,500
If it weren't for the crazy girl's meddling,

79
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,800
I'd have caught that Night-Spirited or Night-Kettle Hero for him long ago.

80
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,670
I didn't come to blame the two of you.

81
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,610
You couldn't catch the Night-Spirited Hero,

82
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,450
so I helped you find him.

83
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,760
Brother Situ, the Night-Spirited Hero appears in and out of Qingzhou City like a ghost.

84
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,790
No one knows his true identity.

85
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,230
Who exactly is this person?

86
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,990
This person... is the third young master of the General's Manor.

87
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,220
Mei Shiqing!

88
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,650
Turns out it was him?

89
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,930
No wonder it felt so familiar when I fought him.

90
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,260
Turns out it was Third Young Master Mei.

91
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,060
This Third Young Master Mei makes opposition with my Salt Gang in every aspect.

92
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,530
Also, he even knows my true identity.

93
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,160
So, Bandit Chief, you must help me!

94
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,200
Brother Situ, I will definitely help you with this.

95
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
However, you are also aware

96
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,040
that I am raising many brothers in my Green Dragon Fort.

97
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,330
They must eat every day, right?

98
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,180
Also, the brothers in our fort

99
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,220
can't work sensibly without drinking some wine.

100
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,700
The main issue is that the Mei Manor is a big household with a big business.

101
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,220
No one is willing to be detested by them.

102
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,470
Moreover, we're even mountain bandits.

103
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,010
How could we be willing to be detested by government officials?

104
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,580
Fine. More money, right?

105
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,360
I'll increase.

106
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,180
Add another 700 gold taels.

107
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,930
700 taels?

108
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,660
Bandit Chief, isn't this too harsh?

109
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,590
How much money does the Salt Gang make every year?

110
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,210
How much could this bit of money mean to you?

111
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,790
Besides, if I take care of the Night-Spirited Hero for you,

112
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,530
you can steadily gain more riches in the future.

113
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,190
Isn't there a good saying?

114
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,720
Peace is wealth.

115
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,360
Brother Situ, isn't it true?

116
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,260
Fine. 700 taels it is.

117
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,330
- Nice!
- It's decided then.

118
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,460
Old Wu, pour some wine for our elder brother.

119
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,250
Here.

120
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,950
Then I'll... wait for you to get Third Young Master Mei's head.

121
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,800
Don't worry! In three days, I'll place Third Young Master Mei's head in front of you.

122
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,290
This time... you must not disappoint me again.

123
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,430
I definitely won't.

124
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,600
- Bottoms up!
- Bottoms up!

125
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,990
Then, I'll leave it to you, Bandit Chief.

126
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,760
I still have business and will be leaving first.

127
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,420
Take care. I won't be sending you off.

128
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,010
Please.

129
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,660
- Please.
- Take care.

130
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,190
This way, please.

131
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,750
- He's really lost this time!
- Chief!

132
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,090
Your debate abilities just now! You really are a sly scound—

133
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,670
- Debating pro!
- Are you tired of living?

134
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,930
Didn't you see his dejected expression and his urgency?

135
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,860
He must've suffered a huge loss because of the Night-Spirited Hero.

136
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,660
He's a businessman. He naturally understands that

137
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,690
you can't capture a wolf if you can't bear to give up your children.

138
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,700
However, this matter...

139
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,160
must be given to you, Xiao Bao.

140
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,590
If you succeed, I won't refuse any request from you.

141
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,690
Don't worry, Godfather! I'll definitely kill Third Young Master Mei

142
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,000
and bring his head to see you.

143
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,260
Wanzi! Come out for a second! I have something to say to you.

144
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,620
I'll be good to you for the rest of my life.

145
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,590
I'll fulfill all my promises.

146
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,630
Xiao Wanzi, are you willing to marry me?

147
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,500
Xiao Bao, time to eat.

148
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Xiao Bao, you have been practicing since before daylight.

149
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,200
If you do this, your body won't be able to withstand it. Eat something.

150
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,400
I can't. This time, I can succeed and not fail.

151
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,200
After I finish practicing this move, I'm going to General's Manor immediately.

152
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,000
General's Manor... Why are you going there?

153
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,800
You still don't know, do you?

154
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,600
The Night-Spirited Hero is the Third Young Master Mei of the General's Manor.

155
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,200
What? The Night-Spirited Hero is Third Young Master Mei?

156
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,200
This Third Young Master Mei wanted to annihilate our Green Dragon Fort in the past.

157
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,000
I have fought him many times, and each time, we never established a winner or loser.

158
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But this time, I definitely can defeat him.

159
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
- But I—
- Enough.

160
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,400
Rest assured. I'll definitely be fine.

161
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,600
Didn't you want to leave Green Dragon Fort?

162
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,200
After I have completed this mission, I'll plead to Godfather on your behalf.

163
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,400
I'll wash my hands in the golden basin and whisk you away from here to live the life you want.
(T/N: He's saying he wants to rinse away his life as a bandit)

164
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,100
Why have you come?

165
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,590
My father wanted me to deliver the bridal dress to you.

166
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,000
He also asked me to warn you to stop playing tricks.

167
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,600
I understand. Anything else?

168
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,900
No.

169
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,700
If so, please go back now.

170
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,400
You act as if I want to be here.

171
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,700
Let me tell you. If it weren't for my father, I would never want to see you again.

172
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,300
Here.

173
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
You have even prepared the bridal dress for yourself?

174
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,600
This... This is the ginseng soup I had my brothers brew for you. I'll also go prepare.

175
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm getting married.

176
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,200
Where do I get the bridal suit?

177
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,440
Godfather? Godfather will definitely have one.

178
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,500
- Godfather.
- Who's there?

179
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,800
Godfather, it's me.

180
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,400
Come in.

181
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,400
Godfather, I would like to ask you...

182
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,650
Xiao Bao, why are you looking for me?

183
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,200
You came at the perfect time.

184
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,300
Take a look

185
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,400
at whether this outfit suits me.

186
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,800
Godfather.

187
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Who... Who are you marrying?

188
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,600
Of course, it's Xiao Wanzi. Otherwise, who else would it be?

189
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,800
Impossible.

190
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,600
Godfather, Xiao Wanzi personally told me that she wanted to marry me.

191
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,910
Xiao Bao,

192
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,200
I know you like Xiao Wanzi,

193
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,800
but she also personally agreed to marry me.

194
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm helpless too.

195
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm your godfather and you are my godson.

196
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,800
I would never take advantage of the misfortunes of others and steal their loved ones.

197
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,400
Hence, I'm giving you another chance.

198
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,000
As long as you kill Third Young Master Mei,

199
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,300
Xiao Wanzi will still be yours.

200
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,400
Xiao Bao, why are you here?

201
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,510
Wanzi,

202
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Nan Batian just said that...

203
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,600
he said that you decided to marry him.

204
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,900
He must be lying to me, right?

205
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,300
Right?

206
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,360
Chief, I'm begging you to save Xiao Bao.

207
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,600
Everything he did was because of me.

208
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,800
Since he's your godson, would you save him?

209
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,900
Xiao Wanzi, didn't you see it just now?

210
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,200
Nan Xiang is treating it as a matter of life and death

211
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,600
and adamantly refuses to hand over the antidote. What can I do?

212
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,700
Nan Xiang definitely has the antidote. She just refuses to hand it over, that's all.

213
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Tell me why you just can't understand.

214
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,400
My daughter's only concern is Xiao Bao.

215
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,900
As for you, Xiao Wanzi, you insist on snagging in between them.

216
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,570
Tell me. How could she willingly hand over the antidote?

217
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,600
Then... Then tell me, what should we do?

218
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
This will depend

219
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,400
on how important Xiao Bao is to you.

220
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,200
How far are you willing to go for Xiao Bao?

221
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,600
After you've thought this through, come back and find me.

222
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,300
Leave.

223
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,400
As long as you can hand over the antidote to save Xiao Bao,

224
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
I will do anything you ask of me.

225
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Do you mean this?

226
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes.

227
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,200
I see you have almost fully recovered.

228
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,220
Even if I made you marry me,

229
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,400
would you be willing?

230
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,420
Yes.

231
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,200
You absolutely won't break your promise?

232
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,600
I won't break my promise.

233
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,400
As long I can get the antidote to save Xiao Bao, you can make me do anything.

234
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,700
Fine.

235
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,800
It's a deal.

236
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
It's all my fault!

237
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,200
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't need to marry.

238
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao!

239
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,400
Don't blame yourself.

240
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,400
I really don't want you to die. I only want you to live.

241
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,400
If I had known earlier, it would've been better if I died!

242
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,600
Stop spouting nonsense.

243
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,600
But Nan Batian just said...

244
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,400
He said that as long as I kill the Night-Spirited Hero,

245
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,800
he will betroth you to me.

246
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Xiao Bao! Xiao Bao!

247
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,400
Look at me. You can't trust him. He's deceiving you.

248
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,200
Even if you kill the Night-Spirited Hero, he won't betroth me to you.

249
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,400
It's true.

250
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
He wouldn't. Godfather wouldn't lie to me.

251
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,200
He's a bad person. He's deceiving you. You must not trust him.

252
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,200
♫ I ask that my diligence becomes the floral scent ♫

253
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,700
I'll go find him right now and ask for clarification.

254
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
Xiao Bao!

255
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:18,500
♫ Go through thick and thin together
Experience the hardships together ♫

256
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,120
Chief, are you really going to cede the Boulder-Shattering one to Xiao Bao like this?

257
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,500
Old Wu, haven't I said it before?

258
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,350
Women are like clothes.

259
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,770
They are all the same.

260
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,820
Did you think I really wanted to marry Xiao Wanzi?

261
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,560
I'm merely testing Xiao Bao and making use of him.

262
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,790
Chief, you have really given a lot of thought to this.

263
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,940
Bu, Chief, say if this Xiao Bao

264
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,360
really brings back the head of Third Young Master Mei,

265
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,630
- what would you do?
- What else could I do?

266
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,310
Chief, I didn't mean that.

267
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,830
You see, you're getting up in age.

268
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,950
No... For the sake of us and the fort,

269
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,510
you have been single for so many years.

270
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,840
It's also time for you to marry a sister-in-law for us.

271
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,160
Then, you tell me what I should do.

272
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,600
If you want my opinion, since you've already invested in the matter, just marry the Boulder-Shattering one

273
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,200
and make Xiao Bao give up completely. Young people always make mistakes in love.

274
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,400
- Tell me more.
- Doesn't Xiao Bao have to leave the mountain?

275
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,520
Use the time he's off the mountain to arrange the wedding.

276
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,230
Once he's back, the matter would already be completed.

277
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,090
Even if he doesn't give up, he will have to.

278
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,150
Old Wu,

279
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,700
other than the fact that you sometimes talk insensibly,

280
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,980
everything else about you is great. You are sharp and quick-witted.

281
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,640
You see, if I don't value someone like you and keep you by my side to use, who would I use?

282
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,090
Thank you, Chief.

283
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,780
You lied to me and used me.

284
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,440
You are all deceiving me.

285
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,840
[Wine]

286
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,680
- Master Bao! Master Bao!
- Let go!

287
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,380
I'm going to smash his precious collection of wine!

288
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,690
- Let go!
- Master Bao,

289
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,280
- smash them.
- Smash again.

290
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,130
- I heard that Master Bao smashed Chief's wines.
- Really?

291
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,240
Let's go take a look now.

292
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,710
Let's go.

293
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,090
Let's go take a look now.

294
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,420
Scram!

295
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,030
Master Bao!

296
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,880
Move aside.

297
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,650
Master Bao!

298
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,640
Xiao Bao, where are you going?

299
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,290
Don't worry. I will kill Third Young Master Mei. Trust me.

300
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,590
Wait for my return.

301
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,280
Xiao Bao!

302
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,470
Did you say that Xiao Bao left the mountain to kill Third Young Master Mei?

303
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,010
Yes.

304
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,910
But it's a pity about your fine wines.

305
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,130
That Xiao Bao really is violently wasteful.

306
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,460
If he really has the ability to kill Third Young Master Mei

307
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,980
and helps me earn that seven hundred taels...

308
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,450
Old Wu,

309
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,390
we can brew more wine.

310
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,840
All right.

311
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,650
But, Chief,

312
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,360
Xiao Bao is not willing to submit now.

313
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,690
What if he accidentally fails?

314
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,930
This is not for you to worry about.

315
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,730
I made arrangements early on to ensure that we'll get Third Young Master Mei's head.

316
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,470
You are indeed the chief. You really are a cunning scoundrel.

317
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,410
That's not it. The older you get, the feistier you get.

318
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,440
In any case, you are great. Brilliant.

319
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,790
I will definitely do what I promised you.

320
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,600
What do you mean?

321
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,580
As soon as the princess is back, I will leave immediately.

322
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,950
I will use my life to swear on this.

323
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,500
Why are you so unhappy?

324
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,030
I was just thinking about what to eat later.

325
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,820
I also figured you were hungry.

326
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,970
Let's have rabbit meat at Ruyi Restaurant.

327
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,610
Rabbits are so cute.

328
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,500
Then, let's eat your favorite sweet and sour ribs.

329
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,840
Let's go.

330
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,080
[Mei Manor]

331
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,320
Once we are at Ruyi Restaurant, don't control how much I eat.

332
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,150
Fine, fine, fine. I'm telling you. You can eat to your heart's content.

333
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,290
I don't even care if you eat until you become fat.

334
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,560
There are many people who want to kill you, Night-Spirited Hero.

335
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,460
There indeed are many who want to kill me.

336
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,110
Don't worry. I'm not here to kill you.

337
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,940
I'd like to ask you to help me.

338
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,270
Help?

339
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:32,520
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

340
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:39,200
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

341
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:47,370
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

342
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:53,830
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

343
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,970
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

344
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,040
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

345
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:09,060
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

346
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,770
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

347
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,540
♫ My treasured memories ♫

348
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:22,910
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

349
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,310
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

350
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,190
♫ It's me missing you ♫

351
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:37,550
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

352
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:56,080
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

353
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,700
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

354
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:10,890
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

355
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:18,180
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

356
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,810
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

357
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,660
♫ My treasured memories ♫

358
