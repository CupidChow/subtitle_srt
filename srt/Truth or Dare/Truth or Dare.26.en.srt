[Mother's Real Murderer]

4
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,670
It must have been suffocating to be indoors all the time.

5
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,260
Let's get some fresh air in the garden.

6
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,310
With you, I don't feel suffocated at all.

7
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,640
You don't dislike the fact that I'm dragging you all over the place in search of doctors

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,020
and brought chaos to the Mei Manor?

9
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,420
Even if you flipped the Mei Manor upside down, I wouldn't mind...

10
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,460
because you're doing it for me.

11
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,620
Shiqing, I'll find a way to cure your eyes for sure.

12
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,290
Silly girl, do you still remember the first time we met?

13
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,200
Of course, I do.

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,430
I still remember clearly

15
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,260
your stoic expression back then.

16
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:36,150
♫ The lonely star and moon are interlaced as they drift across the milky way ♫

17
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,370
Is that all? Anything else?

18
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,310
I don't know. What's going on in that mind of yours every day?

19
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,170
I'm thinking... when we first met, your face was painted.

20
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,310
Why didn't I open my eyes to take a look?

21
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,660
That way, I can remember more of your cute appearances.

22
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,230
I'm thinking about how after you entered the Mei Manor,

23
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,990
why didn't I look at you more?

24
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,150
Then I can remember more of your pretty appearances.

25
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm also thinking about when I can see you again.

26
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,360
Shiqing, don't worry.

27
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,580
I... will definitely let you see me soon.

28
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,840
Okay, I trust you.

29
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,880
♫ My heart is like fire, burning for you ♫

30
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,130
♫ Even my tears are hot ♫

31
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,430
♫ No regrets as my heart loves ♫

32
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,390
Here.

33
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,910
This medicine is so bitter.

34
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,130
Do I get a reward?

35
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,070
How is that? Did it become a bit sweeter?

36
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,790
If I get a reward each time,

37
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,280
I'll take my medicine on time for sure.

38
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,810
Okay. Then you can forget about taking this medicine.

39
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,240
What?

40
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,750
Xiao Wanzi, I want to take you somewhere really important to me.

41
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,610
Siheng, you don't need to go in. You can wait outside.

42
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,660
Yes, Young Master.

43
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,840
[Mei Manor]

44
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,100
Back then, Father hid my mother and me here.

45
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,130
Only a few servants knew of that.

46
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,260
They were very careful and wouldn't have revealed our whereabouts.

47
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,030
Ten years ago, Tao Juzheng had not yet entered Mei Manor.

48
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,390
Then, how did the culprits know of your whereabouts?

49
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,710
I still don't know.

50
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,160
Actually, there is another thing I feel that is very strange.

51
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,930
Back then, when the bandits were about to find me,

52
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,200
unexpectedly, someone hid me

53
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,330
but he slipped away.

54
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,300
Until now, I don't know the relationship between him and the bandits.

55
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,740
Why did he save me?

56
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,760
Remember my words, no matter what happens, don't come out. Okay? Don't come out.

57
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,820
Mother! Mother!

58
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,430
It was so difficult for us to find you.

59
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,210
Did you think we wouldn't be able to find you here?

60
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,830
Mother.

61
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,730
Save me!

62
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,640
No, don't.

63
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,590
Let's go.

64
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,420
Mother! Wake up, Mother!

65
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,080
Mother!

66
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,430
Mother!

67
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,200
Mother...

68
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,500
This is indeed strange.

69
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,550
Who exactly is he?

70
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,010
[Mei Manor]

71
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,310
Princess, allow me.

72
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,700
Young Master, your guess was right.

73
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,960
Someone is tailing us.

74
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,550
My current situation is enough for him to get carried away, thinking he's succeeded.

75
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,060
All our spies are prepared.

76
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,460
We're just waiting for your order, Young Master.

77
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,230
Once he lets his guard down, they can act.

78
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,710
Have you investigated those physicians that Third Young Master Mei found?

79
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,090
Is he really blind this time?

80
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,890
The Mei Manor is urgently searching for physicians.

81
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,620
They not only asked famous physicians but also Jianghu physicians.

82
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,460
Third Master Young Mei is indeed blind this time.

83
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,510
Then, has he made any moves?

84
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,010
He is cooped in his manor and does not go out often.

85
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,990
Today, he visited the old home where his mother was killed.

86
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,970
Third Master Young Mei went to cry to his mother

87
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,390
because he's blind, is that right?

88
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,630
Tell the brothers that business can continue.

89
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,050
Yes.

90
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,390
However, according to my investigation, the people of Ruyi Restaurant are not simple.

91
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,280
They have found a man named Crazy Old Chen.

92
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,280
Crazy Old Chen?

93
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,750
He was a well-known figure in Qingzhou ten years ago.

94
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,090
Then he became crazy and his whereabouts became unknown.

95
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,190
He was hidden by the people of Ruyi Restaurant.

96
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,620
There is no news of anyone seeing him.

97
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,730
Find him.

98
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,290
Yes.

99
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,850
Father, are you going out?

100
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,580
Where have you two been?

101
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,280
We went out to take a stroll.

102
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,290
Mei Shiqing, nowadays, when you see me, can you not speak a word of truth?

103
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,590
Must we become like this?

104
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,600
Father is overthinking.

105
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,130
General Mei is worried about you.

106
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,000
After everything is resolved, it's not too late to tell him.

107
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,750
Let's go.

108
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,230
These are pretty.

109
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,960
How much for one?

110
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,220
Three wen for one.

111
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,720
Look at this.

112
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,660
This is nice as well. Take a look.

113
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,660
- I'll take one.
- All right.

114
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,120
- Pick a nice one for us.
- All right.

115
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,100
Ying Fish.
(T/N: mythical Chinese creature with fish body, bird wing, and duck sounds)

116
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,880
Father, look. My Ying Fish.

117
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,030
Look, it can fly.

118
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,320
Shiqing you should be practicing your martial arts and studying.

119
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,900
Don't play with these things. Put it back.

120
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,030
Why?

121
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,860
There's no reason. Let's go.

122
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,590
No, I want to play.

123
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,300
Shiqing! I told you you have to properly learn martial arts and study. Do you understand?

124
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,720
- Put it down!
- No!

125
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,420
- Let's go!
- Buy one!

126
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,330
Umbrellas for sale!

127
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,690
Looks like Situ Lin can no longer keep his composure.

128
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,660
We'll give him a fatal blow right now.

129
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,650
Young Master, you guessed correctly.

130
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,290
The Salt Gang's warehouse, transportation, and stores have all received orders.

131
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,790
They are going to start selling contraband salt willfully.

132
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,880
Notify all our secret agents to wait for the signal tonight.

133
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,600
Move in unison throughout the city to take down the Salt Gang.

134
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,970
Yes.

135
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,990
My Lord.

136
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,660
Young Master, if you don't have any more orders,

137
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,570
I'll leave now.

138
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,050
What are you two discussing?

139
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,650
Why is Siheng acting suspiciously?

140
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,260
It's nothing.

141
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,550
Do you need anything, Father?

142
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,850
I came to see you.

143
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,430
How is the medicine that quack physician prescribed working?

144
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,070
There's no obvious improvement.

145
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,330
I told you.

146
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,060
The princess is just being willful.

147
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,360
Are you just going to let her continue?

148
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,980
The princess risked her life to invite the physician. So what if I use him?

149
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,290
Fine!

150
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,920
Everyone else is helping you, yet I'm the only one harming you, is that right?

151
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,550
Father...

152
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,990
Where did this come from?

153
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,820
What is it?

154
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,860
A fish with wings. The fish is blue.

155
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,920
Are the wings orange?

156
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,130
How did you know?

157
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,210
Hurry! Keep up.

158
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,800
Keep up!

159
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,330
Come on, drink up.

160
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,260
Come on. I'll pour it for you all.

161
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,700
Quickly.

162
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,360
Open it.

163
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,400
This is bad. All the stores, warehouses, and storages have been raided.

164
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,000
What did you say?

165
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,200
Our brothers didn't even have the chance to fight against them.

166
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,800
It looks like spies have been planted in our gang.

167
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,900
Third Young Master Mei, you forced my hand.

168
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,000
If I don't kill you with my own hands,

169
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
I swear to not be human!

170
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,800
- Kill, kill, kill! None can be spared!
- What are you doing? Shut your mouth! Do you hear me?

171
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
Don't worry anymore.

172
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
You've planned for so long.

173
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,800
What if it fails?

174
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Those spies are well experienced. This has been in the works for a long time now.

175
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,600
It won't fail.

176
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,100
Young Master!

177
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,770
- How was it?
- Everything went smoothly.

178
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,100
There were no casualties among the spies.

179
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,200
They've taken down all of the Salt Gang's strongholds.

180
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,800
Good job. Lock up all those people.

181
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,200
Also, capture those who escaped.

182
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,500
Yes.

183
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,780
This is great. The general will surely believe you now.

184
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,100
But... that Situ Ling is still roaming freely out there.

185
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,800
What if he crazily tries to get revenge on us?

186
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,600
The Salt Gang has been destroyed, so Situ Ling is just a fangless wolf. We need not worry about him.

187
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,800
It's easy to dodge a visible weapon but difficult to protect oneself from a hidden weapon.

188
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,200
If he uses underhanded tactics, then we'll be defenseless.

189
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,860
It's fine, I'll protect you.

190
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,950
I will also protect you well.

191
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,400
How have you been feeling these past few days? Any signs of getting better?

192
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,700
You're still so impatient. How could it be that quick?

193
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,200
But you've been treated for so many days now.

194
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Every day, I wake up, hoping you'll be able to see again.

195
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,200
With you caring for me, I'll be fine in no time.

196
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,400
By the way,

197
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,600
since all the people of the Salt Gang are captured,

198
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,000
will Situ Lin receive news and escape?

199
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
Him? He's prideful.

200
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,200
The Salt Gang that he placed so much effort on has been destroyed, so he surely won't run away.

201
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Then... will he come and get revenge on us?

202
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,900
I actually hope he will walk into the trap himself.

203
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Later, Siheng and I are going to interrogate the Salt Gang members.

204
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,800
You're going, too?

205
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,800
There can't be any mistakes during the interrogation. I must have them confess

206
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,800
and sign. Only then can it be called having both witnesses and materialistic evidence.

207
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,500
Then I'll go with you as well.

208
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,200
No need.

209
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,300
I might be able to help you.

210
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,400
Don't worry, I can go alone.

211
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,800
- Don't worry.
- Young Master.

212
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,600
Ruyi Restaurant sent a message saying Crazy Old Chen escaped this morning.

213
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,900
They just found where he was hiding.

214
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,400
I've come to ask for Young Master's orders.

215
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
This is great news.

216
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,200
Let's go and take a look.

217
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
Wait for me at home.

218
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
Be careful.

219
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,340
Siheng, I'll go alone to where Crazy Old Chen is.

220
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,200
You go get information from the Salt Gang.

221
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,800
- But, Young Master, your—
- No buts.

222
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,400
Hurry and go.

223
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,300
Yes, Young Master.

224
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,000
Crazy Old Chen! I know you're here.

225
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,500
If you don't come out, I'll burn this place down.

226
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,400
If you're not afraid of dying in the fire, then don't move.

227
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,000
If you can be honest, I will guarantee a life with no worries for you.

228
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Is that true?

229
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,400
Yes.

230
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,000
Have you become blind?

231
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
Would you believe me if I said no?

232
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,600
What else do you want to say?

233
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,800
You've finally showed up, Situ, you old dog.

234
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,200
You didn't go blind!

235
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
After seeing you...

236
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
my eyes are all better.

237
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,200
Third Young Master Mei, either you die or I die today.

238
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,600
Prepare to die!

239
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
Li Tianlong!

240
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,200
You backstabbing bastard!

241
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,100
I helped you kill people, yet you betrayed me!

242
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,900
Li Tianlong!

243
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,500
Crazy Old Chen!

244
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,800
Did you want to ask me

245
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,400
- who...
- Who?

246
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
Tell me.

247
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,200
Actually, if it weren't for the person with a painted face

248
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,700
and broke boulders on his chest who pointed out the direction to us,

249
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,800
we wouldn't have been able to kill you...

250
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Crazy Old Chen!

251
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Crazy Old Chen! Crazy Old Chen!

252
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,400
Painted face...

253
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,540
You're back?

254
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,430
Shiqing, your eyes have recovered?

255
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,520
Why aren't you saying anything? Did something happen?

256
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,220
Let me ask you.

257
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:11,940
In Qingzhou, are you and He Yizhi

258
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,780
the only ones with painted faces and break boulders on your chest?

259
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,200
That's right. I told you before. Why?

260
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,090
Think carefully, there must be someone else.

261
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,320
There must be someone else!

262
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,210
Just... What exactly happened?

263
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,060
Before Crazy Old Chen died, he told me that ten years ago,

264
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,520
someone with a painted face

265
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,230
and "Boulder-Shattering Chest"

266
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,100
gave away the hiding place where my mother and I were at.

267
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,940
That allowed him...

268
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,090
Impossible.

269
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,850
Impossible.

270
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,420
I'll go find my father to ask him right now!

271
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,260
Daughter, come here. Just in time.

272
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,800
Try my freshly made tea.

273
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,220
Wait. What's wrong?

274
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,550
Who bullied you?

275
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,210
Why did you do that?

276
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,280
Daughter, hear me out.

277
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,710
Y-you were too young back then. I...

278
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,710
Also, I didn't know that was Mei Shiqing's mother.

279
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,680
Even if it were someone else, it's still a person's life.

280
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,080
Why did you want to harm them?

281
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,940
Daughter, I didn't want to harm anyone.

282
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,180
I truly didn't know they went there to kill.

283
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,690
If I knew, I wouldn't have done it no matter what.

284
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,380
I truly didn't know.

285
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,610
You didn't know! You didn't know!

286
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,280
But Shiqing's mother died because of you.

287
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,510
Daughter, listen to me.

288
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,650
You were too young. I was raising you by myself

289
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,160
and I owed a ton of money to the gambling house.

290
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,450
They forced me to find the whereabouts of a woman.

291
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,640
At the time, I was confused and didn't think twice.

292
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,090
I didn't know they were going to kill anyone!

293
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,340
But that's the reality of it.

294
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,060
Shiqing's mother died because of you.

295
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,510
His mother died because of my father!

296
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,330
What should I do? What am I supposed to do?

297
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,020
That's right. What do we do?

298
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,620
General Mei is so powerful.

299
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,280
This won't do, Daughter! We can't stay here any longer!

300
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,310
Where are we running away to?

301
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,820
At this time, you're still thinking about running away?

302
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,330
If we don't, what do we do then?

303
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,540
Daughter, I know you like him.

304
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,380
It is all my fault, all right?

305
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,760
I'm just an old bastard!

306
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,930
Stop hitting yourself. What are you doing?

307
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,490
Let's do this. I will ask for forgiveness from Mei Shiqing myself!

308
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,850
I admit it was me.

309
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,150
I traced your mother's whereabouts

310
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,070
and sold the information to Paradise Gambling House.

311
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,690
But before Xiao Wanzi came to ask me, I really didn't know she was your mother.

312
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,090
O-Otherwise, I wouldn't have hidden it from you all until now.

313
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,060
Third Young Master Mei, this-this is all my fault.

314
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,230
You can do whatever you want to me. Can you please not blame Xiao Wanzi?

315
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,060
She really had nothing to do with it.

316
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,640
I can cut our ties as father and daughter.

317
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,900
Young Master Mei, I'm willing to die for my crime.

318
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,370
Get out. I don't want to see you.

319
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,050
Third Young Master Mei, as long as you don't blame Xiao Wanzi,

320
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,350
I, He Yizhi, in my next life– No, in this life,

321
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,160
I am willing to do anything!

322
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,580
Get out of here! Leave!

323
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,940
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

324
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:15,380
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

325
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:22,790
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

326
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:29,190
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

327
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,330
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

328
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,520
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

329
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:44,530
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

330
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,250
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

331
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:52,000
♫ My treasured memories ♫

332
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,210
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

333
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,720
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

334
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,570
♫ It's me missing you ♫

335
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:13,960
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

336
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:31,490
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

337
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:39,000
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

338
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,330
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

339
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:53,630
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

340
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,290
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

341
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,200
♫ My treasured memories ♫

342
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,190
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

343
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,920
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

344
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,700
♫ It's me missing you ♫

345
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:25,680
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫
