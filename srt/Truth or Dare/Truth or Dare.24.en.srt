She also likes to trick people.

128

I shouldn't have trusted her back then.

129

I even treat her as a friend. I should have killed her.

Miss, we have been walking around here for a long time now.

131

How about we go searching in another area?

132
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,340
Search?

133
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,870
It's better if we can't find her.

134
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,000
It just so happens that I don't want her to be my stepmother. I never want to see her again.

We're not searching anymore.

136

Yes, I especially understand you. However, how will we explain it to the chief?

137

Are you stupid?

138
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,420
I said I'm not searching anymore but I didn't say you all can't search. You all continue searching.

139
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,830
- Yes, yes. You guys go over there to search.
- Yes.

140

Hey! Come back.

141
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,320
What I mean is just somewhat search the area around here.

142
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,420
You don't need to be so serious about it. Do you understand?

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,090
- Yes, yes. I understand.
- Smart boy.

Why aren't they here yet?

Nothing went wrong, right?

146
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,550
Don't worry. Master Xiao Bao is there.

147
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,670
Nothing will go wrong. They will be here soon.

148
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,720
You're quite optimistic. I can't be.

149
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,850
What should we do if they got caught?

150
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,110
What are you talking about?

151
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,040
Even if they haven't been caught,

152
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,230
what do we do if Master Xiao Bao changes his mind?

153
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,460
I believe in that lad, all right?

154

Even if he doesn't change his mind...

Father, did you lose weight?

160
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,180
No.

161
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,770
- Father.
- You have lost weight.

162
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,860
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

163

- Father.
- Wait, wait.

164

She calls your father, Father. You also call your father, Father.

165

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,870
He would teach me to read.

More importantly, when I am in danger,

277
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,990
he would show up immediately to protect me.

Don't leave. Why would you leave?

I already promised Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua. I need to leave.

00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,030
This is my fault, too.

Yes. It is like a dream.

292

Sometimes, when I look at Third Young Master Mei,

293
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,540
it's like looking at a reflection in the water.

294
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,170
I'm afraid that once I touch him, he will be gone.

295
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,460
So what if it is a dream?

296

Okay.

305
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,140
Let me tell you. Even though I still don't like you,

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,950
I want to thank you for today.

307

Come on.

309
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,860
I'm so happy!

310
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,610
By the way, how did you deal with the spy you caught?

311
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,560
How much do you know about him?

312
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,600
I really do not know much.

313
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,300
When I escaped from the Mei Manor last time

314
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,000
was when I realized there was a spy from our Green Dragon Fort.

315
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,810
As for the specifics,

316

I really do not know much.

317
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,520
To be honest, before I went to the Green Dragon Fort, he committed suicide.

318
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,210
Really? Suicide?

319
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,310
He must have known that even if I spare him,

320

Nan Batian would not.

321

That's true.

What are your plans after this?

323
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,490
Let me tell you. I want to travel far away

324
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,710
and get married with my Xiao Wanzi.

325
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,890
Then, have a bunch of children.

326
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,960
In the end, we will live happily together.

327
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,610
I would not have guessed that you're so romantic.

328
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,070
Of course. Let me tell you.

329
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,950
I truly love her.

330
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,400
I feel like Xiao Wanzi is Heaven's gift to me.

331
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,570
I wouldn't exchange it for any amount of gold or treasures.

332
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,970
In this lifetime, she is the only one I will marry.

333
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,980
Indeed he does not know about Xiao Wanzi and Princess switching identities.

334
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,090
Do you know? There's no need to mention how beautiful my Xiao Wanzi is.

335
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,140
However, do you know what is most important? It's that she's beautiful inside as well.

336
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,800
Oh, right. What is that saying that you scholars have?

337
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,410
Beauty inside, cleaver outside.

338
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,920
Beautiful in appearance and clever in mind.

339
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,430
That's right!

340
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,950
You understand me!

341
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,190
You are just not very educated.

342
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,750
W-What are you saying?

343
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,580
Let me tell you. My Wanzi doesn't look down on me at all.

344
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,020
Not only is she intelligent,

345
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,550
but she also is a master at the four arts.
(T/N: lute-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting)

346
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,090
Let me tell you. My Wanzi is not only beautiful

347
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,380
but she is also so perfect.

348
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,500
But she still has a small flaw.

349
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,850
She's too pretty!

350
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,920
Her temperament is great, too.

351
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,110
I'm worried when she goes out, she'll be bullied.

352
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,880
Let me tell you, listen to me.

353
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,670
Your princess is also all right.

354
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,120
She's just a little lacking compared to my Wanzi.

355
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,790
Let me tell you, Brother. You must not fall for my Wanzi.

356
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,560
Not just you, even if it's the

357
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,360
E-Emperor of Heaven, I'll...

358
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,770
Oh, right! You have a son and I'll have a daughter.

359
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,320
Then she can marry into your Mei family.

360
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,750
- That's not necessary.
- Then wouldn't she be marrying into a wealthy family?

361
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,720
This is the last dumpling.

362
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,630
- Father.
- Great.

363
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,640
You've suffered during this period of time.

364
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,060
Don't mention it.

365
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,920
That Nan Batian is not human.

366
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,830
When I was up on the mountain, if it weren't for Miss Yingyao delivering me food,

367
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,390
I would have starved to death long ago.

368
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,990
The princess is such a good person.

369
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,800
Especially good person.

370
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,150
Daughter, let me ask you something.

371
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,820
Seeing your relationship with the Third Young Master,

372
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,190
will I be able to hold my grandchild soon?

373
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,220
What are you talking about? Who said that? No way.

374
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,830
Fine, but no one knows their daughter like her father.

375
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,120
I-It's not like that.

376
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,380
However, Wanzi, on a serious note,

377
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,350
after this experience, I've been reborn.

378
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,490
Also, seeing how big and prosperous the Mei family is,

379
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,960
I cannot embarrass you.

380
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,170
So I have decided.

381
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,820
From today onwards, I will not gamble anymore.

382
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,360
I want to open the largest gambling house in Qingzhou!

383
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm just kidding.

384
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,380
Just promise me to not gamble anymore and not drink so casually.

385
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,060
- Don't worry.
- Things aren't certain between Third Young Master Mei and me.

386
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,220
This matter will be exposed sooner or later.

387
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,920
Have some more.

388
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,760
How about this? Let's do what's necessary.

389
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,800
Let's take it one step at a time.

390
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,020
Come on.

391
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,190
Come on. This is so delicious.

392
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,600
Let's have another plate of this.

393
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,350
Who is it?

394
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,090
Princess! It's me, Qiao Yun!

395
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,960
There's also me, Qiu Hua!

396
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,810
Hurry and come in.

397
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,790
You've suffered.

398
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,920
Princess, it was my fault for not protecting you. I deserve death.

399
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,600
You two get up.

400
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,020
It was I who ran away and am at fault.

401
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,360
How can it be your fault?

402
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,320
Miss... We...

403
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,220
It's fine now.

404
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,830
We were really worried about you.

405
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,560
Aren't I back now?

406
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,020
It's great that you're able to come back safely.

407
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,690
When you were at the Green Dragon Fort, you weren't bullied, were you?

408
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,460
Of course, I was.

409
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,160
I couldn't bathe every day.

410
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,310
Then, the food I was eating was nothing that I liked.

411
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,290
Besides, I was bored and indoors every day.

412
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,190
- What else?
- What else?

413
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,700
Isn't that enough?

414
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,330
- Enough! Enough!
- It is.

415
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,070
As long as our princess is back safely, everything is fine.

416
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,200
I was able to escape successfully this time

417
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,960
all thanks to the Green Dragon Fort's Master Xiao Bao

418
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,460
for risking his life many times to save me.

419
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,690
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be able to see you two ever again.

420
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,600
Then... why does that Master Xiao Bao

421
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,520
treat you so well?

422
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,400
Because he's a good person.

423
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,890
Miss, you haven't fallen for him, have you?

424
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,530
That's right. I want to marry him.

425
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:35,430
Miss, he's a bandit of the Green Dragon Fort.

426
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,200
So what if he's a bandit?

427
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,320
There's still a difference between good and bad bandits.

428
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,700
Also, he really treats me especially well.

429
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,990
Our princess's life is so hard.

430
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,950
You and the prince consort

431
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,850
were clearly supposed to be a perfect couple.

432
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:55,230
But now you're going to spend the rest of your life with a bandit.

433
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,420
Miss...

434
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,760
Enough already. You two, sit.

435
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,470
You two have to trust my judgment.

436
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,070
I won't pick the wrong person.

437
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,800
- But...
- Enough.

438
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,390
Have some tea.

439
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,980
Let me. I'll pour the tea for you.

440
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,030
All right. Don't cry anymore.

441
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,930
Enough.

442
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,300
Candied hawthorn!

443
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,330
[Study Room of the Four Treasures]

444
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,860
- You...
- You...

445
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,360
You can speak first.

446
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,260
You go first.

447
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,090
What do you think of the princess?

448
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,230
The princess? She's elegant.

449
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,230
Even though she was born into royalty,

450
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,200
she's approachable and kind.

451
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,090
It's really not easy.

452
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:04,730
But... I like someone like you.

453
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,390
Let's go.

454
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,060
Why are you here? Are you not going to sleep yet?

455
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,310
I can't sleep.

456
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,700
How come?

457
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:43,330
No matter how I think about it, I feel like your dad and the princess...

458
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,490
Do you want to explain it to me?

459
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,400
Actually, I wanted to tell you about this long ago.

460
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Let's go inside to talk.

461
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,100
You're the princess?

462
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,430
Wife, that's amazing. Are you really a princess?

463
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,430
But... I...

464
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,740
Don't think too much.

465
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,230
Even if I'm the princess, it won't stop us from being together.

466
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,590
But... you're a part of the imperial family.

467
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,200
You're the precious daughter of the Ninth Prince.

468
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,630
I'm just a bandit.

469
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,810
How am I worthy of you?

470
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,430
Are you afraid? Are you backing out?

471
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,160
Fine. I won't be with you then.

472
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,960
Wife, I'm not afraid of anything.

473
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,670
To me, no matter who you are,

474
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,140
as long as you can be by my side, that's enough.

475
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,160
Then, why were you nervous just now?

476
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,730
I was just... I was just too happy.

477
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,180
I'm too excited, Wife.

478
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,380
Wife, I did wonder whether you were the daughter of a wealthy family.

479
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,890
I even wondered if you were not a fairy sent to me by the heavens.

480
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,270
But I'd never imagined that you were a princess.

481
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,450
I'm too happy and excited.

482
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,550
Whether I am the daughter of a wealthy family or a fairy

483
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,010
is not important. What is important is being able to be with you.

484
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,000
As long as I can be with you, I don't have to be the princess.

485
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,640
Really?

486
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,940
Let's go to a place that's just the two of us.

487
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,060
We can go anytime.

488
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,930
You've sacrificed so much for me.

489
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,550
I will surely treat you well for the rest of our lives.

490
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,220
Can you tell me your real name?

491
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,620
Lu Yingyao.

492
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,250
What a beautiful name.

493
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,960
Can... Can I call you Yaoyao from now on?

494
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,830
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

495
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:24,240
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

496
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,570
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

497
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:38,100
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

498
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,390
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

499
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,290
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

500
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:53,450
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

501
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,020
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

502
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,890
♫ My treasured memories ♫

503
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:07,000
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

504
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,610
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

505
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,400
♫ It's me missing you ♫

506
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:21,940
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

507
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:40,350
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

508
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:47,890
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

509
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:55,120
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

510
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:02,330
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

511
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:06,130
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

512
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,920
♫ My treasured memories ♫

513
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,940
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

514
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,830
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

515
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,650
♫ It's me missing you ♫

516
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:33,830
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫
