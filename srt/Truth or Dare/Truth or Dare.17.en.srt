00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:34,690
[Truth or Dare - Episode 17]

2
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,100
[Hard to say what's in your heart]

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,790
Why must we go to my room?

4
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,660
I'm going to train you to become a lady,

5
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,170
transforming you from inside out.

6
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,420
If Xiao Bao doesn't like me after the transformation, I'll kill you immediately!

7
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,090
You fight and kill like this every day.

8
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,890
Have you truly resolved to have Xiao Bao see you as a brother?

9
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,830
But I was like this since I was younger, and Xiao Bao clearly liked it very much.

10
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,180
But he's not a child anymore.

11
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,180
If you really want him to like you, you must have qualities of femininity.

12
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,020
Qualities of femininity?

13
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,920
You have a nice scent!
(T/N: The literal translation of "Quality of femininity" is "womanly scent")

14
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,490
I don't have a bad scent on me either. We're not that different.

15
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,470
I don't mean scent when I talk about qualities of femininity.

16
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,380
Enough! I can't be bothered with so much.

17
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,450
I'm warning you! Other than Xiao Bao and my father,

18
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,710
you're the third person to ever enter my room.

19
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,110
Okay, it's not like I can steal from your room.

20
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,520
Let's go, let's go.

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,260
Go, go, go!

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,990
This is wolfskin that I hunted myself.

23
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,820
I killed it with one stroke. I didn't hurt any of the hide at all!

24
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,880
Like father, like daughter indeed.
(T/N: Literally, "the daughter of a tiger won't be a dog," a compliment to her might)

25
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,520
What a valiant heroine. I'm impressed!

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,620
Does wolfskin have no qualities of femininity?

27
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,610
It has nothing to do with it.

28
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,600
Do you have a closet? May I see your clothes?

29
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,400
They are here! Here!

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,000
Look!

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,300
- These are all of your clothes?
- Yes.

32
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,260
Is there a problem?

33
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,030
There's no big problem, it's just that there aren't many.

34
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,570
Also, it's all the same style.

35
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,240
This is just like I thought.

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,730
What did you think?

37
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,710
You not only conduct yourself like a man,

38
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,460
you even live like one.

39
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,830
No wonder Xiao Bao only sees you as a brother.

40
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,560
Then... Then, I'd like to see

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,200
what kind of feminine qualities you have.

42
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,780
I picked some clothes from my closet that will fit you.

43
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,590
Why don't you go try them on?

44
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,790
Go, go, go!

45
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,590
Are you tricking me?

46
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,970
You even dare to hunt wolves!

47
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,400
Are you just not bold enough to fight for Xiao Bao this once?

48
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,960
Fine, I can't be bothered by it! For Xiao Bao, I am going to give it everything I've got.

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,650
I want Xiao Bao to know that

50
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,510
I am also a beauty!

51
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,590
You also need to change this behavior.

52
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,680
You can't speak crudely, and these exaggerated movements are also forbidden.

53
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,090
Who are you calling crude? I'll kill you, do you believe it?

54
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,690
Well, then I won't be able to teach you. Kill me.

55
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,990
I made a mistake, okay?

56
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,730
I will make Xiao Bao know that I—

57
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,050
I, Nan Xiang, am also a beauty.

58
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,650
You are a worthy student!

59
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,080
The clothes do fit you, but you're missing makeup.

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,290
Here, let me change your makeup.

61
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,690
Here, I will help you transform.

62
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,650
I will help you draw your eyebrows!

63
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,690
I'm telling you! I'm only going to teach you once. You have to make the effort to learn as well.

64
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,290
Afterward, you have to practice often. Practice will make up for your ineptitude.

65
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,790
What's so difficult about that?

66
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,680
I, Nan Xiang, will definitely learn it on my first try!

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,950
Here.

68
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,740
Master Bao, should we consider something?

69
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,320
What is there to consider?

70
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,160
Isn't that Sister-in-Law?

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,750
Is she here to find you, Master Bao?

72
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,320
She must be here to find me.

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,820
Wanzi! Wanzi!

74
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,060
Wanzi! W-What are you doing?

75
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,650
Ghost!

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,930
Xiao Bao, in the few days we haven't seen each other,

77
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,260
have you been well?

78
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,950
Are you out of your mind?

79
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,050
Why are you dressed up like this? You caused my tears to spring out from fear!

80
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,430
It was that Boulder-Shattering one who taught me this.

81
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,190
She said you would like it.

82
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,400
If you don't like it, I will kill her as soon as I get back.

83
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,090
Nan Xiang, how come I never noticed you were so pretty?

84
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,290
This... sausage-like mouth

85
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,860
and panda eyes

86
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,250
make people unable to resist wanting to

87
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,160
lift a thumb up for you.

88
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,600
It truly is wonderful.

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,030
Brothers, am I right?

90
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,040
- Yes.
- Yes, yes, yes.

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,190
Xiao Bao, then are you willing to

92
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,160
admire beautiful scenery with me?

93
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,870
Nan Xiang, I still have work. I suddenly really need to use the restroom. I'll leave now.

94
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,200
Come back!

95
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,720
Since today is not a good time for you,

96
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,190
we will find another d... day to arrange a date.

97
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,480
Xiao Bao just complimented me.

98
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,230
Boulder-Shatterer! Boulder-Shatterer!

99
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,720
Let me tell you! Xiao Bao said that I looked pretty today.

100
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,060
- He said that you are very pretty like this?
- Yes.

101
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,970
I experimented with this makeup for quite a while. Is it pretty?

102
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,390
- Did he say so himself?
- Yes.

103
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,320
How could I lie to you? All of the brothers can corroborate.

104
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,890
Xiao Bao praised my beauty.

105
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,360
I really didn't expect this to be Xiao Bao's taste.

106
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,800
Don't mess it up.

107
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,630
Boulder-Shatterer, what is this?

108
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,830
This is a sachet. If you like it, I can teach you.

109
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,460
- Really?
- Yes.

110
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,800
All right. Take it.

111
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,330
Wanzi! Goodness!

112
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,200
Why are you here?

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,930
Why are you here?

114
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,220
I can't come here?

115
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,330
You can. By the way, I brought you...

116
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,430
I brought some rouge and jewelry.

117
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,530
For me?

118
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,090
- Does it look pretty?
- No, this is expensive. It is not suitable for you.

119
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,550
This is very suitable for you. It's frugal.

120
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,350
Really?

121
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,610
Now that you're suddenly gifting me things,

122
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,290
do you think I now have femininity?

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,760
Yes. Very good.

124
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,260
Then since you gave me a gift,

125
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,360
I will reward you to pick apples with me. What do you think?

126
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,830
- Pick apples?
- Yes.

127
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,990
Let's go, Wanzi.

128
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,470
I...

129
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,330
I'm not feeling well, so I won't be going.

130
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,520
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

131
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,820
I'm fine.

132
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,400
I'll have Old Six take a look at you.

133
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,830
No need.

134
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,760
Get out the way.

135
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,990
Well... I even brought some roasted chicken and Red Daughter (wine) for Uncle He.

136
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,900
How about if I... bring it over for you?

137
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,120
It's fine. It's sufficient for me to go myself. You two should go pick apples.

138
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,830
Xiao Bao! Boulder-Shatterer said herself she can go on her own.

139
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,570
Come on, let's go pick apples. Okay?

140
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,190
- Bye! Let's go.
- Hey!

141
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,520
We're going apple picking!

142
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,220
What is this?

143
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,940
How come hearing that they're going to pick apples together makes me jealous?

144
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,590
Hey, Daughter, you're here!

145
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,030
Wow! Roasted chicken and Red Daughter! It's New Year's!

146
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,550
Okay, I won't hold back!

147
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,290
Go ahead and eat.

148
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,560
This is Xiao Bao's filial gift for you.

149
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,290
How's his injury?

150
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,590
It's much better now.

151
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,510
His injury is almost fully healed, and yet he doesn't come to see me! This brat!

152
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,370
I matched him with Nan Xiang. They're currently on a date.

153
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,330
Take your time.

154
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,680
What's going on? Why are they on a date?

155
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,180
With my help, Xiao Bao has gradually started liking Nan Xiang.

156
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,050
That's good news. You should be happy.

157
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,370
Of course, I am. I'm very happy.

158
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,140
Well... Princess,

159
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,490
I truly understand how you feel right now.

160
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,040
Do you feel slightly... angry, disappointed,

161
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,130
anxious, worried...

162
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,050
and a bit sour inside?

163
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,500
No.

164
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,100
You're jealous! You're jealous of Nan Xiang!

165
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,940
How could I possibly be jealous? Hurry and eat, Uncle He.

166
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,540
I'm an experienced person. I kcan tell in one glance.

167
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,630
You've fallen for Xiao Bao!

168
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,510
How could I like Xiao Bao? I'd never fall for a bandit.

169
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,480
Just eat, eat.

170
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,530
How has the map matter progressed?

171
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,940
There still isn't news.

172
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,050
Has anything happened with the princess and Situ Lin?

173
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,950
It's all just common courtesy.

174
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,390
The princess had people send him some medicinal materials and tonics and things like that.

175
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,980
Situ Lin then asked someone to return the gifts. That's it.

176
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,230
How is this enough?

177
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,310
We won't be able to get leverage over them in forever!

178
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,890
Madam! Madam!

179
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,210
Reply to Madam and Second Young Master, Princess and Situ Lin met up.

180
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,770
Where are they? What are they doing?

181
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,300
They're eating wontons at a small booth.

182
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,370
- Hurry and keep an eye on them!
- Yes.

183
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,200
Hurry and tell the lord. Let's go! Let's go!

184
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,170
- Go.
- This is my carriage. Feed it some water.

185
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,560
Elder Brother Situ, I'm really sorry for the last time. Are you okay?

186
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,530
I'm fine. Thanks to your tonics, I'm in much better health.

187
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,540
Shiqing seriously did the wrong thing.

188
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,120
I'll apologize in his place.

189
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,450
It's just a small matter. Why hang onto it?

190
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,930
Third Young Master Mei is renowned in Qingzhou for being aloof and prideful.

191
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,890
I won't quibble with him.

192
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,950
But you, you should be more understanding of him. Do you understand?

193
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,850
He is just too childish and unreasonable.

194
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,270
Unlike you, Elder Brother Situ—

195
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,250
Unlike you, Chief Situ, who's magnanimous.

196
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,400
If you are talking like this, you are treating me as an outsider.

197
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,350
Is it that you don't want to interact with me like you did in the past?

198
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,270
Of course, I can.

199
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,040
That's good then.

200
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,610
The wontons are here.

201
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,990
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

202
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,980
Eat it while it's hot. This is so hot!

203
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,550
Elder Brother Situ, eat some more.

204
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,370
You're the one who should eat more. Here, hurry and eat, I'll give you two more.

205
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,960
- Thanks, it's so hot.
- It's so hot.

206
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,220
You're finally back! General Mei wants you to see him.

207
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,960
What's happening?

208
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,570
I don't know. How about we tell the prince consort?

209
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,680
No. Only if he had even half the magnanimity of Elder Brother Situ

210
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
would I dare to invite him.

211
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,450
Xiao Wanzi, can it be that you exposed yourself?

212
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,320
How could I? Let's not ponder on it aimlessly.

213
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,640
Naturally, it will all be clear after we get there.

214
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,770
Qiu Hua, go and inform the prince consort right now.

215
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,080
It's best if he can come.

216
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,690
- Go.
- Okay.

217
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,340
Father. Second Madam. What did you want to see me for?

218
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,580
You should tell us what you did.

219
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,460
Father, I-I don't know what you're talking about.

220
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,660
Princess, you have a noble and respected status.

221
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,050
Even if you have no regard for your clean reputation,

222
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,590
you at least need to consider the reputation of our Mei family!

223
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:03,210
What do you mean by "clean reputation"? What exactly happened?

224
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,820
Madam, you and her

225
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,990
should speak clearly about it.

226
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,080
Meeting up with a male stranger secretly

227
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,650
is considered not following the proper ways of a wife, and it is a disgrace to family tradition.

228
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,190
Meeting privately? Who spread the rumor?

229
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,660
There's no such thing.

230
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,780
Do you need me to call over the wonton stand's boss

231
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,270
to come over and speak the truth in front of you? Don't you dare say it was a coincidence!

232
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,160
He's seen more than once that the two of them, her and...

233
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,680
and that Situ Ling went on dates together.

234
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,330
Princess, is this real?

235
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,050
It's not a private date! We were just eating and chatting!

236
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,130
If you just want to chat and eat, you can come to me!

237
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,530
Why did you have to go find an unmarried outsider?

238
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,300
Elder Brother Situ isn't that kind of person!

239
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,780
You're still trying to use eloquence to talk back at me?

240
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,410
Even though you're the princess,

241
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,480
you're more importantly the Mei Manor's lady!

242
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,620
Today, on behalf of the Mei family,

243
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,240
I will teach you a lesson, you unvirtuous woman!

244
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,050
Shiqing, what are you doing?

245
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,680
Aren't you aware of what she's done?

246
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,380
Shiqing, if you don't discipline the princess accordingly,

247
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,730
we as parents will do it

248
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,400
to prevent her from destroying my Mei Manor's clean reputation.

249
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,060
The person who isn't considering the clean reputation of the Mei Manor and anxiously determining that the princess has committed a sin

250
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,260
is, I think, Second Madam.

251
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,780
The princess has confessed herself,

252
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,010
what are you still quibbling for?

253
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,720
The princess likes delicious food.

254
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,110
It is possible for her to come across anyone in the wonton stall.

255
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,270
Each time she meets with Situ Lin, she will tell me.

256
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,380
Also, the wonton stand is on a busy street.

257
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,260
In a public place with so many people watching,

258
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,470
how could there be such a thing as a private date?

259
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,200
Enough! This ends here.

260
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,100
Princess, in the future, just order whatever you want to eat

261
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,070
and have it brought to the manor. Don't go outside again,

262
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,080
lest you invite gossip.

263
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,450
I understand. You are right to advise me like this, Father.

264
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,610
Then, we'll be leaving first. Do as you please.

265
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,310
My Lord, look at Shiqing. He's indulging the princess too much!

266
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,460
You're also at fault! You didn't even confirm what was going on

267
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,880
and made matters escalate.

268
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,170
Are you trying to disrupt my Mei Manor's peace?

269
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,070
- I—
- Father, my mother did this for the clean reputation of the Mei family.

270
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,620
- Silence!
- I--

271
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,040
Is this something for you to be involved in?

272
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,280
- Do you believe that I can kill you in one strike?
- Mother!

273
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,850
My Lord!

274
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,180
- Next time, confirm things before you talk about them!
- Mother!

275
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,040
I really saw it!

276
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,250
Elder Brother Situ and I... Chief Situ and I truly are innocent.

277
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,400
And eating wontons together at the wonton stall or whatever really was a chance encounter!

278
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,370
I really am innocent. I really didn't do it on purpose!

279
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,800
I really didn't do it on purpose and you have to believe me.

280
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,630
There is nothing going on between us!

281
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,610
You look terrible right now.

282
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,170
Then, are you going to punish me?

283
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,530
You're innocent, so why should I?

284
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,170
Do you really believe me?

285
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,170
With me here, you won't fall for another man.

286
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,820
I've never seen such a narcissist.

287
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,060
Xiao Bao actually went apple picking with me!

288
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,400
If this were in the past, he'd never do something like this.

289
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,050
I didn't expect that Boulder-Sha—

290
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,590
Xiao Wanzi, you really do have some tricks up your sleeve.

291
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,570
Enough now. The tea's about to get cold. Drink quickly.

292
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,720
What's the point in drinking tea?

293
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,250
I love drinking wine, and Xiao Bao does too.

294
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,470
Right! I can invite Xiao Bao to drink wine.

295
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,720
Once we are slightly drunk

296
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,840
and the atmosphere is illuminated,

297
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,690
Xiao Bao will definitely confess to me.

298
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,690
Nan Xiang, that won't work.

299
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,700
However, don't worry. I've already planned it out for you.

300
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,530
You just have to follow my directions.

301
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,410
What plan?

302
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,360
- Done.
- Wait! Do I have to do this?

303
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,850
If you want to capture a man's heart, you must capture his stomach, first.

304
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,080
Right now, what you must do is make a tasty dish. I'm leaving.

305
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,180
Aren't you going to teach me?

306
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,090
I don't know how to cook, so I can't teach you.

307
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,590
You don't know how to cook? What use are you to me then?

308
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,570
Don't worry, I've already found a chef for you.

309
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,870
Da Zhuang.

310
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,000
Although I don't know how to cook, I know how to eat.

311
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,010
As long as you can satisfy me, your cooking skills will definitely be presentable.

312
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,570
- Wouldn't pretending I made it work just fine? Xiao Bao doesn't know anyway.
- Wait.

313
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,320
If you're cooking for your loved one, you have to be sincere.

314
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,620
Could it be... you don't actually love Xiao Bao?

315
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,520
Of course, I genuinely love Xiao Bao! My love is more genuine than a pearl!
(T/N: Play on words, "Pearl" and "genuine" sound similar)

316
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,460
Then you should learn how to cook right now.

317
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,830
Then, put your sincere heart into it

318
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,030
and Xiao Bao will feel it for sure. I'll leave now.

319
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,960
Miss.

320
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,610
Tell me! What should I learn?

321
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,690
First, let's slice the vegetables.

322
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,060
Add the water.

323
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,720
Here, try it.

324
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,700
It's too salty and dry. Try again!

325
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,760
Try it.

326
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,470
How is it? How is it?

327
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,720
You can force it down your throat,

328
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,170
but it's a bit too bland, which doesn't suit Xiao Bao's taste.

329
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,700
Do you want to try again?

330
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,080
Try it.

331
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,050
Is it possible that you're messing with me?

332
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,130
Do you believe that I can use a vegetable knife to send you to your death?
(T/N: She literally says "Western Paradise," a pure land of Amitābha)

333
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,420
Enough, enough. It passes.

334
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,120
Although it's not refined enough, this should be good enough for Xiao Bao.

335
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,580
It's finally met the standard!

336
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,410
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

337
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,490
Taking a break.

338
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,980
Three dishes and a soup are the minimum requirements for cooking.

339
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,740
You have far from enough.

340
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,730
Go and continue learning.

341
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,040
For Xiao Bao, I'll give it my all!

342
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:00,930
Wanzi, did you... not eat enough for lunch?

343
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,570
That's not it, I just saw Nan Xiang cooking in there earlier.

344
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,160
Nan Xiang's cooking inside?

345
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,460
Are you joking?

346
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,860
Soon, you'll be able to taste her great c—

347
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,610
I'll pass. I'd like to live a few years longer.

348
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,610
By the way, Wanzi,

349
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,000
do you know how to cook?

350
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,810
I don't.

351
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,570
Then... Then, what are you good at?

352
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,890
Playing the guqin, but I haven't played in a long time.

353
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,560
Young Master, you have great taste.

354
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,490
This is my great guqin!

355
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,350
Listen to the sound of this one. It's so clear and smooth.

356
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,540
This is the treasure of my shop!

357
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,560
Treasure of your shop?

358
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,160
All right, pack it up!

359
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,910
Boss, I'm paying.

360
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,380
Got it!

361
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,770
If I bring this back, Xiao Wanzi will probably love me to death!

362
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,810
It smells so good!

363
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,990
- I'm such a genius!
- It smells great.

364
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,700
Look at this quality! This is something only I, Nan Xiang, can make.

365
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,190
- Miss, you're amazing.
- Xiao Bao won't dislike this, right?

366
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,520
Master Bao must like this!

367
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,920
Miss, you're so amazing! You've learned so well in just two days.

368
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,500
Enough, stop flattering me.

369
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,980
Well... I'm going to head back to wash up and dress up first.

370
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,290
Bring these dishes over to the pavilion near the bamboo forest.

371
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,670
Let Xiao Bao eat there.

372
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,600
Remember! You mustn't tell him that I made these.

373
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,370
- Understand?
- I got it.

374
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,040
It's a surprise, I got it!

375
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,760
Don't worry.

376
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,720
No sneaking bites!

377
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,360
Take this.

378
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,360
- Da Zhuang, what are you doing?
- Master Bao, why are you here?

379
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,810
Well... prepare some good food for me tonight.

380
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,660
- I'm planning on...
- Do I need to keep it a secret, too?

381
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,950
Yes, that's right. Keep it a secret. How did you know?

382
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,610
I've already got the wine prepared for you.

383
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,780
A man and a woman should drink some wine together.

384
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,470
Nice one, you little rascal.

385
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,940
Be obedient. Prepare well.

386
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,290
Got it. You may rest.

387
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,760
It would only work if I ask Nan Xiang about the map sooner.

388
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,760
Wanzi, why are you spacing out?

389
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,450
I'm not.

390
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,810
I know what you're thinking about.

391
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,630
What am I thinking about?

392
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,740
Wait for me tonight at the bamboo building at the back of the mountain.

393
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,760
If you don't come tonight,

394
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,090
you'll regret it your entire life!

395
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,840
Wait--

396
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,550
What does he know?

397
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,010
You're here, Master Bao? It's all set for you.

398
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,370
That works! You may leave.

399
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,050
Er Gou, put the guqin there.

400
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,400
Xiao Bao, Xiao Bao.

401
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,390
If I were a girl, I'd love you to death.

402
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,890
I think this food is pretty good.

403
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,730
Nice, nice.

404
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,690
Xiao Bao, what are you doing?

405
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,330
How is it? This is the surprise I prepared especially for you.

406
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,240
Over there is also the present I prepared for you.

407
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,040
I specially picked this guqin out for you.

408
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,870
Do you like it?

409
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,000
I haven't played the guqin in such a long time.

410
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,500
If you are willing to play it for me,

411
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,890
I'm willing to listen for my entire life.

412
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,890
Xiao Bao!

413
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,390
Why are you here, too?

414
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,080
What are you here for?

415
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,790
Why are you here? What are you doing?

416
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,550
I made this set of dishes!

417
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,830
I invited you here, so what do you think I'm here for?

418
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,450
Oh no, if Nan Xiang finds out,

419
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,290
I'll fall short of success by just a little bit.

420
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,420
Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao, speak nicely to Nan Xiang.

421
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,110
In order to make these dishes, Nan Xiang spent all morning in the kitchen.

422
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:11,970
Nan Xiang, Xiao Bao called me over to play the guqin for your celebration.

423
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Right, Xiao Bao?

424
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,260
I guess so.

425
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,560
- I guess so.
- Really?

426
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,090
Yes.

427
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,550
Here! Come on, Xiao Bao.

428
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,360
Have a seat.

429
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,300
Look, I made all of these especially for you.

430
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,720
I know you like to eat spicy and numbing foods,

431
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,560
so I specifically added some extra for you. Come on.

432
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,480
Try it.

433
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,620
How is it?

434
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,600
It's good, amazing.

435
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,910
Have you discovered...

436
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,650
that I, Nan Xiang,

437
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,440
am also a gentle and beautiful woman?

438
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,560
So beautiful.

439
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,750
Then... do you want me to

440
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,720
cook for you for your whole life?

441
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,640
What's so great to watch about the guqin?

442
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,250
N-Nan Xiang, since Xiao Bao likes to hear the guqin,

443
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,770
how about if I teach you how to play?

444
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,360
Really?

445
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,740
This guqin is indeed pretty good.

446
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,900
In the future, I'll teach you how to play and you can play for Xiao Bao.

447
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,700
Sure.

448
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,160
I don't like to hear the guqin! It sounds terrible!

449
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,860
Xiao Bao, what's wrong?

450
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,040
Do you want to push Nan Xiang to me that badly?

451
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,020
Xiao Bao!

452
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,060
Since Xiao Bao doesn't like to hear the guqin, then I won't learn it anymore.

453
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,110
Xiao Bao!

454
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,880
Don't spill my wine!

455
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,060
Look at the situation! Yet you're still preoccupied with your wine?

456
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,670
Did you say that we bandits were hateful?

457
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,690
Your-Your-Your daughter is even more hateful than bandits!

458
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,490
You regret it now? Then, you should've thought about this day when you stole her up to the mountain.

459
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,390
It's all your fault! If it weren't for your gambling debts,

460
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,340
would I have had to endure this?

461
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,290
Come here. Sit. Be good. Listen to me.

462
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,520
Bao, listen to me.

463
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,920
In these past few days in the fort, I have been continuously pondering life.

464
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,250
I've concluded that people

465
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,650
can be divided as having good and bad luck.

466
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,890
However, what's the most important thing about a person? Being happy.

467
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,100
You damn old geezer! Stop spewing nonsense at me!

468
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,610
You see, this is what they mean when they say that lonely happiness

469
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,820
is not as happy as group happiness.

470
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,000
Can you say something I can understand?

471
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,400
You're a child unwilling to be educated! Serves you right.

472
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,600
Fine.

473
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,800
You... You can stay here until the day you die!

474
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,000
Stupid old geezer.

475
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,200
Wait!

476
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,300
What is it this time?

477
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,800
A few days ago... did you go apple picking with Nan Xiang?

478
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,400
Yes, why?

479
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,000
"Why?" My daughter got jealous!

480
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,200
She was jealous?

481
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,400
Really truly?

482
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,600
Did she really get jealous, Father-in-Law? You aren't lying to me, are you?

483
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
She's my daughter.

484
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
No one understands a daughter more than a father does.

485
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,000
Would I lie to you?

486
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,200
You wooden-brained one! Why don't you hurry and go?

487
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
Thank you, Father-in-Law!

488
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,060
Remember to bring me two tubs of wine!

489
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Wanzi!

490
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,600
What is it?

491
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,680
Tell me.

492
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,620
Do you dislike me interacting with Nan Xiang?

493
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,800
Who... did you hear that from?

494
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,700
I...

495
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I-I... tried to win Nan Xiang's affections because I wanted to be friends with her.

496
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
That was my own choice.

497
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,600
You don't have to feel wronged and cooperate.

498
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,000
I don't feel wronged!

499
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,800
I'm happy, I'm willing to!

500
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,200
I'll do whatever you want me to!

501
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,400
Okay, okay. What happened today should stop here.

502
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,800
No, it can't.

503
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Right, the guqin.

504
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,100
I'll go and fix the guqin and bring it back to you when I'm done.

505
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,600
What am I doing?

506
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,000
Although he looks aloof all day, has a rotten temper,

507
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and likes to lecture others,

508
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
he's actually just like the Night-Spirited Hero.

509
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,700
Likes to protect people.

510
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,400
Is something wrong? Do you not feel good?

511
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,600
It's... It's just a bit stuffy.

512
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,200
Do you want me to bring you out to the streets for some fresh air?

513
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,800
No need.

514
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,200
I'll go to the garden on my own. I'll go right now.

515
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,200
No matter how nice he is, it has nothing to do with me.

516
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,400
Qiao Yun is right. Xiao Wanzi, don't forget your status and seek something impossible!
(T/N: Literally, "don't be a toad hoping to eat swan meat")

517
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Stay further away from him!

518
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,800
♫ Fingertips brushing, you ask me,
"Whom does your heart cling to?"♫

519
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:34,000
♫ The moon stains the night with spots of light ♫

520
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,200
♫ No regrets as my heart loves ♫

♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

522
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:19,200
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

523
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:27,600
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

524
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,000
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

525
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,200
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

526
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,200
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

527
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:49,300
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

528
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,900
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

529

♫ My treasured memories ♫

530

♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

531
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,500
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

532
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,400
♫ It's me missing you ♫

533
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:17,200
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

534
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,200
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

535
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:43,600
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

536
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:51,000
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

537
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,300
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

538
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,000
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

539

♫ My treasured memories ♫

540

♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫
