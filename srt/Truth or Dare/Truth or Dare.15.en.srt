[Imposter Night-Spirited Hero]

3
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,700
Young Master, have you heard the news?

4
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,400
Someone is purposefully sabotaging the Night-Spirited Hero's reputation.

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,000
The wretched Salt Gang.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,400
They've actually dared to use such underhanded methods to force you out.

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,100
Young Master, we have found out that the Salt Gang and Green Dragon Fort have been colluding.

8
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,400
You must be careful.

9
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,900
This is so detestable.

10
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go and capture the bastard impersonating the Night-Spirited Hero now!

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,400
There's no rush. The person only burned the shop. He did not destroy it.

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,000
He broke into the brothel but didn't commit rape or steal money.

13
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,500
He hasn't done anything truly evil. This does not seem to be the style of the Salt Gang.

14
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,600
Unless...

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,500
Brother Li, let's go to the restaurant in front to talk.

16
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,800
All right.

17
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,600
Night-Spirited Hero, Night-Spirited Hero.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Now, I will arrange for the crime of toying with a woman of decent stature to be committed in your name.

19
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,400
It shouldn't be anymore farther. Just a bit further.

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,600
- Let's go! Let's hurry and try it.
- Sure.

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
How come there are only men?

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,500
Surely I can't toy with a man!

23
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,600
Young Lady, I'm coming!

24
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,100
You're right! I'm the Night-Spirited Hero!

25
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,500
Young Lady, where are you going?

26
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you need me to escort you?

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,200
No! No!

28
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,900
Don't be afraid! How about I accompany you for a drink?

29
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,200
Her stomach! Turns out she has a baby.

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
A-Are you all right?

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,600
I'm afraid I'm about to give birth.

32
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,400
You're giving birth?

33
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,100
Then, where are your family members?

34
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,000
Where's your husband?

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,700
Wake up!

36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
She's still breathing.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
What havoc! I originally planned on harassing her,

38
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,500
but who knew it would cause a child to come forth!

39
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
Never mind, never mind. I'm not dealing with this.

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,700
Her family should be nearby.

41
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,700
Goodness!

42
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,500
Let's come to an agreement beforehand! When the time comes, don't say the baby is mine!

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,400
Physician!

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,000
She's giving birth! She's about to give birth!

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,300
You! Hurry and call a midwife!

46
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,000
- Hurry!
- Come here.

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,200
Use strength!

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
You can do it! You can do it!

49
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Who are you?

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
- Who are you?
- Use strength!

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm her husband! Who are you?

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
I— You're her husband, yet you allowed her to run around outside by herself!

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,200
Are you worthy at all!

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,000
My wife just came back from her hometown.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,800
I was waiting for her at the city gates, but she never came.

56
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Only later did I know she was sent here.

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
So I rushed over. What are you doing here?

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,500
I— Y-You, you, you—

59
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,000
- Dear, you can do it!
- Dear! You can do it!

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
- You can do it!
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
- Keep pushing, dear!
- You can do it!

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,600
- You can do it!
- You can do it, dear!

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
She gave birth! She gave birth! She gave birth to a chubby little boy!

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Thank goodness you brought her here in time! Both mother and child are safe!

65
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,200
- Congratulations! Congratulations!
- Congratulations.

66
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,300
- Hurry over.
- Yes.

67
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
Er Gou.

68
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
- Hey!
- Hurry, hurry.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,800
- Master Bao!
- Master Bao!

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Tonight, I'll add in a meal for you. I'm paying!

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
- Thanks, Master Bao!
- Thanks, Master Bao!

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,400
Master Bao, you seem to be in a good mood today. Did something good happen?

73
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
- True, Master Bao!
- You must've won money!

74
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,800
- Of course.
- Of course.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
You haven't done anything proper!

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Each one of you is so vulgar.

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,600
Vul— What?

78
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,600
You wouldn't understand even if I explained. Enough. Go gamble.

79
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Then again, in the future, leave me out of low-grade games

80
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
- such as drinking and betting.
- What?

81
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,800
- Wait! What's with him?
- What's he saying?

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,200
- Vul— What?
- What?

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,400
Wanzi! Let me tell you!

84
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
Where did she go?

85
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,400
Wanzi!

86
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Why are you here? I spent a long time looking for you.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,300
Guess! What I did today?

88
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,000
You have the nerve to gloat even after doing something bad.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Look at those words of yours!

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,400
The Night-Spirited Hero isn't the only one in the world who can be chivalrous.

91
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,700
I, Master Bao, also know how to.

92
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,800
You're being chivalrous?

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
That's right, I am.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
Fine then! Tell me what you've done.

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Then, if I tell you,

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,200
do I get any reward?

97
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,600
Don't tell me if you aren't planning to. You're deliberately selling suspense.

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,300
I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I'll tell you. All right?

99
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,200
Today, I saved a pregnant woman.

100
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,600
Then, she gave birth to a chubby little boy.

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,300
When she was in labor, I was surprisingly also anxious.

102
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,800
Later, when the baby was born,

103
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,400
I was even happier than I would've been if I'd won money!

104
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,600
In the end, after I saw the chubby baby boy

105
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,000
and witnessed the happiness of the parents,

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,800
I felt so wonderful inside!

107
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
That means you're this child's savior.

108
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,100
Exactly! If it weren't for me, that baby wouldn't have been in the picture!

109
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll let you know, you didn't see it!

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,200
His father was both bowing and thanking me.

111
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,000
In my heart, it felt so sweet.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Sweeter than eating honey!

113
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,200
In the future, you can do things like this every day and feel sweeter than honey!

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,400
No wonder the Night-Spirited Hero likes doing good deeds so much!

115
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,100
So, doing good deeds feels like this.

116
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,600
- This shows that you're also a very kind person deep down.
- Really?

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,200
Then... is that a good thing or a bad thing?

118
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,800
Of course, it's good. I don't like bad guys.

119
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
Then...

120
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,400
If I do more good deeds,

121
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,200
will you like me, too?

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
I'm going to pick flowers.

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm changing my future plans! I won't do bad deeds anymore,

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
I'll do good deeds every day! I'll do even more good deeds

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,200
than the Night-Spirited Hero!

126
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,600
I hope you will take advantage of this turning point and reconsider the distinct paths of good and evil.

127
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Ask your heart which path you should choose for your future.

128
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,470
I've already waited around all day.

129
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,340
Why is doing a good deed so hard?

130
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,330
- Don't run away!
- Let me go!

131
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,830
- Let go!
- Don't leave!

132
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,210
- Don't leave!
- A robbery?

133
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,490
- Let go! Let go!
- You're not allowed to leave!

134
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,500
Miss, are you all right?

135
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,850
Who allowed you to hit him? Who allowed you to hit him?

136
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,170
Husband, are you all right? Husband?

137
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,160
- I'm fine.
- He's your husband?

138
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,540
Then, why were you trying to steal her bag?

139
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,750
My wife and I were arguing because she insisted on returning to her hometown in the middle of the night.

140
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,640
I was afraid it'd be dangerous at night, so I rushed over to bring her back.

141
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,940
Fine, fine, fine.

142
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,170
I'm using my identity as the Night-Spirited Hero to demand you

143
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,980
to never push and pull with a woman again, not even your wife.

144
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,380
- Got it?
- Yes, yes.

145
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,930
Dear, I'm sorry.

146
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,050
Let's go back, come on.

147
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,410
You're the Night-Spirited Hero, right?

148
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,050
- Thank you, you're a good person.
- Oh my!

149
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,620
You're very welcome. Have a safe trip back.

150
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,920
Treat your wife well! Treat her better!

151
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,190
I'm really a good person now.

152
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,540
Night... Night-Spirited Hero?

153
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,580
Night-Spirited Hero?

154
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,800
That's me, that's me.

155
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,890
Well, I saw that you were still doing your laundry in the middle of the night

156
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,170
with your daugh... granddaughter.

157
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,590
Go rest now. Go to bed.

158
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,360
- I'll wash the rest.
- Goodness.

159
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,420
The Night-Spirited Hero is helping me do laundry.

160
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,730
I thank you very much.

161
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,220
Fear not, fear not.

162
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,530
Don't worry, I've found it!

163
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,050
Night-Spirited Hero, thank you! I look up to you so much!

164
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,070
I've heard that recently, the Night-Spirited Hero has done many good deeds!

165
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,980
Lots of people have received his help!

166
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,430
Exactly, exactly! The donkey that I lost was found by him!

167
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,900
Well, that's new!

168
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,640
Everyone knows that the Night-Spirited Hero was causing trouble all around lately.

169
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,020
What? Has he changed all of a sudden?

170
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,390
- Perhaps he discovered a conscience.
- True.

171
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,620
- How interesting.
- Wow, the Night-Spirited Hero is amazing.

172
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,530
When I grow up, I want to be him.

173
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,330
If you want to be the Night-Spirited Hero, then I do, too.

174
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,890
The Night-Spirited Hero is so amazing; he's a grand hero!

175
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,540
Let me see it, too.

176
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,860
These little kids have great taste.

177

[Chivalrous Hero becomes Night-Spirited Hero]

178
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,190
Ridiculous! The Night-Spirited Hero is the one-and-only superhero,

179
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,530
how could a random person replace him? How could that be?

180
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,780
You're so angry.

181
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,830
This isn't bad news.

182
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,660
Wasn't the Night-Spirited Hero's original intention to eradicate evil and bring peace?

183
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,300
No matter who they are or what their motives are,

184
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,920
as long as they're using the Night-Spirited Hero's name to do good things, I don't have a problem with it.

185
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,230
Still, it's unacceptable.

186
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,570
In my heart, the Night-Spirited Hero is irreplaceable.

187
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,840
What are you laughing about?

188
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,360
- D-Did I laugh?
- You did.

189
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,950
Which eye of yours saw that?

190
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,960
I saw it with both eyes!

191
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,030
I'm returning this to you.

192
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,760
Seriously, this fake Night-Spirited Hero.

193
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,550
I must find a way to teach him a lesson!

194
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,160
I don't want to live anymore!

195
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,850
I'd rather die

196
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,560
than be sold to a brothel!
[South Gate]

197
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,300
Instead of being sold to a brothel,

198
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,430
it'd be better for me to jump down from here!

199
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,260
I'm going to jump. I'm going to seek death now!

200
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,690
I don't want to live anymore! I don't want to live!

201
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,990
I want to die!

202
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,440
I'm about to jump!

203
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,930
Why hasn't he come, yet?

204
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,710
I've yelled for so long.

205
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,790
I feel so wronged!

206
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,190
What are your grievances?

207
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,430
My-- My life is hard.

208
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,320
My father sold me to a drunkard.

209
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,400
He both beats and insults me every day.

210
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,640
Now, he's even selling me to a brothel.

211
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,930
It'd be better for me to die.

212
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,900
Instead of being sold to a brothel,

213
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,030
it would be better for me to jump from here right now!

214
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,660
I'm going to jump!

215
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,630
Aren't you going to save me?

216
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,430
Jump.

217
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,340
Wait...

218
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,950
Do you have any—

219
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,720
Thank you.

220
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,700
However.

221
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,920
Although my falling off the city wall was beyond expectation,

222
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,740
it's still considered an accident.

223
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,860
- I—
- Don't worry, I won't do anything to you.

224
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,120
After all, I'm a good person. However...

225
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,460
I-I'm the Night-Spirited Hero. I am!

226
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,850
Of course, I know you're the fake Night-Spirited Hero!

227
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,990
It's me. It's me!

228
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,180
- Why is it you?
- Of course, it's me!

229
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,090
What are you here for?

230
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,360
I came to see what nonsense you were up to!

231
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,900
Then, when you inhaled this smoke just now, did you feel any sort of dizziness?

232
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,260
How could this tiny trick of yours cause me to fall in dizziness?

233
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,580
Wait! Where did you get this from?

234
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,970
I wanted to use this smoke

235
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,870
to teach that impostor Night-Spirited Hero a lesson.

236
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,010
I'm not lecturing you.

237
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,910
But with your three-legged cat martial skills, how could you catch him?

238
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,620
How are my skills comparable to a three-legged cat? I'm so strong!

239
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,520
Just with that tiny bit of—

240
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,080
How exactly have you been handling things?

241
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,650
How long has it been?

242
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,240
We haven't so much as seen the Night-Spirited Hero's shadow!

243
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,560
Godfather, I'm almost there.

244
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,910
I've already found his vulnerable point!

245
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,320
You don't even know how many ideas I formulated just to capture him.

246
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,360
But now I've found an ingenious method!

247
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,690
Ingenious, my ass!

248
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,240
The Salt Gang is out of patience from waiting already.

249
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,680
What they've given us is pure gold and silver.

250
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,570
Are you trying to make me return it?

251
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,500
Godfather, just give me a little more time.

252
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,710
I promise I'll capture him as soon as possible.

253
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,200
Then, hurry!

254
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,390
The method doesn't matter!

255
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,720
For the time being,

256
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,850
I'll be out.

257
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,620
I hope that when I return,

258
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,520
this will have already been settled.

259
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,510
If you can't catch the Night-Spirited Hero,

260
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,820
don't even think about

261
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,910
what you begged me for!

262
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,870
Godfather, don't worry!

263
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,490
I'll capture the Night-Spirited Hero as soon as possible!

264
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,500
Xiao Bao, what's wrong?

265
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,790
If I can't capture the Night-Spirited Hero this time,

266
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,020
I won't be able to protect you.

267
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,590
However, don't worry. You're safe for now.

268
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,320
My godfather is going to leave the fort for a while.

269
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,190
You don't have to pretend and ruin your appearance.

270
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,680
Are you seriously going to capture the Night-Spirited Hero and bring him back?

271
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,140
Yes.

272
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,950
Xiao Bao, the Night-Spirited Hero is a good person. You can't capture him!

273
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,160
I don't care whether he's good or not.

274
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,640
No matter who it is, not just the Night-Spirited Hero,

275
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,200
in order to save you, even if it's the emperor, I'd capture them and bring them back!

276
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,190
If you're so persistent, I'd rather marry Nan Batian

277
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,450
and spend my whole life in this fort.

278
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,270
Wanzi, why would you say something like this

279
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,900
for someone who has no relation to us?

280
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,940
He used his own strength alone to save so many innocent commoners.

281
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,750
You can't harm him!

282
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,080
I, Xiao Bao, can also be considered a good man.

283
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,190
If the Night-Spirited Hero really is good, he should be captured by me.

284
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,340
This is the only way I can save you.

285
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,880
You can't just confuse the ways of good and evil like this.

286
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,360
Is this really... coming from your heart?

287
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,080
Xiao Bao, you're also a good person.

288
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,510
Doing this won't benefit you in any way.

289
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,140
Can't we just think of other ways to solve my problem?

290
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,480
I've discovered that I really am liking you more and more.

291
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,600
Don't blame me.

292
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,480
In order to save you, I must do this.

293
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,510
My ankle hurts so much, I've twisted it!

294
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,920
Is there any kind-hearted person who can help me?

295
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,520
Miss, I'm the Night-Spirited Hero.

296
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,530
May I ask if you require help?

297
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,030
Kind-hearted person,

298
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,460
I've twisted my ankle. Could you bring me home?

299
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,660
- Of course, let's go.
- Thank you.

300
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,630
How come after doing many good deeds,

301
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,280
I think doing bad things is so hard?

302
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,790
Where should I go to find Night-Spirited Hero?

303
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,710
My ankle hurts so much!

304
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,490
My ankle hurts so much!

305
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,430
Is there any kind-hearted person who can help me?

306
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,670
How come I'm being forced to do something good again?

307
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,510
Save me!

308
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,490
- Save—
- Miss, I'm the Night-Spirited Hero. May I ask if you require help?

309
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,830
Kind-hearted person, I've twisted my ankle.

310
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,160
May I ask if you can bring me home?

311
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,410
Of course, let's go.

312
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,840
What are you doing?

313
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,030
Wait a moment.

314
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,600
Why do you look so familiar to me?

315
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,570
I'm not familiar, not familiar. You've never seen me--

316
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,290
Stop right there!

317
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,520
Now, I know who you are.

318
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,690
Isn't this the princess who married into the General's Manor?

319
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,920
Tell me! Who sent you?

320
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,480
- I don't know, I don't know!
- Let her go!

321
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,590
Night-Spirited Hero, save me!

322
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,550
Save me. Save me.

323
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,270
Night-Spirited Hero?

324
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,040
Long time no see.

325
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,470
If you want to impersonate me, you don't need to put on

326
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,750
a woman's foot binding cloth. Don't think that you can be the Night-Spirited Hero just by wearing a mask.

327
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,630
Exactly.

328
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,690
You know nothing! This is called having taste.

329
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,520
No one cares about trivial things.

330
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,720
I want to see your true character.

331
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,910
Xiao Wanzi!

332
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,300
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted
My treasured memories ♫

333
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:04,400
♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

334
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:12,010
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall
It's me missing you♫

335
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,650
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

336
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,740
Are you all right?

337
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,220
Well, don't overthink it. Earlier, it was an emergency situation.

338
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,300
- I was forced to. I had no other choice—
- Who's overthinking?

339
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,530
You're the one overthinking.

340
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,320
- Listen to me!
- Don't follow me.

341
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,250
Siheng, come here for a second.

342
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,510
Miss Qiao Yun, what is your command?

343
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,580
Well, where did Princess and Prince Consort go?

344
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,340
It's so late and they're still not back, yet.

345
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,810
I don't know.

346
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,390
You're Prince Consort's vice-general, how could you not know?

347
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:59,500
Naturally, Young Master will tell me what I should know.

348
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,080
Also, have you noticed that recently, Princess and Prince Consort

349
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,620
have been mysterious lately?

350
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,990
I don't ask a single question about what I shouldn't know.

351
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,050
All right, it's fine now. Go now, it's fine.

352
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,240
Miss Qiao Yun, don't worry. Young Master will definitely protect the princess.

353
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,410
I'll also... protect all of you in the manor.

354
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,120
Master Siheng, Young Master is looking for you.

355
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,640
I know it now.

356
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,720
Young Master, you asked for me?

357
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,200
It's fine, the princess and I fell into the water.

358
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,190
Go look for Qiao Yun and get her to prepare two sets of clean clothing for us.

359
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,030
- We'll take a bath. 
- Yes.

360
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,570
What happened?

361
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,810
Here, put this on. Don't get sick.

362
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,410
How could both of you fall into the water at once?

363
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,740
How careless.

364
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,020
Wasn't it all because—

365
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,080
Xiao Wanzi, what happened?

366
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,360
Nothing much. It's just that when I was walking at night, I fell into the river by accident.

367
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,920
Are you hiding something from me?

368
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,730
How is that possible?

369
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,010
- That's enough. Leave now. I'm going to go to sleep.
- You—

370
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,900
Leave.

371
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,350
Prince Consort, the food is ready.

372
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,710
Where's the princess?

373
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,680
She's... She's...

374
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,880
Princess, the food is ready.

375
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,990
- I-I won't be eating. I ate too much for breakfast. You two can eat.
- Hey—

376
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,190
He already said it was a forced circumstance.

377
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,000
There's nothing to be embarrassed about. Don't—

378
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,940
Just because you didn't eat enough food, you won't even walk with your head up?

379
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,570
Then, why didn't you move out of the way?

380
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,690
Why are you avoiding me?

381
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,770
I'm not.

382
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,350
If you're not, why won't you eat properly?

383
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,910
I've already said that I'm not!

384
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,920
Sure, sure, sure. You aren't, but I have something.

385
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,030
What do you have?

386
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:10,910
I have a fault. I kissed you, which was my fault.

387
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,340
What do you mean?

388
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,090
Since this has made you so mad,

389
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,060
I didn't think it through.

390
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,940
What do you mean you didn't think it through?

391
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,360
I'll apologize to you. It won't happen again.

392
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,500
Fine! Those were your words.

393
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,870
You said... You said there won't be a next time, so whoever mentions this matter again is a puppy!

394
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,780
What's wrong, Young Master?

395
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,960
I don't know, either.

396
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,740
It seems like it's my fault. She was so angry!

397
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,590
Now that you mention it, Qiao Yun also acts strangely and ignores me all the time.

398
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,680
And she's even thrown tantrums at me.

399
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,020
Kid, it seems like you've got lots of experience! Explain it to me.

400
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,560
Young Master, don't make fun of me.

401
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,000
But if you trust me, tell me what happened.

402
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,460
I'll help you analyze it.

403
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,300
So that's what happened. You've already seen

404
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,900
what happened after we got back to the manor.

405
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,630
Young Master, the situation that you encountered

406
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,990
is beyond my experiences.

407
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,010
If you dare to laugh, I'll punish you by the military code.

408
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,390
Young Master, I can't tell if you did the right thing or not,

409
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,910
but by apologizing right after kissing her and saying that it would never happen again...

410
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,370
Aren't you being a fickle heartbreaker?

411
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,920
A fickle heartbreaker?

412
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,670
How could I be a fickle heartbreaker? You're spewing nonsense!

413
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,250
Am I that kind of person?

414
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,680
You told me to tell you and now that I have, you're angry.

415
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,860
Young Master, I haven't completed the military task you assigned.

416
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,910
If there's no other instruction, I'm going back to the camp.

417
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,200
I was clearly saving her.

418
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,640
How did I become a fickle heartbreaker?

419
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,440
Princess, are you asleep?

420
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,820
It's over, it's over. Qiao Yun must be here to interrogate me again.

421
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,800
I definitely can't let her know. I'd best pretend to be asleep.

422
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,010
I'll hide from what I can.

423
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,340
Princess, are you asleep?

424
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,450
You didn't eat and you're even sleeping in the daytime.

425
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,990
Are you sick?

426
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,290
She's still not leaving?

427
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,120
Is it because my acting isn't realistic enough?

428
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,970
Then, you rest well. I won't bother you anymore?

429
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,370
Have you fallen for Prince Consort?

430
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,800
You-- Wait! W-What are you talking about?

431
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,380
How could I like him?

432
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,200
He's so stupid. I hate him.

433
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,400
Why are you being so abnormal then?

434
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,790
Last night, what exactly happened?

435
