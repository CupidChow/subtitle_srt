No. This isn't a matter of taking a risk.

00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,360
- Listen to me. I have to do this.
- Uncle He.
- Otherwise, neither one of us can leave.

6
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,140
- Uncle He, listen to me—
- Stop right there!

7
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,140
You damn Boulder-Shattering Chest.

8
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,880
Turns out you've always wanted to run away.

9
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,930
Move aside.

10
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,080
To think I have been treating you as my friend

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,130
and trusting your words.

12
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,020
Turns out you've been lying and using me this whole time as if I were a fool!

13
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,730
- I'm sorry Nan Xiang.
- Let me warn you. If you want to treat me as a fool—
- Nan Xiang!

14
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,780
What exactly are you trying to do?

15
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,830
Xiao Bao, she's been lying to us the whole time.

16
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,750
She has wanted to run away this whole time.

17
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,650
She coaxed me into treating her well,

18
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,280
tricked you into marrying her,

19
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,970
and she even wants to steal my dad's map! Liar!

20
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,780
Nan Xiang, I'm warning, stop spouting nonsense.

21
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,250
I know what's true, okay?

22
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,080
Xiao Bao,

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,150
you'd rather believe an outsider than believe me.

24
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,320
Nan Xiang, can you stop causing trouble? So annoying!

25
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,750
Xiao Bao, I do everything for your sake!

26
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,660
Since we were young, I've treated you so well.

27
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,260
Yet for a liar,

28
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,880
you'd rather believe a liar than believe me.

29
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,340
You're even shouting at me.

30
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,800
You liar.

31
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,320
I will find evidence against you for sure.

32
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,380
Just wait. Move!

33
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,170
Are you okay, Father-in-Law?

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,510
You're not hurt, right?

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,280
- Xiao Bao.
- I won't let her hurt you guys.

36
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,420
Wanzi,

37
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,920
can I ask you about something?

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,140
- Go ahead.
- Why exactly did you

39
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,630
steal Godfather's cane?

40
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,690
To find the map.

41
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,880
I want to leave here.

42
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,410
So Nan Xiang wasn't spouting nonsense.

43
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,140
You really want to leave.

44
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,280
Actually, there isn't a map.

45
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,990
If you want to leave here,

46
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,930
you have to get through the formation outside our fort.

47
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,560
You can only leave by figuring out the secret of it.

48
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,780
Of the whole fort, only I,

49
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,960
Nan Xiang, Old Wu, Godfather, and the guide,

50
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,570
the five of us know.

51
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,280
Then that means I can't leave here.

52
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,140
I thought you had already...

53
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,790
- Nevermind.
- Xiao Bao,

54
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,460
- I'm sorry.
- Enough.

55
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,550
No need to say anymore.

56
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,090
It's very normal to want to leave here. That's perfectly justified.

57
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,790
I just thought that after such a long time,

58
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,730
you'd already gotten used to being here,

59
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,590
gotten used to me.

60
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,720
Xiao Bao, I actually want to leave here because

61
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,420
I really, really don't want you to be in danger for me again.

62
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,770
I also don't want you to be controlled by Nan Batian, making you have to go capture Night-Spirited Hero.

63
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,290
I hope for you to get back on the right path and escape this life sooner.

64
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,810
Everything I'm saying is from my heart,

65
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,870
nothing is a lie.

66
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,240

some things are not as simple as you think.

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,980
I only believe what I see.

70
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,830
I know what kind of person you are.

71
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,720
I also know

72
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,240
that you're the person I like most in this world.

73
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,550
Xiao Bao, do you know?

74
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,270
I really, really wish

75
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,040
that we could have met

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,340

77
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,770
I really wish for that.

This is you, Young Master. You can tell just from one glance.

You think... this looks like me?

82
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,960
Look at this nose. It's obviously you.

83
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,120
Now that you mention it, it really does look like me.

What are you up to?

91
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,510
All these are ledgers that I stole from Older Brother Situ.

92
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,740
Hurry and look

93
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,130
to see whether they're really related to the sales of contraband salt.

94
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,100
Lest your suspicions.

95
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,680
Don't you believe in your Older Brother Situ?

96
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,270
How come you're stealing ledgers?

97
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,550
I'm tired of you nagging me all the time.

98
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,010
In any case, I took great pains to carry all these here. Look carefully.

99
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,960
Did you do this because you saw something?

100
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,970
How did you know?

101
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,470
It's that... contraband salt gang's leader. Do you still remember him?

102
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,280
I saw him meet with Older Brother Situ.

103
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,880
You're still calling him "Older Brother Situ"?

104

Situ Lin, all right?

105
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,800
I also hope that Old Brother S— No, Situ Lin, is innocent.

Besides, I believe that he is definitely innocent.

107

As the chief of the merchants guild, he must know people who do legitimate business as well as those who do illegal business.

108

If he really is involved,

109
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,160
then you doing this will only alert the enemy.

Promise me there's no next time.

Why must you treat it so seriously?

Aren't you going to promise me?

115

I promise that I'll not dare do it again.

116

If there's a next time, I won't feed you good food.

That's too cruel!

- I don't believe you.
- I— I believe myself.

Fine, fine. I promise. I promise.

120

Look at them quickly.

I still have to return them soon.

122
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,790
No need for you to return them. I'll take care of them.

123
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,190
That won't do.

124
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,960
These ledgers need to be put back in their original places.

125

Only I can go. If you go, you'll give us away.

I didn't expect you to be so meticulous, Xiao Wanzi.

127
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,000
All right. Hurry and look at them. I'll come and get them later.

128
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,430
Young Master, what is your order?

129
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,230
Relay this to A'Rou immediately. Tell her that I recently acquired a zither, calligraphy, and painting.

130
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,250
Invite her over to appreciate them.

131
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,910
Yes.

132
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,070
Normally, you can't even get a glimpse of her shadow. Yet, the moment she's back, she wants to eat.

133
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,590
Xiao Wanzi is getting out of hand.

134
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,340
It's already great that she's willing to stay and pretend to be the princess.

135
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,420
What else can we ask for?

136
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,970
This way, please, Miss A'Rou.

Why is the woman from Ruyi Restaurant here?

139
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,140
The Prince Consort must be doing whatever he likes because the princess is not here.

140
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,890
What do we do then? It's not like we can chase her away.

What are you here for, Miss A'Rou?

144
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,640
Young Master acquired a zither, calligraphy, and painting and asked Miss A'Rou to look at them together.

145
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,020
Young Master is still waiting.

146
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,070
If there's nothing else, we'll get going.

147
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,340
Then, you should hurry.

148
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,290
Remember to take Miss A'Rou back early.

149
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,010
Or else, it won't be good if the general finds out.

150
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,840
Thanks for the reminder, Miss Qiao Yun.

151

Come on, Princess.

155
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,120
What serious thing has happened?

156
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,520
Where are my pastries?

157
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,590
You're still thinking of food?

158
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,420
That prince consort has brought Miss A'Rou here in the manor.

159
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,150
The two are playing the zither and chatting in the study.

160
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,350
As a fake princess, I can't do anything about the prince consort.

161
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,930
Why can't you do anything?

162

Now, she's even been brought home.

Then, isn't he going to marry that A'Rou in the future?

170
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,480
He must have had A'Rou come to the manor to discuss the contraband salt matter.

That's a big problem.

Think about it. The gains from selling salt are very profitable.

Why would Situ Lin not do such a profitable business?

Furthermore, he's the chief of the Qingzhou Merchant Guild.

320
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,620
I brought midnight snacks for you.

321
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,260
Let's go.

322
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,000
Xiao Bao, what are you looking for?

323
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,320
I think I saw Nan Xiang come in here earlier.

324
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,550
I suspect she might've stolen something.

325
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,380
No way. You must've seen wrong.

326
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,270
Your eyes were blurred.

327
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,150
I still think something is not right.

328
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,030
No way. Why would Nan Xiang come to my room?

329
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,140
That's true.

330
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,930
Wanzi, hurry and taste the food I brought you.

331
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,470
Okay.

332
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,830
It smells so good.

333
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,390
What's wrong, Xiao Bao?

334
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,740
Xiao Bao!

335
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,140
This is not good. He's been poisoned. We need to hurry and find the antidote.

336
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,260
Or else, his life will be in danger.

337
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,120
Poisoned?

338
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,610
Where do I go to find the antidote?

339
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,200
Brother Six, it had to be Nan Xiang. It had to be.

340
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,410
I'll go find her now.

341
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,240
Considering the time,

342
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,570
the poison should have already taken effect.

343
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,000
I've finally gotten rid of her. I'm exhausted.

344
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,570
Nan Xiang.

345
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,230
You— W-Why are you here?

346
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,540
Where's the antidote?

347
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,160
What antidote? I don't know.

348
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,010
I'm only able to stand here in one piece is because Xiao Bao got poisoned on my behalf.

349
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,910
Xiao Bao?

350
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,010
Where are you going?

351
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,160
Xiao Bao! Xiao Bao!

352
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,230
You, go away!

353
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,890
Xiao Bao.

354
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,230
Xiao Bao, are you okay?

355
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,290
Xiao Bao, I'm sorry.

356
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,420
I didn't do it on purpose. I didn't want to kill you.

357
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,320
I merely wanted to kill this boulder-shattering person.

358
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,680
Nan Xiang, hurry and get the antidote. If not, he'll really die.

359
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,710
Antidote. Where is it?

360
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,900
I don't have it.

361
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,280
Nan Xiang...

362
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:50,120
Why do you insist on not getting along with Xiao Wanzi?

363
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,530
Xiao Bao,

364
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,400
you're about to die,

365
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,930
yet you're still protecting her?

366
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,100
Xiao Bao.
- Nan Xiang.
- Don't speak to me.

367
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,560
As long as you get the antidote,

368
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,040
I will do anything you want me to.

369
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,410
Will you agree to do anything I say?

370
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,450
Fine.

371
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,600
As long as Xiao Bao agrees to marry me,

372
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,120
I'll give him the antidote.

373
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,150
Xiao Bao,

374
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,510
as long as you agree to marry me,

375
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,110
I'll give you the antidote immediately.

376
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,770
Xiao Bao,

377
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,130
as long as you are willing,

378
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,340
I'll give you the antidote immediately. All right?

379
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,250
Xiao Bao.

380
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,180
Xiao Bao.

381
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:19,370
I will only marry Xiao Wanzi.

382
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,460
Xiao Bao.

383
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,390
Turns out you hate me that much.

384
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,980
Xiao Bao.

385
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,960
Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao.

386
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,600
As long as you're okay, as long as she can save you,

387
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,900
I can do anything. You can't die, Xiao Bao.

388
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,170
Silly girl.

389
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,320
Xiao Bao.

390
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,400
I'm fine. Don't cry.

391
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,380
The increase in the price of salt has resulted in inflation of commodity goods.

392
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,490
The cost for the restaurant has increased.

393
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,090
If we don't increase our prices, our profits for next month will be even less.

394
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,530
From what I see, the sales of wine are not bad.

395
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,700
How about you two continue working and I'll go outside for some air?

396
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,640
Don't go far. I'll be done soon.

397
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,480
How is the investigation into Situ Lin's affairs going?

398
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,650
Situ Lin is usually very careful.

399
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,790
It is very difficult to investigate his background.

400
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,940
I was only able to find out that he is an orphan.

401
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,580
Since young, he grew up in Qingzhou City.

402
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,640
Ten years ago, he went away to do business.

403
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,730
After getting rich, he returned to Qingzhou City to do business.

404
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,020
He became the chief of the merchant guild very quickly.

405
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,390
Situ Lin is a very suspicious person.

406
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,770
Where did he go ten years ago?

407
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,440
How did he make his first business deal?

408
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,640
We are still investigating.

409
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,720
Buns for sale! Warm and toasty buns!

410
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,770
Buns for sale! Miss, have some buns.

411
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,520
- Let me take a look.
- They are freshly steamed.

412
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,640
Your Highness.

413
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,900
Brother Situ.

414
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,150
What a coincidence.

415
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,210
Such a coincidence.

416
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,610
Master has created new things. Do you want to go take a look at them with me?

417
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,630
I shouldn't. I still have things to do later.

418
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,240
All right, we can go another day.

419
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,860
Then I'll take my leave now.

420
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,620
All right.

421
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,540
Buns! Warm buns!

422
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,820
Buns for sale!

423
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,420
Warm and toasty buns!

424
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,700
Buns for sale!

425
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,670
Wang Biao?

426
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,660
This won't do. I have to tell Brother Situ.

427
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,500
Brother Situ!

428
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,000
- Your Highness?
- Just now, I saw someone following you.

429
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,790
You should be careful.

430
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

431
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:21,260
