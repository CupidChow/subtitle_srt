4
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,670
Where should we go capture bad guys today?

5
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,940
I heard there's a rapist in the eastern part of the city
(T/N: Literally "flower thief")

6
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,400
causing unease for everyone.

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,760
But there's a group of bandits in the western part of the city tyrannizing everything!

8
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,900
Should I go to the east and capture the rapist,

9
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,010
or should I go to the west to teach the bandits a lesson?

10
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,660
These two choices are too difficult!

11
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,000
How should I choose?

12
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,730
Give me a decision.

13
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,020
But bad guys must be captured sooner or later.

14
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,250
If not today, then tomorrow!

15
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,170
Or perhaps right now!

16
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,690
I think we can...!

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,520
How come her anger still hasn't died down?

18
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,590
Does she need to be so angry?

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,240
What should I do?

20
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,050
It's too hard to be a man!

21
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,550
Xiao Wanzi, it's been four hours!

22
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,760
Are you sure someone from the gambling house will come?

23
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,790
They wouldn't lie to me.

24
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,520
They send money to the fort on the first day of every month.

25
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,060
Besides, this is a road they must pass.

26
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,130
- They're coming!
- Pawn off some goods

27
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,320
- and make some money!
- That's right!

28
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,040
We cannot take them by storm. We can only take it by strategy.

29
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,380
Do we have to do this?

30
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,720
Don't worry. I will definitely protect you.

31
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,480
Let's find a good place to celebrate!

32
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,490
- Where should we go?
- Anywhere works!

33
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,170
- Look at you!
- Help!

34
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,150
Is there anyone there?

35
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,580
Help!

36
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,540
Is there anyone there?

37
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,560
Help!

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,380
- Not bad!
- Miss, what's wrong?

39
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,020
I twisted my ankle! It hurts so much!

40
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,420
You twisted your ankle? Once I massage it for you,

41
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,760
it won't hurt anymore!

42
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,700
What do you mean, "massage"? She doesn't need a massage right now.

43
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,310
What she wants right now is to be comforted.

44
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,270
Miss, if you've been aggrieved in any way, tell me about it.

45
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,070
- I'll help you resolve things.
- That's right!

46
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,700
I have such a huge grievance!

47
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,810
Miss, be obedient and come back with us.

48
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,510
Or else, don't think of walking out of this forest!

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,430
Why isn't Qiu Hua here yet?

50
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,550
If he continues to not come, I'll use suicide to prove my sincerity!

51
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,670
What are you saying?

52
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,130
I... I said... my foot hurts!

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,880
- Her foot hurts! Let's massage it!
- Massage it!

54
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,440
Her foot hurts!

55
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,410
Let her go!

56
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,100
What?

57
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,750
- Who are you?
- You three scums

58
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,680
are bullying an otherworldly maiden in broad daylight?

59
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,210
You want to die?

60
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,110
Take it easy. Calm down.

61
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,690
Let me tell you. Look at his clothing.

62
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,130
By the looks of it, he has true skill.

63
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,730
We still have things to do!

64
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,180
We still have a box of money behind us!

65
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,940
I'll give you some face today!

66
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,960
Don't let us see you again!

67
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,750
- Let's go!
- See you next time!

68
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,730
Let's go, let's go!

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,990
- Master Wu, we've made you wait.
- Slow down, slow down.

70
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,120
What happened? Did you go to pick wildflowers (pick up girls) again?
- Master Wu.

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,250
- If such a great thing happened, how could we not invite you?
- Right.

72
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,000
Brothers, take the money inside.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,860
Count how much is inside.

74
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,480
Come, let's follow old rules and drink together.

75
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,060
Let's go!

76
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,760
Princess!

77
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
I'm Xiao Wanzi!

78
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,880
- What are you doing here?
- I got here by hiding in the gambling house's cart.

79
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,010
- Let's go talk over there.
- All right.

80
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,510
Xiao Wanzi, I can't wait to escape, so why would you come?

81
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,320
I came to save you and my father!

82
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,410
You risked yourself to come here alone just to save us?

83
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,460
- Thank you for still thinking of me, but I—
- No "buts"!

84
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,280
Let's go first. We'll find my father now.

85
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,470
I'll bring you two out of here.

86
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,950
Xiao Wanzi, I cannot leave yet.

87
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,130
Why not?

88
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,370
Your father... Your father was locked up by Nan Batian.

89
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,280
What?

90
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,600
It was all my fault.

91
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,260
Your father offended Nan Batian's daughter to save me,

92
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,960
and that's the reason he got locked up.

93
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,720
Didn't they say my father is living well in Green Dragon Fort?

94
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,770
Then where is he now? I'll go find him right away.

95
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,550
If you rashly barge into the prison all alone right now, things definitely won't go well. You can't go!

96
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,970
But I can't just wait idly like this.

97
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,990
Wanzi, trust me.

98
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,600
Since I can protect myself, I will definitely protect your father!

99
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,840
Also, my escape plan is about to succeed!

100
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,090
Really? What escape plan?

101
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,870
Boss Yan!

102
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,890
- Master Xiao Bao.
- Let me ask you something.
- What is it?

103
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,400
Do you know who our fort's spy in the Mei Manor is?

104
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,200
It must've been the chief's arrangement.

105
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,700
He is always secretive whenever he does anything.

106
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,110
How could anyone else know?

107
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,290
That's true.

108
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,630
- Fine, let's go drink.
- Let's go.

109
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,340
Isn't this...?

110
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,240
You know him?

111
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,050
The people from the gambling house will be leaving the mountain soon.

112
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,500
Hurry and escape on the cart!

113
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,790
But I haven't seen my father yet.

114
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,650
Wanzi, if you trust me, you'll leave here obediently.

115
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,280
I promise, you'll see your father very soon.

116
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,490
I trust you. Then I'll wait for your good news.

117
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,820
We will definitely make it through this hardship.

118
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,420
Go on!

119
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,690
- We didn't drink to our hearts' content today.
- It's fine, it's fine.

120
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,060
- It was mostly because there were no girls.
- That's right.

121
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,420
It wasn't suitable today, but next time!

122
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,310
Next time, we'll drink to our heart's content!

123
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,090
I have an idea!

124
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,020
- Next time we won't rest until we're drunk!
- This is bad!

125
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,170
What's wrong, Xiao Wanzi?

126
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,420
Master Xiao Bao, he... he has gone missing!

127
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,310
He went missing? When did he go missing?

128
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,990
About... I don't know when he left either,

129
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,460
but he's been gone for about ten hours!

130
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,820
Xiao Bao is in charge of patrolling the mountain today. He will be back at night.

131
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,660
Be good and wait for your Master Xiao Bao.

132
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,900
Let's go!

133
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,180
- Take care, Master Wu, we'll go back today.
- Got it.

134
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,200
- Send my regards to Chi Feng!
- Got it!

135
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,970
- I will come and have drinks with you in a few days!
- Sounds good!

136
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,400
It's already nighttime. Why hasn't Xiao Wanzi come down yet?

137
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,840
Could she have been captured?

138
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,120
Should we go back and find Third Young Master Mei?

139
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,860
Let's wait a little longer.

140
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,150
No, we cannot wait any longer!

141
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,450
- Why don't we—?
- They're here!

142
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,900
Xiao Wanzi, are you okay?

143
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,970
Qiao Yun and Qiu Hua, I'm fine! I'm fine.

144
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,580
Where is the princess? Did you see her?

145
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,480
I already saw her, don't worry. She's very safe right now.

146
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,280
Then... Then, why didn't she come down with you?

147
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,560
That's right! What about your father?

148
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,490
Princess told me to come back first.

149
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,840
She said my father got locked up by the Green Dragon Fort Chief to save her.

150
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,530
She is looking for another chance to escape with him.

151
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,190
How could that work? I... I must find someone to save her!

152
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,090
How can she stay all by herself in the fort? I... I...

153
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,250
Don't panic yet!

154
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,350
The princess told us not to act rashly.

155
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,580
She has already found a way to escape, I'm sure she'll escape soon.

156
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,960
Before that, we should listen to her.

157
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,350
I...!

158
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,380
This has to do with the princess' reputation and integrity. We cannot make a fuss.

159
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,900
Princess is smart and intelligent. I'm sure she'll escape danger.

160
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,920
So let's listen to her for now.

161
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,440
That's right. The princess has always had ideas.

162
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
She should have a plan.

163
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,930
It's getting late. Let's hurry back to the manor.

164
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,300
Otherwise, if we raise suspicions, things will be bad.

165
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,400
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

166
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,140
[Mei Manor]

167
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,740
That way, go that way!

168
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,730
Young Master!

169
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,970
- Did you find her?
- No!

170
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,500
But Miss Qiao Yun is gone, too!

171
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,400
- Go and search the back pavilion, too!
- Qiao Yun!

172
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,840
You people! I always tell you to keep an eye on Young Madam, but you never listen!

173
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,810
If you still can't find her tonight, don't even think of sleeping!

174
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,250
Oh no, have we created trouble?

175
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,850
Yes, I'm getting a bad feeling!

176
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,550
What has happened cannot be avoided.

177
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,850
You two leave first. I'll go alone.

178
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
Who?!

179
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,290
Hi! Were you looking for me?

180
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,030
Tell me.

181
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,840
Where did you go tonight? Be honest.

182
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,630
Are you interrogating a criminal?

183
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,230
I have dignity, all right?

184
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,990
Dignity?

185
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,030
If you want dignity, you have to do something others would respect!

186
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,510
Did you know? You disappeared for a whole night.

187
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,520
In order to find you, the Mei Manor became a huge mess!

188
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,660
I was only gone for a few hours!

189
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,160
Is such a big fuss necessary?

190
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,700
I'm not a two or three-year-old child!

191
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,250
Do you know that your identity is now a princess?

192
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,620
If something happens to you, the entire Mei Manor will be affected!

193
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,600
I was wrong.

194
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,590
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,000
You only know how to apologize, but you never change.

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,900
Tell me. Where did you go?

197
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,130
Did you get hurt?

198
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,720
I'm fine.

199
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,920
Today, I... Today, I met Lu Yingyao.

200
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,260
How did you meet her? Where did you go?

201
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,790
I snuck into the Green Dragon Fort by hiding in the gambling house's money cart.

202
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,930
Then, I saw her.

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,190
Don't get angry yet!

204
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,430
I wanted the princess to come back sooner, but she was the one who made me come back.

205
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,540
She said she had a way to take... to take my father with her in her escape.

206
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,960
My father is at Green Dragon Fort, too.

207
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,500
You're messing around!

208
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,020
I just want the princess to come back sooner!

209
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,220
The one who should be here is her. I shouldn't have appeared here.

210
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,700
You know I care about you!

211
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,240
If you were trapped at Green Dragon Fort, then—

212
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,540
If anything happens to the princess,

213
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,420
the entire Mei Manor will also be in trouble.

214
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,790
Must you speak with me like that?

215
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,490
After so long, are you still unaware of my feelings?

216
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,530
This was all wrong from the start!

217
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,990
I just want things to go back to normal.

218
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,450
Do you know how worried I was about you?

219
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,930
I will take care of everything.

220
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,400
As long as you don't leave me.

221
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,560
But what about the princess?

222
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,600
I will take care of it. Don't interfere.

223
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,120
I also have a huge discovery I haven't told you about yet!

224
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,880
Do you know who I saw at Green Dragon Fort?

225
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,050
Who?

226
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,700
It was that pawnshop owner who escaped.

227
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,990
Him?

228
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,400
You're sure you aren't mistaken?

229
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,370
I took a very strong kick from him.

230
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,950
I'd remember him even if he turned to ash!

231
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,300
So it was him?

232
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,560
That means he has some relationship with Green Dragon Fort.

233
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,420
Then the person who hurt my mother is also related to the Green Dragon Fort?

234
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,730
As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together.

235
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,700
- Their crooked deeds are all intermingled. Trust me, I'll continue to investigate—
- No.

236
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,590
This will stop here.

237
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,690
Leave the rest to me.

238
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,690
This is my investigation!

239
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,860
You're not allowed to sleep tonight.

240
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,560
Your punishment is to write "I will never act on my own accord again" 300 times!

241
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,030
Why is there only a punishment?

242
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,760
I discovered such important news, where's my reward?

243
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,690
A reward? There is.

244
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,210
Why is everyone being so courteous today?

245
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,170
No, Young Madam. We reflected on ourselves yesterday.

246
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,960
We felt that our usual amount of care and attendance to you wasn't enough.

247
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,440
So from now on, we must be more caring towards you!

248
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,800
I think you all are afraid of a certain somebody.

249
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,850
Are you afraid of me?

250
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,110
No, no, no.

251
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,810
- No.
- How could we be afraid of you, Third Young Master?

252
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,240
That's right! You are the kindest person!

253
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,020
That's right!

254
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,200
- Be more natural! Don't make things look so deliberate.
- Yes, yes.

255
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,150
Young Master, Situ Lin is here.

256
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,930
Elder Brother Situ has come? Where is he?

257
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,740
He's in the entrance hall.

258
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,630
- Hurry and follow her!
- Yes! Yes!

259
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,370
Siheng! Am I not charming?

260
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,300
Aside from being more understanding toward others and better at speaking,

261
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,650
Situ Lin doesn't seem to have many strengths.

262
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,120
Are you saying I'm not understanding and don't know how to talk?

263
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,540
That's right. No, no, no.

264
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,020
That's not what I... meant!

265
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,600
Come with me to take a look!

266
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,190
Yes!

267
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,490
Elder Brother Situ, you're here!

268
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,660
Greetings, Your Highness the Princess.

269
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,620
In the future, don't keep calling me "Your Highness." Just call me Xiao—

270
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,320
Princess!

271
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,800
- Third Young Master.
- Why did you call me?

272
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,540
Princess, I came today to give you a rare toy.

273
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,650
What is it?

274
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,060
Take a look.

275
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,930
What is this?

276
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,410
A telescope. How inexperienced.

277
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,270
Third Young Master is indeed full of experience and knowledge. I am presenting in front of an expert.

278
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,010
It's good that you know.

279
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,290
I've never seen one before,

280
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,570
and I've also never heard of anything called a telescope before.

281
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,860
What is this used for?

282
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,040
Princess, do you see the attic over there?

283
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,150
I see it.

284
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,480
Then, what is written on the lintel?

285
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,060
Do you know?

286
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,140
Who can see something that far away?

287
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,780
Let me demonstrate for you to see.

288
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,170
It says "The Star of Prosperity Shines Above."

289
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,720
You can use this... this telescope to see words so far away?

290
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,250
- Yes.
- How mystical!

291
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,910
Give it a try.

292
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,160
Wow! This! Everything in front got closer!

293
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,350
Why is it like a magician's trick?

294
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,020
This is so magical!

295
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,270
It's good that you like it.

296
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,060
I like it! I like it!

297
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,340
What's so great about these cheap tricks? Seriously.

298
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,060
Although it is a cheap trick, within it is hidden

299
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,590
the secret of learning through research.

300
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,870
If I flip it around, this, this...!

301
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:14,080
Everything in front of me got farther away!

302
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,530
If you like it, I'll bring you all the rare toys I find.

303
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,980
Okay! Thank you, Elder Brother Situ!

304
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,230
Do you understand that indulging in trivial matters hinders the will?

305
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,110
How could it be that bad? She's just innocent and pure and playful. That's all.

306
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,720
Brother Situ, this thing is so much fun!

307
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,630
A lot of people must want to buy it. How much can it cost?

308
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,930
It's not expensive. Just twenty taels of silver.

309
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,700
- Twenty taels of silver!
- Profiteer.

310
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,320
Who would buy something this expensive?

311
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,930
You don't know.

312
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,800
This is a rare toy that is passed down among western nobility.

313
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,380
It's really hard to get one!

314
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,930
It seems like your business has expanded a lot.

315
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,400
You flatter me. It's just a small venture.

316
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,570
Brother Situ, why don't I learn how to do business from you?

317
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,220
Oh?

318
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,280
- Nonsense!
- How so? I genuinely want to learn!

319
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,540
You are a princess!

320
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,440
So what?

321
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,270
Since childhood, I knew

322
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,850
I was the one I can rely on the most. I insist on learning!

323
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,690
All right, all right.

324
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,220
Princess, you are indeed not inferior to a man. I admire you.

325
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,840
If you really enjoy it and are interested,

326
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,610
you can come and take a look at my store.

327
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,310
Third Young Master, why don't you come with us?

328
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,200
Take it as playing.

329
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,780
- All right!
- Wonderful!

330
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,930
This toy is worth twenty taels! How many slabs of rock would I have to break to earn that much?

331
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,490
I can make this toy, too!

332
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,100
Doing business is best to earn money!

333
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,750
Princess, please.

334
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,190
Wow!

335
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,100
This is amazing!

336
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,070
What is this?

337
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,600
A tangram?

338
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,060
It's so pretty!

339
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,460
If you like it, I'll gift it to you.

340
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,700
Really? Thank you, Elder Brother Situ!

341
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,290
Wow! Your business is thriving!

342
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,040
My shop is the newest and most complete in Qingzhou.

343
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,780
Naturally, business is better.

344
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,750
The best store in Qingzhou is the Ruyi Restaurant.

345
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,230
That's right. How can a little shop compare with Ruyi Restaurant?

346
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,030
You sure know how to praise yourself.

347
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,250
Then, Elder Brother Situ, do you have any business tricks? Hurry and teach me!

348
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,930
Of course. Take this shop as an example.

349
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,200
Twenty percent of our business is for selling the cheapest items.

350
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,940
Twenty percent is used for income and expenditure and another twenty percent is used to make small but fast profits.

351
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,310
The remaining forty percent are for selling the most expensive items.

352
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,540
It turns out there is a lot to learn in order to do business.

353
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,800
- Is there anything else?
- Also—
- Wait.

354
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,260
Listen! The most important thing for businessmen is to not be anxious to make instant profit.

355
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,240
You must be honest.

356
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,680
Yes, yes, yes.

357
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,760
Everyone's capable of saying those false words. It's much easier said than done.

358
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,460
Boss! Boss!

359
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,510
All right.

360
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,910
Third Young Master and Princess, I still have some matters to take care of.

361
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,190
How about you two go upstairs first? There are clothes and jewelry upstairs.

362
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,000
You will definitely like it.

363
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,860
Bring the best tea leaves to the princess.

364
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,980
- There's no need.
- Thank you, Elder Brother Situ!

365
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,640
Please!

366
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,060
It's been so many days. You must answer me!

367
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,120
Do you like me or not?

368
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,610
I... Hurry and let go of me, there are people here!

369
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,510
You are my wife, what are you afraid of?

370
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:02,610
I... I... I don't know how to answer.

371
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:08,450
Then if you don't answer, I'll take that as a "yes."

372
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,120
You can't do that.

373
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,680
Customers, your tea has been brewed.

374
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,340
Go and tell Chief Situ

375
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,280
that Princess and I have other matters, so we won't bother him. Goodbye.

376
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,760
Hey!

377
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,980
Didn't you want to eat this last time? Why don't we get some more?

378
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,620
Okay!

379
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,720
- I want this mushroom and this chicken!
- All right, all right!

380
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,170
- Boss, give us some more.
- Got it.

381
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,250
Wait a moment.

382
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,970
I left the tangram Situ Lin gave me in his store. I must go back for it.

383
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,410
- I'll go with you.
- No, no, no.

384
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:56,040
Get some more skewers for me. Wait up. I'll be right back.

385
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,170
Boss, give us some more meat skewers.

386
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,960
All right.

387
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Isn't that a contraband salt trafficker?

388
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Was there some misunderstanding along the way?

389
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,600
Is it possible that Elder Brother Situ truly is problematic?

390
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,400
I will tell Third Young Master Mei once I make a clear investigation.

391
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,900
Lest he thinks I'm rash again.

392
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,200
I will definitely create something fun.

393
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I will make a lot of money.

394
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,200
What use is it to make all of these things?

395
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,400
You won't earn much profit from children.

396
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,800
If you really are short on money, let me know. I'll give you some.

397
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
I want to be an independent woman.

398
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,000
I want... I want to work for my own career.

399
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,800
If you really like it, open your own booth.

400
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,400
If you send all of these things to Situ Lin's place, aren't you just using your effort for someone else?

401
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,300
Young Master, Sir Situ is here.

402
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,030
Third Young Master. Princess.

403
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Elder Brother Situ, why are you here?

404
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,400
Princess, I know an artisan who lives in the west of the city.

405
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,000
The weather is not bad today.

406
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,900
Why don't we go pay him a visit?

407
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,900
His place is full of rare and strange things.

408
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,800
I can borrow this opportunity to see

409
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,600
what exactly is going on with Elder Brother Situ.

410
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,200
All right, Brother Situ. Let's go.

411
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Yes. Let's go together.

412
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,300
Young Master, Lord just said he's waiting in the study for you.

413
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,200
Then you go and see Father. I will be fine going by myself.

414
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,800
Don't worry about me. I'm leaving.

415
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Let's go.

416
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,300
Please.

417
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,500
Siheng, keep a very close eye on both of them. Hurry over.

418
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,600
- Yes.
- Go.

419
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,000
Buns. Hot buns.

420
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,200
Look at this bun shop. Eating their meat buns is my favorite.

421
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,000
- Meat filling? I like it.
- I'll treat you to their beef buns later.

422
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,200
- Really? Okay.
- Their beef buns are the tastiest.

423
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,800
This silk goods business... This silk goods business is very impressive.

424
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,000
Is it yours?

425
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,200
It has so many floors. Elder Brother Situ, you're so amazing.

426
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,000
Princess, please.

427
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
- It's this place?
- Yes, this is the place.

428
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,000
Master Jiang?

429
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,300
- Master Jiang?
- Yes.

430
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
- Young Master Situ.
- Master Jiang.

431
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,900
This is a gift for you.

432
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,400
First-grade eaglewood?

433
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,200
How can I come empty-handed when visiting Master?

434
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,000
Let me introduce you.

435
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,500
This is my friend, Lu Yingyao.

436
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,600
- Nice to meet you, Master Jiang.
- Nice to meet you.

437
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,000
This is Master Jiang.

438
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,400
His family has been carpenters for three generations.

439
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,300
There is no craft he doesn't know.

440
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Thank you, Young Master, for your flattery. I don't deserve it.

441
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,400
That's not true.

442
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Master, can I take my friend to look around?

443
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,000
Go ahead. Go ahead.

444
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,400
This way.

445
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,500
These tools are so impressive.

446
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,400
Look at this.

447
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,100
This is so amazing.

448
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,100
And this one.

449
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,000
The birdcage is so beautiful.

450
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
- Isn't it exquisite?
- Yes.

451
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,000
This is incredible.

452
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,100
Master Jiang, did you craft all this?

453
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,200
Yes.

454
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,100
Could you teach me?

455
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,300
Certainly.

456
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,600
- Let's start with something simple. Let's carve a little person.
- All right.

457
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Then I'll show you the mechanics.

458
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,700
Elder Brother Situ, what are you carving?

459
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,000
It's a secret.

460
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Stingy.

461
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,000
I am finished carving.

462
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,400
That fast?

463
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,700
Here. Let me take a look.

464
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,900
What... What did you carve?

465
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,800
A swordsman. A masked swordsman.

466
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,600
Swordsman?

467
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,400
How does this resemble a swordsman?

468
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,000
It's so fat. It's not handsome or carefree at all.

469
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
How is it fat?

470
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,400
How does it not resemble one? It's so handsome and carefree.

471
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,630
Will Third Young Master Mei mind that you came out with me?

472
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,940
He was clearly the one too busy to come here. He can't blame me.

473
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,400
By the way, Elder Brother Situ. I have something to warn you about.

474
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,200
What is it?

475
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,500
The last time I was in your shop,

476
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,600
I bumped into someone,

477
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,600
and found out he was the one who smuggled contraband salt.

478
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,400
So you must be careful.

479
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,200
Smuggled contra...

480
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,800
How did you know he was a bad person smuggling contraband salt?

481
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,800
I saw a portrait of him from Siheng.

482
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,000
They were investigating some salt smuggling case.

483
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,800
Thank you for the warning.

484
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,200
However, the people in my shop are so complicated.

485
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,800
It's so hard to know who it is.

486
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,200
If you see that portrait again, can you let me take a look?

487
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,100
Yes.

488
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,700
Thanks.

489
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,900
Why doesn't Elder Brother Situ seem surprised at all?

490
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,600
It doesn't seem like he knew.

491
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,400
Ginseng.

492
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,600
- What's this?
- Achyranthes.

493
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,000
- Pilose antler?
- Yes, Miss.

494
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Would these many tonics be too many?

495
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,600
Xiao Wanzi gave you five soup recipes.

496
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,400
If you put them all in at once, would something bad happen?

497
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,200
Our Xiao Bao is already losing weight. It must be because he's been practicing his skills.

498
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Add all of these tonics. We have to nourish him well.

499
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,600
Yes, got it.

500
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,400
- Quickly.
- Yes.

501
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,000
Master Wu.

502
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,300
You dare to trust a recipe from Boulder-Shattering Chest?

503
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,200
But that's right. Based on their relationship,

504
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,400
she wouldn't hurt Xiao Bao.

505
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Stew it then.

506
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,600
Wait. Tell me frankly!

507
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
What do you mean by "their relationship"?

508
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Nan Xiang, you're so silly.

509
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,100
You're the silly one.

510
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,000
You don't know yet, do you? Xiao Bao begged Chief,

511
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,200
saying that as long as he can capture the Night-Spirited Hero, he will marry Xiao Wanzi.

512
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,800
Both of them are colluding to deceive you.

513
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,200
They're pretending to be friendly with you, but they honestly just want to take advantage of your identity

514
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,800
to live comfortable lives in the fort.

515
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,400
How could that be possible?

516
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,600
When that Boulder-Shattering one uses you as a pretext,

517
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
which one of our brothers would dare to hurt her?

518
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,400
However, she and Xiao Bao flirt with each other in secret.

519
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,800
Her selfish plot ensures that she doesn't suffer losses from either side.

520
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
If what you said is true,

521
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,700
if she really is that kind of two-faced person,

522
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,300
I, Nan Xiang, will never let her get away with it!

523
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,800
That's why I am giving you a warning.

524
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,600
Don't end up losing completely and have everything become a mess for you.

525
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,800
Where are you going?

526
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,200
Going to settle the score with the Boulder-Shattering woman.

527
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,700
She went to see her father in the prison.

528
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,000
Listen! It's very dangerous for you as a young woman to go to Nan Batian's room.

529
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,200
No, no, no.

530
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
Uncle He.

531
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,800
In order to escape, I have to take that risk.

532
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
No. This isn't a matter of taking a risk. Listen to me. I have to do this.

533
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,600
- Uncle He.
- Otherwise, neither one of us can leave.

534
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,400
- Uncle He, listen to me.
- Stop there!

535
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:46,600
♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

536
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:53,100
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

537
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:01,400
♫ If the painting is beautiful, it's because of you ♫

538
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:08,400
♫ If time turned back, would we meet again? ♫

539
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,200
♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

540
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,200
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

541
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:23,200
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

542
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,800
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

543
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,800
♫ My treasured memories ♫

544

♫ and my simple feelings are difficult to write down ♫

545
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,500
♫ The moon rises as a lonely body; the moon sets as tears fall ♫

546
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,400
♫ It's me missing you ♫

547
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:51,200
♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

548
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:10,200
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

549
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,700
♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

550
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:25,000
♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

551
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,200
♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫

552
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,000
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

553
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,900
♫ My treasured memories ♫
