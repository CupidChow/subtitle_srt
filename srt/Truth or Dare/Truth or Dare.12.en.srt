[A friend in need is a friend in deed]

4
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,140
You again?

5
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,840
Turns out you are in the contraband salt business.

6
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,090
Yeah, you alll are contraband salt dealers.

7
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,080
No wonder you're so skilled at martial arts.

8
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,110
Who are you? Mind your own business.

9
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,190
- Brothers, snatch the goods.
- Got it.

10
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,910
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

11
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,380
The daggers are poisoned.

12
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,240
You didn't expect that, right?

13
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,920
Give me the antidote.

14
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,010
I have the antidote.

15
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,530
But why should I give it to you?

16
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm fine.

17
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,650
This has nothing to do with her. Give me the antidote,

18
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,270
and you can do whatever you want with me.

19
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,960
I can give it to you. But you have to kneel to me.

20
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,580
- I'm fine.
- Wanzi.

21
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,470
- You don't want it? Then I'll smash it.
- No!

22
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,340
- Give it to me.
- Beat him!

23
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,000
No!

24
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,960
Stop!

25
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,620
Stop hitting him!

26
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,820
Stop!

27
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,330
Don't!

28
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,240
You want the antidote? Here you go.

29
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,080
I heard that no one has seen your face.

30
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,530
I shall take a look today.

31
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,500
Kill him!

32
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,060
Be careful.

33
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,410
- Boss!
- Boss, are you all right?

34
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,470
Brothers, retreat!

35
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,050
Let's go. Quickly retreat.

36
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,680
Hurry.

37
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,120
Be careful.

38
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,180
Here.

39
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,650
Slowly.

40
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,470
Are you okay?

41
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,440
Are you trying to kiss me?

42
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,390
Who wants to kiss you?

43
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,530
I'm your husband.

44
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,050
If you want to kiss me, go ahead.

45
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,660
Why are you joking at such a time?

46
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,350
I'm sorry! I didn't do it on purpose. Are you unwell?

47
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,070
- I'm fine.
- Come on, get up.

48
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,700
- Are you all right?
- I am.

49
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,240
I'm sorry.

50
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,690
It's all my fault. I dragged you into this.

51
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,140
Otherwise, you wouldn't have gotten injured.

52
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,040
Silly girl, you saved me.

53
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,240
How would it be you dragging me into this?

54
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,940
It's dark now so let's just make do here for the night.

55
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,520
You rest first. I'll go look for food.

56
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,020
Godfather!

57
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,930
Put some power to it.

58
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,460
How did you do? I have prepared a banquet for you to celebrate your accomplishments.

59
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,800
Godfather, you would never have guessed.

60
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,430
We originally planned to ambush the silk wagons.

61
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,960
Unexpectedly, Night-Spirited Hero jumped out from nowhere.

62
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,540
That's not even the most important part.

63
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,080
More importantly, I accidentally slashed open a sack during the fight.

64
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,620
Tons of salt spilled out of it.

65
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,100
What?

66
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,060
Then that means these people used silk as a decoy

67
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,020
- to illegally sell contraband salt.
- That's right.

68
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,480
When those contraband salt dealers saw that they were exposed,

69
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,450
they attacked us even more fiercely.

70
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:31,620
Fortunately, I was calm, quick-witted, and know everything between Heaven and Earth—

71
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,400
Get to the main point.

72
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,760
On the one side, there are the contraband salt dealers.

73
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,560
On the other side, the Night-Spirited Hero.

74
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,960
I didn't think we'd get much from fighting them both.

75
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,440
So I grabbed these goods

76
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,390
in the chaos.

77
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,620
After saying all that, was it because you couldn't win against them.

78
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,770
You can't say that.

79
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,230
Xiao Bao was facing enemies on both sides.

80
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,260
It's already great that he could snatch these goods.

81
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,800
Nan Xiang you are a reasonable person.

82
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,230
Unlike some people...

83
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,520
Nan Xiang, choose whatever fabric you like. You can make some new outfits.

84
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,760
For real? Brother Xiao Bao, you are the best.

85
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,470
Has this brat been enlightened?

86
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,980
Does he finally see how great Nan Xiang is?

87
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,490
Chief, who knows if he really ran into the Night-Spirited Hero?

88
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,780
Maybe he just made it up

89
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,310
because he was no match to the merchants.

90
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,860
Xiao Bao is not like that.

91
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,960
Am I right, Father?

92
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,820
Right. You are right.

93
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,590
Seeing how considerate you are of Nan Xiang,

94
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,180
I'll believe you this time.

95
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,230
As for the celebration banquet,

96
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,920
it will take place as planned!

97
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,090
- Thank you, Godfather.
- Great!

98
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,300
Brothers, move the goods and then let's drink!

99
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,520
Good!

100
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,100
Bring them in!

101
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,970
Let's go!

102
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,060
What are you still standing here for? Hurry and go help.

103
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,640
I...

104
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,750
Let's go.

105
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,140
Nan Xiang.

106
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,910
I think this kid has finally come around.

107
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,340
Otherwise, he wouldn't give all this silk to you.

108
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,720
I knew it!

109
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,510
Xiao Bao definitely has feelings for me.

110
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,900
It's best if he can think that way.

111
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,920
It'll resolve one of my worries.

112
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,920
It looks like, in his heart, you and the fort are more important.

113
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,660
As for that Xiao Wanzi... just leave her to me.

114
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,190
- Father.
- Yes?
- She's a fox!

115
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,350
She can't stay in our fort.

116
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,170
What do you know?

117
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,620
Beautiful girls are most suited for heroes like me, your father.

118
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,500
Father, how is she considered a beauty?

119
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,070
She is an ugly toad right now.

120
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,200
Take your silk and go!

121
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,530
Xiao Bao!

122
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,080
Bad news!

123
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,070
The Night-Spirited Hero found out about our goods.

124
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,760
Night-Spirited Hero!

125
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,440
Shiqing, why did you become the Night-Spirited Hero?

126
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,960
My mother passed away when I was little.

127
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,520
My mother...

128
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,490
was killed by a group of bandits.

129
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,020
Thus, I have hated those evil doers since I was young.

130
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,580
So you dressed up as the Night-Spirited Hero from then on,

131
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,020
eliminating evil and righting wrongs.

132
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,330
On the other hand, I also wanted to use this identity

133
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:50,030
to find out who murdered my mother.

134
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,580
Heaven is watching as people act. Rest assured.

135
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,000
Those bad people will receive retribution for sure.

136
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,590
Your mother's murderer...

137
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,130
will face retribution too.

138
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,060
Heaven doesn't care about those criminals.

139
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,070
Only I care.

140
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,420
I will be by your side as you do that.

141
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,130
Then.... between being Night-Spirited Hero and Mei Shiqing,

142
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,620
which do you like better?

143
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,910
I like it right now more.

144
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,500
Free to do as I wish.

145
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,190
You have a point.

146
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,640
As the Night-Spirited Hero, you have done so many good deeds.

147
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,460
You've also helped me so many times.

148
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,940
Then you... Then...

149
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,830
have you helped Miss A'Rou before, too?

150
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,760
What are you trying to ask?

151
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,800
I think Miss A'rou cares a lot about you, quite a bit.

152
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,920
A'Rou? She's a street performer I rescued from a "black" (criminal) troupe.

153
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,950
She was pitiful, so I took her in.

154
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,980
I placed her in the Ruyi Restaurant.

155
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,630
I didn't expect her to be so talented

156
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,750
with having a great business mind.

157
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,070
So I entrusted Ruyi Restaurant to her completely.

158
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,930
Why are you explaining so much?

159
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,660
I was just asking casually.

160
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,490
Really?

161
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,190
So you are the mysterious owner of the Ruyi Restaurant?

162
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,520
In the beginning, I just wanted a place

163
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,150
where I could discuss things without being disturbed.

164
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,080
Ruyi Restaurant has so many delicious dishes.

165
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,890
My favorite sweet and sour ribs...

166
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,050
Will you consider lowering the price for the sweet and sour ribs?

167
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,070
It's too expensive! It's exorbitant!

168
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,000
When you go to eat it, just put it on my tally.

169
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,100
For real?

170
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,600
I'm dreaming, right?

171
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,710
Are you?

172
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,520
You're teasing me again.

173
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,370
All right. Let's rest early.

174
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,720
We still need to get off this mountain tomorrow.

175
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,480
No.

176
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,880
Remember what I told you, don't come out no matter what happens.

177
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,950
Don't come out.

178
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,900
We've been painstakingly looking for you.

179
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,050
Did you think we wouldn't find you hiding here?

180
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,450
Mother!

181
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,250
Help!

182
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,110
Shiqing, what's wrong?

183
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,950
Did you have a nightmare?

184
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,850
I'm fine.

185
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,590
I just... I just dreamed of them again.

186
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,380
Them?

187
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,730
Those who killed my mother.

188
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,210
I still can't see their faces.

189
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,250
I only saw a cane.

190
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,660
Shiqing, don't worry.

191
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,100
I'll definitely find your mother's murderer and get revenge with you.

192
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,020
No matter what happens, I will be by your side.

193
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,160
Thank you.

194
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,480
Come on.

195
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,290
Who is it?

196
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,810
It's me.

197
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,730
Princess, the security is very laxed tonight.

198
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,810
They are all drunk. We must leave right now.

199
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,200
- Leave tonight?
- That's right. The chance of success is very high.

200
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,860
Let's go quickly.

201
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,220
Who's there?

202
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,220
It's me, Xiao Bao.

203
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,760
Xiao Bao?

204
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,060
Xiao Bao, what are you doing outside my room so late?

205
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,030
I just wanted to tell you...

206
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,190
I listened to you and didn't kill anyone.

207
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,660
All right, I got it.

208
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,090
I stink of alcohol right now.

209
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,160
You surely won't like it.

210
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,460
I won't come in then.

211
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,790
All right. You should rest early.

212
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,460
I'll keep you company from here.

213
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,180
You should get some sleep.

214
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,430
No need! You should go back to your room to sleep.

215
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,510
Xiao Bao? Xiao Bao, can you hear me?

216
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,200
- I'll go take a look.
- Go.

217
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,050
Xiao Bao?

218
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,660
You should hurry.

219
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,870
Xiao Bao.

220
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,190
I know you are a good person.

221
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,390
But I really need to go down the mountain. I have no other choices.

222
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,430
Thank you for taking care of me during this time.

223
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,100
I will remember it in my heart.

224
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,050
I also hope you can leave the fort soon and get back onto the right path.

225
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,840
Then go somewhere you like.

226
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,490
I...

227
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,320
I'm leaving now.

228
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,690
Farewell.

229
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,390
Xiao Wanzi.

230
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,670
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

231
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,140
They're here. They're here.

232
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,420
- Are you sure Xiao Bao is not in his own room?
- I'm sure.

233
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,710
- Someone saw him head towards the Boulder-Shattering girl's room.
- Xiao Bao?

234
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,720
All he cares about is that Boulder-Shattering girl.

235
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,690
You know what to do, right?

236
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,300
Yes.

237
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,780
Damn, Xiao Bao. He just returned with some fabric and the chief wants to name him the heir.

238
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,820
Let's see how the chief will punish you once I put these goods in your room.

239
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,100
You're going to be in serious trouble.

240
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,510
Let's go.

241
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,110
Uncle, did you hear them? They want to frame Xiao Bao.

242
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,950
Xiao Bao will die or get severely beaten tomorrow.

243
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,150
It's fine, Princess. Now is not the time to talk about that.

244
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,110
Look! The guards are asleep. If we don't leave, we won't have another chance.

245
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,180
We can't leave.

246
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,660
If we don't leave, we won't get another chance.

247
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,220
Xiao Bao has truly treated me very well.

248
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,110
If I leave him here, wouldn't I be watching him die without doing anything?

249
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,800
How about this?

250
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,790
I'll go remove the goods from his room.

251
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,700
Are you crazy? Don't you see them watching over Xiao Bao's room?

252
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,280
If you go in there now, aren't you walking to your own death?

253
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,440
Then I'll go notify Xiao Bao.

254
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,840
Think carefully.

255
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,960
If you don't leave tonight,

256
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,520
you won't have another chance to leave.

257
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,380
I won't leave. I really can't leave.

258
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,260
Uncle He, I owe him this.

259
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,960
I have to save him. Really.

260
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,300
Princess, how about this?

261
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,620
I can't leave you here alone either.

262
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,990
I'll stay with you.

263
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,650
Being from the Jianghu, loyalty is the most important virtue.

264
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,090
I will help you out this time. I'll stay, too.

265
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,550
Let's go. Quickly.

266
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,350
Hurry and go.

267
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,880
Xiao Bao! Xiao Bao!

268
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,160
Wake up!

269
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,380
- What happened? What happened to Xiao Wanzi?
- Xiao Wanzi is fine.

270
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,740
- Do you know what we saw?
- What did you see?

271
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,060
My lord! Don't go back to sleep!

272
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,630
I saw Master Wu!

273
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,110
Master Wu wants to harm you!

274
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,980
Master Wu came to see me?

275
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,200
He's not coming to see you. He wants to harm you.
 (T/N: The two sentences sound very similar.)

276
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,910
Just now, we saw Master Wu's men take a bunch of things to your room.

277
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,700
I'm guessing they may be hiding those things in your room to frame you.

278
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,160
- He's trying to frame you.
- Marry me?
 (T/N: frame and marry sound similar)

279
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,010
Frame! He wants to harm you!

280
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,860
I'll go find him now!

281
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,860
- My lord!
- Xiao Bao!

282
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,690
Xiao Bao, be rational. If you go now, you still won't be able to explain the situation.
- That's right.

283
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,070
I think the Princess— No.

284
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,190
I think the pretty Xiao Wanzi is right.

285
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,240
If you go now, they'll bite back.

286
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,530
Bite them to death.

287
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,940
Xiao Bao, wake up!

288
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,020
Someone is trying to harm you right now.

289
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,920
So pretty.

290
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,840
I have a plan.

291
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,150
What plan?

292
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,470
Get up! Get up!

293
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,250
Hurry!

294
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,760
Still sleeping!

295
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,830
Master Bao, what's wrong?

296
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,190
Master Bao!

297
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,870
- It hurts!
- You were asleep like a dead pig and didn't even notice people entering the room.

298
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,140
What is this?

299
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,700
- What do we do?
- "What do we do?"

300
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,730
You two useless things will anger me to death.

301
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,940
- Put your clothes on and come with me!
- Yes!

302
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,650
Want to frame me?

303
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,260
You're too inexperienced. Let's see how you'll die tomorrow.

304
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,200
I need to thank Xiao Wanzi well.

305
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,860
Xiao Wanzi!

306
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,660
How did it go? Have you resolved the situation?

307
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,340
Thanks to you as well as the whole village but especially you,

308
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,310
it's resolved now.

309
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,640
Then that's good. Don't mention it.

310
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,770
- Xiao Wanzi.
- Yes?

311
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,280
To be honest,

312
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,960
you're the first beautiful girl to be kind to me

313
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,190
in my life.

314
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,910
Was no one kind to you growing up?

315
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,710
How do I put it?

316
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,950
I had no parents since I was young.

317
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,880
Heaven and the earth brought me up.

318
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,050
Nan Batian took me in when I was a child.

319
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,040
I became a bandit under him.

320
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,600
Although it's not honest work,

321
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,140
it's better than almost starving to death like when I was a child.

322
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,550
I can understand your pain.

323
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,250
Have you ever thought of living a different life?

324
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,600
How do I do that?

325
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,400
As the saying goes,

326
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,520
"It's easy to board the bandit boat,

327
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,710
but difficult to get off it."

328
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,450
By the way,

329
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,020
it's late so get some rest. I'll go back to my room now.

330
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,120
Thanks for tonight.

331
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,550
I've failed to escape again.

332
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,260
I don't know if there will be another opportunity in the future.

333
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,840
- Do you want to take a break?
- No.

334
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,130
The spareribs at Ruyi Restaurant are waiting for me.

335
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,390
Young Master! Young Master!

336
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,040
Young Master!

337
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,530
- Young Master.
- Siheng.

338
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,670
I finally found you.

339
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,320
How did you two get injured?

340
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,200
We'll talk about it when we get back to the manor.

341
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,200
[Green Dragon Fort]

342
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,490
Chief, you drank quite a lot last night.

343
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,220
I specially brought you some fruits.

344
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,940
What else do you want?

345
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,770
Chief, there is one more thing, I'm not sure if I should tell you.

346
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,220
Say it.

347
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,510
Chief.

348
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,460
I heard from one of the brothers,

349
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,480
when he went to relieve himself in the middle of the night,

350
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,640
he suddenly saw someone.

351
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,110
It was one of Xiao Bao's men.

352
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,690
He quietly carried two trunks of goods into his room.

353
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,100
I think this is a serious matter.

354
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,200
Hiding goods for himself?

355
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,000
That's the Green Dragon Fort's taboo.

356
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Are you sure?

357
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,400
Although my brother saw it for himself,

358
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,000
if... it's a misunderstanding, that wouldn't be good either.

359
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,200
In my opinion, we should investigate.

360
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,500
Then the truth will be clear.

361
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Godfather, eat some fruits.

362
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,200
These were all picked today by our brothers.

363
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,700
Why are the leftover fruits that they and Old Wu ate yesterday doing here?

364
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
It's rotten. Look, Godfather.

365
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,000
Are you copying me again, doing whatever I do?

366
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Let me tell you. It doesn't matter if you bring fruits. The chief was looking for you.

367
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
Why is he looking for me?

368
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,700
Godfather.

369
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,500
- Did you miss me?
- As if!

370
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,800
Old Wu's man

371
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,000
said he saw your men

372
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,600
carry two trunks of goods

373
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,700
in the middle of the night

374
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,800
into your room.

375
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,000
- Hiding goods for oneself.
- What?

376
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,000
There's no way. That can't be.

377
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,400
Godfather, let me tell you.

378
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,400
The brothers under me are completely clean. They aren't capable of something like that.

379
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Just act. Keep acting.

380
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Aren't you aware of what you did?

381
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,400
Old Wu, I'm warning you. Don't speak nonsense. You're making false accusations.

382
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,900
Enough!

383
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,200
We're speaking without evidence.

384
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,600
Won't we know once we go do a search?

385
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,700
Our chief is wise.

386
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,200
Search! Search diligently!

387
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,800
Godfather, let me tell you. I, Xiao Bao, do not have the least bit of disloyalty toward you.

388
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,000
Besides, I'm clean so I'm not afraid of false accusations.

389
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,600
I swear.

390
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,800
That would be best.

391
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Don't speak nonsense or else I'll break your legs.

392
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Chief, I really saw them hide the goods in this room.

393
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,000
Big Boss, there's nothing in there.

394
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,800
- Old Wu.
- What's going on?

395
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
- What's going on?
- That's impossible.

396
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,100
I, Master Bao, care about reputation. How will I keep living in Green Dragon Fort from now on?

397
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,700
Godfather, you must seek justice for me.

398
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,000
- Old Wu.
- Bandit Chief.

399
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
What's going on?

400
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,100
What's going on? Did you really see it or not?

401
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,200
If you're talking nonsense, I'll punch out your teeth!

402
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
Enough, enough.

403
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Stop scolding Tie Zhu.

404
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,600
I think that I, Master Xiao Bao, want fairness.

405
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,400
Since you've searched my room, then let's search the entire mountain fort!

406
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,300
- We won't leave out any room! We'll have a widespread search!
- That's right!

407
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,800
That's right!

408
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,200
Search them all!

409
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,800
What Xiao Bao says is reasonable.

410
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,130
Since things have come to this,

411
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,100
then let's do a complete search.

412
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,600
Xiao Bao, if we really find goods your men hid,

413
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,200
what shall we do?

414
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,600
In regards to that... "A nation has its own laws.

415
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
A fort has its own rules."

416
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,700
If I, Xiao Bao, made a mistake, then I'll surely admit it.

417
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,800
But if someone is framing me,

418
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,200
I definitely won't let him off easily.

419
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,100
Of course.

420
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,000
Come, come, come! Let's see who it is!

421
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,200
Why is it one of our people?

422
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I—

423
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,400
Turns out it's him.

424
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,700
Kneel!

425
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,700
Chief, we found these two trunks in his room!

426
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,400
Kneel properly.

427
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
How could it possibly...

428
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,000
Who's this?

429
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,700
Let me see.

430
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,000
Isn't this Tie Zhu?

431
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,400
If I didn't remember wrong, he's Master Wu's subordinate...

432
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,200
I admire you.

433
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,800
This... a thief reporting theft, placing righteousness above family loyalty.

434
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,400
If I knew this earlier, I wouldn't have asked to thoroughly investigate this matter.

435
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,000
How serious could it be? We're all brothers.

436
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,800
I should've accepted it and taken the fall for you. Then that would've ended it, right?

437
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,000
Now we've made such a big scene.

438
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,800
Master Wu, what do you think we should do?

439
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,400
Master Wu, you probably have more than these two trunks hidden. Right?

440
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,600
Stop talking nonsense! You're making false accusations!

441
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,100
Let me tell you. I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

442
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,900
Come on. Who's scared of whom?

443
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Are you done?

444
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,200
Old Wu.

445
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,000
Right now, he's been caught red-handed. Give me an explanation.

446
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,300
Bandit Chief... I am absolutely loyal to you.

447
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,600
I definitely wouldn't do something as underhanded as this.

448
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,600
Are you saying that this has nothing to do with you?

449
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,180
Bandit Chief.

450
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
If I did something like this,

451
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
let me be struck by lightning!

452
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
Struck to death.

453
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,700
All right.

454
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,000
All right.

455
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,000
A nation has its own laws. A fort has its own rules.

456
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,700
He's your subordinate. You tell me what should be done.
