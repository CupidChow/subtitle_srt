[Married Wrong in a Strange Fate]

4
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,850
Your daughter marrying

5
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,550
Master Xiao Bao is a stroke of luck.

6
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,370
Let's see who dares to harm my Wanzi!

7
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,270
I'll fight them at any cost!

8
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,880
Father! Stop hitting my father! Stop hitting him!

9
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,330
- I'll marry, I'll marry! I'll marry!
- Stop!

10
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,650
If I marry him, will you let my father go?

11
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,700
Don't worry, I, Chi Feng, will keep my word.

12
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,460
As long as you marry,

13
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,340
I'll set your father free immediately.

14
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,370
Wanzi! You can't marry him, Wanzi!

15
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,630
Father, promise me you won't gamble ever again.

16
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,640
Don't make me worry about you anymore. Take good care of yourself.

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,990
Wanzi.

18
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,240
Take her away.

19

[Ruyi Restaurant]
Young Master Wang, you haven't been here in a long time. Please come inside.

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,540
Why are we here at Ruyi Restaurant?

26
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,860
Ruyi Restaurant is Qingzhou's largest inn.

27
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,640
To be married off into the mountains from here brings good fortune.

28
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,000
Patrons, are you here to dine or lodge?

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,050
Lodge.

30
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,170
All right. Please come inside.

31
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,830
Let's go.

32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,930
This way, please.

33
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,760
Be careful.

[Double Happiness]

35
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,870
Princess, I think we're almost at Qingzhou.

36
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,690
Seeing how happy you are,

37
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,050
why don't you go marry Young Master Mei?

38
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,330
Princess, stop teasing me.

39
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,600
Since it appears we're almost at Qingzhou,

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,720
why isn't there anyone here to welcome us?

41
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,780
You are right. How about I tell Qiu Hua to go check?

42
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,930
Don't do that!

43
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,590
This Mei Manor is so daring.

44
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,190
They dared to neglect me.

45
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,520
I don't even want to go there.

46
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,700
Young Master, hurry! Come out!

47
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,770
Today is the big day, Young Master!

48
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,920
Young Master!

49
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,650
Young Master! It's time.

50
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,250
Young Master! Young Master!

51
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,510
His Lordship says that the princess has already arrived in Qingzhou.

52
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,180
If you don't go to the entrance to welcome them,

53
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,170
you'll face family discipline!

54
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,000
- Welcome?
- Yes.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,410
- Family discipline?
- Yes.

56
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,800
Lord, b-bad news!

57
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,440
Don't be anxious. Speak slowly.

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,800
The princess didn't come to the manor directly.

59
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,740
Instead, she has checked into Ruyi Restaurant!

60
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,140
- What?
- What?

61
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,810
Th-This—

62
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,660
Why is the princess staying at Ruyi Restaurant?

63
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,020
Could it be because Shiqing didn't go to welcome her,

64
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,730
so she's angry?

65
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,710
Then hurry and tell Shiqing to go and welcome her!

66
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,850
Third Young Master won't go no matter what.

67
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,200
This unfilial son.

68
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,690
My Lord, with Shiqing's current condition,

69
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,900
I'm afraid it might not be convenient for him to go welcome her.

70
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,500
Father, this won't do. If there's no other choice, I'll go.

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,980
Quiet! Is the princess someone for you to go welcome?

72
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,920
Tao Juzheng, hurry! Go there and welcome the princess.

73
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,980
Me?

74
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,340

- Go!
- Yes.

[Ruyi Restaurant]
- What's going on?
- How grand!

76
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,660
My Lord, the princess came here very suddenly,

77
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,210
so we didn't have enough time to prepare.

78
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,820
If there are any difficulties, please forgive us.

79
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,050
Is there anyone else here?

80
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,120
Please don't worry. There is one guest left who is bathing and dressing. We'll ask her to leave soon.

81
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,810
We must ensure the princess's safety.

82
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,650

[Zhu Hai]

84
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,830
My Lady, are we lacking in courtesy by suddenly staying in an inn?

85
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,450
Courtesy?

86
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,190
I'm a relative of the imperial family,

87
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,020
a princess conferred by the emperor himself.

88
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,010
That Third Young Master Mei, on the other hand, didn't even come to receive us.

89
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,820
He simply does not care about the imperial family.

90
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,760
My Lady, about Third Young Master Mei not being able to come,

91
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,150
might it be because he's injured?

92
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,470
What happened to him?

93
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,830
Earlier, I heard from the front desk that

94
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,290
Third Young Master Mei injured his eyes in a fight with bandits.

95
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,520
An eye injury?

96
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,580
The Mei Manor servants say that, unfortunately...

97
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,480
- he's blind.
- Blind?

98
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,120
I, the Princess of the Ninth Prince Manor, am going to marry a blind person?

99
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,320
Let's quickly pack our bags and return to the manor.

100
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,360
You must not! You must not! This is a bestowed marriage!

101
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,120
If we return, we will be committing the crime of deceiving the emperor.

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
- Everyone will die!
- That "bestowed" again!

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,640
My Lady, please calm down. Here, have some more tea.

104
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,410
- Stop talking. I want to be alone. Leave.
- All right, all right, all right.

105
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,100
I'll leave. I'll leave.

106
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,110
Think it over?

107
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,190
Qiao Yun!

108
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,820
Stop yelling! I hear you. What's happening?

109
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,920
The Mei Manor housekeeper is waiting outside.

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,300
Does a small housekeeper dare to come to welcome our princess?

111
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,790
Did you see Third Young Master Mei?

112
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,140
No. He probably did not come.

113
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,970
Come on, let's go take a look.

114
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,320
Let's go.

115
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,780
- What is going on?
- Master Xiao Bao?

116
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,510
Why are you here?

117
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,460
I am here to see my cheap future wife.

118
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,220
You're in such a rush.

119
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,490
I'm in a rush?

120
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,320
I should thank you.

121
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,040
Thanks for finding me a "dragon lady," (fierce and violent) with a boulder-shattering chest.

122
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,700
What's her name?

123
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,400
- Her name is Xiao Wanzi.
- Xiao Wanzi?

124
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,030
What are we waiting for? Let's go find her.

125
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,590
Master, don't you see? All these officers chased me out.

126
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,200
She's still bathing on the second floor.

127
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,770
Bathing? Then, which room is she in?

128
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,730
She's upstairs... The room plate says

129
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,590
"Lin Hai."

130
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,670
"Lin Hai"?

131
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,390
I'll enter from the back and check it out.

132
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,410
Has she thought it through?

133
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,890
Since you're all dressed up, let's go. All right?

134
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,200
Who is this? The matchmaker?

135
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,000
So even bandits are particular about marriage.

136
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,180
- She's coming out.
- The princess is coming out.

137
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,930

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,890
By the emperor's mighty grace,

163
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,000
a marriage is bestowed on my Mei Manor.

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,010
This is the utmost honor given to our Mei Clan.

165
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,290
Mei Manor? Isn't this the mountain fortress?

166
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,190
My son, Shiqing, will take good care of the princess from now on

167
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,190
and my entire Mei family shall serve the nation

168
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,380
and repay the emperor's kindness.

169
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,990
Could it be that, earlier, I...

170
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,160
[Lin Hai]

171
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,750
Who are you? Hasn't everyone been escorted out?

172
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,170
- Lives are at stake. I'm trying to run for my life right now.
- What has happened?

173
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,190
My father owes a gambling debt, so to repay it for him

174
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,030
I have to go to the mountain fortress to be a bandit wife.

175
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,540
The lives of girls nowadays are so difficult. Quickly go.

176
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,360
I can't escape. If I run away, my father will lose his life.

177
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,500
These people are simply despicable! I'll help you punish them.

178
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,560
Who are you?

179
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,610
Princess, the housekeeper is here!

180
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,570
I ran into the wrong room.

181
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,860
So this is the general's manor.

182
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,180
What should I do?

183
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,200
If they find out that I'm not the princess... Will I be beheaded?

184
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,450
The auspicious time has arrived! Begin the ceremony!

185
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,420
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

186
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,550
The princess is just nervous,

187
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,300
so she forgot her etiquette.

188
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,130
Princess.

189
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,330
Bow.

190
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,730
Second bow is to the parents.

191
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,720
Husband and wife, now bow to each other.

192
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,950
The general and his madam are both here.

193
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,100
Bow.

194
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,340
The ceremony has been completed! Enter the bridal chamber!

195
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,660
Oh my god! I'm doomed now!

196
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
What should I do?

197
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,260
You're awake?

198
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,900
Who are you?

199
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,160
This... Where is this place? Who are you?

200
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,930
This is the Green Dragon Fort.

201
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,870
I'm the godson of Nan Batian, the chief.

202
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,590
I'm also the Third Boss here. Moreover, I'm your future husband.

203
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,960
- Green Dragon Fort?
- Yes.

204
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,490
- My husband?
- Yes.

205
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,320
How could this be?

206
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,660
Could it be that, earlier, I...

207
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,920
[Lin Hai]

208
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,330
I'll hide here. I'll drag it out for however long I can.

209
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,420
[Lin Hai]

210
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,270
Who are you?

211
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,090
I... am your husband-to-be.

212
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,690
My husband? Isn't he blind?

213
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,100
If you dare come any closer, I'll call for someone! Guards!

214
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,560
This bandit mistook me for that girl at the restaurant.

215
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,130
What should I do?

216
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,660
Should I tell him that he has the wrong person right now and I'm actually the princess?

217
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,530
No, he might kill me.

218
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,860
He might even do something worse to me.

219
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,490
What are you thinking about? Let me tell you. Don't even think of running away.

220
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,270
Your father has already pawned you off to me.

221
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,960
It is natural to repay a debt.

222
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,990
But don't worry. Being with me, Master Bao,

223
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,040
I can guarantee that it will be a lot better than having to perform with your boulder-shattering chest.

224
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,570
Right, M-Master Bao...

225
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,560
Then, do you know what my name is? Do you know who I am?

226
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,760
Aren't you Xiao Wanzi?

227
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,970
Could it be that my martial arts skills were too advanced and you became muddle-headed from my blow?

228
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,540
Xiao Wanzi?

229
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,170
You must be hungry after a long day.

230
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,360
I prepared a lot of delicious food. All of them are my favorites.

231
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,580
Wow!

232
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,400
What are you doing? Why are you just staying over there? The dishes are going to get cold.

233
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,960
Why are you just staying here?

234
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,060
Then come over by yourself.

235
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,640
Look! They're all delicious. Come on, hurry up and eat.

236
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,330
You haven't seen such delicious food while you were performing on the streets, right?

237
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,170
Look at how thin you are. You must be starving.

238
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:34,280
Don't worry. Being with me, you won't ever be hungry.

239
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,030
I'll raise you to be chubby.
(like raising farm animals)

240
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,550
I want to go home! I want to see my father!

241
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,020
Why are you crying? Do these not suit your taste?

242
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,000
There's also this! Here, eat a chicken.

243
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,650
Enough. Stop crying. Let's do this.

244
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,870
Except for sending you home, I'll promise you anything else you want.

245
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,510
T-Then, can you promise to not touch me?

246
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,430
Never touch you? How is that possible? Why did I marry you then?

247
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:20,050
My godfather said to marry you so you can give me heirs.

248
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,550
Master Bao!

249
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,500
- Master Bao.
- Yes?
- The big boss said to bring your new bride to see him.

250
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,540
- All right, I got it. You may go.
- All right.

251
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,000
[Double Happiness]

252
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,200
Please don't take off the veil.

253
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,200
If you take it off, I'm done for!

254
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,000
If I say they got the wrong person, someone will believe me. Right?

255
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,800
What should I do if they don't believe me?

256
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,630
What should I do if I get captured and beheaded?

257
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,400
What are you doing?

258
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,200
What? Princess, are you looking down on me, a blind man?

259
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,700
Is he really blind? Was he already blind when I saw him in the carriage last time?

260
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,400
What are you doing? What are you doing?

261
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,300
I-I'm telling you, this is a misunderstanding!

262
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,600
I... I didn't want to marry anyone.

263
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
You didn't want to marry?

264
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,200
I was forced!

265
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
No, no.

266
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,400
I-I don't know how I was escorted here to the Mei Manor.

267
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,000
This is a marriage that was imperially bestowed. No one can get out of it.

268
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,400
Since neither of us wanted to marry, then let us steer clear of each other.

269
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,200
We'll each stay in our own places.

270
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Wait! We're already at this stage, how do we stay in our own places?

271
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,800
We are married in name, but we certainly will not consummate it.

272
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,400
That means you won't touch me?

273
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,800
What? Princess, do you want to really be married to me now?

274
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,000
No, no, no! I agree, I agree!

275
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,400
- I agree! I agree!
- Excellent!

276
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,900
I've never seen such a narcissist.

277
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,600
Once I'm full and energetic tomorrow, I'll run away!

278
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,000
That's not right.

279
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Isn't he blind? I can leave right now.

280
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,200
What? Do you want to run away?

281
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,200
You ate too much. No matter how quietly you walk, I can still hear you clearly.

282
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Besides, tonight is our wedding night.

283
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,000
It's not safe for the bride to run around everywhere.

284
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,700
Our Mei Manor guards are very strict.

285
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,200
What are you doing? Wait! Wait! What are you doing?

286
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Going to sleep.

287
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,100
If you're sleeping on the bed, where am I sleeping?

288
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,200
If you want to sleep on the bed too, I don't mind.

289
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
I mind!

290
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,300
I...

291
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,100
I"m a princess. I am beautiful and noble.

292
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,000
How can you take advantage?

293
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,600
Then do as you like.

294
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,200
Do as I like?

295
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,800
Is that something a person should say?

296
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
You are a man,

297
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,000
so aren't you ashamed to take the entire bed?

298
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
This is my bed.

299
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,500
By the way, your blankets are over there. Go get them yourself.

300
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Fine.

301
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
Seeing that you are...

302
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,000
a blind man,

303
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,400
I won't fuss about this with you.

304
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm considerate. I can sleep anywhere.

305
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,400
This is bad.

306
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,930
Godfather, we're here.

307
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Xiao Bao, look at you.

308
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,000
You two haven't even gotten married yet and you carried her back here like an anxious monkey.

309
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,500
I was anxious and wanted to see what my wife looked like.

310
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,000
Are you satisfied?

311
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,200
Godfather, I am so satisfied. This is all thanks to Master Wu.

312
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,410
S-Satisfied?

313
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,500
Bride.

314
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,400
Lift up your head up. Let me take a look.

315
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Wanzi, lift up your head up. Godfather wants to see you.

316
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,480
Hurry.

317
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
Godfather?

318
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Chief?

319
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,200
Godfather?

320
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,600
Chief?

321
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
Beautiful.

322
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,300
This girl is beautiful.

323
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,590
Miss.

324
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,580
You were carried up the mountain by this lad just like this?

325
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,600
He didn't scare you, did he?

326
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,800
I was scared.

327
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,300
He doesn't know how to be tender toward women at all.

328
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,800
Godfather.

329
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
We already made up earlier.

330
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,000
Who made up with you?

331
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,800
Save me some face in front of Godfather.

332
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,400
- Xiao Bao.
- Yes?

333
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,300
You are so fortunate.

334
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,400
It's you, Godfather, who picked well.

335
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,710
Get up!

336
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,200
Is it this girl?

337
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,000
Why didn't you get my approval first to get married!

338
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,200
If I'm getting married, why should I tell you? Why do I need your approval?

339
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
I—

340
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,300
- Father!
- Yes?

341
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
You are marrying this woman, right?

342
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,800
If you marry her, don't even think about having peaceful days!

343
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,400
- What does it have to do with you?
- I—

344
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,700
This violent temper of mine...

345
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,800
Xiao Bao!

346
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,900
Hurry and go! Go!

347
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,600
- Let's go!
- Nan Xiang!
- Father!

348
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,800
Why are you doing this?

349
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,000
I—

350
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,200
What is so great about Xiao Bao? He's heartless, isn't he?

351
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,900
Father, he is great! I like him!

352
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,600
Are you my father or not?

353
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,800
Xiao Bao is about to get married! Are you my father or not?

354
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,400
I promise you!

355
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I will definitely teach that heartless Xiao Bao a lesson for you. All right?

356
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,800
No!

357
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,200
What use is that? Even if you teach him a lesson, isn't he still going to get married?

358
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,800
- Father!
- Fine!

359
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,400
I promise you. I will give you a satisfactory answer, all right?

360
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Go back first, all right? I have something to discuss with Old Wu.

361
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,800
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure. Hurry and go back.

362
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,600
- Old Wu.
- Yes?

363
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,700
Come.

364
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,200
What is it, Chief?

365
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,200
You unreliable wicked thing.

366
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,500
You even told me about her boulder-shattering chest and then she's like this.

367
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,000
Why don't I see you finding me such a beautiful bandit wife like her?

368
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Chief.

369
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,800
This is my first time seeing her, too. Who knew she would look all right?

370
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,700
Still talking?

371
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,000
Damn!

372
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,460
Here, have a seat.

373
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,900
Enough. Stop wearing such a long face.

374
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,600
Don't worry.

375
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,270
Nan Xiang has no bad intentions. In the future, when you get used to her, it'll be all right.

376
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,790
Who has a future with you?

377
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,270
Now that I'm full, I'm actually a bit tired.

378
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,380
Wife, let's go to sleep. Come on.

379
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,510
Hold on! Who are you calling "wife"?

380
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm exhausted.

381
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,650
Wh-What are you doing?

382
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,250
Taking my shoes off to go to bed.

383
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,270
Wait! If you're sleeping here, then where do I sleep?

384
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,650
Do you want to sleep on the left or right side? You can choose.

385
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,600
Are you a scoundrel? Get out immediately!

386
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,850
Then, where do I sleep?

387
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,500
Sleep wherever you like. If you don't get out,

388
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,840
- I'll die in front of you.
- Don't!

389
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,550
Fine, fine, fine! I'll leave.

390
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,450
- I'll leave, all right?
- I'm dead.

391
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,210
Master Bao.

392
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,500
How come you aren't going in the bridal chamber tonight?

393
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,790
One hour on a spring night is worth a thousand pieces of gold.
(A romantic night is priceless.)

394
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,630
A thousand pieces of gold, my butt!

395
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,550
Although we are bandits,

396
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,240
we still have to be cultured.

397
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,740
How could we consummate it when we're not yet married?

398
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,070
Also, go snatch some things that women use tomorrow.

399
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,740
Things like lipstick, powder, and blush. Got it?

400
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,350
Stay here and keep watch. If you don't, then you'll be responsible.

401
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,060
Yes.

402
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,460
I have to hurry and think of a way to escape.

403
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,830
It seems Master Xiao Bao actually likes me.

404
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,540
Perhaps I can use him to escape.

405
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,810
No.

406
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,930
Young Master, I apologize for the wait.

407
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,210
What have you found?

408
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,390
A few days ago, a lunatic appeared on the streets of Qingzhou.

409
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,620
While he was spewing nonsense, he mentioned the murder of Madam Mei.

410
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,710
I ordered my men to tie him up.

411
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,890
What is his background?

412
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,000
He is Crazy Old Chen from Qingzhou.

413
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,680
He has a crazy personality and does all kinds of evil.

414
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,700
Ten years ago, he disappeared from here.

415
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,420
Recently, he's wandered back to Qingzhou.

416
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,280
He's gone completely insane now.

417
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,570
He has no family, no friends.

418
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,300
He usually survives only by begging.

419
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,610
What else did you find out?

420
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,710
He mentioned Omniscient Old Lai of the Beggars Gang.

421
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,830
He specializes in finding people and building connections.

422
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,240
I found out that the year Madam was killed,

423
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,080
he was looking for an assassin among the criminal sect.

424
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,390
Where is he now?

425
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,110
It is said he will appear at the shack next to the Temple of the Land Deity.

426
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,850
I've already sent someone to keep an eye out.

427
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,400
You must bring him to me alive.

428
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,740
Yes.

429
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,230
All right.

430
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,900
Night-Spirited Hero.

431
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,700
Let's uphold justice together.

432
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,470
...together.
