[Take Off the Mask]

4
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,810
Princess! Prince Consort!

5
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,080
Prince Consort, let me take care of things here.

6
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,850
- You take care of her.
- All right.

7
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,840
The Prince Consort now already knows everything about us.

8
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,480
So I feel that it is better if we compromise for the big picture.

9
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,440
As long as the princess returns, everything can get back to normal.

10
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,720
The smell of ointment.

11
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,410
What? What smell?

12
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,660
- Have you been listening to me talking?
- Yes.

13
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,440
Am I not thinking of a plan?

14
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,640
Yes, we have to think of a plan to rescue the princess.

15
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,050
Right, rescue the princess.

16
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,480
Right.

17
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,450
I hope my father can quickly rescue the princess.

18
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,850
I really cannot endure this for another moment.

19
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,140
Actually, this Third Young Master Mei has been courteous enough to you.

20
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,560
He knows that you knelt for a day and night in order to save him,

21
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,460
so he specifically asked me to cook a bowl of porridge for you.

22
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,500
Moreover, he even personally applied the ointment for you. Right?

23
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,150
You also know

24
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,750
I did this to save him. Isn't it a given that he should be doing these little things?

25
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,990
Oh, right! You and Qiu Hua did not get held suspect for the prison escape, right?

26
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,180
That Mei Siheng asked everyone in the Mei Manor! He didn't let anyone go.

27
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,860
Good thing we were already prepared.

28
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,180
When Qiu Hua and I came to find you, the majority of the people all saw it.

29
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,000
It's fine.

30
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,260
Right, who exactly was...

31
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,640
that masked person?

32
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,120
About the matter of the Green Dragon Fort bandit being rescued,

33
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,870
we still have not found out what happened.

34
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,080
We also can't find the waiter who sent the food.

35
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,030
Other than the waiter,

36
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,890
the only other clue is the masked person the princess saw.

37
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,320
Actually, I've been thinking about you once mentioning

38
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,750
how the princess almost got sold to Green Dragon Fort that day.

39
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,770
I don't know if the princess was involved in this matter.

40
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,710
She can definitely be trusted.

41
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,050
Also, you must remember to keep the princess's identity a secret.

42
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,120
Then, what should we do now?

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,810
The princess is the only one who saw that masked person.

44
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,850
Perhaps she can help us.

45
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,730
But the princess said

46
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,150
she doesn't remember there being any clues.

47
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,850
She was scared to death at that time.

48
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,670
After she rests a few days, we'll take her out to disperse her worries

49
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,510
and then she'll remember.

50
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,700
- There!
- Here, here, here!

51
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,130
Take it.

52
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,010
Has your injury healed?

53
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,780
Did I ask for your concern?

54
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,730
Don't kick anymore. Let's go.

55
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,670
I'll bring you out to play.

56
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,560
Surely I'm not hearing incorrectly?

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,200
- The sun is rising from the west?
- Are you going or not?

58
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,380
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

59
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,170
Princess, there are many people on the streets. It is not good to show your face.

60
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,060
- Be sure to cover yourself well.
- All righty!

61
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,700
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

62
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,780
We have already found clues regarding who the mole

63
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,230
was that conducted the prison escape. It's in your best interest to confess obediently.

64
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,320
Or else, when we find out through investigation, the consequences will be harsher.

65
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,040
Siheng.

66
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,840
Miss Qiao Yun, why did you come?

67
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,010
Is there any progress on the prison escape investigation?

68
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,040
Didn't the princess see the person who helped with it?

69
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,730
Right, she even remembers one of the person's key characteristics.

70
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,700
Finding the mole will happen sooner or later.

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,360
Miss Qiao Yun, I have to take care of things.

72
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,860
Why didn't I hear Xiao Wanzi mention it before?

73
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,190
When did she remember the mysterious person's key characteristic?

74
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,470
Mei Siheng will definitely alert the enemy by doing this.

75
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,060
Could it be that Third Young Master Mei wants to use her as bait?

76
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,620
Lamb skewers! Come!

77
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,570
Boss, I want four of these.

78
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,590
Also, help me roast two chicken gizzards.

79
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,610
- He will pay.
- Wait a moment!

80
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,260
- Zongzi!
- I want two zongzi and the person behind will pay.
(T/N: Zongzi - wrapped sticky rice dumplings.)

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,760
Behind where? Miss, who will pay?

82
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,520
Behind...

83
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,640
Where is he?

84
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,820
Sorry, I don't want them anymore.

85
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,260
All right. It's fine.

86
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,110
- Zongzi!
- Skewers!

87
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,080
- I heard that the shop in the front has good food.
- Really?

88
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,260
- Let's go to that shop.
- Let's go.

89
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,070
Why is it you?

90
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,850
It is not me! It is not me!

91
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,660
Why are you pretending to be the Night-Spirited Hero?

92
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,360
Pretending?

93
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,300
When did I pretend to be the Night-Spirited Hero?

94
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,960
The Night-Spirited Hero capturing people would be considered c-causing problems on the street at most,

95
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,340
but when Third Young Master Mei captures people, he shocks the authorities!

96
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,010
It really is you?

97
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,100
Truly.

98
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,360
No, t-this...

99
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,820
How can you prove it?

100
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,120
Do you remember that night at Qingcheng Tower,

101
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,780
when you told me a secret?

102
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,180
Qingcheng Tower?

103
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,340
My goodness!

104
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
No!

105
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,070
Night-Spirited Hero is so righteous, protecting and caring for the weak.

106
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,040
How could it be you, Mei Shiqing?

107
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,310
What do you mean by that?

108
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,240
Wait... This news is too much! You need to give me time to recover.

109
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
Wait!

110
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,980
So just now, was that

111
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,120
the Mei Manor mole?

112
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,770
Did you remember something?

113
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,790
Do you know who he is now?

114
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,720
No, I just feel he looks a bit similar.

115
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,680
Then, are we going to go back to Mei Manor and find him?

116
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,270
No need. We've already alerted him.

117
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,870
- He won't give us another chance.
- Then, what should we do?

118
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,000
You should wish yourself the best and be more careful.

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,360
Goodbye, Xiao Wanzi.

120
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,410
How about I look for her?

121
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,760
No. If you leave now, it will cause suspicion that much more easily.

122
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,260
So, it was him.

123
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,660
She's back! She's back!

124
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,140
Turns out it was him.

125
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,010
Xiao Wanzi, are you all right?

126
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,930
Turns out the Night-Spirited Hero has always been by my side!

127
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,790
Xiao Wanzi, are you all right?

128
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,470
Wh-What are you saying?

129
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,790
I heard Third Young Master Mei captured you and used you as bait.

130
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,770
Did anyone get caught?

131
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,070
Why did I fall into his evil plan again?

132
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,710
We didn't capture anyone either!

133
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,620
Xiao Wanzi, are you really all right?

134
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,210
Well, I'll tell you a secret.

135
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,500
Swear that you won't tell anyone.

136
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,910
Forget it, then. I don't want to know.

137
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,950
Is it all right if we don't swear a serious oath?

138
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,680
- The real identity of the Night-Spirited Hero is Third Young Master Mei.
- Huh?

139
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,650
Surely that's impossible!

140
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,810
Why are you both so surprised?

141
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,270
I guessed it long ago.

142
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,760
When it comes to hiding identities, no one is my match.

143
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,980
Right?

144
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,450
No matter whether or not he's the Night-Spirited Hero, Third Young Master Mei is still our prince consort.

145
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,610
Ever since I found out that he's the Night-Spirited Hero,

146
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,020
I start to think he's not that annoying.

147
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,190
Xiao Wanzi, do you remember that you swore an oath?

148
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,910
You can't take the prince consort from the princess.

149
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,280
It doesn't matter whether he's the Night-Spirited Hero or not.

150
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,820
You are not allowed to... make a move on him.

151
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,850
Just what are you thinking?

152
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,330
Of course, the prince consort belongs to your princess.

153
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,730
But can't you leave the Night-Spirited Hero to me to admire for a moment?

154
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,330
Today, many people left the manor to take to the streets.

155
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,250
I fear it will be hard to capture this person based on this alone.

156
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,780
This person is very cunning.

157
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,890
I fear that after going through this, he won't show himself so easily again.

158
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,940
Shiqing, I personally brewed this tea for you.

159
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,350
You've been tired this whole day. Are you thirsty?

160
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,390
Here. Drink this.

161
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,910
My shoulders are also rather sore.

162
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,410
I will help you massage them. I guarantee you it will be comfortable.

163
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,150
I still have matters to attend to. I'm leaving for now.

164
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,810
What's wrong? Are you all right, Shiqing?

165
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,380
Must you use so much strength?

166
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,860
I wasn't using that much strength.

167
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,030
- Then, I will do it more gently.
- No need!

168
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,950
You'd best sit over here.

169
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,420
Why are you smiling so foolishly?

170
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,540
I was just thinking.

171
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,330
I have somehow been living with the Night-Spirited Hero for such a long time,

172
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,790
yet I wasn't even the slightest bit aware!

173
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,690
I'm really too stupid.

174
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,670
Too stupid!

175
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,690
Night-Spirited Hero is indeed the most handsome.

176
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,450
Night-Spirited Hero?

177
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,530
That's right. Put on your mask, all right?

178
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,360
I would like to pour tea for the Night-Spirited Hero.

179
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,370
I'm begging you. Put it on.

180
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,020
Are you doing all this for the Night-Spirited Hero?

181
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,720
Yes.

182
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,560
As it turns out, the Night-Spirited Hero is indeed the most handsome.

183
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,580
- Then, let's go.
- Where to?

184
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,920
To practice writing with the Night-Spirited Hero.

185
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,920
But... well...

186
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,800
You're painstakingly teaching me to write.

187
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,000
For the sake of fairness, I will teach you a kind of unique skill. All right?

188
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,060
How is it? My unique skill is not bad, right?

189
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,820
Your skill is just to draw painted faces?

190
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,730
Wrong. It's the boulder-shattering chest!

191
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,720
This is the unique skill that was passed down by my He family ancestors.

192
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,320
If you're breaking boulders, why do you paint a face?

193
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,980
You don't understand, do you?

194
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,510
This is the original performance method that my father and I created.

195
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,190
It's the only one in Qingzhou.

196
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,590
Go to the streets and ask around if you don't believe me.

197
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,230
Even if they have never seen it, they've definitely heard of it.

198
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,950
This is from our original unique skill.

199
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,560
It's done.

200
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,220
How is it?

201
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,590
So that's what it is.

202
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,080
What are you laughing at?

203
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,820
- You look good.
- Right?

204
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,310
How is it? My unique skill is not bad, right?

205
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,790
Looks like you've gotten lucky. I will pass it down to you now.

206
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,080
Come on. Let me paint you first.

207
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,160
No!

208
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,920
Why can't I?

209
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm a grown man. Why would I paint my face?

210
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,420
And I'm not?

211
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,790
- You are not. Turn around.
- Look at Siheng!

212
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,060
I didn't even complain when you forced me to write.

213
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,920
Now, why can't I paint your face?

214
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,050
I refuse.

215
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,440
I don't care. You—

216
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,660
Come back here.

217
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,290
- Let me paint your face.
- No.

218
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,890
Don't run!

219
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,350
- Come here.
- No.

220
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,620
Come here!

221
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,250
Play with each other if you want,

222
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,930
but why play around with me?

223
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,340
What will Qiao Yun think of me?

224
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,700
Sit.

225
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,790
I already know how to write the characters "Mei Shiqing."

226
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,670
Can I learn to write "Night-Spirited Hero next?"

227
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,420
No.

228
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,100
Why not?

229
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,430
Aren't they both your names?

230
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,430
[Xiao Wanzi]

231
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,460
What you are going to learn next is your own name.

232
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,760
This is my name? That easy?

233
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,020
It looks easy, but if you want to do it well, it is very hard.

234
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,830
Practice well.

235
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,500
It's not difficult.

236
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,860
Write properly. You can only have a break once you fill up ten pages.

237
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,630
I'm done.

238
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,450
That fast?

239
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,600
Let me tell you. Using sneaky tricks isn't going to work on me!

240
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,720
Write it again. A hundred copies.

241
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm requesting the Night-Spirited Hero's help.

242
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,670
I'm requesting for the Night-Spirited Hero to help me write a page.

243
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,430
And you need to dress like him.

244
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,530
The Night-Spirited Hero didn't hear that.

245
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,460
If you still aren't going to write properly, I will attach your hair to the beam.

246
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,700
S-Sorry to disturb you.

247
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
My goodness!

248
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,600
This is the bed that the Night-Spirited Hero lies on.

249
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,400
Xiao Wanzi, you truly are so lucky.

250
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,800
The mechanism has been moved.

251
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,360
Seems like the Night-Spirited Hero is taking action again.

252
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,000
How could you do something righteous

253
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,400
without me, Xiao Wanzi?

254
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,200
Why is he here at the Ruyi Restaurant

255
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,000
so late in the night?

256
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,600
Since the mole was not caught, I fear no one in the Mei Manor will be able to sleep soundly.

257
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,200
Turns out that A'Rou has known Third Young Master Mei's identity

258
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,000
is the Night-Spirited Hero.

259
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,600
The people were unsettled, to begin with.

260
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,100
And now that this has happened, it has set forth a surging undercurrent.

261
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,000
I fear that person will be unable to restrain himself.

262
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,400
Is it possible that the mole feels a sense of fear and doesn't dare to act?

263
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,900
I naturally have my own considerations regarding that.

264
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,000
By the way, did you gather any new information?

265
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,100
There is a group of silk merchants passing through Green Dragon Mountain. According to a reliable source,

266
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,200
Green Dragon Fort already has their eyes on the profitable gains.

267
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,600
That's a good opportunity.

268
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,200
Then, we'll bide our time and launch a surprise attack on Green Dragon Fort.

269
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes.

270
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,700
Who is that?

271
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
M-Me.

272
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,000
A'Rou, you can leave now. I have matters to speak with the princess on.

273
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,400
Yes.

274
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,600
Well done.

275
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,400
You were even able to find the mechanism underneath my bed?

276
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,700
You only have yourself to blame for not shutting it properly and exposing yourself.

277
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,000
So... Lady A'Rou has known about your identity since a long time ago?

278
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Why do you say that?

279
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,600
Looks like Second Madam wasn't mistaken.

280
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,300
You and this Lady A'Rou truly have a special relationship.

281
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,400
- My relationship with A'Rou is different from what Second Madam said.
- I see.

282
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,900
As for you, why were you following me?

283
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,400
I didn't want to either. All right?

284
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,200
If I hadn't seen you acting chivalrous and feared that you'd run into danger,

285
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,000
I wouldn't have come out after you.

286
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Is lying on my blanket and sleeping not nice?

287
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,200
Did you forget

288
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,200
that our relationship is only a contract relationship?

289
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,000
That's right, Xiao Wanzi.

290
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Wake up. The Night-Spirited Hero is not real.

291
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,400
His real identity is Third Young Master Mei.

292
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,000
Come, take a look.

293
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,600
Let's bet.

294
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,400
Princess, I have something to tell you.

295
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Recently, I figured out the details of their daily activities outside the fort,

296
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,600
including the times that they switch the guards.

297
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Thus, we can find a time when they relax their security

298
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
and find an opportunity to escape down the mountain.

299
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,900
I already gathered all of that in the past.

300
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,200
I have attempted to escape multiple times, but I was captured and returned each time.

301
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,400
Moreover, I have a feeling that Nan Batian is not going to let me go.

302
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,200
Listen to yourself.

303
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,600
Wasn't that because you were all alone in the past?

304
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,700
You're just a young girl. How would you be successful?

305
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,400
Now, the situation is different. You have your Uncle He here now. Right?

306
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,000
Adding to that is my experience in Jianghu.

307
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,200
I can definitely get you out of here.

308
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,500
Then, Uncle He, once I'm out of here,

309
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,300
I will go to my family's vault and get you lots of money

310
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,800
to show my gratitude.

311
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Look at you.

312
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,000
As long as you don't give me too much.

313
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,750
By the way,

314
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,000
I think Xiao Bao is a good kid.

315
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
Especially with how he treats you.

316
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,230
See? He went down the mountain so enthusiastically this time.

317
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,800
I think it was all for you.

318
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,200
Uncle He, he is just a bandit.

319
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Besides, he only goes down the mountain to steal things.

320
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Has he already left?

321
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,800
By now... By now, he should've left.

322
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Then I'll go...

323
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,600
Go do what?

324
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,000
- I...
- To see him off?

325
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
Why would I see him off?

326
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,000
I was planning to say

327
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,600
that since he's leaving, there will be lots of people going to see him off, so the security will be relaxed.

328
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,800
I wanted to see if we have a chance of escaping. Right?

329
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,000
I'll take a look first.

330
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,800
The female mind. Really.

331
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,600
During this trip down the mountain,

332
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,200
let's take as many goods and seize as many armed escorts as possible.

333
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
Let's create more glory for our Green Dragon Fort. All right?

334
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,600
All right! Seize the escorts! Get rich!

335
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Get rich! Get rich! Get rich!

336
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,800
You are coming to see me off? That's so kind of you.

337
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,900
D-D-Don't worry, I'll come home safely.

338
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,100
Right.

339
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
I specifically bought this while I was down the mountain. I wanted to give it to you.

340
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
I think it'll look good on you.

341
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,300
Thank you.

342
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,000
Once I gain merit, maybe Godfather will...

343
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
Xiao Bao, don't overthink things right now.

344
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,900
The most important thing is to guarantee your own safety. It will all be good as long as you can return safely.

345
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,500
I just knew you were concerned about me!

346
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,580
Don't worry. I have good martial arts skills.

347
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,800
I will definitely defeat them utterly.

348
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,600
Then I'll steal some things for you.

349
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,800
Xiao Bao, you don't need to steal anything for me.

350
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,700
Just promise me you won't kill anyone.

351
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,800
Kill someone?

352
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm not that cruel.

353
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,400
No matter how you fight, just don't kill anyone.

354
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,200
I promise I won't.

355
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Good.

356
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,000
Xiao Bao.

357
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,400
Godfather!

358
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,300
I'm here to see you off.

359
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,800
I wish you a swift victory.

360
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,000
Bring back many things.

361
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,800
Godfather, rest assured.

362
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,400
I will bring a lot of goods back to you.

363
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,800
Very well.

364
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
Brothers, let's go.

365
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
- All right! 
- All right!

366
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,600
Xiao Bao, I'll see you off.

367
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,300
Xiao Wanzi, I will take care of you too.

368
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,800
Don't worry.

369
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,600
Thank you, Chief. There is no need for that.

370
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,200
You should use your time to chat and have a drink

371
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,000
with your brothers at the fort. I have my father here.

372
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Your daughter is not only beautiful but also understanding.

373
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,300
I like her.

374
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,000
Disgusting.

375
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,120
Boss, I want a bowl of wontons.

376
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,630
All right. Please sit and wait.

377
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,580
Candied hawthorns!

378
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,260
In the past, I liked Night-Spirited Hero

379
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,570
and hated Third Young Master Mei.

380
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,120
But now, why do I hate Night-Spirited Hero as well?

381
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,740
How could this happen?

382
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,080
Miss, your wontons are ready.

383
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,050
Why are you daydreaming and not eating?

384
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,520
If you don't eat soon, the wontons are going to get cold.

385
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,250
Brother Situ, what a coincidence.

386
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,690
Boss, a bowl of wontons.

387
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,170
All right.

388
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,990
What's wrong? In a bad mood?

389
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,090
You look miserable.

390
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,970
If you can't think it through, talk it out.

391
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,060
Maybe I can help you.

392
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,570
I've met up with a very puzzling matter.

393
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,040
The person I like the most just had to be the person I hate the most. What should I do?

394
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,900
- Young Master, please enjoy.
- Thanks.

395
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,760
It's so hot! It's so fragrant.

396
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,740
Is this like how you like to eat wontons,

397
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,960
but you're also afraid of getting burned by them?

398
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,180
Let me put it this way. Everyone loves the brightness of the sun,

399
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,060
yet we cannot look at it directly.

400
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,050
You're feeling confused because you cannot have him.

401
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,800
That's right. It doesn't matter whether it's Night-Spirited Hero or Third Young Master Mei.

402
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,310
Once Lu Yingyao is rescued, I'll need to return them both to her.

403
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,820
For me, they're just like the sun that is out of reach.

404
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,600
I was just speaking casually. Don't take it to heart.

405
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,050
Brother Situ, you're right.

406
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,170
Since I have no way of getting him,

407
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:39,030
isn't it better to cut it cleanly and avoid all of this worry and hesitation?

408
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,850
- You've thought it through?
- Yes.

409
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,990
All right. Hurry and eat then.

410
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,400
I've got a reliable tip that the bandits of Green Dragon Fort will rob a group of traveling merchants today.

411
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,740
Please allow me to lead the troops to go and suppress them.

412
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,200
Where did you get this information?

413
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,890
This is my only thread of information.

414
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,910
I cannot tell you. Please understand, Father.

415
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,410
You're even hiding it from me. Mei Shiqing,

416
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,100
the last time you deployed troops to suppress the bandits, the troops suffered heavy losses.

417
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,890
I think it's because you want to regain your dignity

418
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,850
that you're so anxious to deploy troops.

419
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,960
Why can't you believe in me?

420
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,890
Just based on your past deeds,

421
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,970
why should I believe in you?

422
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,630
I have already drawn out a detailed battle plan.

423
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,420
This time, I definitely will not fail.

424
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,990
The battle hasn't even started and you're already talking recklessly.

425
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,690
Generals most importantly must avoid being rash!

426
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,540
You're too young.

427
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,560
A mantis stalking a cicada is often unaware of the oriole behind it. Why then should I miss such a good opportunity?

428
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,030
Enough. I won't supply you with a single soldier.

429
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,670
Leave!

430
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,400
You're always so stubborn.

431
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,200
Young Master, I'm telling you. Don't be angry.

432
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,850
It's not like you didn't know your father always had a temper.

433
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,790
Have some tea. Young Master, here.

434
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,310
Why are you here?

435
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,980
I think what you said last night was correct.

436
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,850
We should keep to our agreement and never cross lines.

437
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Thus, I've decided to return all of these things to you.

438
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,220
I cannot deal with those things now. Wait for me to finish dealing with my matters and then we will discuss it.

439
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,760
Matters? What matters are you dealing with?

440
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,140
Wait for my return. If I don't return,

441
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,870
leave Mei Manor.

442
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,260
I have prepared traveling expenses for you in the secret passage.

443
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,880
Siheng, what is he going to do?

444
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,450
Please do as Young Master arranged, Princess.

445
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,320
He's doing it for your own good.

446
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,570
Wait! If you don't tell me, I'm going to look for General Mei.

447
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,180
Just leave the goods here for me today

448
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,950
and I will consider sparing your lives.

449
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:50,100
Who will be sparing whose lives... that still hasn't been decided.

450
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,140
Brothers, we agreed today that

451
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,920
we're only here to loot goods. We won't kill anyone.

452
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,890
- Yes!
- Yes!
