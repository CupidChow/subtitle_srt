[Pretending to be the Princess]

3
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,000
Sweet and sour ribs.

4
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,400
Sweet—

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,900
What type of person is this?

6
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Greetings, Prince Consort. Princess, I am here to help you wash up.

7
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,300
All right. Come in.

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,100
- You—
- What's the matter?

9
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,000
It's all because my sleeping on the floor scared her!

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,700
We're going out to speak in private.

11
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,300
- You—
- Let's go. Go, go, go!

12
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
Speak! Where did you hide the princess?

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
I don't know where your princess went.

14
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,600
Tell us! Where is the princess?

15
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,200
I-I really don't know.

16
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,100
Are you going to tell us or not? Tell us! Tell us!

17
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,800
I-I seemed to have met your princess at the Ruyi Restaurant.

18
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,600
How could you have encountered our princess at the Ruyi Restaurant?

19
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,000
Hear me out, all right?

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,070
I-I am just someone who performs on the streets for a living.

21
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,000
In order to pay off my father's gambling debts,

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
someone sold me to the Green Dragon Fort to become a bandit's wife.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Then the bandits asked me to go bathe at the Ruyi Restaurant before heading up the mountain.

24
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
That's how I met your princess.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Later on, I got married to Third Young Master Mei in a fit of confusion.

26
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,400
I swear that if I spoke even half a lie, the heavens will inflict a terrible punishment upon me!

27
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,800
So the princess really did escape the marriage.

28
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
- "Escape the marriage"?
- "Escape the marriage"?

29
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,600
His Majesty betrothed the princess to the junior general.

30
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,200
Escaping this marriage is a crime of deceiving the ruler!

31
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,500
"Crime of deceiving the ruler"?

32
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,990
What does that mean?

33
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,700
It means killing the whole family and carrying out the nine-generation exterminations.

34
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't cry just yet. Maybe there's a solution.

35
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Only if you can pretend to be the princess until we can find her!

36
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,600
I don't want to.

37
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,100
Then the Mei Manor, the Ninth Prince Manor, you, and your father

38
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,200
will all have to die!

39
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,980
I have walked Jianghu for so many years.

40
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,000
These scare tactics won't work!

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,800
- Qiao Yun, don't—
- Let go! Let go!

42
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Fine, fine! I'll help you. Satisfied?

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Attempting suicide to threaten others.

44
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,200
However, you also have to agree to a condition of mine.

45
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,600
Help me find my father, He Yizhi.

46
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,200
I promise you.

47
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
It is all my fault for falling asleep last night.

48
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,200
Here.

49
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I am the princess's personal maid. My name is Qiao Yun.

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,400
He is the princess's personal guard, his name is Qiu Hua.

51
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,000
How about you? What's your name?

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,200
Just call me Xiao Wanzi.

53
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't have any personal things.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Xiao Wanzi, don't worry. Third Young Master Mei can't see.

55
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,800
Moreover, no one here knows what the princess looks like.

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
As long as you follow my lead, there won't be any problems.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,800
All right.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,200
There's also one more thing.

59
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Did you and Third Young Master Mei consummate the marriage?

60
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,100
How would that be possible?

61
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,000
Besides, he doesn't want to be a parent with your princess either!

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
How could we allow that?

63
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
Xiao Wanzi, I beg you!

64
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,000
You must protect our princess's marriage. I'm begging you!

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,200
That isn't easy to do. He already said

66
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,800
to stay out of each other's way.

67
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,070
We are married in name only, so we won't be carrying that out anyway.

68
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm guessing that he is currently trying to figure out how to divorce your princess.

69
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,000
Just do it to protect the lives of you, me, and everyone else.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,200
As long as you listen to him without argument and be complacent even if maltreated,

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,800
then Third Young Master Mei won't have a reason to divorce you.

72
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,500
No way.

73
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,800
What if Third Young Master Mei falls in love with me?

74
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm asking you to pose as the princess. You aren't actually going to become one.

75
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,200
How could Third Young Master Mei fall in love with a street performer?

76
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,300
All right. What you are saying does make sense.

77
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,700
But... you both must help me find my father.

78
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,200
I promise you.

79
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,000
All right! You must not sleep with Third Young Master Mei no matter what! Do you hear me?

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,200
What words are you saying! There's a man here!

81
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,500
Then... let's quickly go. Third Young Master Mei is still waiting.

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
Siheng.

83
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,800
I can help my husband wash his face.

84
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
Thank you for your trouble, Princess.

85
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Why are you using so much strength for?

86
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,000
I am helping you wash your face, Husband.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
If you can't do it well, give it back to Siheng.

88
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,000
He's a grown man.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,400
He can't control how hard or gentle he is. When it comes to these kinds of things, it's better if you let me—

90
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,200
No, it's better if you let your wife, which is me, do it.

91
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
As this is the princess's first time being a wife, please be tolerant, Prince Consort.

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Please, be more tolerant.

93
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
From today onward, your face, Husband,

94
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
will also be your wife's face, that's my face.

95
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Now get over here.

96
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,600
Wasting such a handsome face for nothing.

97
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,800
You don't know what's good for you. If it weren't for Qiao Yun,

98
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,700
I would be too lazy to serve you.

99
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,600
Do you have a fever?

100
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
No.

101
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,250
Then, why is your face so warm?

102
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,100
This is enough. If you continue scrubbing, my skin will fall off.

103
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,600
Sure. Then may I ask, do you have any other requests, Husband?

104
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,000
Help me change my belt.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,600
Surely.

106
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Please stand up.

107
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
How is it, Husband?

108
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,320
It's not comfortable. Change it.

109
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,310
How about this one, Husband?

110
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,050
The leather quality isn't good. Change it.

111
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,440
It doesn't feel good to the touch. Change it.

112
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,440
How does this one feel?

113
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,210
Are you crazy?

114
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,450
You want to murder your husband on the first day of our marriage.

115
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,970
What poor taste. I'll do it myself!

116
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,700
It's this one. It smells good too.

117
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,180
Wasn't this the first one!

118
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,770
Is that so? Then I have such good taste.

119
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,920
Good morning, Third Young Master and Princess.

120
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
What is it?

121
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
The general sympathizes with the princess's weariness from her journey.

122
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,950
He excuses you two newly-weds from morning greetings.

123
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,450
At noon, the tea will be served at the family banquet.

124
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,060
All right, I know now.

125
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,280
Then I will take my leave.

126
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,280
What are you doing?

127
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,950
In order to save the lives of the three of us,

128
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,820
you must undergo urgent special training now.

129
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,810
What training?

130
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,290
How to become a princess.

131
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,440
Father, drink some tea.

132
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,390
Use both hands.

133
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,860
Father, drink some tea.

134
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,820
Tighten your legs.

135
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,780
Lift your waist.

136
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,050
Finally! Oh my god!

137
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,290
How can you just pick up things like that? Take them one by one.

138
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,250
I quit!

139
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,940
This is inhumane! A fake is a fake!

140
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,020
No matter what, I can't become real.

141
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,480
Here, here.

142
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,870
Xiao Wanzi, let me tell you...

143
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,260
You actually have a lot in common with the princess.

144
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,990
Really?

145
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,540
It's true that some people have said that I have a unique temperament.

146
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,820
That's right! Then you have all the conditions needed to successfully impersonate the princess, don't you?

147
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,250
But what if I expose myself at the family banquet?

148
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,820
According to my experience,

149
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,300
you just need to keep your back straight, eat and talk less.

150
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,180
Then you'll basically be able to get through the situation.

151
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,880
For the rest, you can just act based on my eye signals. There won't be any issues.

152
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,450
Will that work?

153
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,790
Of course! I was always by the princess's side.

154
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,390
If I say it will work, it will.

155
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,620
Now repeat what I said from my experience.

156
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,350
"Keep your back straight,

157
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,080
eat less, and talk less."

158
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,030
Right.

159
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,140
Where's my father?

160
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,560
I went to the Paradise Gambling House, but I couldn't find your father.

161
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,850
Then, where did he go?

162
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,390
Could something have happened to him?

163
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,140
Don't worry.

164
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,690
Let's get through this difficulty first and keep our lives.

165
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,590
We'll find your father sooner or later.

166
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,780
Is there any news from Omniscient Old Lai?

167
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,450
Not yet. A'Rou's men are still watching.

168
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,400
Young Master, the family banquet is about to begin.

169
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,510
Why don't we go back to prepare?

170
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,590
What are you doing?

171
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,930
Wait, wait. Husband, let me lend you my arm.

172
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,930
No need! I can... I can walk by myself.

173
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,530
It's all right, I'm quite strong.

174
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,650
Besides, it's my duty to take care of my husband.

175
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,050
[Elegant, Beautiful Residence]

176
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,220
Father, when will you help me get a wife?

177
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
Mother. Father.

178
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,120
I'll find you the best one. Don't be anxious.

179
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,860
- Mother is always best.
- Princess, Shiqing, take a seat.

180
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,920
Father. Second Madam. Second Young Master.

181
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,160
Husband, please have a seat.

182
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,950
The princess serves tea to the general and madam.

183
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,400
Father.

184
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,070
- Father, please have some tea.
- Good.

185
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,160
Second Madam.

186
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,790
Second Madam, please have some tea.

187
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,060
Princess, please have a seat.

188
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,040
Thank you, Father.

189
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,460
Princess, my Mei Manor cannot compare to your Ninth Prince Manor.

190
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,690
I don't know if you will grow accustomed to living here.

191
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,600
Everything is fine. Thank you for your concern, Father.

192
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,570
Shiqing, for the princess, with her status, to marry into our Mei family

193
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,090
is our good fortune.

194
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,830
You must treat the princess well from now on, understood?

195
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,360
Princess, Shiqing usually doesn't talk much.

196
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,960
If you feel bored, you may come to me at any time and I'll help you to relieve any boredom.

197
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,460
Thank you for your concern, Second Madam.

198
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,780
Not since the last time when I became a noble,

199
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,720
there hasn't been a celebratory occasion in my Mei family for almost ten years.

200
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,300
Come on! Let's all eat. We may talk while we eat.

201
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,260
Princess, Shiqing's eyes aren't in good condition right now,

202
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,560
in the future, he'll rely heavily on you for his care.

203
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,990
All right, Second Madam. You may rest assured.

204
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,590
Shiqing, if there is anything you would like to eat, let me know.

205
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,900
Here...

206
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,030
Father, there is something that I still feel the need to say.

207
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,190
Since I'm already married, please allow me to establish my own family (residence).

208
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:04,760
Let's discuss this after we are done eating.

209
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,500
Seeing as everyone is here, I thought I might as well make it clear.

210
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,520
Is this also the princess's wish?

211
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,490
Yes, Father. Shiqing's wishes are also my wishes.

212
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,520
Since the princess is already married to me,

213
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,060
she will naturally follow my arrangements.

214
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,060
I'm not dead yet.

215
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,470
Why are you so anxious to live apart from us?

216
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,860
Shiqing, you and the princess have just gotten married.

217
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,400
Why would you mention living apart from us?

218
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,760
Wh-What is all of this?

219
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,190
If marriage means separating from the family,

220
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,120
I'd rather wait to get married until Father dies.

221
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,570
Shut your "bad omen uttering" mouth!

222
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,680
- No, Father, I want to be with you and Mother.
- My Lord! My Lord!

223
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,490
My Lord, don't be angry. Shiyuan had good intentions.

224
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,090
It's just that his mouth is a little clumsy.

225
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,370
These two rebellious sons. One is wicked and one is stupid!

226
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,190
They're going to anger me to death!

227
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,490
Mei Shiqing, let me tell you.

228
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,830
As long as I'm still alive, my word is law!

229
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,240
You went through with the marriage, but you have to stay within this family as well.

230
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,370
You keep talking about the Mei family,

231
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,510
only because you want the Mei family to have more honor, wealth, and status, right?

232
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,890
My mother and I have already done our best for the Mei family.

233
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,660
Impudence!

234
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,430
Mei Shiqing, don't go too far.

235
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,800
The lord just doesn't want to argue with you.

236
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,420
From what I see, you just faked your blindness to escape this marriage, didn't you?

237
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,830
Be quiet!

238
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,590
I've made my decision. Father, please agree.

239
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,890
Rebellious. So rebellious!

240
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,160
Tao Juzheng, family discipline!

241
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,760
My Lord.

242
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,820
Kneel down!

243
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,400
Father! Father, stop beating him!

244
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,260
Princess, stay out of this!

245
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,890
I must teach this boy a lesson today.

246
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,460
If you want to hit someone, hit me.

247
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,230
I'm his wife. I'm sure the emperor will understand if you hit me.

248
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,430
All right, you brat.

249
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,260
Today, I'll spare you one time for the princess's sake.

250
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:56,100
Princess, now that you've married into the Mei family, you are a member of the Mei Manor.

251
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,240
If this brat acts impetuously again, will you block it for him every time?

252
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,540
Yes!

253
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,570
♫ Scene after scene flashes by ♫

254
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,530
♫ Lifting my head, I gaze at the galaxy ♫

255
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:13,690
♫ I diligently become more persistent little by little ♫

256
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,530
♫ Even if I'm fearfully gambling ♫

257
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,640
Mei Shiqing! Since the princess protected you today,

258
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,060
I'll let you go this time. Mind your behavior.

259
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,730
♫ My heart is like fire, burning for you ♫

260
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,330
♫ Even my tears are hot ♫

261
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,490
- Princess.
- Young Master.

262
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,100
Princess, don't blame Shiqing's father for being too cruel.

263
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,070
There's an old saying among our people that says that an "uncut jade can never be made into a weapon."
(One who has never experienced hardship will be forever useless)

264
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,870
Everything is for the good of Third Young Master.

265
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,970
Shiqing lost his mother at a young age.

266
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,600
How can Shiqing's father not educate him?

267
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,030
However, Shiqing has finally lived up to his father's expectations.

268
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,940
Haven't you "married down" to him?

269
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,950
Now, won't you eat a little more?

270
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,480
The dishes are getting cold. Come on.

271
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,990
Why fear the dishes getting cold?

272
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,790
The scariest thing is a cold heart.

273
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,020
To think that in the end, it was an outsider who came to help me.

274
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,060
Just look at him. Let's see how much longer he can hold on.

275
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,140
How long can the princess protect you?

276
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,150
A dignified princess married a blind man!

277
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,900
Just then, didn't I really have the stance of the princess?

278
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,340
It seems like acting like the princess isn't that hard.

279
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,190
- Lower your voice.
- I know it! There are ears listening everywhere.

280
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,420
Xiao Wanzi, you must remember to keep a low profile.

281
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,630
Don't interfere with what you shouldn't interfere with

282
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,910
and don't say what you shouldn't say.

283
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,070
After wandering throughout Jianghu for so many years, I understand that principle at least.

284
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,460
Earlier, I only helped him on an impulse because I seriously couldn't watch it any longer.

285
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,710
However, I promise that I'll do my best to keep a low profile in the future.

286
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,530
All right! I'll trust you once more.

287
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,870
Next time, don't act rashly and speak impulsively again!

288
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,900
All our lives are in your hands.

289
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,300
We are all dependent on you, got it?

290
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,050
Got it, got it. You're so young to be nagging like an old lady.

291
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,230
You're the one who's like an old lady!

292
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,710
Princess, Young Master is hurt quite badly.

293
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,540
Why did you have to talk back to General Mei?

294
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,940
After all, he's the master of the family. Couldn't you have given him some face?

295
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,920
Be quiet!

296
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,060
Is this how you speak to your savior?

297
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,560
At least I saved you! If I hadn't, who knows how badly you would've been whipped.

298
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,730
- Who asked for your help?
- I—

299
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,270
Princess actually cares for Prince Consort.

300
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,360
However, she just hopes he can care more about himself.

301
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,190
Right, Princess?

302
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,280
Siheng,

303
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,350
I'll dress Young Master's wound.

304
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,620
You're hurt so badly.

305
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,680
If it hurts, yell out and don't hold it in.

306
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,110
That General Mei is really something. He hit you so cruelly.

307
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,680
Are you even his own son?

308
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,970
- Someone who doesn't know the situation would think he harbors a huge grudge against you.
- Be quiet!.

309
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,950
Are you using your authority to exact revenge on me?

310
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,710
What did you say?

311
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,450
Don't interfere with my life.

312
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,390
Did you think I wanted to?

313
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,920
It's all because—

314
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,250
It isn't a big deal if you don't thank me, but what's with this attitude?

315
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,080
We'll just say I was meddling in another's business, all right? I was meddling in another's business!

316
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,840
Since you've put it that way,

317
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,240
then...

318
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,850
I still have something to say.

319
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,590
Never meddle again!

320
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,650
- I—
- We're all one family.

321
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,820
As long as the two of you work toward a common goal together and live harmoniously,

322
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,170
won't that be enough?

323
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,390
She's right, she's right! Princess,

324
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,690
we've all noticed your care for Young Master very clearly.

325
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,550
We all admire it very much. We admire it.

326
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,950
We admire it!

327
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,870
Don't you just want to separate from your family? What's so hard about that?

328
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,740
Build a wall in your courtyard

329
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,640
and then you, Third Young Master Mei, will have such a peaceful space of your own!

330
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,590
Since it's so easy,

331
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,390
go do it.

332
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,420
Do you think making a weak female build a wall is reasonable?

333
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,230
Are you weak?

334
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,860
I can build it,

335
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,210
but the problem is that if I do build it successfully, then what happens?

336
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,060
What do you mean by "what happens"?

337
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,270
If you want money, just ask for it directly.

338
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,510
Qiao Yun and Siheng will be my witnesses.

339
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,930
If I, the princess, successfully build this wall,

340
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,460
you, Third Young Master Mei,

341
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,060
will have to respectfully and earnestly

342
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,980
bow down to me in thanks.

343
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,760
Good luck.

344
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,210
Princess!

345
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,830
Goodness.

346
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,780
- Princess, what are you going to do?
- Princess!

347
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,580
Don't be angry, Young Master isn't picking on you!

348
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,860
Don't just look and see that he is young, accomplished, talented, handsome, and charismatic!

349
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,000
The truth is, he lost his mother at a young age

350
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,610
and his father is like that.

351
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,110
He's very sensitive inside and he badly needs to be protected.

352
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,610
He is also really afraid of spiders.

353
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,470
A grown man being afraid of spiders?

354
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,290
That's so funny.

355
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,010
Our young master isn't afraid of pain or death,

356
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,930
he's just really afraid of spiders.

357
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,510
I ask you to keep that in mind, please.

358
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,460
Enough, enough, I got it. Stop talking.

359
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,990
Take me to the housekeeper

360
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,560
to ask for men and materials. We'll build the wall right now.

361
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,640
No matter what he says, I will make him

362
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,820
- thank me personally!
- Yes!

363
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,100
Also, take that side down.

364
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,110
Housekeeper Tao.

365
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,300
What is your command, Princess?

366
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,630
Call for more guards and bring some men.

367
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,060
We're building a wall.

368
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,880
Building a wall?

369
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,300
What kind of wall?

370
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,210
Just, a wall. What other kind of wall is there?

371
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,830
Princess, to build a wall, we must prepare mudbricks and tools.

372
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,570
The hour is getting late.

373
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:53,490
How about tomorrow? How about if I send people over tomorrow?

374
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,290
Tomorrow is fine.

375
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,050
Remember to get lots of people early tomorrow morning, all right?

376
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,520
Yes.

377
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,400
Second Madam, I have something to report to you.

378
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,620
Go ahead.

379
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,880
The princess came to me in a rush just now.

380
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,490
She asked for men and materials to build a wall.

381
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,910
I didn't know whether I should agree or not, so I pushed the preparations to tomorrow.

382
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,090
- Build a wall?
- Build a wall?

383
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,810
What wall?

384
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,510
If my guess is correct, it should be a courtyard wall that seals in the third courtyard.

385
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,290
Has that Mei Shiqing lost his mind?

386
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,860
I'll go tell my father right now. This time, even the princess won't be able to save him!

387
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,200
- Stop right there.
- Mother?

388
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,980
It would be no use to go right now.

389
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,520
Let him mess around.

390
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,210
The ideal situation is to have him build the wall a bit higher.

391
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,010
Mother, you're right.

392
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,570
- Tao Juzheng.
- Yes.

393
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,200
If Third Young Master needs anything,

394
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,180
then do your best to help him.

395
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,770
You must cooperate well with me.

396
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,910
Yes, I understand.

397
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,080
Mother.

398
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,010
When you come across problems, you have to be calm and collected.

399
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,340
Don't always act like a child.

400
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,880
I got it, Mother. What you say is right.

401
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,620
Let's wait to watch the show tomorrow.

402
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,200
I've been here for so many days already.

403
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,100
There are people outside guarding the area strictly every day.

404
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,800
How do I get out?

405
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,800
Master Bao? You—

406
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,480
Who are you people?

407
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,200
Why are you outside my room?

408
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,000
We're your subordinates!

409
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,700
- Go! Go!
- We're going, we're going.

410
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Why have you come?

411
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,500
Why have I come?

412
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,700
I'm returning to my room.

413
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,000
Why are you here? You came to find me, didn't you?

414
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,800
N-No. Hey, hey!

415
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,200
- I can't escape anyway, so where would I be if not here?
- Escape?

416
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,500
You... You...

417
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,400
As of now, you still can't accept

418
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,800
our feelings for each other...

419
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,800
We... have feelings for each other?

420
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,200
All right...

421
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,200
It's fine if we don't.

422
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,200
I, Master Bao, don't... don't force women.

423
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,900
Let me tell you.

424
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,800
Actually, I think you're the best man among the bandits!

425
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,600
I think you're both responsible, courageous,

426
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,600
and you're also handsome! I really, really admire you!

427
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,800
You really admire me?

428
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,000
I really admire you!

429
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,200
Look! I don't talk to anyone else. I only talk to you.

430
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,000
Then in the future,

431
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,400
I'll come and talk to you every day.

432
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,000
There's no need for that.

433
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,200
Then look here, Elder Brother Master Bao,

434
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,800
if you like me so much, can you promise me something?

435
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,400
Say it!

436
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Can you let me go? Just treat it as fulfilling the wish of another!

437
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Once I get out, I'll grab a bunch of money and come repay you!

438
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,800
I-I will definitely come to repay you, all right?

439
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
All right!

440
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,700
Really?

441
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Are you trying to—

442
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
What are you doing?

443
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,600
D-Didn't you say you wouldn't force me?

444
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
Force you?

445
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
What are you trying to do?

446
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
I know...

447
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
I know you aren't asleep!

448
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
S-Stop pretending.

449
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,000
He's really asleep?

450
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,200
He had the guards leave earlier...

451
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,400
Tonight's my best chance to escape!

452
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,400
Master Xiao Bao!

453
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,200
How did Master Bao turn out shorter today?

454
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,300
That's right. What's going on?

455
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Stop running!

456
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Master Xiao Bao!

457
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,000
If you don't want to die, stay here obediently for me.

458
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,700
Hurry up!

459
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,400
Master Xiao Bao!

460
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,800
Someone ran away wearing your clothes just now!

461
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,600
Are you crazy? It's so late in the night, have you still not fully woken up?

462
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
Really! There really was someone just now!

463
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,600
Also! Ask him! Ask him!

464
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,000
That's right! I also saw it!

465
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Someone's running over there!

466
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Go chase them! Hurry up!

467
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,100
Got it, got it!

468
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,200
If it wasn't for me just now, you would've died there! Do you know that?

469
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,000
Thank you then.

470
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,770
Do you know what kind of people everyone in the Green Dragon Fort is?

471
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,500
They're all bandits!

472
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,200
If you were caught by any of them, do you know what would have happened?

473
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,100
You a bandit, aren't you? Well, aren't you?

474
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,000
The Green Dragon Fort is full of traps.

475
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,600
You can't escape. Stop trying to.

476
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,400
Take off your clothes.

477
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,800
What are you looking at? Those are my clothes!

478
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,100
Take them off!

479
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'll take them off then. What are you yelling for?

480
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,200
I won't take advantage of your bad situation.

481
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll wait for you outside. Leave the clothes on the ground after you take them off.

482
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,700
I won't take them off!

483
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,400
- Everyone, get in better spirits! Work hard!
- Yes.

484
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,800
After today's construction is complete,

485
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,200
I'll treat everyone to a sumptuous feast of wine and meat!

486
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
- How's that?
- Great!

487
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,800
Thank you, Princess!

488
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,000
Who would think that the princess understands so much?

489
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,400
My Lord, I heard the kapok flowers across the courtyard are blooming just right.

490
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,800
Let's go take a look.

491
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,200
I have never been interested in those things.

492
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Father, kapok trees are also called "hero trees" and their flowers are called "hero flowers".

493
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,000
Only such handsome and strong plants are worthy of the appreciation of a hero such as Father.

494
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,600
Keep talking.

495
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
It's said that Nanjiang Island

496
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,400
once had a local hero who died in battle defending against other clans.

497
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,700
In the past... this wall wasn't here, right?

498
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,600
That's right! What's going on?

499
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,800
In response to Madam's question, that seems to be Third Young Master's courtyard.

500
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,000
This wall then... should have been just built.

501
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
T-This Third Young Master's actions are too extreme!

502
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,300
Since he can't separate from the family, he's even built a wall.

503
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,800
My Lord!

504
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,600
He doesn't hold you, his own father, with any respect!

505
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
That's right, Father.

506
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
Bring me a ladder!

507
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
- Hurry and go!
- Yes!

508
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,400
Your technique is incorrect. Come down and let me do it.

509
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,300
Please be careful then, Princess.

510
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,000
You can climb up.

511
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,000
- Father?
- Princess?

512
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,600
Why aren't you entering through the entry door?

513
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,400
I would like to go through the entry door.

514
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,200
I forgot to leave space for a door.

515
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,600
Mei Shiqing!

516
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,200
Who allowed you to build a wall with a sealed doorway!

517
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,130
I have my own family now and would like to live separately.

518
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,800
The princess agrees as well.

519
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,200
You—

520
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
Princess, get out of the way.

521
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,800
Mei Shiqing, I'm telling you.

522
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,400
For every day that I remain in the Mei family, I'm still in charge!

523
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,000
Who's idea was it to build a wall?

524
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,800
My idea!

525
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,200
Fine, Mei Shiqing.

526
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,600
Don't think just because the princess is supporting you,

527
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,400
that I won't dare to do anything to you!

528
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,200
I wouldn't dare.

529
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,100
If you want to beat or scold me, please do it to your heart's content, Father.

530
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,000
Mei Shiqing,

531
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,700
you don't respect me, your own father, at all now. Right?

532
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,400
Since ten years ago, you and I

533
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,200
remain only father and son in name, not in feeling!

534
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,700

♫ Light is casted in my eye by chance ♫

536
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:03,000
♫ Just like how I came into your world by chance ♫

♫ The most beautiful scenery of this life ♫

540
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
♫ is the clouds passing through the moonlight ♫

541
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,100
♫ Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm ♫

542
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,800
♫ The moon is covered; the moon is spotted ♫

00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,200
♫ It's me missing you ♫

547

♫ Facing the moonlight, I say, "I'll wait for you" ♫

548
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,100
♫ The night awakens us with the silver moonlight ♫

♫ Whoever catches the firefly shall walk together with me ♫

♫ Fated chance destined it to be you ♫

551

♫ What a pity to not meet in all this time ♫
