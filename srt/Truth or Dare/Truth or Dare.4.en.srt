3
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,940
Mei Shiqing, take this wall down immediately!

4
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,650
Or else today, I'll beat you, my unfilial son, to death!

5
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,660
I won't take it down.

6
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,310
Father!

7
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,100
Shiqing, let's take the wall down right now.

8
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,220
I... will... not!

9
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,770
- Thank you.
- No need.

10
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,380
You became injured like this in order to protect me.

11
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,200
Of course, I have to thank you.

12
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,260
Before, my attitude toward you was horrible.

13
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,180
Now, I feel especially regretful and guilty inside.

14
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,320
I'm sorry.

15
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
However, you really are something.

16
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,210
In a situation like that, couldn't you just give in?

17
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,510
Why do you have to suffer this kind of physical pain?

18
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,160
I think you're overthinking it too much.

19
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,320
I saved you because I was afraid that if you got hurt, we wouldn't be able to explain it to Ninth Prince Manor.

20
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,060
I think you're overthinking it too much, too.

21
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,920
I... I said it out of courtesy. Courtesy, do you understand?

22
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,860
I think you shutting your mouth would be being courteous.

23
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,460
I'm someone who most definitely repays anyone's kindness.

24
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,390
Anyway, I'll repay your kindness no matter what.

25
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,920
I said no need.

26
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,880
From now on, if you want to eat, drink, or need anything, just tell me.

27
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,950
I will do my best to satisfy you.

28
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,380
Fine. I need you to be quiet.

29
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,040
Aren't you blind?

30
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,450
Then, how did you...

31
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,990
happen to block something right in front of me?

32
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,380
I mean, I didn't even notice.

33
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,780
With your physique and noise level,

34
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,270
it is impossible not to know (where you are).

35
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,530
Makes sense.

36
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,030
Wait a second. What do you mean by my physique?

37
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,800
You're just calling me fat!

38
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,180
I want to eat porridge.

39
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,310
Porridge, right?

40
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,220
I'll tell Qiao Yun to go make it in a bit.

41
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,200
Wait! What do you mean by that? What do you mean I'm fat?

42
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,820
Just now, someone was crying to Heaven, begging me for a chance to repay my kindness.

43
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,860
As I see it, that's just an empty mantra.

44
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,350
Right now, even a bowl of porridge has to be made by someone else.

45
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,570
Am I someone who doesn't do what she says?

46
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,090
Isn't it just a bowl of porridge? Wait for me.

47
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,120
Young Master, thank goodness you reacted quickly!

48
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,230
Are you all right?

49
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,840
I'm fine.

50
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,330
All right, all right, all right! Let me do it.

51
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,210
I have to make it myself. That's what sincerity is.

52
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,360
The fire isn't even lit, what are you cooking?

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,640
This porridge has to be made with boiling water.

54
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,870
Then you add in the blanched ingredients

55
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,340
so the porridge will have a delicate fragrance. This—

56
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,080
I got it!

57
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,530
I have to show Third Young Master Mei what gratitude is and what repaying another's known kindness is.

58
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,370
You just let Prince Consort have a good bowl of porridge.

59
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,770
That is the greatest gratitude you can show, all right?

60
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,100
I'll help you cook it. After it's done, you just have to bring it over. All right?

61
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,830
Am I cooking it poorly?

62
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,180
All my efforts wasted.

63
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,780
The porridge is done. Hurry and eat it before it gets cold.

64
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,510
I don't want it.

65
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,860
You don't want it anymore?

66
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,450
Forget it, Xiao Wanzi.

67
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,740
You're repaying a kindness right now, so just endure.

68
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,950
Fine. If you don't want it, I'll eat it.

69
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,030
Wait! Siheng, your young master has an injury.

70
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,400
All right. You eat this porridge. I'll help him wash his hair.

71
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Attentive work like this indeed requires me to do it.

72
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,100
Yes.

73
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,960
Young Master, the porridge is not bad. Aren't you going to try it?

74
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,430
If it's not bad, then finish it for me!

75
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,240
Yes.

76
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,700
Can he really not see?

77
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,950
At the time, he was able to save me so quickly.

78
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,360
Is he really blind?

79
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,630
There's a fly.

80
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,200
Here, Shiqing. Have a foot bath before you go to bed.

81
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,880
What's wrong?

82
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,700
It's too hot.

83
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,300
Then, I'll add some cold water for you.

84
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,000
One more ladle.

85
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,200
Try it now. Come on.

86
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,400
- Is that better?
- Yes, yes.

87
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,560
- Go pour me a cup of water.
- All right.

88
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,860
There's no more?

89
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,840
Here, husband. Please have some tea.

90
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,770
Why are you covered in sweat?

91
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,370
Is it still very hot?

92
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,470
Is it?

93
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,790
- By the way, there's no more cold water. Go get me more.
- All right.

94
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,890
It's so hot.

95
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,310
How did he know there's no more cold water in here?

96
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,070
Xiao Bao, it's been a long time since you and I drank together like this.

97
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,640
We happen to be free today so let's drink.

98
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,570
- Cheers!
- Yes.

99
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,680
Xiao Bao,

100
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,610
why did I hear that Xiao Wanzi wants to run away?

101
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,400
No. The two of us were playing a game.

102
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,620
Look at you, an adult, yet you're still messing around.

103
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,050
But I think... that this Xiao Wanzi is not easy to deal with, right?

104
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,460
Yes, she is especially hard to deal with.

105
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,780
I've already put in so much effort.

106
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,750
Godfather, when do you plan to hold the ceremony for us to get married?

107
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,630
In regards to you two,

108
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,500
I've seriously thought about it, over and over again, all night long.

109
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,040
Godfather, you've really been troubled over me.

110
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,320
So I have decided...

111
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,610
- to betroth Nan Xiang to you.
- What?

112
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,460
Xiao Bao, think about it. You've been with me for so many years.

113
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,190
I hope you can inherit my position as the chief of this fort

114
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,210
and grow our Green Dragon Fort. Don't you think so?

115
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,040
Yes, Godfather. I understand your good intentions for me.

116
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,990
Well... if I marry Nan Xiang,

117
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,310
what about Xiao Wanzi?

118
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,080
I will marry her.

119
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,010
B-But, Godfather--

120
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,390
But what?

121
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:02,090
When have I, Nan Batian, ever taken my words back?

122
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,570
Godfather, y-you've overthought too much!

123
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,200
Godfather, your kindness toward me is as heavy as a mountain.
 (A huge debt of kindness)

124
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,260
I really regret this.

125
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,050
If I had known you liked that girl, I wouldn't have touched her!

126
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,220
But...

127
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,290
- She and I have already... done what can't be undone.
- What!

128
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,420
Y-You... h-how could you act so quickly?

129
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,650
Godfather, she wanted to run away.

130
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,180
I was thinking we cannot delay banishing misfortune.

131
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,270
- Right?
- Didn't you just say you two were playing games!

132
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,600
How could you j-just...

133
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,660
I will apologize by taking my life right now.

134
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,430
W-Wait!

135
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,390
No need to go to that extent. Come, sit.

136
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,700
In the past, there was the tale of Emperor Ming of the Tang Dynasty and Noble Consort Yang.

137
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,390
The Jianghu sons and daughters of our Green Dragon Fort

138
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,590
can also follow in their footsteps, right?

139
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,520
Godfather, if you are in a rush, I will have her sent to you right now.

140
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,870
Come back! Sit.

141
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,860
This is why I say you're young. You... But...

142
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,390
Did Noble Consort Yang go directly to the imperial palace from the prince's manor?

143
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,460
No.

144
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,250
She first shaved her head to become a nun and entered a nunnery.

145
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,280
After a short transition period did she enter the imperial palace.

146
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,350
Then we must have a short transition period as well.

147
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,920
All right, I understand.

148
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,360
Tonight, I will send Xiao Wanzi to the guest room.

149
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,710
Then, I will have her bathed and dressed up

150
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,770
before delivering her from the guest room

151
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,930
to your room.

152
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,420
Xiao Bao,

153
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,860
I appreciate your filial thought.

154
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,170
But... although we are bandits, we cannot be uncultured.

155
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,360
Yes.

156
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,740
Besides, in all these years, it hasn't been easy to remarry.

157
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,490
In any case, it must be grand,

158
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,880
luxurious, and impressive. Right?

159
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,730
I understand.

160
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,350
We must make it grand, luxurious, and impressive.

161
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,590
All according to your wishes! I'll go make the arrangements right away.

162
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,220
Go ahead.

163
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,700
Xiao Wanzi.

164
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,060
Hold on. What's going on with you?

165
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,490
My godfather won't let me marry you.

166
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,170
It looks like your godfather is someone who is sensible and knows that we are not suitable for one another.

167
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,760
What are you smiling about?

168
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,400
My godfather wants to marry you himself.

169
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,350
Hold on. Is there not one normal person in this fort?

170
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,460
Yesterday, you were going to marry me. Today, he's going to marry me.

171
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,960
You all are so shameless and low! What do you take me as?

172
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,200
Do you think that's what I want? It's all your fault.

173
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,230
If your parents didn't make you so beautiful,

174
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,310
do you think I would like you this much?!

175
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,460
Thank you for praising me. What do I do now?

176
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,400
I can't do it so I'll just die. I can only end this by dying.

177
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,290
I'll die.

178
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,000
Die! Let's all die! That way I don't have any worries.

179
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,980
I won't die.

180
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,280
Then what should we do? How about...

181
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,220
How about... How about you pretend to be stupid?

182
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,200
Get away! Stay far away from me!

183
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,250
Then, what do you say we do?

184
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,860
I've thought of something. When I was young, there was a type of medicinal herb.

185
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,110
Once I soak it in water and smear it on my body,

186
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,250
my whole body will be covered in rashes; it is really scary.

187
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,170
For real? Is it that severe?

188
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,400
For real.

189
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,130
Then... what is the herb called?

190
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,360
It is called corydalis saxicola.

191
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,850
I don't know it. I'm uneducated.

192
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,960
- Is it expensive?
- Yes.

193
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,000
No matter how expensive it is, I will buy it for you at the apothecary.

194
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,970
If I really can't buy it, I'll climb a mountain of swords or plunge into a sea of fire,

195
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,060
or even jump off a cliff to find it for you. All right?

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,850
Xiao Wanzi, how is your relationship with Third Young Master Mei these days?

197
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,520
That's not important.

198
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,160
I suspect that Third Young Master Mei can see.

199
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,370
Can see!

200
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,160
- This—
- But it's only a suspicion.

201
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,490
If we can confirm it, we are already prepared for that. Right?

202
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,890
Don't worry. I have already come up with a plan.

203
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,330
What plan?

204
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,360
I know that Third Young Master Mei has an obsession with cleanliness.

205
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,870
I also know what he is most afraid of.

206
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,990
Shiqing!

207
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,500
"The green mountains transverse the land behind the northern wall. The clear water winds around the eastern part of the city."

208
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,390
Princess.

209
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,310
- What are you here for?
- I am here to take care of you.

210
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,500
There's no need. Siheng being here is enough.

211
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,130
Siheng, go out first.

212
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,260
I... have something to say to Young Master privately.

213
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,760
Y-Young Master, I'll put the book here for you.

214
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,560
I've put it there.

215
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,060
Shiqing, this is

216
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,360
a folk remedy that I especially had someone find to cure your eyes.

217
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,530
It's said to open up all the meridians around your eyes.

218
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,230
It will help those who are blind recover their eyesight.

219
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,490
Let me try it on you.

220
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,300
Are you all right?

221
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,290
I'm fine.

222
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,260
I'm very sorry for wasting your painstaking efforts.

223
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,170
It's all right.

224
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,430
Shiqing... it is said that massaging the arms more

225
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,130
can also help with recovering one's eyesight.

226
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,650
So, he really is blind.

227
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,580
What a waste of time.

228
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,810
Wait for me as I get you a new dose of medicine.

229
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,800
I tested him yesterday. That Third Young Master Mei really cannot see.

230
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,030
Even when the spider was about to crawl to his neck,

231
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,490
he didn't react at all.

232
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,700
I guess this is considered good news.

233
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,670
Qiu Hua, how about you?

234
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,380
I haven't heard any news about the princess.

235
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,420
I also haven't heard any news of Father He from the Paradise Gambling House.

236
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,480
Since I didn't marry into the mountain (fort),

237
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,810
they didn't kill my father, did they?

238
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,020
They wouldn't have, the gambling house wouldn't do that.

239
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,430
Xiao Wanzi, don't worry too much.

240
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,560
Your father will be fine.

241
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,670
Second Madam is here.

242
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Princess, you look content.

243
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,870
Second Madam, since you're personally here, is there anything you need?

244
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,390
Doesn't Shiqing keep getting injured? I brought some tonics.

245
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,420
Princess, I will trouble you to nourish him.

246
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,760
Thank you for your kindness, Second Madam.

247
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,060
Does Shiqing treat you well?

248
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,460
Don't just see Third Young Master as he is now.

249
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,530
Before his eyes went bad,

250
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,620
he was famous for

251
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,600
being a ladies' man with eyes on the top of his head. (Arrogant)

252
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,020
In this Qingzhou City, not a single lady

253
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,470
caught his eye.

254
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,400
Except for that...

255
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,910
that singer at the Ruyi Restaurant.

256
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,530
Second Madam, that's all in the past.

257
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,680
Right now, I think that as long as he stays by my side, it's enough.

258
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,730
Then I've said the wrong thing.

259
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,440
I won't say anymore.

260
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,310
Look at my memory. Give it to me.

261
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,000
Princess,

262
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,630
I have a hairpin that

263
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,610
I think suits you perfectly.

264
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,030
I hope you will like

265
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,240
my small token of appreciation.

266
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,190
- Here.
- I-It's probably not right of me to receive a reward without doing anything, right?

267
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,390
However, this is a small token of kindness from an elder after all.

268
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,800
If I don't accept it, it will seem

269
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,280
I'm being inconsiderate of your affection. Anyway, thank you, Second Madam.

270
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,850
As long as you like it, that's great.

271
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,520
There are too few womenfolk in this family.

272
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,590
I'm absolutely delighted that you could marry into this family.

273
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,790
I hope that when you have time in the future, you'll come and chat with me often.

274
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,690
Most definitely! I'm someone who loves to chat.

275
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,260
Isn't Third Young Master usually unwell?

276
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,400
I was afraid you'd be overly bored

277
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,930
so I even prepared a big surprise for Your Highness.

278
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,300
Just wait and see.

279
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,820
I'm also someone who likes surprises very much!

280
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,790
Thank you so much, Second Madam.

281
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,120
You'll like it for sure!

282
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,970
Then I won't disturb Your Highness any longer.

283
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,990
Rest well. Rest well.

284
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,640
Then take care, Second Madam.

285
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,630
Come by often.

286
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,390
All right!

287
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,750
- Farewell, Princess.
- Farewell.

288
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,900
What was she here for?

289
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,510
Shiqing, I think that...

290
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,060
Second Madam is quite nice. She even brought you tonics.

291
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,210
Throw them away.

292
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,170
They're so expensive. Don't throw them away!

293
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,850
All right, all right. I'll throw them away.

294
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,890
I just think that although the Second Madam is a problematic person,

295
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,420
the tonics are not. It'd be a shameful waste.

296
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,550
There's nothing else?

297
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,400
- No.
- Really?

298
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,580
Why would I lie to you?

299
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,200
Besides, I'm a princess.

300
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,880
Would I easily bow down for such a small favor?

301
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,960
How funny.

302
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,290
I hope that is so.

303
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,920
Siheng, take me for a walk outside.

304
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,170
Madam, you don't like Third Young Master Mei,

305
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,640
so why did you bring him tonics?

306
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,130
You don't understand, do you?

307
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,350
Those things have been sitting around for so long.

308
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,760
They would just continue to sit there. By gifting them to him,

309
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,660
I'm just seeking the princess's personal favor.

310
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,060
Madam, you are wise.

311
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,120
There are many of those things.

312
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,710
Remember when you're delivering things there from now on,

313
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,320
to be more clever and inquire about some news.

314
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,810
Yes.

315
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,600
Wait.

316
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,080
How is it going with what I ordered you to do?

317
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,650
Rest assured, Madam. In regards to what you have instructed us to do,

318
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,120
all the servants are doing well.

319
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,900
The princess has just entered the manor,

320
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,820
so it naturally takes some effort to bring her to our side.

321
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,640
You are more familiar with Second Madam, so do you know what she is showing us?

322
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,100
I only know that in order to make you happy,

323
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
she put in quite a bit of effort.

324
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,240
You're not jealous that I have better relations with the people in this manor, right?

325
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,560
My Lord, look, they're here.

326
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,280
- Princess.
- Second Madam, what exactly do you want to show us?

327
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,590
Today, I spent a lot of money to invite the best acrobatic troupe

328
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,000
to relieve everyone's boredom.

329
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,190
Come on, let's go onto the platform.

330
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,340
Let them begin.

331
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,240
- Yes.
- My Lord, let's go.
- Let's go.

332
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,310
Have a seat.

333
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,920
My Lord, the acrobatic troupe that I invited today

334
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,970
has a unique skill that is especially famous.

335
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,470
She even spent a lot of money to invite an acrobatic troupe?

336
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,280
My father and I are the best.

337
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,120
Speaking of Father,

338
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,050
I don't know where he is right now.

339
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,930
I, Wang Haiquan, am the leader of the Qiankun Troupe.

340
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,020
I pay my respects to General and Madam.

341
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,560
I pay my respects to Young Master and Princess.

342
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,650
Our troupe has ventured about Jianghu for a long time.

343
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,980
We will definitely give everyone a good show.

344
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,960
The princess is here today so perform well.

345
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,950
Since Madam has praised us then we shall show our humble incompetence.

346
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,990
[Safe, Peaceful Life]

347
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,550
- Great!
- Amazing!

348
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,390
- Impressive! Great!
- Amazing!

349
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,950
Next is our main event:

350
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,150
the Boulder-Shattering Chest. From our esteemed audience,

351
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,630
who dares to come forth and try?

352
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,400
Me!

353
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,130
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

354
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,150
Second Young Master.

355
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,250
Take the hammer.

356
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,080
It's pretty heavy.

357
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,940
My goodness.

358
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,470
Young Master, did you not rest well last night?

359
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,140
Here, let me.

360
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,000
Let me! Let me, let me! Let me!

361
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,350
Let me!

362
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,590
I'm here.

363
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,380
Princess, you must not.

364
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,110
Don't worry, move aside.

365
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,420
Princess, your body is delicate and precious. You should not do it.

366
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,220
It's fine. Don't worry.

367
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,890
Princess, you are indeed a woman who is not inferior to men.

368
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,510
Oh no, I've blown my cover.

369
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,810
If it weren't for all of my hits earlier, there's no way she could have broken it!

370
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,620
Right! Exactly.

371
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,830
I... Well, I took advantage of your work.

372
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,650
Thank you, Second Young Master.

373
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,870
Princess, let me have the hammer.

374
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,050
Princess Lu Yingyao doesn't speak or act with a noble demeanor at all.

375
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,440
Instead, she seems like someone from Jianghu.

376
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,150
I didn't scare you just now, did I?

377
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,740
No.

378
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,720
Say, you cannot see,

379
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,640
so why do you come to the study all day long?

380
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,340
Since I cannot see, why don't you read to me?

381
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,920
What is it?

382
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,200
I caught a cold so my throat doesn't feel well.

383
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,980
Since that's the case, then I won't bother you.

384
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,540
What auspicious day is it today?

385
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,230
I should conscientiously go back to the room and stay there.

386
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:00,540
Shiqing, you have a good rest. I will return to the room.

387
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,770
Hold on.

388
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,160
Shiqing, what is it?

389
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,830
In a few days, it will be my tutor's birthday.

390
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,250
I want you to help me write a letter.

391
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,030
Write a letter? That's such a private matter.

392
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,630
I shouldn't write it for you.

393
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,720
I don't mind. We are husband and wife.

394
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,400
Who else is closer than us?

395
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,080
Who's close with you?

396
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,500
Could it be... that you do not know how to write?

397
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,550
What a joke! I...

398
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,940
How could a princess possibly not know how to write?

399
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,790
Of course, I can write.

400
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,940
Fine, I'll write it. You cannot see anyway.

401
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,440
Come on.

402
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,290
Tell me. What do you want to be written?

403
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,410
I'll dictate and you write.

404
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,520
"Admirable Tutor, please accept my respects.

405
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,730
It has been many days since we parted.

406
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,120
I wonder if your health is well.

407
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,920
The weather in the capital changes often.

408
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,020
I hope you are taking good care of your health."

409
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,270
Continue. You don't have to wait for me. I write very quickly.

410
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,320
"My body is not well so I cannot attend your birthday banquet.

411
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
I am really remorseful."

412
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,820
Fortunately, my father taught me a few words before.

413
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,320
It seems to be of use.

414

[Boulder-Shattering Chest]

415
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,860
Bad news! Qiao Yun, bad news!

416
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,720
- What is it?
- Third Young Master Mei just asked me to write a letter!

417
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,330
Do you know how to write?

418
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:20,440
I don't know. I only know how to write "Boulder-Shattering Chest".

419
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,220
What did Third Young Master Mei say to you?

420
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,160
- He said "Thank you, Admirable Tutor".
- "Thank you, Admirable Tutor."

421
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,300
- He just told him to take care of his health and that he can't attend...
- Take care of his health...

422
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,780
- the birthday banquet.
- Can't attend the birthday banquet?

423
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,150
- Take care of his health...
- Princess!

424
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,410
Xiao Ruan, what are you doing here?

425
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,360
I am here to deliver something from Second Madam. She has emphasized that

426
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,380
this is a special medicine for Third Young Master Mei to strengthen his body.

427
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,480
Just put it here.

428
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,480
Are you making soup? I am the best at that. Do you need help?

429
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,350
You're looking down on us right now, Xiao Ruan.

430
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,630
Please do not misunderstand, Older Sister.

431
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,990
Then I will not bother you any longer.

432
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm leaving.

433
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,690
Quickly go write a letter to replace the one I wrote.

434
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,730
It will be bad if he sends it.

435
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,410
All right. Then help me look after the soup. I will be back soon.

436
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,310
Yes, yes.

437
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,130
Such top-quality supplements. He's really privileged.

Let's nourish him some more.

439

That quickly?

440
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,540
The meaning is about the same.

441
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,850
If you send it now,

442
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,890
then the meaning is about the same which is fine.

443
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,860
Quickly go. Quickly.

444
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,390
Run faster! Don't expose yourself!

445
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,910
