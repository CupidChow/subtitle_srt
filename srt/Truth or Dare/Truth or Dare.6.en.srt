4
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,940
Wait.

5
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm giving it to you.

6
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,000
Farewell.

7
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,000
What an idiot.

8
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,000
However, I want to leave here very badly.

9
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,440
Your subordinates will come and save you.

10
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,240
Don't blame me for being ungrateful.

11
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,820
I'm leaving.

12
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,940
Are you leaving just like that?

13
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,150
You don't know how to repay one's kindness at all.

14
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,530
If you leave like this, I'll be sad.

15
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,950
Do you think you can just do as you please because you saved me?

16
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,990
I didn't do anything.

17
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,230
If you dare do anything, I'll... die in front of you!

18
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,340
Don't! Don't!

19
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,550
As long as you obediently go back with me,

20
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,770
I promise I won't do anything to you.

21
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,600
But I seriously don't want to marry Nan Batian, that old and ugly bastard.

22
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,170
Xiao Wanzi, I, Master Bao, have wandered this land for so many years.

23
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,450
Don't worry, as long as I'm here,

24
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,920
I won't let you suffer one bit.

25
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,410
- Xiao Bao.
- Yes?
- How about this?

26
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,530
Let's find a paradise away from the turmoils of this world

27
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,750
and live there together forever.

28
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,700
I'll have a bunch of children with you.

29
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,450
What do you think?

30
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,120
With me?

31
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,930
Have a bunch of children?

32
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,640
From then on, we'll live happily as a family,

33
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,440
never ever separating.

34
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,710
Then, what are our children's names?

35
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,160
We'll call them...

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,810
Xiao Baozi! What do you think?
(Xiao Wanzi - 'little meatball' and Xiao Baozi - 'little steamed bun')

37
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,340
Then, we'll have a Xiao Jiaozi.
(Xiao Jiaozi - 'little dumpling')

38
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,440
- What are you doing?
- Did you really take me for a three-year-old child?

39
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,650
My godfather says that a woman's mouth is full of lies.

40
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,860
- Let me down!
- Obediently return to the fort with me!

41
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,400
You're insane! Let me go!

42
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,640
- Master Bao!
- They're here!

43
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,730
- Master Bao is sure amazing!
- Let me go!

44
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,210
Master Bao, don't work too hard!

45
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,280
Look at Master Bao!

46
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,190
Nice!

47
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,960
This won't do.

48
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Even if this girl doesn't run away by herself,

49
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,360
she'll be stolen by that kid sooner or later.

50
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,250
I need to come up with a plan.

51
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,920
Let go of me!

52
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,740
You're insane, right?

53
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,110
After the pains of last night, aren't you tired? I'm almost tired to death.

54
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,850
I hate you so much.

55
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,450
Hate me? There are so many people who hate me.

56
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,630
Who do you think you are?

57
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,320
I'll never like you in this lifetime.

58
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,550
- Then in the next life.
- It won't happen in the next life either!

59
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,910
By the way, aren't you trying to avoid my godfather?

60
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,920
I already found your solution.

61
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,280
Here, the thing you wanted.

62
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,050
Really? You really got it?

63
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,380
Now he won't dare get close to me ever again.

64
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,390
Are you for real?

65
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,530
Is it that powerful?

66
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,310
You may not have seen it but the princess has been holding a man's cloak today and has been in a daze all morning.

67
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,030
- The cloak doesn't belong to our Third Young Master either!
- What?

68
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,160
As a princess, how can she do something so absurd?

69
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,670
If Third Young Master finds out, how will he feel?

70
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,800
- Hey, the princess is coming!
- Quickly go!

71
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,740
- What is it?
- This!

72
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,820
The whole Mei Manor knows about

73
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,320
you holding another man's cloak!

74
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,350
Do you know who gave me this cloak?

75
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,790
It was the Night-Spirited Hero!

76
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,110
His scent still lingers on it. Hey!

77
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,800
Stinky hand.

78
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,990
Even if I tell you two, you won't get it.

79
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,990
The Night-Spirited Hero eliminates evil, brings peace to the people, and upholds justice.

80
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,770
He's romantic and caring, too.

81
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,090
No wonder he's someone I've admired for so long!

82
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,490
Is that Night-Spirited Hero as great as you claim him to be?

83
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,100
I think he's just tricking gullible girls like you!

84
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,680
You can slander me, but you can't slander my hero!

85
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,290
- Hero? What can you do to me?
- I—

86
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,410
Young Master.

87
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,760
Your friend from the capital, Fang Wenhuai, came to visit.

88
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,120
He also brought his younger sister. They're already in the entry hall.

89
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,460
- Brother Fang is here? Quickly take me there.
- All right.

90
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,270
Someone from the capital has come! Most of them have seen the princess before.

91
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,310
You must not let them know, or else your cover will be blown!

92
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,940
Fang Wenhuai?

93
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,890
I remember that the prince and the Fang family do not have much contact.

94
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,090
- It should be fine.
- Who is that?

95
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,660
What wind blew you here, Brother Fang?

96
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,400
Shiqing, I wasn't able to come to your wedding.

97
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,870
- Today, I have time so I especially came to visit.
- Thank you for your trouble.

98
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,280
By the way, why do I not see your wife?

99
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,510
She is unwell so she's unable to see guests for now. Please forgive us.

100
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,580
Princess and I are old acquaintances.

101
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,880
Since I have come here from afar,

102
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,190
no matter what, I want to catch up with the princess.

103
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,140
I can also see how her illness is while I'm at it.

104
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,340
Stop dragging your feet, I also want to see your wife.

105
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,120
Let's go.

106
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,600
It's over, it's over. It's over for real this time.

107
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,280
They even said they are some kind of old acquaintances.

108
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,820
First, calm down a bit. I really don't remember what connection

109
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,910
this Fang Yuhan and the princess have.

110
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,210
But, it's fine. In a bit, just say that you're sick.

111
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,720
I've already prepared the medicinal soup for you.

112
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,470
They're here, they're here! Hurry, hurry.

113
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,370
Princess, Wenhuai and Yuhan have come to see you.

114
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,250
I'm unwell so I'm unable to receive you.

115
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,090
My apologies.

116
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,990
Princess, do you remember me, Fang Yuhan?

117
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,840
Back then, at Ninth Prince's birthday banquet,

118
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,890
I was fortunate enough to meet you.

119
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,170
Back then, we had great conversations as if we were best of friends.

120
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,800
I remember.

121
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,430
Princess, you have now married into here, yet your body is still unwell.

122
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,780
I am fine. Don't worry.

123
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Qiao Yun, the princess hasn't taken her medicine yet, right? Give it to her first.

124
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,220
That's right. The medicine is getting cold. I will help her take it now.

125
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,850
Brother Fang, the princess still has to take her medicine so let's not bother her for now.

126
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,260
Let's leave now.

127
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,310
It has been so long since the princess and I last saw each other, so please let me help feed her.

128
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,280
- Your Highness.
- No need, no need!

129
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,550
- I am ill, I am afraid I will give it to you.
- It's all right, I will help you.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,110
Princess, you... you've changed so much!

131
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,570
You are prettier than ten years ago!

132
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,900
Your body is plumper than before as well.

133
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,980
Turns out she only met the princess over ten years ago.

134
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,690
I was scared to death.

135
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,850
Perhaps because I am well-fed here in the Prince Manor.

136
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,670
Then let's eat dinner together tonight and catch up with each other.

137
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,200
No need. I haven't been well lately so you all may go.

138
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,510
I heard guests have come to the manor today.

139
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,650
I, Fang Wenhuai, greet Second Madam.

140
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,880
No need for such formalities. You are our guest.

141
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,750
Second Madam.

142
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,240
This lady is...

143
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,520
My surname is Fang, given name is Yuhan.

144
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,380
I am Brother Wenhuai's younger sister from the same clan.

145
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,080
I specifically came from the capital to see Young Master Mei and the princess.

146
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,200
So you're my niece.
 (Not related. It's an address to show generation and hierarchy.)

147
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,630
Since you have come from afar,

148
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,760
please make yourself at home.

149
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,960
I will certainly take good care of you.

150
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,860
Since they are my guests, there's no need to trouble Second Madam.

151
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,170
Since they are Third Young Master's guests,

152
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,440
then it's better for you to make arrangements for them.

153
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,160
If our noble guests want to stay longer,

154
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,290
you must let me do my duties as a host and treat this as your own home.

155
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,490
Deceitful.

156
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,990
Brother and Sister, you have come from afar to see me and the princess

157
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,460
so I will definitely give you a grand welcome.

158
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,450
Siheng, take Qiao Yun and the rest with you to situate the guests.

159
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,800
Yes.

160
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,150
This way, please.

161
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,790
Get up. Stop pretending and freshen up.

162
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,620
Do I have to go as well?

163
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,340
Of course. They are here to specifically to see you.

164
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,520
I really don't want to go.

165
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,850
You don't have a choice.

166
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,580
Later, speak less and adapt to the changing circumstance, all right?

167
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,450
What if I give myself away?

168
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,810
Is Prince Consort here?

169
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,590
You are here? Then I will come out first.

170
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,880
Just stay there.

171
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,050
You can't see anyway and it saves me the trouble of helping you out.

172
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,920
All right.

173
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,630
What is he doing?

174
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,680
Are you not feeling well?

175
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,160
Why do you keep drinking water? Your face is very red, too.

176
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,100
N-No. I-I'm just a bit...

177
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,950
I'm just a bit... hot.

178
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,250
You and that Fang Yuhan have not seen each other in over ten years so you two may be distant.

179
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,950
Don't worry, I am here. Eat in peace.

180
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,390
Do you see my achievements?

181
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,550
The sun is rising from the west!
(This is unbelievable!)

182
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,240
How do you, a ball of ice, know to care for a lady?

183
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,990
Nonsense.

184
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,820
So darn stubborn and still in denial.

185
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,330
Let's go. I'll help you out.

186
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,270
Brother and Sister, you have come from afar to Qingzhou

187
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,260
to visit us both; thus, I shall give you a toast as a sign of respect.

188
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,560
Please.

189
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,020
I came very hastily. I should have told you in advance.

190
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,000
Seeing Older Sister's demeanor today,

191
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,580
I feel that Third Young Master didn't marry the wrong person.

192
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,490
I am obviously younger than you,

193
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,780
yet you have the nerve to call me "older sister."

194
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,360
It looks like she doesn't come with good intentions.

195
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,600
Yuhan is young and doesn't know how to speak,

196
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,720
I hope Princess does not mind.

197
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,010
Why would I?

198
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,750
Bygones with this wine, cheers!

199
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,460
Cheers.

200
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,450
Let's have one more cup.

201
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,360
Let me pour it for you.

202
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,070
- Here.
- All right.

203
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,020
Your Highness, you are still recovering so do not drink as much, all right?

204
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,660
In a moment of happiness, I've drunk too much.

205
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,060
Princess has just gotten well so you should not drink too much and be mindful of your health.

206
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,930
Don't worry, we have just started.

207
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,950
I will also give a toast to Brother Shiqing...

208
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,380
to show my admiration.

209
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,460
Older Sister, the flowers over there are blooming beautifully.

210
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,500
Can you accompany me to take a look at them?

211
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,790
All right. I'll accompany you.

212
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,760
Older Sister, there is something

213
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,350
I don't know if I should tell you or not.

214
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,190
What is there that should or should not be told?

215
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,600
If there is anything, feel free to tell me.

216
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,620
Princess, when Third Young Master went to the capital to study,

217
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,560
he and I actually had a relationship.

218
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,830
Back then, I was mesmerized by his scholarship and martial arts.

219
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,200
He also saw me as his female confidante.

220
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,010
Our families had always wanted to arrange our marriage until you...

221
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,990
Yuhan, I was actually forced into this as well and had no choice.

222
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,060
A lot of things are just fate.

223
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,690
Princess, I understand it all.

224
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,850
Third Young Master Mei is someone who thinks for the world.

225
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,750
For his family, he gave up love.

226
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,130
He also had no choice.

227
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,960
Princess Sister, I have a hard favor to ask.

228
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,330
Tell me. As long as I can help, I will surely help.

229
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,630
I hope you and Third Young Master will have mutual love and no hostility.

230
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,870
Then I will be content.

231
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,060
Mei Shiqing, you don't deserve this face of yours!

232
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,920
I didn't expect you to be a hypocrite who looks like a person but behaves like a dog.

233
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,120
- What did I do?
- You tell me what you did!

234
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,000
You're still acting? Why are you acting as (innocent) as a little white bunny?

235
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,560
From what I see, you're just an unfaithful... c-cabbage!

236
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,530
How am I unfaithful?

237
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,860
Fang Yuhan, your female confidante!

238
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,460
When did I become a confidant with her?

239
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,100
The total number of sentences I've said to her doesn't exceed five!

240
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,130
When you studied in the capital, you and her become confidants.

241
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,690
Then she fell for you.

242
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,620
When I was in the capital, I-I've always treated her like a younger sister.

243
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,400
She was the one clinging to me.

244
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,590
Younger Sister?

245
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,730
Then, how many younger sisters do you have in the capital?

246
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,700
How will we continue our lives if these younger sisters keep showing up?

247
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,570
She likes me. What can I do?

248
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,700
I've seen arrogance but I've never seen someone as arrogant as you.

249
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,660
Divorce me and just go marry her.

250
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,730
Princess, is that something you should be saying?

251
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,560
Our marriage was an imperial bestowment.

252
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,500
We have to think of a way to make them leave.

253
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,800
How?

254
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,900
I need your cooperation for that.

255
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,620
How do I cooperate?

256
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,890
We have to pretend to be a loving couple.

257
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,630
To have her think that I'm only with you.

258
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,460
So she can completely give up on me.

259
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,430
I'm saying, I've already married you, a bad-tempered woman,

260
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,330
and one is enough for me.

261
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,590
In the future, can you only say the first half of your sentence?

262
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,460
Every time you get to the second half, I wish that you'd get crippled!

263
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,670
If I were crippled, then wouldn't you be the one to suffer?

264
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,030
I...

265
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,030
[Green Dragon Fort]

266
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,560
Chief.

267
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,090
- Good work. You may leave.
- Okay.

268
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,690
- That...
- Yes?

269
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:42,300
No matter what sounds come from here in a bit,

270
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,170
just pretend that nothing is happening.

271
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,640
Chief, please.

272
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,800
Xiao Wanzi.

273
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
Xiao Wanzi?

274
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,780
Xiao Wanzi?

275
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,800
Xiao Wanzi.

276
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,800
You must have been scared lately.

277
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,600
I have specifically come to see you.

278
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,400
No need. I don't want to see anyone right now.

279
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,400
Xiao Wanzi, you may not know,

280
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
but when I first saw you,

281
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,200
my soul was taken by you.

282
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Lately, I've been thinking of you.

283
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,300
So much so that I cannot sleep at night.

284
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,000
As long as you be with me,

285
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,200
I will guarantee that you will have a lavish life and never suffer.

286
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I won't be with you!

287
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,700
That is not up to you.

288
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,100
Today, you must yield

289
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,600
whether you want to or not!

290
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,700
Ghost!

291
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,200
W-Who are you?

292
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,400
I am Xiao Wanzi.

293
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,300
Xiao Wanzi?

294
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,200
H-How did you b-become like this?

295
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,600
I contradicted some kind of skin disease.

296
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
- I heard it's contagious!
- No, no, no!

297
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,200
Xiao Wanzi, don't come over here.

298
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,000
It better for a lady to have more self-respect.

299
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'll... I'll c-come to see you in a few days!

300
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,800
G-Goodbye. G-Goodbye!

301
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,700
Goodbye.

302
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Open the door!

303
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,000
Ghost, it's a ghost!

304
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,120
You scared my godfather into that state. Amazing.

305
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Say, it's quite effective.

306
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,100
Right?

307
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,600
But this is just temporary. Fortunately, he gave up on what he wanted this time.

308
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,000
That's right.

309
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,600
- By the way,
- Yes?

310
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,800
does it feel uncomfortable? When will you recover?

311
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,000
This kind of rash normally takes one or two days to recover from.

312
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,500
However, I need to have that medicinal herb ready all the time.

313
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,800
What if he comes back in the future? You stinky men are all alike.

314
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
You only like girls with pretty appearances.

315
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,600
What do you mean "stinky men"? Let me tell you, I am not the same.

316
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
What I like is on the inside.

317
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,000
Today, why don't we...

318
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,600
Get out right now. If you don't leave,

319
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,000
I-I'll die right in front of you.

320
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,400
You're going to die in front of me again? I don't even know how many times it's been now.

321
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,500
All right, all right! I'll leave.

322
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
We've already investigated and there is no such person in Qingzhou City.

323
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I have not found a trace of him on any of the paths.

324
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,700
A person cannot disappear into thin air.

325
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,400
I don't believe that he won't ever show his face.

326
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,600
By the way, all the goods recorded here are everything that was stolen by the bandits.

327
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,100
This pawnshop is the bandit's den.

328
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,600
I will have someone investigate his relationship with Green Dragon Fort.

329
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,400
Be careful.

330
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,800
Wenhuai. Yuhan.
 [Mei Manor]

331
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,400
Make yourself at home when you're here in my Mei Manor.

332
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,900
Just treat it like it's your home and be casual.

333
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,800
Thank you, Uncle, for your hospitality. My sister and I are thankful.

334
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,200
Good. Let's have dinner then.

335
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,200
"'Guan, guan!" goes the ospreys on the islet in the river."
 (Poem, "Ospreys' Cries," by Zhou Nan)

336
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,400
"The modest, virtuous young lady is a fine match to the gentleman."

337
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Miss Yuhan, I am Second Young Master Mei. I have long heard of you.

338
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,800
Now that I have met you, you are indeed extraordinary, with the looks of a goddess.

339
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,200
Second Young Master Mei, you flatter me.

340
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I am saying the truth. When I first saw you, Miss Yuhan,

341
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,400
I felt an inexplicable familiarity toward you like I've seen you somewhere before.

342
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,200
Do you believe in fate?

343
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,900
That's great!

344
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,800
I also believe in fate.

345
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,600
Maybe we met in our previous lives.

346
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,400
Shiyuan...

347
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,900
Miss Yuhan cannot eat with you standing there.

348
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,800
Come and sit.

349
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,200
Drink some soup.

350
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,200
I am so used to drinking the soup you make, this is tasteless.

351
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,130
Older Sister, Third Young Master eyes are inconvenient right now,

352
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,600
it must be hard on you to take care of him.

353
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,200
There are some things... he won't let me do though.

354
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
Is it because you can't do them?

355
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
Is it because I don't want the princess to have grievances.

356
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
Nowadays, the Ninth Prince Manor is no longer as it was before.

357
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,600
To be able to marry such a good husband, what kind of grievances could she have?

358
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,200
Yuhan, do not speak such nonsense.

359
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
As an official's daughter,

360
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,200
making such criticism about my father-in-law in front of everyone

361
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
is not very proper, is it?

362
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,500
My father is also a second rank official in the imperial court.

363
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm just thinking that if I were Older Sister Yingyao,

364
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,600
I would be more considerate than her.

365
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Although Yingyao is a princess, she does not have a haughty attitude at all.

366
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,000
I am very happy with her.

367
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
As for your imperious temper, as a daughter from a wealthy family, I cannot tolerate it one bit.

368
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,200
Besides, I've never liked you.

369
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Young people, don't suppress your thoughts in your hearts.

370
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,000
It is all good once everything is spoken out.

371
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,800
The Princess of the Ninth Prince Manor and our Shiqing

372
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,600
are very much in love. As for how they act with one another,

373
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,000
let us not worry about it from now on.

374
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,700
The food is getting cold, so let's eat.

375
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,200
Get some food, get some food!

376
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,000
Come on.

377
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,400
Have a shrimp.

378
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,800
Here.

379
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,980
Miss, careful.

380
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,400
Shiqing, we came to see you as we were passing by and have caused trouble, I'm very sorry.

381
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Brother Fang, you are too polite. In the future, when we have time, let's get together again.
 [Mei Manor]

382
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,800
Yuhan is still young. If she was out of place in any way, please forgive her.

383
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,200
I also thank you for your care.

384
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,600
There are still many days ahead.

385
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,400
Brother Fang, have a safe journey.

386
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,000
I also hope that your eyes get well soon.

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
- Take care.
- Take care.

388
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,000
If you have time, come often to play! The Mei Manor always welcomes you!

389
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,900
Is the princess still not awake?

390
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
Prince Consort, Princess was overjoyed today.

391
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,600
She is not good with alcohol so please do not fault her, Prince Consort.

392
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,000
You all may leave. I will take care of her.

393
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

394
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Wake up. Get up!

395
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
Hey, get up. This is my bed.

396
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,300
You!

397
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,500
Siheng, is it you?

398
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,800
Why won't you even give me water to drink?
