1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,320
It's her.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,110
She asked me to do this.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,550
I took a lot of benefits from her.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,400
Don't slander me.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,710
Miss

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,630
Jingya.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,190
I treat you well. Why are you doing this?

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,800
Miss

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,070
Sister-in-law is so kind.

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,150
Why did you frame her to drive a wedge between us?

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,670
You know,

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,590
I

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:44,920
Jingya.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,630
Do you think it's the last time

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,510
You're punished for spreading rumors.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,360
So you have a grudge.

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,630
That's why I did it.

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,480
Miss

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,550
Miss, I was wrong.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,760
Miss, I was wrong.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,070
Miss, I was wrong.

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,320
What's the use of begging?

23
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,920
But I think sister-in-law is so kind.

24
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,030
I won't care about you.

25
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,280
Miss White Lotus.

26
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,920
Don't kidnap me with morality.

27
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,590
And did something wrong.

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,000
It's time to send the officials.

29
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,550
The penalty.

30
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,000
Now you're dumb. Say something.

31
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,710
You're right.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,510
It's Jing Ruo's fault.

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,030
Jing Ruo is here to apologize to you.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,150
Don't come to those empty things.

35
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,440
Didn't you just say that

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,710
Do I have to pick from the box?

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,670
I think the whole box is good.

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,880
It's just some things.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,360
As long as you're happy.

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,670
I can't be happy.

41
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,760
A dog riding on your head.

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,280
Why am I so happy?

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,110
Jingruo.

44
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,840
Since your people made a mistake,

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,070
I shouldn't have punished him.

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,840
But you hurt my wife.

47
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,510
You can't be punished.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,320
It's nonsense.

49
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,880
Miss

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,400
Brother Junyao.

51
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,280
Can't you be lenient?

52
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,800
Let go of me.

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,510
let go

54
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,230
You're hurting me.

55
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,230
Let go of me!

56
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,670
Anyway, I've figured out what happened today.

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,550
If there's nothing else,

58
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,630
I won't join you.

59
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,800
sorry

60
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,920
Ah

61
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,070
what

62
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,480
I said,

63
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,550
I'm sorry about today.

64
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,920
When I heard them talking about you,

65
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,360
I was so angry.

66
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,360
It doesn't matter.

67
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,880
It's not a big deal.

68
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,400
I just think as a general,

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,880
If you don't have the ability to tell right from wrong,

70
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,400
Many innocent people will get hurt.

71
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,320
I know.

72
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,110
I'll pay attention to it next time.

73
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,230
The sound of milk.

74
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,000
hallucination

75
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,710
What's your situation today?

76
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,590
Why did you change your temper suddenly?

77
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,400
Let me ask you something.

78
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,670
What is your relationship with Nangong Hao?

79
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,150
The Company Men

80
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,000
I won't allow you to get too close to him.

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,960
Why not?

82
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,030
It's not allowed.

83
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,360
You're too overbearing.

84
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,400
He gave me the money to open the restaurant.

85
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,960
I can't open a restaurant without his money. I'll open it with my face.

86
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,550
What are you doing?

87
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,030
Why women are easier to forgive men.

88
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,550
Don't want to forgive a woman.

89
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,760
Zixuan

90
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,230
Do you also think that the thing I did yesterday

91
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,280
It's a little too much.

92
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,480
With the general's ability,

93
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,630
It's not a small matter to deal with this.

94
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,190
Do you know why it is like this?

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,760
Because I'm an outsider.

96
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,550
Actually, you care about her.

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,150
Because I care.

98
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,030
That's why you want to know the result.

99
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,550
Because I care.

100
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,400
You will be carried away by your emotions.

101
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,000
Because I care.

102
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,360
In summary

103
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,070
Based on my years of experience in martial arts,

104
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,670
Are you in love with her?

105
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,360
Are you kidding me?

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,150
I would never like her.

107
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,920
She's not only plain but also messy and lazy.

108
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,110
Especially when you're a money-grubbing junkie.

109
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,840
It's not good at all.

110
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,920
I don't even want to look at her. I like her.

111
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,920
Naughty boy.

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,920
What's that look?

113
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,030
general

114
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,440
Madam made you a meal.

115
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,760
Open it.

116
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,070
What kind of noodles is this?

117
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,280
This is

118
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
Brazilian steak

119
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,880
Baked potato with rosemary

120
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,150
Butter garlic shrimp

121
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,070
general

122
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,760
You're right. She's a good cook.

123
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,760
These dishes

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,360
Ordinary people can't imagine it.

125
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,070
general

126
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,590
You can't finish all these dishes.

127
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,440
I

128
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,030
You just ignored her.

129
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,510
In a flash,

130
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,880
To protect the food.

131
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,590
roll

132
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,710
Alright.

133
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,920
Miss

134
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,710
Is Jing Ya all right?

135
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,960
Miss

136
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,400
You don't have to say much.

137
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,590
I know it in my heart.

138
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,360
I won't treat you unfairly in the future.

139
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,190
Miss

140
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,070
I'm your maid.

141
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,840
I will do whatever you want.

142
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,440
If His Highness hadn't supported her this time,

143
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,190
She's not your opponent.

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,190
Su Qian,

145
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,000
I hope you have such good luck every time.

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,230
The Nangong Hao seems interesting.

147
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,110
Miss

148
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,960
She can handle Su Qian Qian.

149
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,070
Of course.

150
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,360
In the Su family, Su Qian is most afraid of her.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,390
interesting
