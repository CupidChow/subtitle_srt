1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,480
Madam

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,360
My lady is delicate.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
Don't apply the needle randomly.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
to feel relieved

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,190
I promise I'll give it to you when you wake up.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,630
General, don't do that.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,960
I can't let her prick Miss.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,800
Just put your heart in your belly.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,590
Brother Junyao.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,190
Jingruo.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,280
Are you awake?

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,400
Brother Junyao.

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,840
What's wrong with me?

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:38,800
Jingruo.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,670
Why am I here?

16
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,150
Fierce

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,150
Jingruo.

18
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,480
Are you sick?

19
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,000
That's right.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,960
Jingruo,

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,920
The doctor said

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,030
You have a heart condition.

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,190
Acupuncture.

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,480
I'll give you a shot now.

25
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,440
Don't bother me.

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,400
Now,

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,840
Is almost fine.

28
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,150
Jingruo.

29
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,880
Are you really OK?

30
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,320
Brother Junyao.

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,630
I saw you

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,110
My illness will be cured.

33
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,440
Silly girl.

34
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,710
Tomorrow.

35
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,510
I'll find two famous doctors.

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,480
To treat you.

37
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,920
No need, Junyao.

38
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,960
I'm not sick.

39
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,880
Actually, I just need some time.

40
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,280
Take a good rest.

41
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,630
Brother Junyao.

42
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,920
Don't worry too much.

43
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,880
Miss

44
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,400
Why don't you find a time

45
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,400
Let the general

46
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,710
To pray for peace with you.

47
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,360
to make trouble

48
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,000
Junyao has heavy military duties.

49
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,630
Why does he have time?

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,800
Stay with me.

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,440
What about the love affair?

52
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,230
You should repay her kindness as a child.

53
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,280
it doesn't matter

54
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,760
She's fine recently.

55
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,400
I'll accompany you to the temple tomorrow.

56
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,400
Alright.

57
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,670
Listen to Junyao.

58
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Are you really OK?

59
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,670
It's okay.

60
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,190
It's no longer possible between me and Jing Ruo.

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,110
It's better to take the chance tomorrow.

62
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,880
And explain to her.

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,070
White lotus flower.

64
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,110
You ruined my good bridal chamber.

65
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,920
I'm not finished with you.

66
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,320
Shallow

67
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,800
Qian, you're awake.

68
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,550
Shallow

69
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,230
mom

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,960
I thought I'd never see you again, mom.

71
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,800
Qian, it's good to see you awake.

72
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,110
I can't live without you.

73
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
I was wrong.

74
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,150
I shouldn't force you to have a blind date.

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,030
Actually, you only need to be healthy.

76
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,630
It's good to be safe with your mother.

77
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,710
I won't force you anymore.

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,030
mom

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,230
It's me.

80
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,670
When I leave the hospital,

81
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,800
I'll find someone to marry.

82
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,510
And stay by your side.

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,320
Mom, sorry.

84
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,440
I neglected your feelings.

85
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,920
I thought you would never leave me.

86
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,400
Shallow

87
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,840
You got it wrong today.

88
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,710
The person who went on a blind date with you,

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
It's not him.

90
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,920
Your Mr. Right.

91
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,480
It's Chu Junyao.

92
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,320
Chu Junyao

93
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,150
dream

94
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,070
What do you mean?

95
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,480
It seems that Chu Junyao must be defeated.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So I can go back to see my mom.

97
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,440
Really, I didn't have any worries at that time.

98
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
The rank of master and servant is too low.

99
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,590
I told my mother-in-law about it in a roundabout way early in the morning.

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,230
So now,

101
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,000
The Great General and Lady Jing Ruo

102
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,030
We went to the temple together.

103
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,070
Am I not clear enough?

104
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,070
I need you to remind me again.

105
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,030
You're really blind.

106
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,280
Miss

107
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,320
I think

108
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,590
Are you jealous?

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,840
It's so obvious.

110
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
It's written on your face.

111
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,510
impossible

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,320
It's so sour.

113
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,510
The noodles I ate yesterday were too sour for my teeth.

114
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,000
Say it again.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,510
Remember to buy me a fake beard.

116
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,360
Today, I'm going to use

117
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,110
Miss, I have something to do.

118
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,280
Have you got anything to do

119
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,230
What's wrong?

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,480
Good thing

121
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,710
Good thing

122
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,190
Ying Ying.

123
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,280
You're here.

124
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,360
You two can do it.

125
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,030
Let's go shopping for you.

126
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,480
Miss, don't be too hard.

127
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,550
Wait

128
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,920
Your general,

129
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,440
I really have no money.

130
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,800
How could he be rich?

131
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,400
He is the poorest official in the capital.

132
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,630
The general's salary and savings are all used to pay the military salaries.

133
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,190
And the soldiers who died.

134
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,320
He will send a lot of subsidies.

135
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,670
Your general

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,150
So noble.

137
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,920
Although the general is usually cold,

138
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,710
Actually, he's kind.

139
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,510
And sincere.

140
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,510
All the soldiers will submit to him.

141
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,190
So the soldiers of the general

142
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,510
Can be invincible.

143
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,000
It seems my money-making plan has to speed up.

144
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,590
Madam

145
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,000
I think

146
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,320
You and the general are a good match.

147
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,670
Come on

148
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,030
Don't say that.

149
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,280
Although I also think so.

150
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,150
You two...

151
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,920
cut

152
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,400
Do you really think they are a good match?

153
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,710
I don't. I think...

154
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,360
I want her to think

155
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,320
Madam

156
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,800
Madam

157
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,230
Old Madam, please welcome.

158
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,030
Mother,

159
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,440
No, no.

160
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,840
Sit down.

161
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,150
You worked hard.

162
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,150
mother

163
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,190
I

164
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,110
I know.

165
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,760
I've been there.

166
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,440
You were so great last night.

167
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,030
My pleasure.

168
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,960
I need to learn more from my mother.

169
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,280
I wish.

170
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,000
Your son didn't cooperate.

171
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,480
What are you waiting for? Come on.

172
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,840
This is

173
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,840
This one.

174
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,840
It's similar to immortal soup.

175
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,070
This is not a supplement.

176
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,840
这是催情药啊

177
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,280
You need to make up for it.

178
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360
It's very good for the fetus.

179
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,670
mother

180
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,550
otherwise

181
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
Let's wait for the general to come back.

182
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,920
Let's drink together.

183
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,880
No need

184
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,400
He has other plans.

185
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,510
This is specially made for you.

186
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,800
Drink it while it's hot.

187
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,840
mother

188
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,000
I just finished eating.

189
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,840
Or

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,150
How about I take it to your room?

191
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,800
Alright.

192
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:10,960
come

193
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,400
fast

194
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,920
Shallow.

195
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,350
I specially prepared this for you.

196
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,030
come

197
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,840
Thank you for tolerating Junyao.

198
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,430
You only met him yesterday.

199
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,720
Today,

200
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,800
mother

201
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,960
Why are you so courteous?

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,800
If Jing Ruo can get married,

203
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,640
Then I'm also happy.

204
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,680
Junyao loves it so much.

205
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,030
He likes me.

206
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,390
Take a look.

207
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,800
Is really a good daughter-in-law of our Chu family.

208
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,000
I really have no resistance to the sugar coated cannonball.

209
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,030
Shallow.

210
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,150
I won't treat you unfairly.

211
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,150
mother

212
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,880
Compared to others,

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,390
The daughter-in-law is living a happy life there.

214
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,190
Do you still have the medicine?

215
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,310
I can still drink it.

216
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,470
Hurry, hurry.

217
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,560
There are several pots.

218
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Aunt Wang, go and get it.
