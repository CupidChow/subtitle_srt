1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,590
in order to

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,840
dry

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,510
dry

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,760
dry

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,840
Eat.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:23,920
Go on. Eat.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,590
You two are endless, right?

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,590
Why are you helping my woman?

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,840
She's my partner.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,480
It's only natural for me to help her.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,710
Shallow

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,960
You are not allowed to eat the food he served.

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:55,920
OK

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,230
Nangong Hao.

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:58,760
Oh, no.

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,150
Your Highness.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,840
Can you be more conscious?

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,960
The so-called gender differences,

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,840
Stop flirting with my male idol.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,670
I was embarrassed.

21
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,630
Good girl.

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,360
A woman?

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,070
None of them are reliable.

24
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,280
In this world,

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,760
Only delicious food can be lived up to.

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,000
Scum!

27
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,920
Do you still have a girl like you?

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,230
You can introduce some to me.

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,960
It's not like you don't know.

30
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,920
I have two snarky sisters above me.

31
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,030
There are some difficult sisters.

32
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,030
If you like them, I will introduce them to you.

33
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,630
I think so.

34
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,400
I'll arrange it.

35
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,920
come

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,510
congratulations

37
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,670
I'm not eating. I...

38
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,110
Eat.

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
It's weird.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,760
The general came to pick up his wife every day.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,710
Why didn't you send a servant today?

42
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,150
Nothing

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,550
Anyway, it's close.

44
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,110
You can go with me then.

45
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,190
Miss

46
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,030
Are you in a bad mood today?

47
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,030
I've been away from home for a long time.

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm homesick.

49
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,710
What is there to think about in that cold home?

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm talking about my real home.

51
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,480
I don't want to celebrate my birthday here.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,190
How could I forget?

53
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,000
Miss, it's your birthday today.

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes?

55
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,070
You want to give a gift?

56
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,960
Give it to me.

57
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,960
Must be sent.

58
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,800
I give you my best wishes.

59
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,030
It's not practical. I don't want it.

60
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,110
cut

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,110
mom

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
I miss you

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,550
What should I do?

64
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,190
Can you teach me?

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,440
strange

66
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,880
Why is there no one here?

67
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,190
Miss

68
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,920
Miss

69
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,880
Shallow

70
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,030
Happy birthday

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,190
Every birthday from now on,

72
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,920
I will be with you.

73
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,550
Looking at the sky,

74
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,590
The direction of the wind.

75
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,630
I miss my mother.

76
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,070
Leaning on my lover's shoulder,

77
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,760
Looking at the starry sky,

78
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,670
Made my lifelong wish.

79
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,710
Look over there.

80
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,710
Jing Ruo is here to see the Empress.

81
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,590
Get up.

82
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,150
Thank you, Your Highness.

83
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,400
Jing Ruo.

84
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,400
You've been in the Chu family for so long.

85
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,710
Can it be effective?

86
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,590
Your Highness,

87
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,670
Everything went well.

88
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,960
Chu Junyao is in my hands.

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,360
But who would have thought

90
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,400
There's a Su Qian on the way.

91
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,590
Now Chu Junyao is obsessed with her.

92
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,800
Has no friendship for me at all.

93
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,880
Jingruo.

94
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,070
I'm really disappointed with you.

95
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,550
The family has trained you for so long.

96
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,550
You can't even handle a little woman.

97
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,070
The emperor has gained more and more control over the imperial court.

98
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,670
We are running out of time.

99
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,070
If you can't handle this,

100
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,800
You know the consequences.

101
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,510
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,920
I will do my best to make it right.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm tired.

104
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,760
Reflect on yourself.

105
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,440
Su Qian,

106
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,480
I will definitely not let you have good results.

107
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,630
I have a stomachache after eating these dishes.

108
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,190
Bah, are these dishes poisoned?

109
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,070
I also have a tummy ache.

110
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,800
Boss, what did you poison?

111
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,710
Your Highness.

112
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,630
patron

113
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,360
How can you hit me?

114
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,190
Shallow

115
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,920
Are you all right? Where are you?

116
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,440
Nothing
