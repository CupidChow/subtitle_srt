1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,550
Miss

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,280
Why aren't you with the general tonight?

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,360
I don't want to put a cold ass on my face.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,590
Do you smell it?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,840
Try it.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,760
Miss

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,880
Is there a ghost?

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
The world is so delicious.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,480
dang!

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,880
Where did this fool come from?

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,630
Who are you?

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,110
How dare you steal our fish?

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,480
Do you know who this is?

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,760
This is the Grand General's wife.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,880
The legitimate daughter of the Duke of Su.

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,110
The wife of General Chu.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,000
But why are you living in such a remote yard?

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,670
I haven't asked you to return my grilled fish.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,000
Speak nicely.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,360
What else can you cook?

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,840
I can do whatever you bring.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,030
Only you can't imagine.

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,280
There's no food I can't make.

24
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,190
I'm here.

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,630
The Southern Palace Hao.

26
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,440
Su Qian,

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,670
to

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,510
Let's go.

29
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,920
I'll bring the materials tomorrow.

30
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,110
He dresses like 280,000 yuan.

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,550
It's either the rich second generation or the official second generation.

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,960
Maybe you can assist me to get the ice face.

33
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,230
What delicious food can you make with only one bag of flour?

34
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
A real chef.

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,030
Has the ability to transform decay into magic.

36
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,000
What a coincidence!

37
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,230
I'm such a chef.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,280
As a three-star Michelin chef,

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,320
In this era,

40
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,880
I call it the second in the world.

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,150
No one dares to be the best in the world.

42
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,440
What's the smell?

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,760
It smells good.

44
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,510
Did you cook something delicious in the room?

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm hungry.

46
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,670
go

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,440
Go and have a look.

48
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,070
This kind of food

49
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,280
In my time, there's no way

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,000
Where did you learn it?

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
truth to tell

52
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,190
Actually, I'm the reincarnation of the chef.

53
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,840
Your Highness.

54
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,550
You...

55
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,760
What mat?

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,590
I don't need a mat. I'm not sitting on the floor.

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,440
Your Highness.

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,280
So this fool is still a prince.

59
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,110
My hands are dirty.

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,030
I'll wash my hands.

61
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,110
Don't finish it.

62
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,630
Then I'll feed you.

63
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,150
Ah

64
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,150
In order to arouse your possessiveness,

65
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,550
I have to be flexible sometimes.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,070
He's really cooperative.

67
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,920
You made all this?

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,280
Isn't it obvious?

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,670
This is the General's Mansion.

70
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,630
Don't make a mess.

71
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,480
Remember who you are.

72
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,150
I'll give one to the general.

73
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,670
He's so handsome.

74
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,230
But he seemed to react a little bit.

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,840
Hurry up.

76
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,320
General general

77
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,480
Your Highness.

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,440
Nangong Hao.

79
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,510
What are you doing?

80
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
It's rare for you to live in the capital city.

81
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,110
I have to spend more time with you.

82
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,400
Our relationship

83
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,880
When did you become so good?

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,480
Chu Junyao.

85
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,920
You really hurt me.

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,510
You've just been married for a few days.

87
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,760
Why didn't you spend more time with her?

88
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,670
Right now,

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,590
When you're doing this?

90
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,190
Don't you like it?

91
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,670
How about this?

92
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm reporting to father.

93
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,550
And ask him to withdraw the imperial order.

94
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,630
Then I'll issue an order.

95
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,630
I want you to marry Jing Ruo.

96
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,590
What about

97
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,030
Highness

98
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,320
Why don't you open the pot?

99
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,110
You should know this well.

100
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,070
Jingruo girl is the queen's own niece.

101
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,630
Your Majesty

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,550
Who will make the queen a lady.

103
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,230
To marry the general?

104
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,320
Su Da Shen.

105
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,760
What's wrong?

106
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,230
I'm trying to dig some wild vegetables for you.

107
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,840
Don't joke with me.

108
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,150
Is there anything delicious?

109
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,150
Are you a foodie?

110
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,190
I know how to eat.

111
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,110
Congratulations.

112
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,800
general

113
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,110
You've been tricked into getting married.

114
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,280
It turns out that Madam is the third lady from the concubine of the Su family.

115
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,880
The former two legitimate girls didn't want to marry the general.

116
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,630
That's why I asked Miss San to marry him.

117
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,110
What's wrong?

118
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,110
Tell me who bullied you, I'll take care of it.

119
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,360
Chu Junyao.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,510
Go.

121
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,880
The noble girls in the capital.

122
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
He said that

123
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,070
It's a gorilla.

124
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,360
It turns out that Madam is the heroine of the Women School.

125
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm not afraid to go into the Dragon Pond.

126
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:49,670
The general

127
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,000
Did I ask you to look into these?

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,280
Please.

129
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,960
I finally let my taste buds find the feeling of first love.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,320
First love doesn't sound like a word.

131
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,960
You can't let it be lovelorn.

132
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Ying Ying said

133
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,760
Madam only cooks simple home-cooked meals.

134
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,440
He's totally different from now.

135
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
If the general wants to cancel the marriage,

136
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,070
Will be successful.

137
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,840
Then you can change someone else.

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,150
I can handle it.

139
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
Miss Su,

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,630
Isn't that a cannon to kill mosquitoes?

141
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,360
I dare not forget it.

142
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,280
a row

143
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll just find a few people to hit her.

144
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,360
What do you want to eat?

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,880
Don't spread the word about it.

146
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,550
You can't let the old lady know.

147
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,400
yes

148
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Zixuan will definitely

149
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,110
All the general's orders

150
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,150
Follow through.

151
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,800
And execute it immediately.

152
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,630
Han Zixuan

153
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
I found out if you've been affected by some unhealthy atmosphere recently.

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,920
No, no.

155
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,360
Zixuan wasn't influenced by his wife.

156
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,110
just

157
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,110
How you behave.

158
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,630
It's sincere.

159
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,230
roll

160
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,440
Alright.

161
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,670
Wait

162
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,590
Don't eat the food she cooked.

163
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,760
I can't be bribed by her.

164
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,960
Get out of here.

165
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,400
It smells good.

166
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,000
It smells so good.

167
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,630
This is mine

168
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,110
Why are you here?

169
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,630
I'm not here. Where are you?

170
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,710
You are my wife.

171
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,840
Of course it's where it should be.

172
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,840
Yes, you admit that I'm his wife.

173
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,110
Your Highness,

174
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,110
Where should I be?

175
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,510
Junyao

176
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,280
We are no longer outsiders.

177
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,590
I know about your relationship.

178
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,440
She actually made the whole thing

179
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,000
To Nangong Hao.

180
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,230
How about this?

181
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,320
You didn't say that.

182
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,510
How could you be so careless about your reputation?

183
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,630
My relationship with the General

184
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,320
To put it bluntly,

185
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,550
Interest relationship

186
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,280
as if

187
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,550
It doesn't matter.

188
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,190
That's right.

189
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,030
Since you two have no relationship,

190
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,670
How about this?

191
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,960
How about you give her to me?

192
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,800
The conditions are up to you.

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,590
Are you serious?

194
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,000
As long as you cook for me every day,

195
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,800
I offered you up like an immortal.

196
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,150
impossible

197
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,920
Junyao

198
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,640
If you are against the emperor's order,

199
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,070
Then I'll ask my father

200
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,640
I want you to marry Jing Ruo.

201
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,470
Hey, hey. Stop it.

202
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm leaving with my best friend.
