1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,190
It hurts.

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,150
You tried hard again.

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,590
Does it hurt anymore?

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,360
If you don't, you will be worse.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,070
I think so.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,920
Thank you, Prime Minister.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,360
I didn't take care of you.

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,440
Don't worry.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,070
Those who hurt you

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,840
I won't let any of them go.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,070
Those four are good.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,920
It's obviously for you.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,480
Have you offended anyone recently?

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,670
No, right?

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,710
How dare I offend anyone?

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,230
Could it be that the hotel's business is so good that they are jealous?

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,880
So he sent someone to make trouble on purpose.

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,150
general

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,550
speak

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,590
Those people are stubborn.

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,920
You wouldn't tell me.

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,440
And committed suicide by biting his tongue.

23
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,760
You're dead.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,840
It seems

25
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,360
Is not a competition among peers.

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,400
Don't let anyone know about this.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,190
general

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,230
Is it for us?

29
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,510
Ah

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,840
Could it be a mountain quake?

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,360
I'm afraid to protect you.

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,880
In these two days,

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,840
Take a good rest.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,110
Don't go anywhere.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,280
I'll make some bone-strengthening soup for you.

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,280
Brother Junyao.

37
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,630
I heard that sister-in-law was injured.

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,070
I made some soup for her.

39
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm going to send it to you.

40
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,760
How did you know about this?

41
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,320
general

42
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,630
You don't know.

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,070
The news has spread abroad.

44
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,230
There's a restaurant that makes dirty food.

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,840
The guest ate a bad stomach and went to the shopkeeper.

46
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,400
And he was put into prison.

47
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,400
We still don't know whether he is alive or dead.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,880
Brother Junyao.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,590
Jingruo.

50
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,400
I don't care if you did this.

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,880
I hope you can stop.

52
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,280
I don't want anyone to hurt her, you know?

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,800
Brother Junyao.

54
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,440
Am I so miserable in your eyes?

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,190
General general

56
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,230
Without evidence,

57
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,030
How could you say that to my lady?

58
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,960
Brother Junyao.

59
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,070
You and I have known each other for years.

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,480
Can't you compare to the days of love between you two?

61
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,360
Jingruo.

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
It's impossible for us.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,190
The general's mansion

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,840
It's not suitable for you to live here.

65
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,800
Are you kicking me out?

66
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,110
Brother Junyao.

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,800
How could you be so ruthless to me?

68
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,630
I know you have her in your heart.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,550
but

70
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,670
I just want to

71
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,760
I just want to look at you.

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,230
Can't you satisfy my wish?

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,840
Brother Junyao.

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,320
I know.

75
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,030
You've always believed in me.

76
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,630
And I recognized you.

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,110
if

78
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,480
I can't be with you in this life.

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,590
I might as well

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,630
Miss

81
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,840
Jingruo.

82
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,440
I won't forget your help.

83
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,150
Take care of yourself.

84
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,590
Brother Junyao.

85
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,960
Miss

86
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,710
The general is so ruthless to you.

87
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,190
Miss, you can't be kind to him anymore.

88
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,000
Everything has been arranged.

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,880
Play it by ear.

90
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,440
I see, Your Highness.

91
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,070
The Emperor's edict

92
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,320
The Great General's wife is a skilled cook.

93
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,710
I'm summoned to the palace.

94
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,440
The Empress Dowager will be responsible for three meals a day.

95
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,510
When you enter the palace today,

96
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,510
No mistake.

97
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,150
I hereby decree that

98
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,190
Long live my Emperor.

99
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,440
Mrs. Chu.

100
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,630
Get ready. Let's go.

101
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,510
For a while,

102
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,280
I didn't visit my grandmother anymore.

103
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,510
This time,

104
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,840
I'll go with you.

105
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,670
Alright.

106
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,280
Your Majesty

107
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,150
Overjoyed

108
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,400
It's a great wedding.

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,480
Why are you so happy?

110
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
Empress Dowager has an excellent appetite.

111
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,280
Instead of eating all the dishes made by Madam Chu,

112
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
After the meal,

113
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,880
And took Mrs. Chu for a walk in the imperial garden.

114
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
You're so energetic.

115
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,840
It's much better than before.

116
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,590
It seems that Mrs. Chu

117
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,070
The Empress Dowager loves it.

118
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,550
I didn't expect that the daughter of the State House

119
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,670
You have such ability.

120
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
The imperial edict.

121
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,670
The Grand General's wife, Su, has rendered meritorious service to the Empress Dowager.

122
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,880
Is specially conferred

123
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,880
Princess Wufeng.

124
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,440
As you wish.

125
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,400
Miss

126
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,230
You are now a princess.

127
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,480
You used to have a maid, Xiang'er.

128
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,590
Was killed by Second Miss's men.

129
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,800
I implore you to avenge her.

130
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:07,960
I know.

131
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,590
But we have to find a suitable chance.

132
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,150
Don't worry.

133
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,030
I have my own plan.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,760
It's time to teach her a lesson.
