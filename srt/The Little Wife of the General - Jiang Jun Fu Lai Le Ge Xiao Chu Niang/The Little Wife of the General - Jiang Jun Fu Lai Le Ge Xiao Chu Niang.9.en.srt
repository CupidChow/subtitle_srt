1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,110
Our wife is not in favor.

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,320
When the general heard that Lady Jing Ruo was ill,

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,630
And ran out of bed.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,110
She was so jealous.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,480
And made a fuss over Miss Jing Ruo.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,760
And wanted to use a needle on Miss Jing Ruo.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,070
Like a shrew.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,110
Lower your voice.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:28,800
Old Madam.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,550
Old Madam.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,550
Who's a shrew?

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,400
yes

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,070
Say it.

14
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,710
Who is a shrew?

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,110
Say it.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,510
It's Madam.

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,190
Who sent it to you?

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,440
It's Xiaoyu from the West Garden.

19
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,110
go

20
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,110
Bring Xiao Yu to the front hall.

21
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,710
yes

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,710
I'm going to interrogate you one by one.

23
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to catch him.

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,070
Who started the rumors?

25
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,550
Some men are hard to take down.

26
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,960
We have to outflank them.

27
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,150
I mean,

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,590
Su Qian's business kingdom is about to set sail.

29
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:12,960
small

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,630
Childe

31
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,840
It's so much easier for us to stay at home.

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,960
Why do you have to go out and show yourself?

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,190
Chu Junyao took care of his subordinates.

34
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,000
I have to earn more money to help him.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,550
He's my man.

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,710
I admire you so much suddenly.

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,190
Anyway, I'll be with you forever.

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,440
If you can't flatter me,

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,150
I can only let those who have the ability to be promoted.

40
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,630
Take care of yourself.

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,480
Childe

42
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,150
Su Shen.

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,030
Wait for me.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,110
Old Madam, calm down.

45
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,480
It's all from Jing Ruo's maid.

46
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,710
This is a vicious slander against her.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,710
It seems

48
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,150
Was really ordered by Jing Ruo.

49
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,920
It was only because of the relationship behind her.

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,840
To oppose her being with Junyao.

51
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,670
If she really marries into the Chu family,

52
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,920
It's going to be difficult for me.

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,630
after

54
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,030
If anyone talks behind my back,

55
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,710
Must be dealt with.

56
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,110
Do you understand me?

57
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
yes

58
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,840
Help!

59
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,030
Inform the General immediately.

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,880
To train in the capital suburbs.

61
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,320
No mistake.

62
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,110
The general is accompanying Miss Jing Ruo.

63
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,840
What are you afraid of?

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,960
Princess Royal.

65
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,590
I'll enter the palace.

66
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,840
To His Majesty.

67
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Brother Junyao.

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,360
It's so lively today.

69
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,800
Look at this.

70
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,110
Brother, this is also pretty.

71
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:57,880
go

72
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,320
How to tell Jing Ruo.

73
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,710
We can only be brother and sister.

74
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,150
Jingruo.

75
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,360
Brother Junyao.

76
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,510
Jingruo.

77
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,590
Brother Junyao.

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
I think I sprained my foot.

79
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,230
Are you all right?

80
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,510
If Junyao helps me,

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,880
Then you'll be fine.

82
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,960
This street is quite bustling.

83
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,710
The rent is not cheap.

84
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,400
There's no shop available.

85
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,630
Mr. Su,

86
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,480
This street

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,360
Actually, it's not the most bustling.

88
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,480
There are four or five more bustling places.

89
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,400
Or

90
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,840
I will take you to other places to investigate.

91
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,280
can

92
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
This is the cost.

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,230
Can't you see my position?

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,840
Childe Su is very rich.

95
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,480
You have to choose the best place.

96
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,030
Please.

97
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,110
Let's go.

98
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,550
here

99
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,320
Let's go.

100
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,320
general

101
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,280
His Majesty has an order.

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,190
General, please go to the suburbs of the capital to train.

103
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,070
No mistake.

104
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,360
come

105
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,840
Hold your lady.

106
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,920
Jingruo.

107
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,280
Since His Majesty has an order,

108
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,550
Take good care of yourself.

109
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,760
I want to talk to you another day.

110
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,110
You can arrange two people

111
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,480
Send Jing Ruo back to her mansion.

112
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,070
yes

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,590
Miss Jing Ruo, please wait a moment.

114
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,760
I'll call the carriage.

115
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,920
Miss

116
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,480
Junyao is a great general.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,480
You must obey the order.

118
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,230
That's how a man stands tall.

119
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,150
Chu Junyao

120
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,280
You are destined to be my man.

121
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,760
This place can be said to be the gold store of the whole capital.

122
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,030
As the owner wants to retire to the south,

123
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,030
So,

124
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,960
So I rushed to do it.

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,030
Look inside.

126
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,920
This shop

127
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,760
I made it.

128
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,280
Please come in.

129
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,840
Boss

130
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,920
This is Detective Su.

131
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you sure?

132
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,840
To sell this shop.

133
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,320
That's right.

134
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,400
Please make a price.

135
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,480
One thousand taels of silver.

136
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,190
One thousand taels of silver.

137
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,710
Is indeed a little expensive.

138
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,590
But for

139
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,030
As for me,

140
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,000
That's

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,550
Sprinkling water.

142
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,230
It's not silver.

143
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,110
It's a thousand taels of gold.

144
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,190
Gold

145
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,800
Gold

146
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,360
Childe, what's wrong with you?

147
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,320
Don't you see I'm trying to ease the embarrassment?

148
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,440
Are you buying it or not?

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,630
If you don't want it,

150
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,670
Little old man,

151
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,920
To someone else.

152
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,920
Not boss.

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,360
Your shop

154
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,070
I'm not buying it.

155
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,880
You won't sell it.

156
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,920
When I bought it,

157
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,960
Someone else will buy it.

158
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,190
Are you not following me?

159
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,110
Absolutely not.

160
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,710
Alright, Boss Wang.

161
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,840
I said I would sell it for 900 taels.

162
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,320
Turn around now.

163
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,760
To this young man.

164
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,150
That's not how business works.

165
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,840
I just want more.

166
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,030
And save some money for retirement.

167
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:21,880
Rich childe.

168
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,760
I'm here.

169
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,030
I'll make it up to you.

170
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,110
Don't do that.

171
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,070
I'll give you 1,100 taels.

172
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,710
This shop

173
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,150
I'll pack it.

174
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,150
Master Su.

175
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,630
See, you're...

176
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,230
want

177
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,480
Boss

178
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,880
this

179
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,920
You're the one who asked for it.

180
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,510
Childe

181
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,110
You can't say that.

182
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,320
This rich childe

183
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,670
Is the son of Minister of Personnel.

184
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,150
How could it be?

185
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
I went to the second generation of officials.

186
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,760
Childe

187
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,550
Why don't we go to another one?

188
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,400
You have to change.

189
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,510
Let's change.

190
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,550
You poor people want to fight with me.

191
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm telling you,

192
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,840
Today,

193
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,480
We can't just leave it at that.

194
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,880
If Jing has seen Auntie,

195
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,400
Jingruo.

196
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,800
hear

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,550
You sprained your foot.

198
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,440
It's okay.

199
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,800
It's out of the way.

200
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,360
Thank you for your kindness.

201
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,710
That's good.

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,960
You're really useless.

203
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,880
You can't even protect your safety.

204
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,360
What's the use of asking you?

205
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,440
Jing Ruoruo, if something really happened,

206
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,320
Don't hesitate to die.

207
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Old Madam, please forgive me.

208
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,480
Jing Ya knows she's wrong.

209
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,480
It's good to know your mistakes.

210
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,440
go

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,960
Take ten clubs.

212
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,960
Miss

213
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,590
Let's go.
