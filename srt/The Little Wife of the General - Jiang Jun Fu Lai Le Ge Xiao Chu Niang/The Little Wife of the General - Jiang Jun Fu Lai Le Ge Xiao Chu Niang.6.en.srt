1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,110
Hey, hey. Stop it.

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,590
I'm leaving with my best friend.

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,480
You scared me to death.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,800
Otherwise, the play can't go on.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,400
But the problem is you don't like me.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,510
What are you holding on to?

7
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,440
She can't go with you.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Why?

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,000
She's my wife.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,360
I said I can't.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,590
She has to listen to me.

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,030
Go ahead. How much is it?

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,880
Get rid of it.

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,840
It's impossible. Don't give up.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,590
Both of you, let go of me.

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,000
Say it again.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,230
I'm my own person, I'm not a thing.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,280
Chu Junyao

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,670
from childhood

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,480
You are stealing what I like.

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,710
This time,

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
I will never give it to you.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,400
See?

24
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,960
She has made a wise choice.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,190
You can take a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,710
Go away too.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Let me make it clear.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,710
I'm my own.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,630
It's nobody's fault.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,400
you

31
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,550
What are you doing?

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,510
aunt

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,190
mother

34
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,190
mother

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,590
Hao Hao.

36
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,800
Why are you here?

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,440
I heard that Auntie is back.

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,550
I'm here to visit you.

39
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,510
Look at me.

40
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,400
What am I doing here?

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,230
You put me in the cold palace.

42
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,000
What are you going to tell your mother?

43
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,360
Yes?

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,920
This is

45
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,630
Mother is like this.

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,440
I like to find a quiet place to cook.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,840
So I put the kitchen in the backyard.

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,320
I see

49
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,800
You're really thoughtful.

50
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,960
In the future,

51
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,000
The cooking.

52
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,800
I'll leave it to the servants.

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,800
Take a good rest.

54
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,840
mother

55
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,230
Today,

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,710
I went to the temple for help.

57
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,800
The Immortal Soup.

58
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,710
I heard it works.

59
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,840
go

60
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,280
You two,

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,670
Have soup with me.

62
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,760
aunt

63
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
What soup? I want to try it too.

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
Is this a crap?

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
It's the couple's private affair.

66
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,590
What are you doing here?

67
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,070
go

68
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,800
Let's have soup.

69
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,630
Shallow.

70
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,440
You must understand my heart of wanting to be a grandmother.

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,150
Come on.

72
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,800
This one.

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,070
It's the soup to send the child.

74
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,030
What kind of soup is this?

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,670
Is obviously lying.

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
Such a bad smell.

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,480
I want to vomit when I smell it.

78
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,920
You can't drink ice face.

79
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,190
What are you waiting for?

80
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,920
Drink it while it's hot.

81
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,480
Hey, don't drink.

82
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,070
What if you drink it?

83
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm done. I can't avoid it.

84
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,840
very good

85
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,440
Shallow

86
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,590
Why don't you drink it?

87
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,070
I'll drink it soon.

88
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,630
Drink up.

89
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,670
That's great.

90
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,030
Today,

91
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,710
Aunt Wang went to invite the master.

92
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,630
The wedding room

93
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,670
To adjust the feng shui.

94
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,070
This bed

95
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,550
In this position.

96
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,550
tonight

97
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,440
You can sleep in this bed.

98
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,960
I can...

99
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,670
To have a grandchild.

100
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,000
Ice face, you can't avoid it tonight.

101
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,590
We have to follow my path.

102
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,070
It's all up to you.

103
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,070
Come on.

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,150
Hurry up.

105
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Watch it.

106
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,590
Watch carefully.

107
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,630
Keep an eye on him.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,070
dizzy

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,800
She's hot all over.

110
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,110
Are you giving us the aphrodisiac?

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,710
Here comes the chance.

112
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,630
If he were in modern times,

113
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,590
Must be the male god who ruined the country and the people.

114
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm Su Qian.

115
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,280
He has kept his life for 30 years.

116
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,550
So I waited for you.

117
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,630
Don't flatter yourself.

118
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,590
I won't let you succeed.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,670
To my mouth.

120
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,070
You can fly.

121
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,400
The most taboo of flirting is to expect too much.

122
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
And then you'll be swayed by considerations of gain and loss.

123
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,480
You have to imagine that he's fighting monsters, upgrading and gaining experience.

124
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,150
You should have the attitude that you will be better and better.

125
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,400
Here comes the problem.

126
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,030
What if he doesn't touch me?

127
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,480
Hold on.

128
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,320
mother

129
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,480
Why did you deliberately stay away from Jing Ruo?

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,960
This man

131
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,800
It's normal to have multiple wives.

132
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,670
But Jing Ruo

133
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,550
You can't touch it.

134
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,190
Now in the court,

135
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,840
The concubine is in charge.

136
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,230
His Majesty is wary of the Empress.

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,960
If you really marry Jing Ruo,

138
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,070
Your Majesty,

139
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,110
He must have a grudge.

140
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,480
Think about it.

141
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
The Chu family has always been loyal and kind.

142
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,480
To maintain this innocence.

143
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,480
It's rare.

144
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,320
You're forcing me to use force.

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,960
Forget it.

146
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,800
I'm afraid of being beaten.

147
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,510
Hold on.

148
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,840
Su Qian,

149
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,880
I'm warning you.

150
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,190
Don't be delusional.

151
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,590
And a pure boy.

152
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,630
Let Miss Su

153
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,800
To teach you well.

154
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,070
Ah

155
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,710
You hurt her gently.

156
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,400
Ah

157
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,960
I can't even make a joke.

158
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,000
Are you violent?

159
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,110
Hurry up. Help me up. My waist.

160
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,720
My waist.

161
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,960
I told you.

162
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Don't touch me casually.
