1
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,510
Mother!

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,000
And made the task more difficult for me.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,760
Yeah, where's my mother-in-law?

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,510
Look at my mother-in-law.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,190
If we take her down, we can take down Mom's Boy.

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,480
Greetings, Mother.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,710
good

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,510
Greetings to Mother.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,710
I wish you good health.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,320
Everything is going smoothly

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,190
Happy family.

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,710
I should have called you mother-in-law.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,710
But I can't express my love for you.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,360
So please allow me to call you mother.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,550
Alright.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,630
What's your name?

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,110
I love them all.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,510
She's really the daughter of Duke Su.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,150
Highly cultured and steeped in propriety

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,800
And smart.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,840
Mother, you flatter me.

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,360
To be loved by you.

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,440
I think

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,920
It's a great honor.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,280
Alright.

26
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,360
You can marry into our General's Mansion.

27
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,480
It's also blessed.

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,920
Wow, this is my problem.

29
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,230
She's so talkative.

30
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,070
I don't know how to address it.

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,030
Sister, call me Jing Ruo.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,840
Junyao and I

33
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,510
Grew up together as childhood friends.

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,000
It turns out to be Jing Ruo's sister.

35
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,280
Sister-in-law, I...

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,030
I didn't prepare any gifts.

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,920
Don't take it personally.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Our lady is the niece of today's queen.

39
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,150
It's not a common gift.

40
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,590
The background is so hard.

41
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,760
I can't afford it.

42
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,030
Jingya.

43
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,840
Don't be rude.

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,000
You can't say that again.

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,880
yes

46
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,710
Mother,

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,230
You must be tired from the journey.

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,760
I'll help you take a rest.

49
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,760
good

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,150
Junyao

51
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,630
Come here too.

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,840
yes

53
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,440
Shallow.

54
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,510
I'm here this time.

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,550
First, I came to see you two.

56
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,030
Second,

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,710
Junyao

58
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,110
Second, come on.

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,880
I want you

60
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,400
Fulfill my grandmother's wish as soon as possible.

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,070
Mother,

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,480
he-man

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,670
Should put the world first.

64
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,400
child

65
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,110
We haven't considered this.

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,550
Shallow

67
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,360
This is your fault.

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Your husband.

69
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,230
On the horse,

70
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,480
Guard the world.

71
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,550
You should take this time

72
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,920
Work hard.

73
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,960
To get pregnant with our Chu's Lin'er as soon as possible.

74
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,360
My mother-in-law loves me.

75
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,590
Junyao.

76
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,000
If you ask me,

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
In this world,

78
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
And have a baby.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,190
It doesn't violate

80
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,800
I know.

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,670
These days,

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,760
I will supervise you.

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,230
Mother,

84
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,070
To have children for the Chu family.

85
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,480
Shallow. Don't allow it.

86
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,760
You must work day and night.

87
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,400
Ju

88
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,710
Alright.

89
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,190
I can see.

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,320
For this,

91
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,070
You two are working hard.

92
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,030
Thank you

93
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,320
aunt

94
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,480
Have more.

95
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,230
The roast goose in the capital

96
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,590
Is famous all over the world.

97
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,030
I really can't eat it.

98
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,550
Shallow

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,440
come

100
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,190
Eat more for me.

101
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,110
good

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,630
Why did mother deliberately stay away from Jing Ruo?

103
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,480
mother

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
How can you not eat?

105
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,150
Zixuan

106
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,030
Go get the doctor.

107
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,710
yes

108
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,510
Don't bother.

109
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,360
The doctor has been here.

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,320
I've prescribed the medicine.

111
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,000
It's useless.

112
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,440
Mother,

113
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,800
You have no appetite.

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,920
It should be caused by the digestive system of the stomach.

115
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,070
This needs long-term diet conditioning.

116
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,360
I'll cook now.

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,670
To make an appetizing soup for you.

118
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,960
What's your identity?

119
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,440
How can you cook it yourself?

120
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,280
I'll go to the palace tomorrow.

121
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
Your Majesty, please make a decree.

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
And ask two imperial chefs to cook.

123
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,840
No need, sister.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,360
The daughter-in-law cooked for her mother-in-law.

125
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,400
That's right.

126
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,590
Alright.

127
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,630
We...

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,150
Let's not talk about this.

129
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,440
What about me?

130
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,840
distant

131
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,480
I didn't make it.

132
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,320
Your marriage

133
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,320
It's better to

134
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,510
You two,

135
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,150
In front of me,

136
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,440
Drink once and make a toast.

137
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,800
Take it as

138
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,440
I attended your wedding.

139
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,510
How about that?

140
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,190
Alright.

141
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,920
I'll listen to Mother's order.

142
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,760
good

143
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,550
come

144
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,760
what are you doing?

145
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,150
What's wrong?

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,030
Look at this.

147
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,440
The couple

148
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,510
And when you can't let it go,

149
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,360
Mother, since you've spoken,

150
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,110
You can't let her down.

151
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,710
yes

152
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,480
Mother,

153
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,880
hurry up

154
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,510
Don't make Mother anxious.

155
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,510
Little boy.

156
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,840
Finish this cup of wine with me.

157
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,590
Let's get married.

158
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,070
I finally got what I wanted.

159
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,440
Don't push your luck.

160
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,070
Are you still a man?

161
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,400
I suspected you.

162
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,920
Forget it. The task is important.

163
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,000
Junyao.

164
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,110
To Qian Qian.

165
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,360
This child

166
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,360
His wife.

167
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,840
You should know how to love them.

168
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,880
yes

169
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,840
Mother,

170
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,280
A little bigger.

171
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,150
Bigger.

172
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,360
Eat more.

173
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,440
The image of Goddess Su for 30 years.

174
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,190
You ruined it beyond recognition.

175
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,440
Mom, I'm not finished with you.
