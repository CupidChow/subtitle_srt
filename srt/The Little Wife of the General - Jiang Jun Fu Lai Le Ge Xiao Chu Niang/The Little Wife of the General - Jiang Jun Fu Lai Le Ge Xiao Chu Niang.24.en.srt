1
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,150
What's wrong, Prime Minister?

2
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,280
I want to discuss something with you.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,400
what?

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,510
I want to divorce you.

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,920
What's that

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,960
Our previous wedding was too childish.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,030
I want to marry you openly.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,400
I owe you this.

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,360
Oh dear

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,190
Why are you doing this when you're married?

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,150
We can't afford to be short of three matchmakers.

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,550
I will carry the sedan 8 times.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,070
And a thousand fireworks.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,670
The team will stretch for 100 miles.

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,110
I want Su Qian to know.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,320
She really met someone who could love her with her life.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,840
She doesn't have to look at others anymore.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,280
Can you do that?

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,110
Thank you.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,590
Why should I thank you?

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,510
I'm speaking for Su Qian.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,440
She deserves a proper wedding.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,800
How are you?

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,320
A bit of

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,920
You've been drinking, Benben.

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,840
come

27
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,190
You must be satisfied with your life.

28
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't make Jin Zun empty to the moon.

29
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,000
good

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,800
Good poem.

31
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm telling you,

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,070
This man's desire

33
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,710
It's endless.

34
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,110
When you got everything you wanted

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,630
You will have higher desires.

36
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,590
on

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,630
Take me for example.

38
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,230
Then tell me.

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,400
money

40
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,550
status

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
Fame and prestige

42
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,190
And beautiful men.

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,000
I have all these.

44
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,030
Now,

45
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,840
I want to live forever.

46
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,880
I want it.

47
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,710
Everything I have,

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,440
Can always exist.

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,110
I'm so scared.

50
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,440
I woke up suddenly one day.

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,550
I found myself with nothing.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,760
I will always be by your side.

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,840
You will never have nothing.

54
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,150
All is well

55
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,800
It's safe and sound.

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,030
What's wrong?

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,280
Having a nightmare?

58
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,590
Don't be afraid.

59
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,280
I'm here.

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,440
I don't want to give her back her body.

61
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,480
I'm afraid of losing you.

62
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,030
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,400
Junyao

64
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,400
Actually, I'm not the real Su Qian Qian.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,360
The real Su Qian.

66
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,590
Before the wedding,

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,550
He was dead.

68
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,230
Don't think too much.

69
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
Well

70
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,400
Your time limit is only 77 49 days.

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,480
If you fail to complete the mission, you will be destroyed.

72
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,710
I'm telling the truth.

73
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,480
I dreamed that

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,590
She said

75
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
She asked me to give her body back to her.

76
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,510
I know.

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,550
therefore

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
You are the one who married me.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,880
You are the one who has always been with me.

80
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,710
It's me.

81
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,760
Actually, I already know you're not Su Qian Qian.

82
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,760
therefore

83
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,510
There's only one possibility.

84
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,400
Of course it's a fairy, a fool.

85
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm really afraid of losing you.

86
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,670
Then let's treasure it together.

87
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,480
Every minute and every second,

88
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,550
Okay?

89
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,710
There were many reasons.

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Without letting us be together,

91
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,320
This time,

92
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,400
What's wrong?

93
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,230
Isn't this what you always wanted?

94
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,070
I want it.

95
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,710
Is eternal.

96
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,550
sorry

97
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,880
I don't want you to see me go up in smoke.

98
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,550
It's not a pain.

99
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,190
It's heartbreaking.

100
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,030
I just want you to bear the pain of my disappearance.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,070
Bye.

102
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
My love.

103
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,400
Junyao

104
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,630
Shallow

105
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,710
Qian, you're awake.

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,590
mom

107
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,670
I thought you'd never wake up.

108
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,760
It's good to wake up. Mom, I'm back.

109
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,720
I had a dream.

110
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,110
A beautiful dream.

111
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,190
I didn't want to wake up.

112
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,150
But I'm worried about your health.

113
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,110
mom

114
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,430
What's wrong with you?

115
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,350
Why did you say you have no time?

116
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,430
Mom, nothing.

117
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
I can't live for decades.

118
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,600
Mom is old.

119
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,560
Oh, I wouldn't have come back if I had known.

120
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,800
Why are you crying again?

121
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,430
Stop crying.

122
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,470
mom

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,920
Mom is wrong.

124
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,070
I'm ignoring you.

125
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,960
Mom, you're wrong. Stop crying.

126
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,110
Stop crying.

127
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,350
It's all right.

128
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,760
The doctor came to check the ward.

129
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,560
He is the blind date you want today.

130
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,270
He's actually a doctor here.

131
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,310
What a coincidence!

132
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,230
Chu Junyao
