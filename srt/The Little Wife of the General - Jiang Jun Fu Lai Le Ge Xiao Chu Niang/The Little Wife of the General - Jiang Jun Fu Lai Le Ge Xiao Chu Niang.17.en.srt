1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,150
I'm bathing and dressing.

2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,440
If I didn't know you,

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,670
I thought you were the emperor.

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,510
Hey, you're going too far.

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,840
That's not right.

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,920
You're looking straight at me.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,630
It's not like you're asking for punishment.

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,320
Oh, forget it.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,360
Take it first.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,400
It's important to protect yourself.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm dressing for the general.

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,070
sometimes hot and sometimes cold

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,800
And erratic in nature.

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,800
The standard boy pattern.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,960
给男人脱衣服这事儿

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,280
This is my first time.

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,920
This is the rhythm of sleeping.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,230
Is this guy drinking too much grandma's soup?

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,840
Is really amazing.

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,630
I'll do whatever I want.

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,800
Sleep with him.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,480
I can't see him if I go back in time.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,030
And his career has become empty.

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,590
If you don't go back,

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,280
I don't even know how long my mom can wait.

26
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,190
It's so confusing.

27
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,480
Old Madam.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,070
The war is coming.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,510
I just saw Madam was asked to take care of the general.

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,230
It's so noisy.

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,800
These two children finally understand.

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,280
ah

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,480
What's wrong?

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,630
today

35
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,670
I forgot to let them drink the immortal soup.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm ready to go now.

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,230
Go, go.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,550
Alright.

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,070
What are you waiting for?

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,400
Come in.

41
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,030
Ah

42
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,760
You're really standing here.

43
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,440
It's really embarrassing.

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,550
If you're fine,

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,880
I'm leaving now.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,230
What are you doing?

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,670
You're General's woman.

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,630
No one can touch it.

49
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,190
Do you still remember

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,190
On the night of the wedding, you said

51
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,440
Saying I'm a political victim.

52
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,710
Don't be delusional.

53
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,550
Now you say I'm your woman.

54
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,070
Which one is true?

55
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,110
I don't care.

56
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,920
Since you and I paid respect to the court,

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,230
Then you're my woman.

58
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,110
No one can touch it.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,920
You're too overbearing.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,920
I'm so overbearing.

61
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,590
Listening to each other's heartbeats.

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,150
And feel the love.

63
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,230
Actually being in love is really easy.

64
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,760
The right time.

65
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,110
The right place.

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,630
And the right person.

67
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,670
Love will grow into a cocoon.

68
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,550
To the heart.

69
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,840
I

70
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,670
It's time to get off the list.

71
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,360
Your lady is so good.

72
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,840
Hold on.

73
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,440
Don't touch me.

74
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,960
I think my period has arrived.

75
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,230
Ah

76
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
Which aunt?

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,230
It's the moon.

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,150
Oh

79
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,840
Then I will go out to cool off.

80
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,320
Miss

81
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,710
Our business is so hot.

82
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,190
Why do you have to close for a day?

83
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
This is called hunger marketing.

84
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,190
It can make customers change their tastes.

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,320
We can rest for another day.

86
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,230
I really admire you now.

87
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,480
Of course.

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
You don't want to see whose wife it is.

89
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,230
you

90
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,550
you

91
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,280
You're a big man.

92
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,510
Don't stay here all day.

93
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,590
Do whatever you need to do.

94
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,230
I'm hiding here. What's wrong?

95
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,110
I'm half the boss here.

96
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,880
Half boss.

97
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,510
I think you have a bad intention.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,510
Hey, don't do that.

99
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,840
Cherish evil thoughts

100
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,030
How could you please me?

101
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,670
It's a battle.

102
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,030
It's not over yet.

103
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,920
We've agreed.

104
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,670
A gentleman never says a word.

105
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,110
You can beat him.

106
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,030
good

107
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,550
I will fight with you.

108
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,510
Stop

109
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,800
You two...

110
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,760
You two, stop.

111
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,030
How about this?

112
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,030
I'll cook it myself at noon.

113
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,800
Alright

114
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,670
For the sake of my wife,

115
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
I'll spare you this time.

116
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,670
You two sit and eat together.

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I have it.

118
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,880
Only friends have no dignity.

119
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,710
Sit down.

120
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,960
I want you to have a seat.

121
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,440
Don't be gossipy.

122
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,150
that

123
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,360
Let's drink together.

124
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,880
come

125
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,520
Come on.

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,560
for

127
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,110
I haven't finished yet.

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,110
in order to

129
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,030
dry

130
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,720
dry

131
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,030
Eat.

132
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,600
Go on. Eat.
