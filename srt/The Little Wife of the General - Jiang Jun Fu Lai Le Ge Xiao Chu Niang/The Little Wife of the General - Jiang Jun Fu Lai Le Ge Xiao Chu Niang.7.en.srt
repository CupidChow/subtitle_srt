1
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,320
What do you want?

2
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,760
Oh, my waist.

3
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,360
No, no. Help me to lie down.

4
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,880
What are you doing?

5
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,670
Check your acupuncture points first.

6
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,480
So that you won't

7
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,000
那你脱衣服干嘛

8
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,510
I'm a little hot.

9
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,030
Then why are you taking off my clothes?

10
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,190
I'm afraid you're too hot.

11
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,630
Ice face.

12
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,070
Be gentle.

13
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,440
This is my first time.

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,280
What are you thinking?

15
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,710
The medicine is really powerful.

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,960
We need to heat it up. Where are you going?

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,840
Ice face.

18
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,670
No matter what happens between you and Su Qian Qian,

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,110
The dignity and integrity of her life

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
Is closely linked to you.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,920
That's right.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,800
In her life,

23
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,550
Can't be another woman.

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,550
otherwise

25
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,110
Something happened.

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
I find your idea of a woman dangerous.

27
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,550
I'm just trying to liven up the atmosphere.

28
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,440
It's just giving birth.

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,480
A man always gossips.

30
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,280
I find your idea is really dangerous.

31
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,840
You're not a normal person.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,760
You're so naughty.

33
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,760
I have jumped out of the Three Realms, and I am not in the Five Elements.

34
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,480
You're in the circle, I'm independent from the outside.

35
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,360
You're the man in my name. If I don't sleep with you, who will I sleep with?

36
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,880
Do you want me to be a widow?

37
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,840
Can you be serious?

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,670
Unless you agree to marry me,

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,030
I mean,

40
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,760
As long as you agree to three conditions,

41
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,360
I can cooperate with you.

42
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,550
Including but not limited to childbirth.

43
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,670
Be serious.

44
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,400
speak

45
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,630
first

46
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,280
Although I married you on the surface,

47
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,360
But you can't limit my freedom.

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't want to be a bird in a cage.

49
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,760
no problem

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,440
But you can't do anything that will disgrace the family style.

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,150
What do you think of me, Su Qian?

52
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,110
Am I that kind of person?

53
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,190
Who are you?

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,960
Okay. I promise you.

55
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,110
second

56
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,280
It is said that

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,070
Money talks

58
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:07,840
Understand?

59
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,760
I have no money.

60
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,360
A great general is so stingy.

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,150
The third one.

62
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,590
Third

63
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,030
Give it to me.

64
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,280
Be serious.

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,710
That's the third condition.

66
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,280
Hurry up.

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,030
Big men are so gossipy.

68
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,280
Shh

69
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,280
Someone is outside.

70
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,710
General, that's great.

71
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,360
She loves it so much.

72
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,230
So that Old Madam can have grandchildren,

73
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,510
Come on, husband.

74
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,070
Work hard.

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,590
Don't stop.

76
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,320
Old Madam.

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,280
The war has started.

78
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,480
Madam, she is powerful.

79
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,840
The general is aggressive.

80
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,400
The people in the yard next door

81
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,880
Was alerted.

82
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,150
Alright.

83
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,230
I didn't expect you to be a lady.

84
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,920
You know all this?

85
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,840
Are you...

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,030
What do you think of me?

87
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,360
Su Qian has always kept a clean mind.

88
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,230
Besides,

89
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,590
No man is so easy to get into my eyes.

90
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,880
I'll sleep on the floor.

91
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,000
The eavesdropper is here again.

92
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,510
General general

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,480
What is it?

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,800
My lady

95
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
She fainted. Go and have a look.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,590
Am I floating recently?

97
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,280
I forgot the ice face is cold.

98
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
It's the medicine that gives me a good look today.

99
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,030
But what's White Lotus up to?

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,510
Whatever.

101
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,510
I'll go and have a look.

102
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,110
Jingruo.

103
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,630
Jingruo.

104
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,510
Did you find a doctor?

105
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,280
The doctor has looked for it.

106
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,110
But the doctor couldn't say why.

107
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,510
She said my lady was weak.

108
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,510
It's possible.

109
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,920
It's caused by a heart disease.

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,150
Heart disease.

111
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,320
Heart disease is heart disease.

112
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,590
And possibly depression.

113
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,000
You know this?

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
understand

115
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,800
Here comes the chance.

116
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,280
Let me apply the strongest TCM therapy.

117
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,110
Pulse pressing auscultation

118
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,480
You can pretend. Come on.

119
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,440
I'm going to rip off your pliers.

120
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,480
That's great. I made a big move.

121
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,230
Look at the teeth.

122
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,480
It's good for eating grass.

123
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,760
But why are you eating meat with me?

124
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,510
You eat grass, you hear me?

125
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,070
Your eyes are not good enough.

126
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,000
I can't survive more than three episodes.

127
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,550
The doctor is right. It's indeed a heart disease.

128
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,320
According to the medical book,

129
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,320
You need a silver needle to keep your health.

130
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,400
You're good at medical science.

131
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,320
You know something.

132
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
I'll get the silver needle.

133
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,000
Madam

134
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,880
My lady is delicate.

135
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,320
Don't apply the needle randomly.

136
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,110
to feel relieved

137
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,190
I promise I'll give it to you when you wake up.

138
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,360
General, don't do that.

139
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,070
I can't let her prick Miss.

140
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,630
Just put your heart in your belly.
