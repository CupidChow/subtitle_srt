1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,800
This time,

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,670
Someone must die.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,710
Ah

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,400
Can't both of them die?

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,070
Until the last minute,

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,070
I won't give up my life.

7
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,150
But if I have to choose,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,190
I want him to be alive.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,440
It's settled.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,190
Emperor

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,550
Shallow mouth without cover.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,070
Please take back your order.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,510
You're serious.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,360
Are you still here?

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,280
Father.

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,550
Father.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,760
How could you do that?

18
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,440
You're dead.

19
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,510
How can I live alone?

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,110
It's okay.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,800
Anyway, I've already died once.

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,840
It's been so many days.

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,230
It's worth it.

24
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,920
You must live well.

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,510
There are thousands of beautiful women in the world.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,230
After a while,

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,510
You will forget me.

28
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,710
Don't talk nonsense.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,630
Everything in the world

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,400
Is no better than you.

31
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,230
When I met you,

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,030
It took all my luck.

33
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,000
The time for the mission is drawing near.

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,590
Not only is there no freedom in my heart,

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,070
Instead, I was more depressed.

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,110
I thought I could be relieved.

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
But when facing it,

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,480
But I feel guilty and reluctant.

39
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,880
His Majesty has an order.

40
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,110
Chu Junyao, the Su clan betrayed the enemy.

41
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,550
And poisoned the Empress Dowager.

42
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,920
To be executed.

43
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,550
Your Majesty, it's time to eat.

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
Why are you here?

45
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,320
Where is Chief Zhang?

46
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,670
His Highness Zhang accepted bribes.

47
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,230
Was discovered by the Empress.

48
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,550
Sent out of the palace.

49
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,630
I will serve you now.

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,840
wanton

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,710
Eunuch Zhang has been with me for decades.

52
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,880
Even if you made a mistake,

53
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,800
It's up to me.

54
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,280
Go get the queen for me.

55
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,230
Go back to His Majesty.

56
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,030
The queen went to pray in the temple.

57
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,150
Damn it!

58
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,280
Guard Li.

59
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
General Mo,

60
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,320
Order the Imperial Guards to close the palace gate.

61
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,840
Enter the palace to protect you.

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,920
As you wish.

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,030
It seems His Majesty knows

64
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,920
We poisoned his food.

65
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,670
Mother,

66
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,510
What if he finds out?

67
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,710
It's too late.

68
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,320
It's better to take this opportunity

69
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,760
To force father to resign.

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,670
To avoid changes.

71
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,070
Empress.

72
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,710
What His Highness said is true.

73
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,840
A queen

74
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,190
Give the order.

75
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,400
General Wang.

76
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,630
General Mo,

77
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,030
Let the soldiers prepare.

78
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,760
Control the royal family first.

79
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,960
Tonight at noon,

80
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,440
And capture the king in the palace.

81
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,510
General Mo, please accept it.

82
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,510
Bold

83
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,880
Third Brother.

84
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,030
Because I know you're good at martial arts.

85
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,230
today

86
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,230
You can't escape.

87
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,150
Nangongyue

88
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,320
What are you doing?

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,150
And killed his brothers.

90
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,800
Aren't you afraid that father will punish you?

91
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,400
Father can't even protect himself.

92
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,150
I can manage you.

93
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,840
What did you do?

94
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,840
Take down

95
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,710
Highness

96
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,670
The whole city is under martial law.

97
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,400
The Capital Garrison has been mobilized in large numbers.

98
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,280
It seems that they want to violate

99
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,030
What a big move.

100
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,190
To kill Chu Junyao first.

101
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,630
Then he ruled out any attempt to usurp the throne.

102
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,920
No way

103
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
I have to go to the palace.

104
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,550
To go now is to die.

105
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,710
The imperial guards are loyal to father.

106
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,360
I won't betray you.

107
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,230
Highness

108
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,190
We should find reinforcements now.

109
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
My father is in the palace.

110
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,150
How could I watch him get killed?

111
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,030
So impulsive.

112
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,710
How can I be the king?

113
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,590
If father is gone,

114
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,510
What does it mean to be a king?

115
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,880
I didn't dare to contradict you before.

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,280
But now I think

117
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,070
I'm not that happy.

118
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,590
There are so many things every day.

119
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,880
And so much pressure.

120
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,550
Than a common man.

121
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,760
Your wings are hard.

122
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,070
Think

123
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,440
I'm in a difficult situation.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,360
I have no choice.

125
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,400
Father.

126
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,320
Don't be stubborn.

127
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,110
They'll come in later.

128
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,190
Stand behind me.

129
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,800
If Hao'er dies in the war,

130
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,920
Then the next thing,

131
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,760
I can't help it.

132
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,960
If we're lucky enough to escape,

133
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,390
Father,

134
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,230
Can you leave me alone?

135
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,680
Naughty boy.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,920
How dare you talk to me like this?

137
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,640
Aren't you afraid of me?

138
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,070
Father.

139
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,720
That's to you.

140
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,600
I'm not afraid of you.

141
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,070
He has guts.

142
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,190
What you said and did today

143
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,720
I remember it.

144
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,270
Su Shen said that

145
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,560
He doesn't fear the hot water.

146
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm the mysterious Dead Skin Brother now.
