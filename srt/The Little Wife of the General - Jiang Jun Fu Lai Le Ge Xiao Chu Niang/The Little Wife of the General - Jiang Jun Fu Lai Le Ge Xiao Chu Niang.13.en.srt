1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,630
General, the evidence is conclusive.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,000
You have to make decisions for our lady.

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,150
What's wrong?

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,840
Junyao, don't be angry.

5
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,920
I don't think she did it on purpose.

6
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,590
Sister-in-law

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
But although the couple is worthless,

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,480
But it's the only thing my mother left me.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,360
I thought you really came to visit me.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,630
But I didn't expect you

11
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,070
Oops, I'll go.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,190
So this is the last resort.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,590
The wife of the general's mansion.

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,760
You can't steal anything.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,190
I went to her room.

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,960
But I didn't steal from her.

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,280
Sister-in-law

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,070
I beg you to give it back to me.

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,110
As long as you give it back to me,

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,510
You can choose the valuables in this box.

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,920
Come on, Jingruo.

22
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,150
Get up first.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,070
You are so stupid.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,000
What others say is right.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,360
You don't even have the ability to tell right from wrong.

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,710
Mother gave me so much gold and jewelry.

27
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,960
Do I have to steal it?

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,760
ZhangJingRuo

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,920
You mean I took your stuff?

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,510
Where is the evidence?

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,400
Show me the surveillance footage.

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,800
Sister-in-law, don't be angry.

33
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,510
It's really important for me.

34
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,400
Who has no opinions.

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,550
It ticks me off

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,510
Madam

37
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,960
There's a rumor out there.

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,360
He said you bought the most popular shop.

39
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,280
Maybe you just need money.

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,070
You're so analytical.

41
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,320
Why didn't you steal your lady's jade pendant?

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,840
Madam

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,400
How can you slander me?

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,960
I've been with my lady since I was little.

45
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,510
Although I didn't do my best,

46
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,400
But he's innocent.

47
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,550
Jing Ya, stop it.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
I believe you.

49
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,280
again,...

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,000
The son of the cockfight,

51
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't solve it.

52
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,440
You can slander me all you want.

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,280
Anyway, I'm an outsider.

54
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
I want you to be innocent.

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,710
Because you're my wife.

56
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,440
indeed

57
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,190
You have to give evidence.

58
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,000
You can't believe what others say.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,360
general

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,440
Why don't you go?

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,030
Investigate all the famous pawnshops in the capital.

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,760
See if you can find a couple.

63
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,400
yes

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,590
They killed the game.

65
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,880
What should we do?

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,150
What are you looking at?

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,760
To see your white lotus flower.

68
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,000
You don't trust me.

69
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,070
I can't even...

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,960
general

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,150
He has arrived.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,150
General, the evidence has been found.

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,840
Thank God I finally found it.

74
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,480
Take it and have a look.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,550
You are so mean.

76
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,000
To frame me in this way.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,550
Enough

78
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,550
I really don't have you to believe me.

79
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,030
Brother Junyao.

80
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,590
Now that we have found it,

81
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,710
Don't blame her.

82
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,070
Don't hurt your feelings and harmony for the jade pendant.

83
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,840
Look carefully.

84
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,030
It's the jade pendant I made.

85
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,480
Many people came to the pawnshop during the day.

86
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,030
I don't remember.

87
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,360
How could you not remember?

88
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,670
Did someone teach you to say that?

89
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,800
I dare not hide it.

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,360
You disappointed me.

91
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,800
You can ask me if you need money.

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,030
Why did you do such a despicable act?

93
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,920
They wronged me.

94
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,590
Believe it or not,

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,150
Do you believe it?

96
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,230
Your Highness believes that

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,880
What do you think? I believe you.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,880
Are you touched?

99
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,030
Nangong Hao.

100
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,630
This is my family affair.

101
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,510
Don't get involved.

102
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,190
Chu Junyao

103
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,030
Since you don't believe your wife,

104
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,230
Then you should divorce her.

105
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,190
My suggestion

106
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,880
It's good for everyone.

107
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,360
Don't hesitate.

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,230
A woman who rogues,

109
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,440
What's there to miss?

110
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,880
If it gets out,

111
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,030
The General's Mansion will lose face.

112
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,510
Shut up, Nangong Hao.

113
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,920
Oh, I'm kidding.

114
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,190
Chu Junyao

115
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,480
The shop was bought by Qian and me.

116
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,190
Do you think it's possible?

117
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,630
How does this account book explain?

118
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,800
Then I have to ask you.

119
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
I

120
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,710
How do I know?

121
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,030
I'll pawn my jade pendant.

122
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,480
It's signed with your name.

123
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,150
Can I say you stole it?

124
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,150
Your Highness.

125
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,440
You really know how to joke.

126
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
to speak the truth

127
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,030
Your Highness, please forgive me.

128
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,480
I'm telling the truth.

129
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,510
You can't force me to confess.

130
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,110
It's true that you can't cry without seeing the coffin.

131
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,030
Come in.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,150
Hong Ying is your Qingyi Courtyard's sweetheart.

133
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,920
What did you say?

134
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,840
No one knows better than her.

135
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,360
Yu Chuan, you should explain.

136
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,230
We can't offend these adults.

137
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,280
Don't be silly for Xiao Chuan.

138
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,030
Tell me.

139
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,550
I said,

140
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,190
This has nothing to do with Hongying.

141
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,360
I hope you won't implicate her.

142
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,960
The pawnbroker

143
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,230
It's her.

144
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,030
She asked me to do this.

145
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,630
I took a lot of benefits from her.

146
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,230
Don't slander me.

147
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,550
Miss
