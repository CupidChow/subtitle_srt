1
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,150
Smash

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,070
Let her do it.

3
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,760
It's all smashed.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,280
This is all our efforts.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,110
It's okay.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,030
She will pay three times.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,590
Really cheap.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,480
No

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,800
It's so high.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,360
adult

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,190
Why are you here?

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,480
Are you stupid?

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Do you know who owns this shop?

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,400
Highness

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,110
Highness

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,150
Madam

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,400
You should be punished.

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,440
Wait

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,480
You should pay for it.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,880
Let me get an abacus.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,440
I'll do the math.

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,320
Catch him.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,630
yes

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,110
Your Excellency.

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,440
Elder male cousin

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,960
Su Qian,

27
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,710
The prince will protect you this time.

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,190
I'll see who can protect you next time.

29
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,800
Miss

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,230
A total of 560 people today.

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,320
A total of 1,200 taels of silver.

32
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,280
To eliminate the labor cost,

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,030
And earned 800 taels of silver.

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,880
This is so amazing.

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,280
And the compensation of 3,000 taels of silver.

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,110
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,360
If only people came to break the store every day.

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,590
What are you thinking?

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,880
It's nice.

40
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,280
This business is more profitable than I thought.

41
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,710
I want to.

42
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,550
When we're stable,

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,630
To open more branches across the country.

44
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,710
In this case,

45
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,280
So that guests don't have to travel far to eat.

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,960
How does it feel to go home and eat?

47
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,710
That's a good idea.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,960
If the communication is better,

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,030
And carry out takeout business.

50
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,510
Dimensionality reduction strike

51
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,360
No pressure at all.

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,070
Come on.

53
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,030
Drink some water.

54
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,400
You can't be ill.

55
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,960
If you are ill,

56
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,550
Our shop will be closed.

57
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,880
It's not necessary to close down.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,360
I've thought of that.

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,510
I'll teach them some simple dishes first.

60
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,630
And train a group of super chefs.

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,670
In this way, the whole country will bloom.

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,670
Do I also count

63
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,590
The Grand Master level.

64
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,440
very good

65
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,360
yes

66
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,960
This is also a good idea.

67
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,880
But I'm afraid that

68
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,190
They don't respect you, father.

69
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,440
So,

70
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,550
We should choose some good people to train.

71
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Should

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,030
We need some contracts to guarantee our rights.

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,030
It should be safe.

74
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,960
What are you doing?

75
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,550
It's useless.

76
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,630
I didn't expect that.

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,590
How could Miss Su be so stupid?

78
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,320
I have it.

79
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,440
How about this?

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,840
Yes, Miss.

81
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,630
I heard that the boss is the wife of the general.

82
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,190
But you're hanging out with other men all the time.

83
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,880
You're really unfilial.

84
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,960
How shameless!

85
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,400
That's right.

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,360
It's better not to let your man eat here.

87
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,320
To avoid being haunted.

88
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,710
Namely

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,760
What nonsense is that?

90
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,510
You're old and disrespectful.

91
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,400
Hum

92
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,440
Bah

93
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,400
Zixuan

94
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,000
Zixuan

95
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,590
What are you doing?

96
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,710
Nothing

97
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,030
Water. I want to take a shower.

98
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you out of your mind?

99
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,230
It is said that

100
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,190
If you want to live a good life,

101
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,670
How can there be no grass on the head?

102
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,230
nerve

103
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,510
general

104
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,840
My wild and elaborate suggestion

105
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,840
Didn't you

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,150
Find something?

107
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,360
what

108
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,670
general

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,630
If you don't work hard,

110
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,670
Your Highness will take her away.

111
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,280
He can't take it away.

112
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,710
People have been spreading the rumor.

113
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,190
The grassland above the general.

114
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,480
You can take care of the sheep.

115
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,840
The description is vivid.

116
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,480
say

117
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,400
Third Prince and General's wife are handsome and handsome.

118
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,000
You love me.

119
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,190
but

120
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,710
But the Great General

121
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,960
独守空房

122
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,960
general

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,550
If you hadn't been green,

124
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,190
Was on the way to be green.

125
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:24,710
I

126
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,000
Miss

127
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,440
It's just a rumor.

128
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,510
Don't talk nonsense in the mansion.

129
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,960
I'm not lying.

130
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
Last night, I saw with my own eyes that Third Prince sent his wife back.

131
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,190
The intimacy is so embarrassing.

132
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,880
Shut up!

133
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,840
Seeing is not necessarily believing.

134
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,030
Mind your mouths from now on.

135
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,030
yes

136
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,840
Madam

137
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,480
General, please.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,590
Ah

139
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,710
What's wrong?

140
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,230
It seems to be a rumor.

141
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,150
The general is angry today.

142
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,070
And sharpened his sword for an hour.

143
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,190
Every time the general sharpens his sword,

144
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,630
There must be blood.

145
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,280
It's probably because the foodie hugged me today.

146
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,070
It's not on purpose.

147
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,230
I've been working all day, too.

148
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,840
How about you tell him I'm going to take a rest?

149
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,840
Correct!

150
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,190
The general also said that

151
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,710
If you don't go there, he will come.

152
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,800
I'll go then.

153
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,710
Paranoid little boys are really hard to coax.

154
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,390
Explain to him.

155
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,840
Come here

156
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,560
I'm bathing and dressing.

157
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,520
If I didn't know you,

158
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,880
I thought you were the emperor.
