1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,800
Is it beautiful?

2
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,360
Little Yingzi.

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,480
Is this nice?

4
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,510
Miss, do you like this style?

5
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,710
But it's pretty.

6
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,360
But the silver doesn't match your temperament.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,030
Yes

8
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,400
It must be gold.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,150
That's right.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,960
Where are you from?

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,480
You'll be able to judge the accessories of Great Jade Pavilion.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,230
You don't even look at yourself.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,590
What, do I look like I have no place?

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,800
Miss, we are too low-key.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,110
With our current status,

16
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,920
Don't be so narrow-minded.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,440
Let's go, Ying Ying.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,590
Hey, you little bitch.

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,960
How dare you taunt me?

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,150
Bearer

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,030
Give me a hand.

22
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,920
You're so bold.

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,110
I'm the princess.

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,230
Is something you can offend.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,000
Ah

26
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,920
Su Qian,

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,590
Are you crazy?

28
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,800
Even the princess dared to pretend.

29
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,800
Did the prince hit you in the tavern last time?

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,760
Who will save you today?

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,670
Did you ignore what I said?

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,840
If you don't do it,

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,670
Ying Ying.

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,550
It hurts.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,110
You little bitch, how dare you hit me?

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,880
Beat her to death.

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,590
to wait a moment

38
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,230
Everyone,

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,030
Today,

40
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,190
I have to show you another power.

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,230
Banknote ability.

42
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,360
Everyone here today

43
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,440
Anyone who helped me teach this bitch a lesson.

44
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,360
That punch.

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,480
It's only one or two silver coins.

46
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,230
Give me the money.

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,000
How dare you!

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,480
I promise I won't even recognize her parents.

49
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,510
Oh, thank you.

50
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,400
How dare you!

51
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Go on.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,150
Come and collect the money from me.

53
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,110
Go on.

54
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,840
I'm the Second Lady of the State Mansion.

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,400
How dare you hit me?

56
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,630
My father won't let you off.

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,710
Go and call my father.

58
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,000
How's Ying Ying?

59
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,760
To calm down?

60
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,510
Dispelling qi

61
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,150
Miss

62
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,880
We've suffered for more than ten years.

63
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,440
Daddy

64
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,760
Stop

65
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,280
I want to see

66
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,550
Who dares to bully my Su family in the capital?

67
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,190
Shallow

68
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,000
Daddy

69
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,360
Daddy

70
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,000
who

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
to boil

72
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,280
I'm smoking.

73
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,360
Who the hell is that?

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,920
To beat you like this.

75
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,030
Daddy

76
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,760
It's Su Qian's son.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,230
How dare she?

78
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,150
Hit me.

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
Shallow

80
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,030
Well

81
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,630
I'm going to break your legs now.

82
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,510
Dad, are you wrong?

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,550
You bastard.

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,190
Do you know Qian?

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,670
Now not only is it deeply loved by the queen girl.

86
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,760
And was granted the title of Princess Wufeng by the Emperor.

87
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
You're evil.

88
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,360
Half of it is fine.

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,000
And those of you who can't see it,

90
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,760
And bullied Qian repeatedly.

91
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,800
I have long wanted to punish you.

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,320
But when I think about it,

93
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,550
Without experiencing the cold,

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,190
The plum blossoms are not so fragrant.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,190
therefore

96
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,110
I will endure it again and again.

97
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,670
To raise Qian so well.

98
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,510
Pity the whole world.

99
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,230
Did you write it down?

100
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,880
Got it.

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,510
Just like this.

102
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,030
The more wonderful it is, the better.

103
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,960
Don't worry, Duke.

104
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,000
I understand.

105
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,110
Duke Su is here.

106
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
My old age is far away.

107
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,590
I hope Haihan

108
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,590
What are you talking about?

109
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,710
You and I are in-laws.

110
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,230
If I hadn't been busy with my official business,

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,320
I should have come for a walk.

112
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,590
The Crown Prince.

113
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,030
According to rumors,

114
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,320
In order to cultivate Qian Qian,

115
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,360
You didn't waste much effort.

116
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,760
Not only did you place it in the broken chamber,

117
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,800
Even your servants.

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,480
And casually humiliate them.

119
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,070
How about you?

120
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,400
You're like a strict father.

121
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,320
My pleasure.

122
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,230
It's no match for a princess.

123
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,070
To teach Junyao the outstanding general.

124
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,590
That's right.

125
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,000
There are no parents who don't love their children.

126
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,400
Right?

127
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,360
hear

128
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,480
Listen to it.

129
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
Many children

130
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,070
Qian is the most sensible.

131
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,550
You know the most.

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,190
It won't be in vain.

133
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,320
Father's good intention

134
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,150
Qian was very moved.

135
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,760
I dare not forget it.

136
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,710
What I remember most is

137
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,510
My father once told me

138
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,190
When I get married,

139
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,480
Will marry me off.

140
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,960
Hundred acres of fertile land.

141
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,190
Ten thousand taels of gold.

142
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,000
The cloth is 3,000 yuan.

143
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,150
to wait a moment

144
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,920
Hold on.

145
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,670
Twelve beads.

146
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,920
Thirty pearls.

147
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,030
Three boxes of white jade.

148
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,360
The Princess Dowager.

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,030
Enough

150
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,550
Su Qian,

151
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,550
Don't go too far.

152
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,480
This is

153
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,190
She's a smoker.

154
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,710
The Duke of Su

155
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,400
And such a rude daughter.

156
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,070
Why are you yelling in front of the elders?

157
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,360
Kneel down and apologize to Qian.

158
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,400
Daddy

159
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,150
Kneel down

160
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,150
Don't.

161
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,670
father

162
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,630
Don't get angry over such a small thing.

163
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,150
Look.

164
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,920
That's how you behave.

165
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,280
Learn it well.

166
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,480
Father,

167
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,760
My dowry

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,320
As a father, I will follow your heart.

169
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,670
I'll make it up for you.

170
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,150
You should keep this.

171
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,840
Alright.

172
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,150
It's a deal.

173
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,630
You're old.

174
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,920
Go to the Emperor and tell him the truth.

175
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,070
Just say,

176
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Duke Su.

177
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,400
Father and daughter love each other.
