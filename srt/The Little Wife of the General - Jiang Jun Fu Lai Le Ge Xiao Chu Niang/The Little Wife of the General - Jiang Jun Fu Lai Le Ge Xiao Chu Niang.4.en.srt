1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,800
Why didn't my mother-in-law want him to associate with White Lotus?

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,880
Isn't that perfect?

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,590
As long as she likes you,

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,920
In the future,

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,000
Isn't it happier?

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,510
Your brain is too simple.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,320
The rich and powerful have killed many people since ancient times.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,230
It's a knife without blood.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,550
The happier you are, the faster you will die.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,030
Miss, are you exaggerating?

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,400
Don't scare me.

12
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,550
The position of Old Madam and White Lotus,

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,710
That's much smarter than Second Evil.

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,840
The killing is invisible.

15
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,150
Ying Ying, the situation we're in now

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,070
It's tough.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,510
But the white lotus dared to steal my man.

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,510
My palace drama

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,960
For nothing.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,710
According to the current situation,

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,760
Only when you take care of your stomach,

22
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,110
To make this precious man like me.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,070
Fight, Su Shen.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,480
mother

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,710
She made a bowl of cream mushroom soup.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,760
You can try it.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,760
I'm afraid I will fail to live up to your kindness.

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,110
Nothing

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,880
You can try it first.

30
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,760
I really have no appetite.

31
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,000
Shallow

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,550
sit

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,510
It's your first time to cook for me.

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,670
Then I...

35
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,030
Then I will give you face.

36
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,110
I'm God Su.

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
You won't get a false reputation.

38
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,110
Anything else?

39
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,880
Yes

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,800
Another bowl.

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,440
good

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,280
Go.

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,400
go

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,760
Give Junyao a bowl.

45
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,550
go

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,030
mother

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,670
I'm not hungry.

48
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,960
Please eat slowly.

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,030
If it's not enough,

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,760
And ask her to do it.

51
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
Why are you so arrogant?

52
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,030
I'm not your servant.

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,280
come

54
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,510
Try it.

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,960
Open your mouth.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,630
Open your mouth.

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
Ahha

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,920
Your performance today

59
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,110
It's pretty good.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
You're right.

61
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,030
Oh

62
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,800
Oh

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,710
You seem to have something against me.

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,840
I dare not.

65
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,880
Take the initiative to chat.

66
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,800
The sign of the bite.

67
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,630
What are your requirements?

68
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,670
You can mention it.

69
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,510
I will try to make them satisfy you.

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
During this period,

71
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,110
Take care of my mother.

72
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,920
So I don't want to owe you a favor.

73
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,630
I can satisfy your three conditions.

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,150
No need

75
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,030
It's enough to satisfy my condition.

76
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,030
that

77
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,630
Any condition.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,630
can

79
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,710
But it must be reasonable.

80
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,230
good

81
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:53,670
It's a deal

82
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,960
High five, I swear.

83
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,590
hurry up

84
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,480
Hurry up.

85
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,030
Don't hit me randomly next time.

86
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,510
You will get hurt.

87
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,710
This ice face.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,110
It was on purpose.

89
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,880
But I felt warm when I was held by him.

90
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,030
Go for it, Su Shen.

91
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,150
general

92
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,920
Madam, these days,

93
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,360
For the old lady.

94
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,760
None of them are the same.

95
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,590
These dishes

96
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,630
See what one has never seen before

97
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,710
Have never even heard of it

98
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,230
Are you saying that Madam is really a chef?

99
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,590
Check her background.

100
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,110
Madam's background.

101
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,510
General, don't you know?

102
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,360
I'll ask you to go.

103
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,800
yes

104
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,440
Brother Junyao.

105
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,760
Jingruo,

106
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,550
You're back.

107
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,710
I haven't seen you for a long time.

108
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,030
So she kept me in the palace for two more days.

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,030
brother

110
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,510
You look thinner.

111
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,000
Is something bothering you?

112
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,880
Is really haunting.

113
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,630
What's wrong with you, Jing Ruo?

114
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,480
Sick

115
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,480
General general

116
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,360
My lady has been

117
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,440
Although she's in the palace with the Empress,

118
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,800
But most of the time,

119
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,590
Are praying for the general.

120
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
Miss's health is not good.

121
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,070
When the Buddha knelt down,

122
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,230
For several hours.

123
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Kneeling for several hours,

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,550
You can stand so tall and straight.

125
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,670
What a cow!

126
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,670
Jingruo,

127
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,110
sorry

128
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,150
I didn't fulfill my promise.

129
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,000
If I had come earlier,

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,840
Brother Junyao.

131
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,800
Don't take it to heart.

132
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,670
It's just a few jokes from my childhood.

133
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,070
Who would have thought

134
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,960
How could you remember it?

135
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,510
If it weren't for your timely rescue,

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,440
There's no Chu Junyao now.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,030
Sorry, Jing Ruo.

138
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,480
It's all my fault.

139
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Brother Junyao.

140
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,840
Don't blame yourself.

141
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,590
It's hard to disobey the imperial order.

142
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,400
However

143
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,280
Jing Ruo's love for Junyao

144
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,280
The sun and the moon can tell.

145
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,480
You seduced my man so bluntly.

146
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,960
It ticks me off

147
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,800
I'll interrupt her now.

148
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,670
Is it a little...

149
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,000
You care too much about him.

150
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,280
Jingruo.

151
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,510
Jing Ruo.

152
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,150
Hello, aunt.

153
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,510
How is Her Majesty?

154
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,440
Everything goes well

155
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,400
Aunt, don't worry.

156
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,920
That's good.

157
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,630
aunt

158
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,590
You look much better.

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,630
Really?

160
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,510
This?

161
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,840
Thanks to my good daughter-in-law,

162
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,000
Shallow

163
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,280
Qian took good care of me.

164
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,550
You worked hard, Qian.

165
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,030
I'm not tired.

166
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,880
As long as you're healthy.

167
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,800
Because you are the best person to me here.

168
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,310
Look what you said.

169
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,520
Isn't that

170
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,030
Is there Junyao?

171
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,800
We are a family.

172
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,150
Junyao

173
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,600
Right?

174
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,350
What Mother said is that

175
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,030
Fortunately, Mother-in-law came in time.

176
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,030
It seems that the demon of White Lotus

177
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,430
I can't finish it.

178
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,680
Auntie is targeting me.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,760
It must be this Su girl.

180
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,430
The Great White Lotus hates my eyes.

181
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,430
It's so stark.

182
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,520
Mother is so partial to her.

183
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,190
How should I face it?
