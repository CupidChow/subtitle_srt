1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,190
He's here.

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,840
Oh my god, the gorilla is here.

3
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,110
Finished

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,320
It's over.

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,190
Why don't I try something else?

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,000
In order to see my old mother as soon as possible,

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,230
Go for it.

8
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,510
Sleep with him tonight.

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,440
I

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,000
I really really like him.

11
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,800
What does he want?

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,630
To tell you the truth,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,320
It's hard to disobey the imperial order.

14
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,150
You deserve to marry into the General's Mansion.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,000
What a conceited man.

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,800
Since you married into the General's Mansion,

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,840
You must learn to behave yourself.

18
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,480
She's the wife of the general's mansion.

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,760
Take care of yourself.

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,360
I was rejected by the gorilla.

21
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,480
I'm pretty, right?

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,920
I want to see what is in your brain.

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,190
dang!

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,880
This is so cool.

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,070
God is so kind to me.

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,480
I can reach the peak of my life by sleeping with him.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,030
And thank you for throwing a bottle at me.

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,510
So that I can achieve great achievement ahead of time.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,760
today

30
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,110
I will forgive you.

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,190
You need to find the man you really like.

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,000
After getting married with her lover,

33
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,190
And return to the real world.

34
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,150
It's you.

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,190
Finish the task and let me go home.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,440
This beautiful man won't waste my time travelling.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
What are you doing?

38
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,760
You can move to another courtyard tomorrow morning.

39
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,030
I don't want to see your face again.

40
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,840
What does he mean?

41
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,710
According to modern terms,

42
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,960
It's you, Goddess Su, who was abandoned by Gao Fu Shuai.

43
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,110
It seems that this task is very difficult.

44
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,710
mom

45
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,320
You must wait for me.

46
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,840
I should have found a boyfriend.

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,400
Did you finish my mom's wish?

48
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,670
Nothing

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,550
With my wisdom,

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,920
And my beauty.

51
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,320
And my cooking skills,

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm sure I can get this ice face.

53
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,000
Based on my years of experience,

54
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,150
I'm in the cold palace.

55
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,590
You can't see the ice face.

56
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,440
How can I complete my task?

57
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,670
The general said

58
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,400
Madam, don't go out of the yard.

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,150
Miss

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,840
Did you not serve the general well last night?

61
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,590
I'll take care of you.

62
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,480
Look at this.

63
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,510
Isn't that

64
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,920
garden

65
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
A villa.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,030
I'm telling you,

67
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,480
From now on,

68
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,630
This is our base.

69
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,280
Miss, I can't understand you.

70
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you possessed again?

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm on your body.

72
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,400
Just follow me and see how I lead you.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And kicked Miss Second.

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,630
I slept with Ice Face.

75
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,070
general

76
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,760
Old Madam is coming.

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,000
Would you like me to prepare it?

78
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,190
The treatment

79
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,320
I want to lie down.

80
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,440
Remember, remember.

81
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,920
We must not go to corruption because of these materials.

82
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,000
If the old lady wants to come, let me dress up to welcome her.

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,400
This ice face.

84
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,550
Can't it be Nanny Bao?

85
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,920
Whatever.

86
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,280
The transfer is coming.

87
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,000
You must take down my mother-in-law.

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,150
I can only go back if I sleep on ice face.

89
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,630
Your Highness.

90
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,030
I want to see how Ice Face pleases me now.

91
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,280
Please.

92
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,510
If Mother hadn't come,

93
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm too lazy to look at you.

94
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,710
When my mother was here,

95
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,630
Just do your duty.

96
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,190
What does the general mean by duty?

97
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,550
He won't force me, right?

98
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,880
When my mother was around,

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,150
You have to pretend to be in love with me.

100
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,230
To reassure her.

101
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,400
You're so overbearing and selfish.

102
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,840
Move your sister out when you use her.

103
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,030
When you're not using it, you should leave me alone.

104
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,030
What do you take her for?

105
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,150
I'm telling you,

106
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,190
If you want me to pretend love in front of your mother,

107
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,590
Unless you kneel down and beg me,

108
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,400
Oh, my God.

109
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,150
You can play back this cute little face.

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Su Shen.

111
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,280
Please help me.

112
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,760
The boy's soft voice.

113
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,320
To my bone marrow.

114
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,480
Is this the feeling of being in love?

115
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,190
I will be your horse.

116
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,550
Please.

117
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,150
That's more like it.

118
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,030
Sister, think about it.

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,360
Even if you are wild inside,

120
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,360
And be gentle as a sheep.

121
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
Otherwise, I might not survive this episode.

122
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,150
OK

123
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,190
Is there anything else?

124
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,880
Also

125
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,070
When my mother was away,

126
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,320
Don't let me see your face.

127
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,670
Don't you want to see it?

128
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,070
It ticks me off

129
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,670
How could there be such a person?

130
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,510
If I slapped you, I'll slap you.

131
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,840
Look, give him what he can.

132
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,590
Calm down.

133
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,800
Don't be angry. It's important to protect yourself.

134
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,670
Not angry.

135
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,800
I'm not angry at all.

136
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,760
Brother Junyao.

137
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,800
Jingruo.

138
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,560
With my years of watching TV,

139
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,880
This is the opposite.

140
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,600
wow

141
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,960
You're really handsome.

142
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,070
Golden boy and jade girl -- immortal boy and girl in waiting of a divine house

143
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,390
Mother!

144
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
And made the task more difficult for me.

145
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,430
Well

146
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,000
Where's my mother-in-law?
