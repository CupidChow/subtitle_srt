1
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,230
His Majesty, Your Majesty

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,280
At this point,

3
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,880
You're still superior.

4
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,320
Zitong

5
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,440
didn't expect

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,550
It will be you who oppose me.

7
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,320
You and I are husband and wife.

8
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,230
As long as you give the order now,

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,280
Pass on the throne to the second

10
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,510
I will remember you and me.

11
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,510
And ask you to abdicate with dignity.

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,590
Live an easy life in old age

13
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,630
In this case,

14
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,510
I have to thank you.

15
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,630
Emperor

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,110
You are fatuous.

17
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,920
And dethroned Chu Junyao.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,920
I don't think anyone can protect you now.

19
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,880
I

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,630
I can only rely on Chu Junyao.

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,480
What a pity.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,710
What a pity.

23
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,360
Emperor

24
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,440
You're smart.

25
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,510
I don't have to say much about the current situation.

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,150
I believe you can make a wise choice.

27
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,190
Yes?

28
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm issuing an order.

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,670
And let you usurp the throne.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,150
Ah

31
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,710
You're delusional.

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,150
If I don't give the order,

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,480
You will distort the facts.

34
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,960
Why bother?

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,800
All officers and soldiers, listen to me.

36
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,800
in

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,000
Immediately.

38
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,000
The Empress of Zhang Bingyue.

39
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,920
The Second Prince plotted against you.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,280
And demoted to a commoner.

41
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,630
If you make any trouble again,

42
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,280
You can kill no one.

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,230
yes

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,670
Emperor

45
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,440
Emperor

46
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,280
Can't you see the current situation?

47
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,880
Since you don't care,

48
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,280
My concubine.

49
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,550
I'll give you a lift.

50
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,280
kill

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,550
Chu Junyao

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,230
General Wang.

53
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,440
Su's daughter.

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,920
You're still alive.

55
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,920
Hi, Bai Lian.

56
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,630
I won't die even if you die.

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,150
Do you know why I am still alive?

58
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,630
I'm not telling you.

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,550
you

60
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,070
Emperor

61
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,630
I came late to save you.

62
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,760
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

63
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,400
Your Highness, please forgive me.

64
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,510
Everything is as you expected.

65
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,480
Who wants me dead.

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,880
Is the so-called family.

67
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,110
Do everything according to the law.

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,070
I'll obey your order.

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,840
That's great.

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,000
So you're waiting for me here.

71
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,800
Tell me what the situation is.

72
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,000
Actually, His Majesty and my husband

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,550
I've known about the Empress's evil intention.

74
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,150
Empress.

75
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,150
To secretly put chronic poison in the Emperor's diet.

76
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,510
And recruited me to the palace.

77
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,590
And take care of Empress Dowager's meals.

78
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,920
To poison the food of the Empress Dowager secretly.

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,800
To frame me.

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,440
Fortunately, I pumped Empress Dowager's stomach in time.

81
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,550
To save the Empress Dowager.

82
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,710
Your Majesty, you've really gone to great lengths.

83
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,510
In order to get rid of the Emperor's right-hand man,

84
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
You colluded with some evil ministers.

85
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,710
And framed my husband for betraying the country.

86
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,920
Big Bai Lian also planted some fake evidence in my house.

87
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,110
To prove that my husband betrayed the country.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,760
I can't.

89
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,480
We have to take care of it.

90
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,480
To lure the snake out of the cave.

91
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
It's so exciting.

92
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,190
You didn't tell me earlier.

93
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,960
I was so scared.

94
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,320
You're really careless.

95
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,840
You lost everything.

96
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,840
Brother Junyao.

97
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,030
It's because

98
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,840
I did it because I love you so much.

99
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,880
Can you forgive me?

100
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,000
Has come to this point.

101
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,550
You still don't repent.

102
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,800
Are you really

103
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,670
And deceived your humanity.

104
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,480
power

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
desire

106
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,280
Brother Junyao.

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,230
I wanted to be with you from the beginning.

108
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
But what about you?

109
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,360
Even without this woman,

110
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,360
Did you ever treat me with any sincerity?

111
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,150
I want to get you.

112
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,230
No matter what I do,

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,150
Brother Junyao.

114
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,400
I love you so much.

115
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,880
How can I compare to her?

116
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,880
You're so ruthless to me.

117
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,710
heartless

118
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,760
At this moment,

119
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,110
Are you still scheming?

120
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,800
You're just satisfying your ambition.

121
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,030
The man you really want to marry

122
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,630
It's Second Prince.

123
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,760
You want to become the new Empress through him.

124
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,320
Right?

125
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,800
You've been trying to control me with your emotions.

126
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,670
Let me be the sword in your hand.

127
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,840
Then you found out

128
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,150
You can't handle my sword.

129
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,400
You framed me for betraying the country.

130
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,360
Question

131
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,840
Who are you to say that?

132
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,760
Father.

133
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,800
Father.

134
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,960
Father.

135
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,590
Please don't kill me.

136
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,510
These things

137
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,510
Was organized by my mother.

138
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,070
Father.

139
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,070
You must believe me, father.

140
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,630
Father.

141
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,560
Mother,

142
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,840
Mother,

143
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,640
Mother, mother.

144
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Tell father,

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,600
You arranged everything.

146
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,150
Tell him, mother.

147
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,640
Mother,

148
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,390
Worthless waste

149
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,070
Bearer

150
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,880
And sent all the rebels to the prison.

151
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,840
You will be executed on a certain date.

152
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,800
yes
