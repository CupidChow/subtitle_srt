1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,710
Miss

2
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,670
She can handle Su Qian Qian.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,800
Of course.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,230
In the Su family, Su Qian is most afraid of her.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,190
interesting

6
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,440
This bracelet

7
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,320
Was given by Empress Dowager.

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,880
Take it to her.

9
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,630
Ask her to do something for me.

10
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,280
Yes, Miss.

11
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,920
Yes, Mother.

12
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,280
Shallow

13
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,190
sit

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,670
mother

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,760
What's your order?

16
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,230
I miss you.

17
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,150
I heard you opened a restaurant.

18
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:22,880
gosh!

19
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,400
I guess she doesn't want her daughter-in-law to be exposed.

20
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,760
Nothing

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,590
You don't have to worry too much.

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,760
The Chu women

23
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,360
In the past, you fought with men on horseback.

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,590
What does it matter that you only opened a restaurant?

25
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,480
You scared me to death.

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,150
mother

27
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,190
You're really broad-minded.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,440
Take a broad and long-term view

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,510
Qian, give you a thumbs up.

30
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,070
Look what you said.

31
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,230
I just want to ask you

32
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,590
Well

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,030
Why did you open the restaurant?

34
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,840
Just to make money?

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,070
To earn money.

36
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,360
Ah

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,840
Here's the thing.

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,360
In our place.

39
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,280
You can't do anything without money.

40
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,000
You can't even find a good place to drink.

41
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,510
You need money to eat and drink.

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
I'm poor and scared.

43
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,440
In your Su mansion,

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,960
Is the competition so fierce?

45
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,630
Ah

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
I forgot that in ancient times,

47
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,880
Oh

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,070
Of course.

49
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,320
Here's what I think.

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,070
When the money has accumulated to a certain extent,

51
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,440
I'll take it out.

52
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,840
To relieve the people.

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,230
And pay for the troops.

54
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,150
To serve the motherland in another way.

55
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,030
Of course.

56
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,510
This can't be achieved overnight.

57
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,670
But I think

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,150
As long as you stick to your dream,

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,960
It must be better and better.

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,360
very good

61
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,510
With your high consciousness,

62
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,030
I'm relieved.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
It's shallow.

64
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,280
In the future,

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,480
With the strong backing of the Chu family,

66
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,920
You can go ahead boldly.

67
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,110
With your words,

68
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,710
I'm so relieved.

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,000
come

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,670
We're done.

71
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,320
Let's have soup then.

72
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,440
You're too ruthless.

73
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,800
That's a lot.

74
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,360
What should we do tonight?

75
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,960
What's wrong?

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
mother

77
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,590
You care about us so much.

78
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,840
It's really touching.

79
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,030
Don't you work day and night?

80
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,920
How can I have grandchildren earlier?

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,760
I haven't got it yet.

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,360
Grandma, this is the rhythm of killing people.

83
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,670
come up

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,670
Ah

85
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,630
Alright.

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,590
I didn't expect that a woman like you

87
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,400
So unreserved.

88
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,190
The floor is too hard and I can't sleep well.

89
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,190
Besides,

90
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,480
We have a record.

91
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,630
I'm sleeping with you, which is also protected by law.

92
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,360
You're always teased by a woman.

93
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,360
I have no face.

94
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,630
I'll sleep with you.

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
Fellow villagers,

96
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,480
Don't miss it when you pass by.

97
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,710
Come and have a look.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,190
This shop is opening today.

99
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,800
Welcome.

100
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,630
All the drinks and food are free today.

101
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,670
It doesn't matter if you can't finish it. You can take it all away.

102
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,550
Su Qian Qian is really something.

103
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,230
Miss

104
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,000
Su Qian let so many people eat and drink for free.

105
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,400
How much is the loss?

106
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,590
You can't return to Ben for a while.

107
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,550
You're wrong.

108
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,960
I have to say that Su Qian's cooking skills are indeed excellent.

109
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,440
As long as everyone has eaten her dishes,

110
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,400
Her business will definitely be profitable.

111
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,800
Su Qian,

112
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,880
This is really brilliant.

113
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,110
He's getting harder to deal with.

114
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,320
Miss

115
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,550
What should we do next?

116
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,670
A person in a high position is liable to be attacked

117
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,800
There must be something wrong.

118
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,230
We'll see.

119
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,030
Correct!

120
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,190
How is the thing I asked you to do with Miss Su?

121
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,030
She said yes.

122
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,150
good

123
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,920
Ask Su Qian to come out to see me.

124
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,230
Sir, our boss is cooking in the kitchen.

125
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm busy.

126
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,800
And now you're the boss.

127
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,920
Tell her.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,360
If you don't come out to see me,

129
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,000
I was smashed.

130
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,590
She's really busy in the kitchen.

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,760
Who is it?

132
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,110
I don't think any of you dare.

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,670
You're just a director.

134
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,710
And listen to the instigation of some ignorant women.

135
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
I don't know that the sky is the sky.

136
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,840
Do you know who owns this shop?

137
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,510
A group of buckets.

138
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,710
I won't even know how to die.

139
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,590
Elder male cousin

140
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,320
We are not afraid of them.

141
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,030
I've found out everything.

142
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,190
Su Qian is not popular in the General's Mansion.

143
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,760
Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing business in public.

144
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,510
Anyway, if you don't seal this shop,

145
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,630
She'll ignore you from now on.

146
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,920
Younger female cousin

147
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,480
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

148
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,150
If you don't do it,

149
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,630
Hit it.

150
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,400
Get out of here.

151
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,800
I broke them all.

152
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,320
over there

153
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,840
Smash
