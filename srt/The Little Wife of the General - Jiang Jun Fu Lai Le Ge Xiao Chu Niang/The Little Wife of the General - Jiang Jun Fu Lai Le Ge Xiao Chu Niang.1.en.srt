1
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,590
God, you're so good at fooling people.

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,230
If you really want me to marry a man,

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,400
We didn't even see each other, so we got married.

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,440
What if I don't like it?

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,710
I can't go back to the wedding.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,800
How can I fix it?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,800
He's here.

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,440
Oh my god, the gorilla is here.

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,550
Stop, stop.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,760
Here's the thing.

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,960
My name is Su Qian.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,440
I'm almost 30 years old.

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,670
This is the ninety-ninth time I have been caught by my old mother.

14
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,440
As the top chef of Michelin three-star restaurant,

15
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,070
I think it's the same as cooking.

16
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,030
You must be careful.

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,190
Beat me to death.

18
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,480
Fight.

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,280
Hello, mom.

20
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,280
Hold the flowers in your hands.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,360
When I see the boy with the rose,

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,360
Is your blind date.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,440
No matter how ugly he is,

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,840
You have to talk to me.

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,030
I know, mom.

26
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,280
Obscene uncle.

27
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,960
Su Qian,

28
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,360
Stop right there.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,000
It's for you.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,510
Su Qian,

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,880
Shallow

32
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,230
My time is running out.

33
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,590
Mom, what are you talking about?

34
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,230
Don't scare me.

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,190
Mom forced you to date.

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,550
Because my time is running out.

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,030
I can't stay with you for so long.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,400
mom

39
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,670
You are a lowly concubine.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,230
You deserve your mother to die early.

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,590
Whose voice?

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,550
Don't fight. Fight.

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,150
The Su family

44
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,670
Isn't there a maidservant?

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,480
Ask her to marry the hairy general for us.

46
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,630
Mom, mom.

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,800
Miss, are you awake?

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,030
Who are you?

49
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,070
Where is it?

50
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,630
I remember I was hit by a car on the road just now.

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,190
Why is everything okay?

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,760
Oh, right.

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,230
Have you seen my mother?

54
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,110
Miss

55
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,670
The old lady has passed away for a long time.

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,800
Don't scare me.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,550
What did you say

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,510
My mother is dead.

59
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,150
Miss

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,150
You lost your memory.

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,440
You look so familiar.

62
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
You look like the maid in the drama.

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,320
Your name is Ying Ying.

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,590
I'm Ying Ying.

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,110
What?

66
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,070
Why am I in my own drama?

67
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,670
I

68
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,480
Do you have any idea?

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,670
Can let me die.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,480
Miss

71
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,510
Are you out of your mind?

72
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,320
How can I go back if I am not dead?

73
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,960
I

74
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,190
Oh dear

75
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,920
How can an ordinary person have the courage to die?

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,110
Are you asking me

77
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,840
Pass this character.

78
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,400
I haven't finished my drama.

79
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,590
How am I supposed to know what happened?

80
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,630
And I'm only a chef.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
I

82
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,230
Su Qian,

83
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,190
mom

84
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,110
mom

85
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,400
Where is it, Mum?

86
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,920
You want to go back to the real world?

87
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,880
Must complete the following conditions

88
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,960
You need to find the man you really like.

89
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,070
After getting married with her lover,

90
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,280
And return to the real world.

91
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,190
It's so embarrassing.

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,630
I want to leave my first time here.

93
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,670
Your deadline.

94
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,360
There are only 77 and 49 days.

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,880
If you fail to complete the mission, you will be destroyed.

96
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,840
Oh, my God.

97
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,550
You're really my real mother.

98
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
But I want to go back now.

99
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,760
mom

100
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,070
mom

101
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you still there, Mum?

102
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,480
You scared me to death.

103
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,510
Miss, can you stop mentioning Madam?

104
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm a little scared.

105
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,070
Your lady

106
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,510
Do you have a boyfriend?

107
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,880
Is a lover.

108
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,480
Miss, how long has it been since you last met a man? Don't you know?

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
This lady is miserable.

110
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,280
that

111
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,110
I have to go back to see my mom.

112
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,590
such

113
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,440
Tomorrow morning, we'll go to find a man.

114
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,280
Miss, tomorrow is your wedding day.

115
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,150
So fast.

116
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,070
It's easy.

117
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
We can get married tomorrow.

118
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,280
Oh

119
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,230
I remember now.

120
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,230
This lady is acting for her two evil sisters.

121
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,230
To marry General Long Hair.

122
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,190
Who dares to scold me like that?

123
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,230
Miss, she heard you scolding Second Young Lady.

124
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,630
What are you afraid of?

125
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,510
You look so incompetent.

126
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,800
You're the prettiest girl.

127
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,800
A snake demon face with a fork.

128
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,070
Kdjkdykfkkkk

129
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,710
You think bullying is funny?

130
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm telling you, you were born by your parents. No one spoiled you.

131
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,230
How dare you scold me?

132
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,480
I just want to scold you, not you.

133
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
What do you mean?

134
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,880
Miss

135
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,590
She scolded you for not being a human.

136
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,000
Hit her.

137
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,030
Who dares?

138
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,190
to wait a moment

139
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,880
You must bluff him.

140
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,150
Don't you dare?

141
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,630
Or I'll be beaten.

142
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,480
Don't do that to your face.

143
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,800
dang!

144
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,150
You're getting married tomorrow.

145
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,230
As a sister, I have to see you off.

146
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,150
You're so handsome.

147
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,550
Think about it.

148
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,150
I can't hit you anymore. It's so hard.

149
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,760
What do they want?

150
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,510
Get some slops for her.

151
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,760
Are you crazy?

152
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,800
The general still married a woman he didn't love.

153
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,110
You can practice the Pure Yang Power.

154
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,030
The hair is different from ordinary people.

155
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,400
Only when we're done,

156
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,280
To return to normal.

157
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,480
But today is your wedding day.

158
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,400
Why don't we shave it off?

159
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,510
Why should I do what others like?

160
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,070
roll

161
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,000
Alright.

162
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,840
God, you're so good at fooling people.

163
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,480
If you really want me to marry a man,

164
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,630
We didn't even see each other, so we got married.

165
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,670
What if I don't like it?

166
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,960
I can't go back to the wedding.

167
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,030
How can I fix it?

168
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,960
He's here.

169
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,310
Oh my god, the gorilla is here.

170
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,110
Finished

171
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,310
It's over.
