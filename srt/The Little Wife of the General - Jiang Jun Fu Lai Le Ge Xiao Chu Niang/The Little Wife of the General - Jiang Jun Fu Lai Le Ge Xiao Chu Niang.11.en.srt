1
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,960
how could that be?

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,070
So it's Fu Shao.

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,000
Lord Zhang.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,280
He took my gold and hit my men.

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,510
You're so ruthless.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,710
How dare you stir up trouble under the Emperor's feet?

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,800
And a brainless man.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,280
Bearer

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,840
in

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,920
to carry

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,710
yes

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,480
wanton

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,920
He's a minister of the Capital Zhao Mansion.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,070
Indiscriminately.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,440
Be servile to one's superiors and tyrannical to one's subordinates

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,150
Are you worthy of this official uniform?

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,550
Don't talk here.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,920
After I take you down,

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,670
I will interrogate you severely.

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,800
If you don't do it,

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,670
to wait a moment

22
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,760
Did you bring the jade pendant I gave you?

23
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,670
Young Lord of the Capital Zhao Mansion doesn't recognize me.

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,590
But the royal jade pendant must be recognized.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,230
No

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,070
I seem to have pawned it.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,150
you

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,710
I really lost to you.

29
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,840
Go with them.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,440
I'll get help.

31
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,110
You bet the wrong thing.

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,230
This is the strongest generation of bullshit.

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,670
surrender

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
surrender

35
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,960
to carry

36
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,800
If there is someone in life,

37
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,510
When you first saw him,

38
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,960
You already know it's him.

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,110
Now I know

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,480
Love is so easy.

41
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,440
No matter how affectionate, it's better than love at first sight.

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,320
You can't fall in love at first sight.

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,800
Are you all right?

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,030
My woman.

45
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,840
How dare you touch it?

46
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,280
Don't leave them standing.

47
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,280
yes

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,590
General, this is all a misunderstanding.

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,590
General general

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,880
My heart is like Schrodinger's cat.

51
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,630
Sweet and confusing.

52
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,590
And watch the rainbow man come

53
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,920
I quickly collapsed into a Pavlovian dog.

54
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,480
And excited.

55
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,880
If the previous courtship was to go home,

56
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,000
Now,

57
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,760
Only love you.

58
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,710
A heart to you.

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,550
I'm not a fickle person.

60
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
Just let me fall in love with someone.

61
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,920
I need time.

62
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,150
Are you still shy?

63
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,230
Aren't you good at it?

64
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,230
It's not the drug.

65
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,400
In the normal range.

66
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,590
You bastard, Chu Junyao.

67
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,760
I have to go to the barracks later.

68
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Tonight, you just...

69
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,710
I know.

70
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,710
I will be careful.

71
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,920
I won't bother you anymore.

72
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,800
I mean,

73
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,920
I'll ask Zixuan to bring you a hundred guards.

74
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,150
Ah

75
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,630
That's too high profile.

76
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,960
Is it bad?

77
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,670
I want a tall one.

78
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,510
You should be handsome.

79
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,070
To be strong.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,920
Mainly

81
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,710
It looks safe.

82
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,190
I'm telling you,

83
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,550
If I hadn't happened to pass by today,

84
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,360
You and your wife might be taken away.

85
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,150
General, if you really treat our lady well,

86
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,840
We don't have to go out and do business in public.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,920
So,

88
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,030
What the general really cares about is Miss Jing Ruo.

89
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,590
Maybe

90
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,840
general

91
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,480
Empress Dowager's order came from the palace.

92
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,360
I want you to bring your wife to the palace.

93
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,360
Well

94
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,670
I haven't visited my grandmother in the palace for some time.

95
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,360
go

96
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,480
Call Madam.

97
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,320
yes

98
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,880
My grandson paid a visit to my grandmother.

99
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,760
Her grandson's wife, Su Qian, paid a visit to the Empress Dowager.

100
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,000
what are you doing?

101
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,190
Oh, I forgot to kneel.

102
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,840
And kowtow to you.

103
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,110
How could he give such a great gift?

104
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,800
Hurry up. Hurry.

105
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,030
I wish Empress Dowager

106
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,880
The Second Dragon's Drama.

107
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,440
You can make a fortune in all seasons.

108
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
The Five Blessings and the Six Clans are in good luck.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,710
The seven stars shine in the sky.

110
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,670
The Nine Months Luck.

111
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,760
Perfect

112
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,840
Ever-young

113
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Ever-young

114
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,630
Will you become an old monster?

115
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,670
I like this kid.

116
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,400
Just like Junyao.

117
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,280
It's called grandmother.

118
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,550
Grandmother

119
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,590
Alright.

120
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,150
Young Master, did I make a face for you today?
