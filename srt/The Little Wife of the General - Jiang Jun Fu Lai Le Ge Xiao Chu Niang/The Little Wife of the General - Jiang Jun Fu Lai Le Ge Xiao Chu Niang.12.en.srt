1
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,440
The fastest mouse is back.

2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,760
Is it a waste?

3
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,710
Ying Ying, don't let yourself go.

4
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,760
If you don't want to die,

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,440
to feel relieved

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,230
How can I treat a little girl the same?

7
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,510
I'm leaving first. There's a reason.

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,760
As me, I'm fighting outside.

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,190
You'll lose your dignity.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,230
wow

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,110
You're right.

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,710
You're wasting your time.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,150
You're so generous.

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,710
You are so mean.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You don't know me very well.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,230
I regard money as rubbish.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,480
Of course, you are the most important in my heart.

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,710
Stop it.

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,670
Really

20
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,440
First of all, I'm not a bitch.

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,400
Second, I don't want you for nothing. I'll give you shares.

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,510
What is a share?

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll talk to you later.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,880
I need to discuss my business plan with you.

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,670
I want our hotels to spread all over the country.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,710
You're the boss of these things.

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Now, dare you make a bowl for me?

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,360
Eclipsed fried rice

29
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,710
I'm injured.

30
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,230
Or you can do it yourself.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,800
This is also good.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,280
You didn't eat this.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,190
general

34
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,150
The old lady said

35
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,480
The rumor of slandering Madam was spread by Jing Ya.

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,400
You said

37
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,030
Jing Ruo doesn't feel sorry for Qian.

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,920
general

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,510
You're obsessed with the situation.

40
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,670
In her words,

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,070
To see the essence through the appearance.

42
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,550
Madam and Jing Ruo

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,030
There's no injustice.

44
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,960
Why are you so targeted?

45
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,400
The fundamental reason

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,030
It's you, General.

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,670
you

48
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,760
You're really something.

49
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a woman who wants to have a bite.

50
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,360
Shut up if you can't speak.

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,920
No

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,110
general

53
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,590
You are too tolerant to Miss Jing Ruo.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
This rumor

55
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,510
You didn't say anything harsh.

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,440
If Madam knows,

57
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,440
You must be upset.

58
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,070
in one's childhood

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,550
Jing Ruo and I were kidnapped by human traffickers.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,070
It's because of Jing Ruo.

61
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,710
So I can escape.

62
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,960
It can be said that I have

63
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
With kindness.

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,030
So since then,

65
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,960
I promised her

66
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,320
To repay her for the rest of my life.

67
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:03,880
general

68
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,840
Kindness is not love.

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,360
You can repay her in other ways.

70
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,110
Don't hurt your heart.

71
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,760
when the moment comes

72
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,070
I suddenly realized

73
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,030
It will be too late.

74
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,000
You know,

75
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,440
You can't enjoy it if you leave it here.

76
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,400
Why do you have to suffer?

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,480
Think of a way.

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,920
To persuade her.

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,800
Don't open a shop.

80
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,920
general

81
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,190
Madam said that

82
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,150
At the end of the year,

83
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,670
And took out 20,000 taels of silver.

84
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,840
To fund the military.

85
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,800
The general said that

86
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,030
Is there something wrong with your ears?

87
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,880
I asked you to protect her.

88
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,480
And the safety of the restaurant.

89
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,400
roll

90
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,760
Madam

91
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,190
You're really amazing.

92
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,880
I told the general everything you told me.

93
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,030
General, that's called meditation.

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,630
It was like an epiphany.

95
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,070
And told me about his tragic past.

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,400
Really

97
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,150
Really

98
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,840
Tell me.

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,280
The general said

100
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,280
No wonder he indulges in everything.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,590
So there's a secret.

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,110
What if the white lotus is holding my husband?

103
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,510
Madam

104
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,360
What's wrong?

105
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,190
My lady asked you to go there.

106
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:54,960
cut

107
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,510
The weasel gives the chicken

108
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,070
Oh, no.

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,510
I didn't mean to.

110
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,190
Alright.

111
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,960
This way.

112
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
What's wrong with your legs?

113
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,670
I forgot to wind it up.

114
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,400
Miss

115
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,960
The general's wife has arrived.

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,630
sister

117
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,000
Sister-in-law, please have a seat.

118
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,280
Jing Ya, go down first.

119
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,070
I'm talking to my sister-in-law.

120
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,800
Is this a grand banquet?

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,280
Where did the axeman hide?

122
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,320
Sister-in-law

123
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,510
What are you looking at?

124
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,400
Oh

125
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,920
Your room is well decorated.

126
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,400
Very white lotus.

127
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,800
What do you mean?

128
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,110
To compliment you.

129
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,480
It's you.

130
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,440
She's like a lotus.

131
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,960
Sister-in-law, you are really good at praising people.

132
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,510
Is this the poison in tea?

133
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,000
come

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Try the health tea made by Tianshan snow lotus.

135
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,150
How far is the Tianshan Mountain? Liar!

136
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,840
Miss Zhang,

137
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,800
If you need help, just tell me.

138
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,840
I don't have so many twists and turns.

139
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,670
Sister-in-law is a straightforward person.

140
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,110
Then I'll be frank with you.

141
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,440
Jing Ruo replaced the wine with tea.

142
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,000
To make up for your loss.

143
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,000
For what happened last night,

144
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,840
trifle

145
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,840
Not to

146
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,630
As long as you don't go too far.

147
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,110
I can still forgive you for your kindness to my husband.

148
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,800
And those rumors.

149
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
It's all because Jing Ruo didn't cure it well.

150
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,190
And let those maids talk about it.

151
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,670
Aunt and I have scolded her.

152
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,760
Please don't care about her.

153
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,280
So the cockfighting was beaten.

154
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,800
It's so miserable to be a keyboard warrior in your ancient times.

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,880
What do you mean?

156
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,840
You don't have to apologize for such a small matter.

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,710
I'm tired too.

158
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,510
I'm leaving now.

159
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,630
I'll give it to your sister-in-law.

160
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,070
No need

161
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,440
Sister-in-law, take care.

162
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,670
Miss, what are you writing?

163
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
To open a five-star hotel.

164
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
The Guest Service Department.

165
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,230
And the kitchen department.

166
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,840
So many people.

167
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,110
How much will it cost?

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,510
You're so professional.

169
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,230
General, the evidence is conclusive.

170
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,350
You have to make decisions for our lady.

171
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,470
What's wrong?
