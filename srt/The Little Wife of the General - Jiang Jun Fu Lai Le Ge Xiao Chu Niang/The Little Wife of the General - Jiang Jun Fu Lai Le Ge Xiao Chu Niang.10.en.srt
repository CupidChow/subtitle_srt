1
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,590
Jing Ruo.

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,030
But aunt,

3
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,000
You've gone too far.

4
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,670
Don't tell me.

5
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,510
How could it be?

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,000
Aunt is also kind.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,190
and

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,630
This girl, Jing Ya,

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,440
I've been a little tired recently.

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,480
Auntie, don't ever say that again.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,110
Oh that's true!

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,670
Our relationship

13
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,920
You can't be so separated.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,440
but

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,030
This is the way to get along.

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,230
Be courteous.

17
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,760
Lord, once,

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,030
The rules are the rules.

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,510
It's like

20
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,550
It's shallow.

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,550
She is Junyao's wife.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,960
Tell me.

23
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,960
These lowly maids

24
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,550
How dare you talk behind my back?

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,880
You know,

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,030
Such a thing,

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,360
Should I be punished?

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,110
And this kind of thing.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,670
You should be punished.

30
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,110
And should be punished severely.

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:29,710
such

32
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,880
So I can adopt the right family law.

33
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,030
You're right.

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,150
next time

35
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,710
Is not just a simple matter of family law.

36
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,920
All right.

37
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't mention such bad luck.

38
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,550
Auntie asked you to come.

39
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,440
I want you to taste the newly made osmanthus cake.

40
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,110
come

41
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,630
the two of us

42
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,800
And gossiping.

43
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,670
Thank you, aunt.

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,920
Eat it.

45
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,320
This is made by Qian himself.

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
It's very sweet.

47
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm telling you,

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,400
Today,

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,190
We can't just leave it at that.

50
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,150
that

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,630
What do you want?

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Look at your outfit.

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,320
And rich.

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,150
How about this?

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,960
You two...

56
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,590
To compensate me for 1,000 taels of gold.

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,320
you

58
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,110
And kowtow.

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,510
apologize

60
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,510
Look at this young man.

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,230
If I had so much money,

62
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,840
Why should I waste time with the boss?

63
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,840
Or else,

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Please let it go.

65
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,920
If it's anyone else,

66
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,320
I'll forget it.

67
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,400
The point is,

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
Your name

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,400
Let me

70
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,440
I'm not happy.

71
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,150
name

72
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,960
What name?

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,150
Su Shen.

74
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,190
Su Shen.

75
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,670
I announce that from now on,

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,510
call

77
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,840
It's Little Su.

78
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,840
How about Little Su?

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,230
Okay, you little bastard.

80
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,920
How dare you play with me?

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,550
No, no.

82
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,070
come

83
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,000
Give it to me.

84
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,800
to slap

85
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,960
to wait a moment

86
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,710
Let's play together.

87
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,150
Hit her, hit her

88
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,070
She's tough.

89
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,480
She can beat me.

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,320
Give it to me.

91
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,110
to wait a moment

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,920
We're from the General's Mansion.

93
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,190
Is there any proof?

94
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,880
voucher

95
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,400
What document?

96
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,480
You're bold.

97
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
How dare you pretend?

98
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,590
I'm telling you,

99
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,280
Even if the people from the General's Mansion come today,

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,550
I have to watch my face.

101
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,510
Beat me to death.

102
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,670
If you have something to say,

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,360
Missyou

104
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,710
Both of them.

105
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,630
who?

106
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,000
Miss

107
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:07,960
Get up.

108
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,000
Who are you?

109
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,230
Why did the goods come here?

110
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,150
You look good.

111
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,510
The one you can't offend.

112
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,400
In the capital,

113
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,670
I'm as rich as the sea, but I haven't managed to offend many people.

114
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,280
What are you?

115
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,800
If you want to fool me,

116
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,320
Please continue.

117
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,760
If you don't know the real identity of Nangong Hao,

118
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,960
I think

119
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,400
He is really good at acting.

120
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,190
Break his leg.

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
Oops, I'll go.

122
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,630
I didn't expect he's a master.

123
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,150
Get up, you good-for-nothing.

124
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,920
Alright, Su Qianqian.

125
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,670
How could you let her be so partial to you?

126
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,760
That's a good way to do it.

127
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,630
Miss

128
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,670
Calm down

129
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,400
You are useless.

130
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,480
You can't handle such a small matter.

131
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,030
Later, you will go to the old woman to plead guilty.

132
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,510
You must leave me out of this.

133
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,110
Miss

134
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Old Madam found a reason casually today.

135
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,550
So he beat me half to death.

136
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,550
If I confess again,

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,070
fear

138
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,710
I'm afraid that my life

139
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,510
Jingya.

140
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,110
By now, the old lady should have known that you spread the rumors.

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,150
This time,

142
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
You can't avoid it.

143
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,440
Miss

144
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,150
I volunteered to be a lady.

145
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,230
Ready to die the cruelest death for principles

146
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,590
But I'm not convinced.

147
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,360
Su's daughter is sinister and cunning.

148
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,440
You must not let her off so easily.

149
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,190
Su Da Shen.

150
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,320
How is my martial arts?

151
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,440
Here you are.

152
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,110
I'll give you a thumbs up.

153
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,030
Praise it.

154
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,800
Compared to Chu Junyao,

155
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,920
How about I make an arrangement for you?

156
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,110
You two are competing.

157
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,280
Forget it.

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,480
Do you know who I am?

159
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,630
My childe is the leader of the court.

160
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,800
The son of Lord Fuhai.

161
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,880
If you don't break your feet today,

162
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
We can't get out of here.

163
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,110
Hey,

164
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,110
So he's a prince of Yi Pin High School.

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,920
You're so powerful.

166
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,190
I'm standing here today.

167
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,150
Who dares to play?

168
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,480
Please be smart.

169
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,070
This is a prince.

170
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,480
The Second Strongest Generation.

171
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Young Master, I've informed the people of Jingzhao Mansion.

172
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,670
See how long he can be arrogant.

173
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,320
Let's call someone.

174
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,190
Sure.

175
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,110
otherwise

176
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,150
You can't lose face.

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Call someone.

178
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,280
Come on.

179
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,840
I

180
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,000
Anyway, I don't have any child.

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,630
There are so many people in the General's Mansion.

182
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,760
Just bring a group of people from the army.

183
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,710
Kill them all.

184
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,800
You sound like a cow.

185
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,230
Why don't you say you're the Heavenly King?

186
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,710
You want to open a restaurant?

187
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,480
That's right.

188
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,800
But I can't afford it.

189
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,150
That's easy.

190
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,190
I'll pay the money.

191
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,320
How about I cover the court?

192
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
No.

193
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,070
This is my own business.

194
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,520
I don't want to be your tool.

195
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,880
The restaurant is still yours.

196
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,350
How about I pay for the meal?

197
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,800
Good cooperation.

198
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,920
how could that be?

199
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,960
So it's Fu Shao.

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,880
Lord Zhang.

201
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,150
He took my gold and hit my men.

202
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,350
You're so ruthless.

203
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,070
Bearer

204
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,760
in

205
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,390
to carry

206
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:55,920
yes
