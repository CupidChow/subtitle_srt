20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,120
You are still trying so hard.

21
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,901
You continued practicing
after the shop closed.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,510
I only have mediocre talent.

23
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,400
Unlike you,

24
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,429
I am not talented.

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,150
What did you mean on the phone?

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,560
I found this in Mr. Zheng's cabinet
of the locker room.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,870
The date indicated here happens to be

28
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,890
(Li's Restaurant Ham Order Form)
the day before us making the ham.

29
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,760
(Signed by Zheng Fangxing)
But our Chef had sent you to buy the ham.

30
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,310
Are you suspecting Mr. Zheng
bought the inferior-quality ham

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,000
and swapped the ingredients?

32
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,920
I am not sure.

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,190
But don't you think
it is such a coincidence?

34
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,470
I saw Mr. Zheng and Liu Ping
at on the roadside yesterday.

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,400
Liu Ping?

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,310
Isn't he the Chef
of the Liu's Restaurant?

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,630
He is said to have joined the Yuan's
in cutting off the supply of Chuncheng.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,120
No wonder.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,430
Back then,
I really found Mr. Zheng suspicious.

40
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,430
But your call made me change my mind.

41
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,430
I wanted to tell you the truth ASAP.

42
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,910
No.

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,400
You are a fanatic admirer of Jiang Jie.

44
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,030
If Mr. Zheng had been the culprit,

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,030
you would have told Jiang Jie immediately

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,280
instead of telling me, a nobody.

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,120
All people know I admire him,

48
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,590
but he has never fixed eyes on me.

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,360
Pick up the phone.

50
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,560
Pick up the phone.

51
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,590
It is me.

52
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,630
I replaced the onigiri.

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
Then what?

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,800
I did such an insignificant thing,

55
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,470
but they gave me a lot of money.

56
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,080
An insignificant thing?

57
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,710
Don't you know poisoned food
can kill people.

58
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,120
When those kids took over the food
from you,

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,750
they even thanked you.

60
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,870
What do you know?

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,520
Li Nai,

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,910
you are a genius.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
You are endowed with a gift.

64
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,470
You don't know what difficulties
we ordinary people have.

65
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,800
Do you know how many people

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
I have defeated to work in Chuncheng?

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,910
Thirty-five.

68
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,430
He chose me from 35 candidates.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I even defeated you.

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,520
However, why are you the one

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
who will join him in the contest?

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,080
Why were you promoted
to the chef assistant?

73
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,080
If you are not satisfied with your job,

74
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,430
you can go tell it to Jiang Jie.

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,280
Jiang Jie

76
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,750
doesn't know

77
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,080
you are trying to open a shop, right?

78
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
Cut the crap. What exactly do you want?

79
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,310
What do I want?

80
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,680
I also want to know.

81
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,710
I have seen the lordly Jiang Jie

82
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,030
get into trouble due to my tricks.

83
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,120
Actually, it is high time I left.

84
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,600
But when I think of you,

85
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,870
I feel unfair.

86
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,120
I do feel unfair.

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
If people find

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,270
that you sneak in

89
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,750
when Chuncheng is closed

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,160
and set the kitchen on fire,

91
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,800
do you think you can

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
be cleared of suspicion?

93
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,750
You are totally unrepentant.

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,720
Are you all right?

95
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,800

You finally saw me.

100
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,190

but also make you two
remember me forever.

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160

Chef,

148
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,950
the first-hand information
has been posted on the forum.

149
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,390
The public opinion is being reversed.

150
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,310
Our restaurant will be able to
resume business soon.

151
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,070
Do we need more tables?

152
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,630
No.

153
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,430

we seem to be concealing something.

If she doesn't come,
her pay will be deducted.

160

Got it.

161

Following the wind,
it slips into the night.

162

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,830
What nonsense.

165
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,480
Mr. Jiang,

166
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,030
this is what happened.

167
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,200
Jiang Jie is puffed with pride.

168
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,630
Such a grievance is nothing.

169
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,790
But if he is allowed to

170
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,480
seize another knife

171
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,120
from one of
the Cao, Li, Chai and Ge families,

172
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,600
as per the rules,

173
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,480
he'll be qualified to
challenge your Jiang family.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,960
What?

175
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,320
You think our Jiang family
is the food market

176
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,670
where people can haggle?

177
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,480
No, I didn't mean that.

178
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,870
These are the rules
made by our ancestors.

179
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,440
Jiang Jie is cunning and devious.

180
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
We have to be on guard.

181
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't believe

182
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,790
Jiang Jie is that capable.

183
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,000
Liu,

184
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,960
it's not the past now.

185
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,480
Back then, people flattered us

186
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,600
and made our Jiang family the defender.

187
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,390
Now

188
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,320
I only wish our Jiang family

189
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,910
could stay safe.

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,960
Do you understand?

191
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,030
Yes, I do.

192
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,790
Please.

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,080
He is the offspring
of our Jiang family after all.

194
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,200
He is really something.

195
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Will your Jiang family stay out of this?

196
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,240
Mr. Liu,

197
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,000
about Jiang Jie's background,

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,510
I don't believe you know nothing.

199
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,440
Xiu,

200
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,480
this is our guest. Be careful.

201
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,630
Guest?

202
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,720
Are you leaving?

203
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,550
Yes, I am off.

204
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,480
Chef Jiang.

205
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,790
I will escort you out.

206
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,360
No, you need not do that.

207
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,390
I'll take my leave, Mr. Jiang.

208
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,360
Take care, Mr. Liu.

209
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:47,750
Get out.

210
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,200
Dad,

211
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,960
where are Jiang Jie
and the others going?

212
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,750
Why isn't grandpa seeing them off?

213
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,030
Xuyang,

214
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,670
see clearly.

215
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,910
There is no affection
in your grandpa's heart.

216
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,750
Those worthless people

217
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,200
just ended up like this.

218
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,960
So remember this.

219
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,480
Zhu Hao, help Jiang Jie to seize
the next knife quickly.

220
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,670
Otherwise, he is useless to me.

221
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,870
Can you see that?

222
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,260
(Baichuan Municipal Public Security Bureau
Xinhua Police Station)

223
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,510
If you cause trouble to Jiang Jie
next time,

224
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,120
you won't have a chance to be bailed.

225
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,630
Hurry up!

226
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,000
I can

227
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,910
put two tables here.

228
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,120
I can put the cashier here.

229
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,240
My kitchen will be here.

230
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,240
The kitchen counter will be here.

231
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,360
This is where I give play to my talent.

232
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,600
What do you think?

233
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
It's good.

234
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,360
You will be the Sous Chef.

235
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,030
And I will be the Head Chef.

236
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Perfect.

237
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,200
Perfect.

238
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,390
But I sent my resume to Xijiangyue.

239
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
You did that?

240
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,030
The job at the convenience store

241
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,120
inspired you so soon?

242
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,360
Why do you want to work in Xijiangyue?

243
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,510
Here is the thing.

244
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,630
Tell me frankly.

245
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
I fell in love with a girl
at first sight.

246
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,080
Have we been out of touch for long?

247
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,390
What is unknown to me?

248
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,440
It doesn't matter.

249
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,000
What matters is

250
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,960
I fancy Jiang Xiu.

251
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
You have a crush on Jiang Xiu?

252
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,600
Hello?

253
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,510
Where are you?

254
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,200
I am at home.

255
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
I am standing below your building.

256
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,670
Wh-what?

257
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,080
You are downstairs?

258
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,200
What is wrong with that?

259
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,750
I am having a bath.

260
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,510
What sound?

261
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,510
A dog is barking below.

262
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
Where is the dog?

263
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,790
How about next time?

264
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,510
I give you half an hour.

265
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,670
See you then.

266
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,630
Who is it?

267
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,390
Keep watch on this place. I gotta go.

268
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,080
Jiang Jie.

269
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,750
Why are you here?

270
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,270
There are still five minutes left.
You need not make haste.

271
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,790
What is the matter?

272
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,750
A friend gave me this.
I have no time to take care of it.

273
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,030
So I will give it to your dad.

274
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,960
My dad even can't take care of himself.

275
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,870
I will keep it.

276
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,790
I recognized you
when I had the contest with Chef Xue.

277
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,200
Won't you ask me why I didn't tell you?

278
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,510
It is unnecessary.

279
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,390
We haven't seen each other for so long.

280
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,870
I didn't know what to say
when we met.

281
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,960
Moreover, you were having a contest
at that time.

282
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,360
Then I began to work for you.
It was better if we didn't speak of it.

283
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,600
I am waiting for you to recognize me.

284
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,360
Why did you leave
the welfare center suddenly?

285
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,360
My dad's friend found me.

286
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,630
Did you leave on short notice?

287
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,630
It's fine.

288
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,240
Did you tell Li Nai you are leaving?

289
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,270
We are not in a hurry.

290
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,270
Say goodbye to your friend.

291
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,510
Did you cry because I left?

292
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,270
Of course

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,590
I didn't.

294
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,960
Why didn't you tell me
you were leaving?

295
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,920
Because I want you to remember me.

296
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,720
It didn't work well.

297
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,400
- Tomorrow...
- I most...

298
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,030
Go ahead.

299
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,270
You go ahead.

300
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,480
- We will resume work tomorrow.
- Resume work?

301
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,110
I was about to remind you of
paying my last month's salaries.

302
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,270
The last month?

303
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,750
Haven't I been fired?

304
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,030
You were suspended from duty.

305
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,750
Did I fail to make myself clear?

306
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,270
Then I will resign.
I don't want the job anymore.

307
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,640
You can resign,

308
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,480
but you have to notify your employer
in written form 30 days in advance.

309
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,270
This is stipulated
in Article 31 of the Labor Law.

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,200
Take good care of it. See you tomorrow.

311
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,720
Did you read through
the Labor Law last night?

312
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,240
You didn't seem to have found
any strong evidence.

313
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,240
Were you sleepless?

314
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,000
Sorry to have made you come to work.

315
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,350
Li Nai,

316
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,830
since you agreed to go back to work,

317
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,270
I thought you wouldn't open a shop.

318
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,790
I didn't expect you would open a shop

319
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,350
that only serves supper.

320
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,240
Anyway, our aim is to seize the knife.

321
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
The business volume is not a priority.

322
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,920
Then why are we painting the wall
late at night?

323
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,110
We can ignore the business volume,

324
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,160
but we can't pay the daily rent in vain.

325
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,920
You got a point there.
Let's do it.

326
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,790
Come on!

327
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,960
It is nothing.

328
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,350
I work to be paid.

329
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,720
Ms. Zhu,

330
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,590
when will the new kitchen hand come?

331
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,440
Since someone
is so satisfied with her pay,

332
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,270
she should do more work.

333
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,790
- Prepare for the lunch hours.
- Yes, Chef!

334
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,480
The miser Jiang Jie!

335
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,270
Jiang Xiu.

336
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,790
You like drinking this?

337
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,680
I have a lot here.

338
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,590
Jiang Xiu,

339
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,550
I sent my resume to you.
Did you see it?

340
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,270
Resume?

341
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,200
What resume?

342
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,110
I sent my resume to Xijiangyue.

343
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,880
I wonder whether you saw it or not.

344
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,440
You mean the CV?

345
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,480
You were passed.

346
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,750
It is normal.

347
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,960
After all, it is the top restaurant
in the alliance.

348
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,070
Normal.

349
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,480
Very normal.

350
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,400
Jiang Jie.

351
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,640
Your pay will be deducted
if you are absent from the meeting.

352
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,680
Let's get started.

353
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,510
This is the plan for
the team building event. Check it out.

354
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,030
Surfing is good.

355
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,920
Seaside.

356
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,000
Mr. Zheng.

357
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,350
Li Nai,

358
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,400
we will go surfing for team building.

359
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,920
I don't like outdoor activities.

360
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,030
Then you can choose one.

361
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,658
(Chuncheng Team Building Event Plan)
How about the mystery drama game?

362
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,880
It's good.

363
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,750
Ms. Zhu, I am not available.

364
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,830
The date hasn't been set yet.

365
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,350
Team building event?

366
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,240
Count me in.

367
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
Jie, this is your favorite.

368
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,350
When is it? Where will we go?

369
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,160
Ms. Zhu will inform you of
the specific date.

370
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,830
All staff of Chuncheng must be present.

371
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,680
Do you get it?

372
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,830
Yes, Chef!

373
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,400
Yes.

374
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,480
- You are dismissed.
- Where is the destination?

375
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,960
I hate to go.

376
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,830
Jie.

377
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,440
Jie, where are you going for the event?

378
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,200
Take me with you, please.

379
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
As the Head Chef of Xijiangyue,
aren't you busy these days?

380
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,640
Your affairs come first, Jie.

381
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,750
Then stop being the Head Chef
of Xijiangyue.

382
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,440
That's impossible.

383
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,550
Jiang Xiu,

384
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,640
stop riding the motorbike.

385
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,200
Jiang Jie seems to dislike you.

386
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,830
When I am the busiest,
there is the team building event.

387
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,680
And I am required to attend it.

388
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,510
I touched her hand today.

389
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,350
It felt very cold.

390
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,750
She even can ride a motorbike.

391
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,200
So cool!

392
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,200
He threatens me
with pay deduction every day.

393
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,750
I am also a boss.

394
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,270
Moreover, she especially came today

395
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,240
to tell me I am not hired.

396
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,310
I must pretend sickness tomorrow.

397
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,000
I have to keep the Jiangs
away from me.

398
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,310
All the Jiangs are toxic
and their poison is contagious.

399
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,240
Ms. Zhu,

400
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,590
what I ate last night made me ill.

401
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,270
I won't attend the team building event.

402
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,030
Li Nai!

403
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:51,960
Hurry up.

404
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,830
Good morning.

405
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,400
Jiang Jie is so considerate.

406
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,540
(Convenience store's cashier: Cui Can)

407
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,110
He resigned?

408
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,661
He asked for leave to have teeth extracted,
but our boss didn't permit it,

409
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,590
so he resigned.

410
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,640
He said the tooth
is connected with the heart.

411
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,790
When his heart aches,

412
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,160
he knows the capitalist is heartless.

413
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,030
Do you know where the dental clinic is?

414
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,270
It should be near here.

415
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,830
He just left.

416
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,000
Thank you.

417
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,350
Come on, open your mouth wide.

418
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,720
Open your mouth wide.

419
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,550
Doctor,

420
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
does it hurt?

421
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,110
No.

422
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,480
Doctor,

423
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,920
I feel numb in my mouth.

424
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Anaesthetic caused that.

425
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,310
It is normal.

426
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,920
Doctor,

427
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,240
I am very afraid.

428
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,920
It is easy to extract your tooth.

429
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,550
It will be done in a wink.

430
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,960
Are you nervous?

431
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,240
A moment, please.

432
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,680
Come on.

433
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,160
Hold this tightly.

434
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,750
Do you have an appointment?

435
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,640
I am looking for someone.

436
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,160
Doctor, did you start doing it?

437
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,680
Not yet.

438
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,270
Did you get started?

439
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,200
Right away.

440
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,830
Relax.

441
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,590
Be patient.

442
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,110
I will start doing it.

443
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,030
I will get started.

444
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,720
Where is Li Nai?

445
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,350
Doctor, be gentle.

446
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,269
Loosen your grip.

447
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,270
It hurts. Let go of me!

448
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,790
I am sorry.

449
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,790
Why are you...

450
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:23,767
You want to know
why I went to the dental clinic?

451
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,590
I was there to see you.

452
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,960
You came to see me?

453
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,000
Where will Chucheng hold the event?

454
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,310
Li Nai must have told you the location.

455
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,750
Tell me the address.

456
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,000
You can't speak?

457
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,400
Type.

458
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Don't just look.

459
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,480
Remember to take photos.

460
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,510
All guests,

461
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,070
go through this door

462
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,200
and you'll enter the world of the story.

463
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,720
After walking through the garden,
you'll see the tearoom.

464
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,270
You can choose your roles there.

465
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,510
Then the rooms will be allocated to you.

466
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,110
Before it gets dark,
you must put on the custom-made clothes.

467
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,920
But you can't read the script.

468
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,000
Everybody, this way, please.

469
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,200
This way.

470
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,000
This place is luxurious.

471
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,640
Well,

472
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,400
two of your people came earlier.

473
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,443
They are waiting in the tearoom.

474
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,750
All of us are here.

475
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,070
Did you make a mistake?

476
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,550
They said they were from Chuncheng.

477
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,240
Jie, you are finally here.

478
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,920
Could one of you
go sit on the other side?

479
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,830
Please start the game directly.

480
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,830
I am Yao Zhengling.

481
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,400
I am the master of the Yao family,
a family of medicine.

482
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,400
Tomorrow is my 50th birthday.

483
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,000
I am very grateful to you

484
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,640
for coming to my birthday party.

485
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,960
Wish you a long life
and boundless happiness.

486
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,440
Wish...

487
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,590
Sorry, I couldn't help doing it.

488
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,480
His best wishes almost
caused a man to end up in prison.

489
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,510
Some of you look unfamiliar to me.

490
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,680
How about introducing yourselves?

491
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,270
Here are the files of ten characters.

492
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,480
After turning over the cover page,

493
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,550
you should stop.

494
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,110
We usually suggest
you not play a reverse role.

495
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,070
Two of the characters are a couple.

496
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,890
I want one of the lover scripts.

497
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,110
Then you two will play the couple.

498
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,310
He will have the other one.

499
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,140
(Lin Feixue,
the heiress of the escort agency)

500
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,110
Then choose your script, everybody.

501
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,350
Here is a special character
who is mute.

502
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,750
- I will choose this character.
- Thank you, Jiang Jie.

503
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,110
Jiang Xiu,

504
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,510
we are together again.

505
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,960
Next, you are free to do what you like.

506
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,750
When the nightingale warbles,
the game starts.

507
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,270
I bid you goodbye, guys.

508
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,750
What should we do next?

509
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,080
Shall we go back to our rooms?

510
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,640
Then let's go back first.

511
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,830
Wait.

512
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,510
Be seated.

513
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,000
Going back now will spoil the fun.

514
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,480
Since it is a team building event,

515
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,240
we should bring the team members closer

516
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,750
and deepen mutual understanding.

517
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,240
