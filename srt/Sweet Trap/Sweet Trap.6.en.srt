14
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,310
Li Nai.

15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,150
You're talking about Cui Can all day.

16
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,790
Don't you have any other friends?

17
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm afraid no.

18
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,430
Since I went to college,
Li Jidong's been ill.

19
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,920
I've been busy taking care of him.

20
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,510
And then, I didn't have time
to keep in touch with other friends.

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,230
So, you don't have many friends, either.

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I just don't have much time
to hang out with them.

23
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,280
- I've got many friends since childhood.
- So,

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,430
who was your best friend
when you were five?

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,070
When I was five?

26
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,870
That's too early.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,080
I definitely can't remember things
when I was five.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
It's quite normal. Can you remember?

29
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,520
Of course.

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm not as dull as you.

31
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,000
How can you say that?

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
Although I was the one who made you sick,

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,960
I'm compensating you.

34
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,630
It's not okay if you call me names.

35
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,800
Who begged you to accompany me?

36
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,840
I'm leaving then.

37
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,800
Jiang Jie.

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,430
- You haven't left?
- I saw you haven't done the infusion.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,190
So clever of me to buy an umbrella earlier.

40
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,630
It must have been sold out now.

41
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,870
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,150
Let's go.
You haven't got your medicine, right?

43
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,520
You were out?

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,630
- Why are you here?
- Were you alone?

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,630
What's the matter?

46
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,120
Strange. Xiu hasn't come to you.

47
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,280
Where else can she be?

48
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,280
Hello, Cui Can,
it's raining heavily outside.

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,430
Take care of Li Jidong.

50
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,560
Don't get him wet like me.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,840
This mango's off.

52
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,630
What are you talking about, miss?

53
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,560
- Our fruits have all been picked today.
- Today?

54
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,590
It was picked at least a week ago.

55
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,310
Are you here looking for trouble?

56
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,280
Cut it open, then.

57
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,160
This... This must have been
placed here by mistake.

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,750
Pick the others, pick the others.

59
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,000
To buy fruits, take the second shop
on your left after entering.

60
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,360
How do you know that mango is off?

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,270
- The smell.
- That's incredible.

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,310
You're so familiar with the surroundings.
Do you live here?

63
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,870
Yeah, since I was born.

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,950
I've just come to Baichuan today.

65
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,040
Do you know what is
the most delicious restaurant here?

66
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,750
The most delicious restaurant?

67
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,720
You can try Chuncheng.

68
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,870
Chuncheng?

69
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:48,800
Okay.

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,390
I'm leaving, then.

71
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,000
Wait a moment.

72
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,190
I'm Liya. What's your name?

73
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,390
I'm Li Nai.

74
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,140
(Chuncheng)

75
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,190
Today, Chef Zheng will still be
in charge of today's main meal.

76
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,800
Li Nai will assist Chef Zheng.

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,510
Mr. Zheng.

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,510
- Get on with it.
- Okay.

79
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,680
Ms. Zhu.

80
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,240
- What's wrong?
- Our first guest has a special requirement.

81
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,800
- Special requirement?
- She hopes to designate a chef for her meal.

82
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,630
She wants Li Nai to cook for her.

83
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,190
- Li Nai?
- Me?

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,920
That's her.

85
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,300
(Guest No. 1, Liya)

86
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,240
Hello, miss. I'm Chuncheng's manager.

87
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,920
Do you have a solution now?

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,040
I'm sorry, miss.

89
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,310
According to our restaurant's bylaws,

90
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,000
without the Head Chef's permission,

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,870
no one is allowed to make the main meal.

92
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,870
I see.

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
So,

94
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,480
it's okay for me to see around, right?

95
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,070
Li Nai, have you switched your position?

96
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
Different hats, sort of.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,390
Warehouse keeper and chef assistant.

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,870
Why so suddenly?

99
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,480
I can't tell you the reasons.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,190
I'm only asking.

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,680
I really envy you.
I want to make main meal too.

102
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,000
Li Nai, stop chatting.

103
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,680
I'll leave for a while.
Take care of the kitchen.

104
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,720
Okay.

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,480
Mr. Zheng, long time no see.

106
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,680
Xiu, long time no see indeed.

107
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,680
- When did you come?
- Just now.

108
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,360
Your brother's not here today.
Why are you here?

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,510
I know. I'm coming for a meal.

110
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,430
The one with a special requirement?

111
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,000
Congratulations. Bingo.

112
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,270
You're awarded to grant me a wish.

113
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,630
From now on, you're not allowed
to enter the kitchen,

114
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,510
and you can't stop me from doing anything.

115
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,750
Don't act up.

116
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,600
Your brother and I have put
years of effort into this place.

117
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,000
I know.

118
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,680
Mr. Zheng, don't you always spoil me?

119
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,270
You know I'm just doing it for fun.

120
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,310
How can I do anything bad?

121
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,240
I'm the last guest, after all.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,070
Why hasn't Mr. Zheng come back?

123
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,510
It's you.

124
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,630
Liya, how can I help you?

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,160
I want you to cook for me.

126
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,070
But your strict manager
objected to my requirement.

127
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,720
I can't help it. I'm under her charge.

128
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,000
So,

129
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
can you cook for me secretly?

130
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,870
Why do you want me to cook for you?

131
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,830
I'm not as good as our Sous Chef.

132
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,950
Because I want to.

133
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,390
Li Nai.

134
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
That is the last dish?

135
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,270
Do you wanna go out
and hear the guests' reviews?

136
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,320
If I get caught by Ms. Zhu,
she'll find out.

137
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
She just went out.

138
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,910
Is everything to your liking?

139
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,240
Why are you here?

140
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,960
Aren't you afraid of being caught
by your strict manager?

141
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,000
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

142
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,670
Does everything taste good?

143
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,510
You wanna know?

144
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,960
You know?

145
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,440
This is my first time
to make a main meal for the guest.

146
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,510
So your review is most significant to me.

147
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,550
Come closer.

148
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,510
I

149
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,150
am

150
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,720
honored.

151
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,870
What's the matter, Liya?

152
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,480
Anyone here?

153
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,600
Can anyone help me? Liya?

154
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,870
Miss? Call 120.

155
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,820
(Emergency)

156
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,540
(Emergency Clinic)

157
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,740
(Inpatient Department)

158
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,000
Jie,

159
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,840
are you leaving now?

160
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,720
You're awake?

161
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,600
Feeling any better?

162
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,670
You're caring about me.

163
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,790
Jiang Xiu,

164
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
don't do anything so silly again.

165
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,440
I know. I won't do that again.

166
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,320
Jie,

167
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
you...

168
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,240
Is Li Nai your girlfriend?

169
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,030
At my welcoming banquet,

170
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,270
I didn't expect you to leave early for her.

171
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,750
I was unhappy about that.

172
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,150
- Are you investigating me?
- She's a bad cook.

173
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,960
She doesn't get any training in cooking.

174
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,270
She seasons food randomly.

175
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,790
And she's bad at controlling the heat.

176
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,790
She's not my girlfriend.

177
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,080
Jiang Xiu,

178
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,670
don't accept Xijiangyue's offer
to be Head Chef.

179
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,240
Then let me join your restaurant, Jie.

180
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,360
Your restaurant is full of employees
with ulterior motives.

181
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,440
Zhu Hao's recognized me today,
but she still let me.

182
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,120
Mr. Zheng's been persuaded by me
in a few words.

183
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,750
I think

184
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,790
I'm the one who's more reliable,

185
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,030
aren't I?

186
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,270
Take a good rest.

187
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,120
Jie.

188
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,910
Chef, I'm sorry.

189
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,510
Is that guest alright?

190
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,200
Is it serious?

191
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,200
I'll be responsible for all the costs.

192
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,360
Are you that rich?

193
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,670
It's my mistake.

194
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,150
I'll take the consequences.

195
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
Did I allow you to make a main meal?

196
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,910
It was me
who took the liberty of doing that.

197
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,080
She's a bad cook.

198
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
She doesn't get any training in cooking.

199
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,270
Seasons food randomly.

200
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,720
Bad at controlling the heat.

201
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't you want to know her reviews?

202
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,030
Li Nai,

203
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,390
don't take this place as any random stall
without a standard.

204
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,030
Every dish,
no matter seasoning or temperature,

205
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,720
has been through countless experiments
to get the best recipe.

206
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,550
I allowed you
to help prepare the main meal,

207
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,390
but you can't represent Chuncheng

208
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,270
at your current level.

209
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,600
Do you understand?

210
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,720
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,270
She's just allergic to nuts.
She did that intentionally.

212
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,750
You'll only get half of the pay
due to a bylaw violation.

213
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,000
Jiang Jie.

214
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,440
Jiang Xiu.

215
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,960
Hi, we meet again.

216
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,080
You...

217
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Environmental protection

218
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,550
is everyone's duty.

219
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,120
Jiang Xiu.

220
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,240
How did my brother introduce me?

221
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,960
You have the same bad character as him.
There's no need for an introduction.

222
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,000
You ordered the dessert on purpose.

223
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,240
Have I ever offended you?

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,630
It's you who made my brother sick.

225
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,720
What do you want? Just say it out loud.

226
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,200
I heard you have a good nose.

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
I want to compete with you on smelling.

228
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,550
Compete with me on smelling?

229
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,790
What's the bet?

230
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,870
No bet. I just want to see you lose.

231
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,080
Good, just the judge we need.

232
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,550
How do we compete here?

233
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Let's compete on who's the quicker buyer

234
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,480
to get the food we need
with eyes being blindfolded.

235
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,440
That's not fun.

236
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,790
Let's compete in something harder.

237
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,750
- As you wish.
- Let's do this.

238
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,550
The one who gets more food with eggs
in a limited time

239
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,030
- will be the winner.
- Okay.

240
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,200
Wait.

241
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,510
You regret it?

242
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,120
- The one who pays for the stuff is...
- Me.

243
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,080
Countdown on 10 minutes.

244
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:40,960
Start!

245
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,630
Hello,
please give me an order of Octopus Balls.

246
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,670
Please give me an order of Cheese Dog.

247
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,840
Thank you.

248
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,270
Please give me an order of Mahua.

249
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,000
An order of Fried Chicken Feet.

250
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,160
A big burger, please.

251
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,400
- Egg Waffle.
- Grilled Cold Noodles.

252
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,780
- Boneless Chicken Wings with Rice.
- Douhua.

253
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,720
Thank you.

254
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,310
Li Nai, 11 items.

255
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,400
- Jiang Xiu.
- 21 items.

256
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:19,880
I lost.

257
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,680
Being a chef is not being a police dog.

258
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,240
Li Nai,

259
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,590
this is all you got.

260
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,790
Well, there's no egg in Fried Chicken Feet.

261
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,830
Does that count?

262
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,480
This is exactly what you lack.

263
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,480
You only pay attention to food itself.

264
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,640
But Jiang Xiu is not like you.

265
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,680
She sees not only the essence of food,

266
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,830
but also the process of cooking.

267
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm going now.

268
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,750
Mr. Zheng.

269
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,750
They can do this well only with their nose.

270
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,160
Is this what a genius is like?

271
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,640
What's good to be a genius?

272
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,160
Be an ordinary person.

273
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,200
Clean this up.

274
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,920
(Li Nai lost so badly.)

275
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,310
It's alright, Li Nai.

276
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,880
I can really understand you.

277
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,030
The thing you're most proud of,
your sense of smell,

278
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,310
has been knocked down.

279
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,680
It's just like someone says
that my family has gone bankrupt.

280
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,960
I've lost my only advantage that way.

281
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,270
You're the one who has only one advantage.

282
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,000
But now I've realized

283
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,030
there's always someone better.

284
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480
My skills are way poorer than Jiang Jie's,

285
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,110
and now, I can't even win his sister.

286
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,510
Are you talking

287
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,590
about Jiang Xiu from the Jiang family?

288
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,000
It is Jiang Xiu.

289
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,310
Which Jiang family?

290
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,440
Which else?

291
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,270
The leader of Baichuan's catering industry.

292
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,790
The Jiang family behind Xijiangyue.

293
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,240
So, Jiang Xiu works for Xijiangyue.

294
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,160
And her brother, Jiang Jie...

295
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,750
(If you're talking about that,
it's rather complicated.)

296
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,070
(Jiang Ziqing, the current head
of the Jiang family,)

297
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,680
(has two sons.)

298
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,340
(Jiang Yuanfeng,)

299
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,160
(and Jiang Yuanshan.)

300
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,480
(Jiang Yuanfeng)

301
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,400
(is the father of Jiang Xuyang,
Baichuan's golden bachelor.)

302
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,680
And Jiang Yuanshan

303
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,070
is the father of Jiang Jie and Jiang Xiu.

304
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,310
Then why is Jiang Jie
running a restaurant on his own?

305
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,440
- The relationship is weird.
- Speaking of that,

306
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,350
it should start
with an unofficial knife-seizure contest.

307
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,400
Knife-seizure?

308
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,680
Eighteen years ago, Jiang Yuanshan
challenged the Head Chef of the Ge family,

309
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,110
one of the seven families.

310
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,000
Back then, Jiang Yuanshan
wasn't Xijiangyue's Head Chef.

311
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,960
So, it was just an unofficial

312
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,160
knife-seizure contest between them.

313
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,790
But the bet was extremely high.

314
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,590
- How high?
- So high that you can never imagine.

315
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,200
Cut to the chase.

316
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,240
After all, Jiang Yuanshan lost.

317
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,510
So he was kicked out of the family,
so was his wife,

318
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,680
- and his kids.
- Being kicked out just for a contest?

319
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,200
That's heartless.

320
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,030
Then why does Jiang Xiu
still work for Xijiangyue?

321
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,720
They were all kicked out of the family
at first.

322
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,350
But a year later,

323
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,720
Jiang Yuanshan and his wife
had an unexpected death.

324
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
And Jiang Xiu, the one with an innate
ability in cooking, has been brought back.

325
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,790
In terms of
the relatively mediocre Jiang Jie,

326
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,160
he refused to return to the family.

327
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,000
So, he was sent to the welfare center,

328
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,640
and brought abroad afterward.

329
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,310
Relatively mediocre?

330
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,510
Jiang Jie?

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,750
Even if he is relatively mediocre,

332
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,400
why do they have to send him
to the welfare center?

333
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,590
I can never know.

334
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,510
I didn't send him there.

335
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,110
So, Jiang Jie seizes knife
to prove he's not mediocre?

336
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,920
What garbage are you handling?

337
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,790
Throw it away.

338
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,200
It's something urgent. I gotta go.

339
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,350
Chef.

340
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,350
Close your eyes.

341
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,400
Close your eyes.

342
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,590
Wine.

343
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,720
The half bottle that was used
to cook steak yesterday.

344
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,070
It's left overnight,
and the acidity increases.

345
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,030
And some newly-ground salvia.

346
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,640
It's not what we use in cooking,

347
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,030
but from the one by the window.

348
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,590
As an assistant that I need,

349
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,790
your sense of smell

350
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,310
is sensitive enough.

351
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,030
But according to your words,

352
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,070
my level is still far
from Chuncheng's standard.

353
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,270
- But Jiang Xiu...
- You're no match for her.

354
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,440
Your blunt words really hurt people.

355
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,830
Lying to protect others' dignity,

356
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,680
I won't do anything stupid like that.

357
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,790
Jiang Xiu is not just a genius,

358
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,240
but also went through the training
you can never imagine.

359
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,400
Does everyone in the Jiang family
work themselves into the ground?

360
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,400
As long as you do it,
you need to do the best.

361
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,550

362
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,070
Rest assured. I won't give up so easily.

363
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,310
Your high-intensity practice,
I can handle that too.

364
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,720
- Morning.
- How long have you been here?

365
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,240
Not for long.

366
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,350
So industrious. You're even taking notes.

367
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,590
We'll go get changed, then.

368

- See you later.

What's going on with
Chuncheng's order of the ham?

371
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,310
I see.

372
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,000
From tomorrow onward,
Yuan's will no longer be our supplier.

373
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,350
Chef, we've been keeping
a close partnership with Yuan's.

374
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,680
There must be some reasons
for their hasty decision.

375
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,310
I'll go get this straight now.

376
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,830

You have a good eye, miss.

381
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,960
This is the first class Heqing ham.

382
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,790
- Please give me two of these.
- Two?

384
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,270
No, I work for the owner.

the ham had been sold out.

388

Well, this, and this...

389
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,790
They have been ordered.

390

Ma'am, how much is this?

391
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:36,830
It's not for sale.

392
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,960
- Why is that? It looks good.
- It's just not for sale.

393
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,680
- This one will do.
- It's not for sale either.

394

- It's not for sale.

Writing bad ratings to Chuncheng like that,

401
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,110
you're like a mosquito
around an elephant's ear,

402

If it's not because
Grandpa entrusted you to me,

406

407

to be some else's brother.

409
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,750
I have to remind you.

haven't you realized that these days,
the relationship between Li Nai and Jiang Jie

413
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,440
has become even closer?

414
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,200
So, what should I do?

415

Only when you become
the Head Chef of Xijiangyue,

416
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,110
can you

417
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,030
make him look back at you.

418
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,440
Is it Grandpa who asks you to take me back?

419
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,680
I'll do as you wish.

420
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,270
- Get on with it.
- Sure, Chef.

421
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,160
- Go get the tools.
- Mr. Zheng,

422
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,720
later, Li Nai will assist you
in preparing the dishes.

423

Yes, Chef.

I don't quite get it.

428
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,030
What are we gonna do?

429
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,880
Haven't you told her?

430
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,160
- Told me what?
- Zhu Hao.

00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,070
This afternoon, Chuncheng

432
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,550
will pay a visit
to the municipal welfare center.

433
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,160
We need to prepare 50 boxes of food.

434
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,030

435
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,200
Find me at the back after you get it.

436
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,830
Ham.

437
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,160
Thank you, everyone.

438
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,750
Li Nai, you didn't buy the ham
from Tao's, did you?

439
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,590
Of course it's bought from Tao's.

440
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,030
Chef has checked it.

441
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,590
But I remember Tao's ham
has special serial numbers on it.

442
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,350
I've bought it for Chef once.

443
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,160
This is probably not for sale
at their shop.

444
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,160
But there's nothing wrong with the quality.

445
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,830
Rest assured. I won't tell this to Chef.

446
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,480
I had no choice.

447
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,270
Once Mrs. Tao realized that I was from
Chuncheng, she kicked me out of the shop.

448
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,640
She probably has a grudge against Chef.

449
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,920
So I bought it from someone else.

in your storage collection.

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,750

00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,480
- Let's meet at someplace.
- Sure.

456
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,070
You were quite lucky.

457
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,960
I think so.

458
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,030
- They taste the same.
- Yeah.
