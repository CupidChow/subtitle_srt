if you meet this condition.

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,400
The one who's the first
to put down five fingers should

24
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,280

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,640
Me first!

26
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,000
Put down a finger
if you have no elder brother.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,790

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,080
A finger down
if you have never been married.

30
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,400
A finger down if you can't drive a truck.

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,000
I win.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,630
Li Nai,

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,470
come out with me with your script.

34
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,000
Give me yours.

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,280
How well matched you are
with that idiot Cui Can!

36
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,512
Don't pester my brother anymore.

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,150
Cui Can likes you!

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,560
So what?

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,120
I have to like him back?

40
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,150
A finger down if you've dated someone!

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,280
Someone chased me
when I was back in France.

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,150
It only lasted for two days, I swear.

43
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,520
A finger down if you don't have a job.

44
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,200
A finger down
if you just had your tooth pulled out.

45
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,403
A finger down if your family name is Cui.

46
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,750
A finger down
if you haven't studied management.

47
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,840
A finger down if you can't swim.

48
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,430
I'm out.

49
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,960
Hey!

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,750
Keep on.

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,036
A finger down
if your family name is not Jiang.

52
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,150
A finger down
if you haven't delivered any takeout.

53
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,800
A finger down
if your dad's not a security guard.

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,310
A finger down if you can't slaughter cows.

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,120
Alright,

56
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,840
here's an interesting one.

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,150
A finger down
if you have a crush on someone.

58
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,430
A finger down if your crush is here!

59
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,430
It's about time,

60
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,560
we should get changed.

61
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,240
Let's go.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Cui Can.

63
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,560
What's your role?

64
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,190
Secret.

65
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,270
Let's go.

66
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,510
Li Nai!

67
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,870
Feixue, the daughter
of the head of the escort agency,

68
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,190
and her boyfirend Chushi, meet in a garden
on a beautiful moonlit night.

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,830
Who plays Chushi?

70
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,600
On a night moonlit and the sky deep blue.

71
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,630
You are not aware of it that...

72
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,560
I'm deep in love with you.

73
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,040
Dad! Please don't.

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,600
You're pathetic!

75
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
After that much time,

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
you can't even excel that little girl!

77
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,240
Get out!

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,240
Dad,

79
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,430
I think

80
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,360
we should do things step by step.

81
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,390
You heard what old man said.

82
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,240
As if Jiang Xiu alone is not showy enough,
Jiang Jie is messing around at this time.

83
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,600
You will soon be kicked out by those two!

84
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,600
You are overthinking, dad.

85
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,000
Grandpa gave up
on Jiang Jie himself back then.

86
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,510
If he regrets now,

87
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,750
he'd be eating his own words!

88
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
He's muddled now.

89
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,310
Jiang Jie,

90
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,680
just like his father,

91
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,750
always gets in my way.

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,510
He'll be too proud to see

93
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,680
that he's just a loser

94
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,190
if I don't teach him a lesson!

95
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,950
What's on your mind?

96
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,120
He likes to bound his team, doesn't he?

97
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,870
Then I'll show his team that

98
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,920
he's nothing!

99
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,800
Wait and see.

100
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,480
So,

101
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,870
turns out that we play the couple.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,680
The rising star in the Yao family
and the young lady of the escort agency,

103
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,000
who plan to run away.

104
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,920
Sounds funny.

105
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,120
So,

106
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,800
what clues can you provide me with?

107
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,800
You asked me to investigate
the beheading of the imperial pharmacist,

108
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,040
and here's what I learned.

109
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,310
The beheaded is called Yao Buling.

110
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,040
Yao Zhengling, Yao Buling.

111
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,750
These two brothers have similar names.

112
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,750
Yao Buling.

113
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,830
What was he charged with?

114
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,480
(The Beheading)
The empress dowager was ill,

115
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,750
so doctors were recruited nationwide.
Yao Buling stood out in the selection,

116
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,360
but made a mistake
while treating the empress dowager,

117
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
which almost killed her.

118
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,870
Almost?

119
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,360
So she didn't die.

120
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,190
His brother Yao Zhengling
cured her in the end,

121
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,510
so his family were not punished.

122
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,510
But Yao Buling was still beheaded,

123
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,080
and his kids were kicked out of the family
by his father.

124
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,000
Kicked out of the family?

125
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,440
That sounds a bit familiar...

126
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,240
Li Nai, you stole my role!

127
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,910
Xiu.

128
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,720
Jie,

129
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,270
you look so good!

130
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,080
A pity that your partner
is the wrong person!

131
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,390
It's he who asks me to run away with him!

132
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Don't you dare!

133
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,630
Of course I dare.

134
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,870
I literally exchanged my script from you.

135
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,600
You...

136
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,790
Enough.

137
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,550
Ladies and gentlemen,
please come to the lobby.

138
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,360
Off you go!

139
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,790
Jie, are you really eloping with her?

140
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,480
Stop it.

141
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,120
Hey, wait a sec!

142
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
(Card of Truth.
Answer the cardholder's question truthfully)

143
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,750
What's this?

144
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,080
Card of Truth.

145
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,630
Jie, do you like Li Nai?

146
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't brood about stuff.

147
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,550
What's wrong with you and Zheng Fangxing?

148
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,720
She was just like you when I met her,

149
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,790
playing with mud with a runny nose.

150
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's not keep them waiting.

151
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,480
I didn't play with mud!

152
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,390
Jie!

153
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,600
I'm the big brother in the Yao Sect.

154
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,910
Xiu, you can trust me forever!

155
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,270
Kill Li Nai for me then.

156
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,200
That's not appropriate, is it?

157
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,910
Then don't stand out.

158
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,360
The big sect brother
is always in danger after all.

159
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,510
Cui Can,

160
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,630
that's so nice of you.

161
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,910
Please be serious with the game.

162
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,790
I don't want anyone to hold me back.

163
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,270
Everyone's here.

164
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,440
Recently, there have been rumors that

165
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,000
my deceased elder brother
appeared in the mansion.

166
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,030
Please don't believe that.

167
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,910
Trust only what you see,

168
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,480
and may the deceased rest in peace.

169
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,750
Yao Buling,

170
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,000
Yao Zhengling's elder brother,

171
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,480
who died 18 years ago.

172
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,630
I believe

173
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,600
you already understand
your identity and tasks.

174
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,870
Please

175
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,320
follow the game rules.

176
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,200
A small decision of yours

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,550
may lead us to unexpected endings.

178
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,630
Have a good rest, Jie.

179
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,480
- Okay.
- Bye.

180
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,270
Shall we talk?

181
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,510
No, I just read my script,
and there is a message related to Jiang Xiu.

182
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,270
I'll get some food and talk with her.

183
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,960
All right then.
Hope things go well with you.

184
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,910
Trust me.
See you, then.

185
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,200
Bye.

186
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,030
Xiu.

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,440
- Who's it?
- It's me.

188
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,480
I brought you some food.

189
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,440
Osmanthus cakes,

190
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,390
rose cakes,

191
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,150
egg tarts and pear juice.

192
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,600
Do you want some?

193
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,600
Don't call me Xiu.

194
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,910
We're not that close.

195
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,030
What should I call you then?

196
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,870
My surname is Jiang.

197
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,870
Jiang? Then...

198
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,150
Then I'll call you Jill?

199
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,150
Sounds nice.

200
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,670
You don't eat anything

201
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,840
at night?

202
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,840
I think
you don't need to go on a diet at all.

203
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,840
I remember the first time I met you,

204
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
I was stunned by
how beautiful and slim you are.

205
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,720
And I think it's totally okay for you

206
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,440
to eat something at this time.

207
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,960
You barely ate anything today after all.

208
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,000
That's why I brought you all these food.

209
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,670
How about I try one for you first?

210
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,120
An osmanthus cake.

211
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,480
It's good! Really! Do you want some?

212
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,270
I'm going to eat them up!

213
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,750
What's wrong?

214
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,390
- We don't have tasks tonight, right?
- I do.

215
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,870
Chushi should hand these to Feixue.
It's my task.

216
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,630
Put it on.

217
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,030
Let me help you.

218
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,550
Alright.

219
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,320
There seems to be blood stains
on your sleeve.

220
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,870
Well, that, that's not blood.

221
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,000
Maybe I accidentally got it dirty
somewhere.

222
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,360
It's getting late.

223
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,510
Get some rest tonight.

224
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,390
See you tomorrow.

225
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,000
See you.

226
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,600
Li Nai,

227
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,670
goodnight.

228
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,790
Chushi should say that to Feixue.

229
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,120
Also my task.

230
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,960
Goodnight, Chushi.

231
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,020
(Contact Li Jidong)

232
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,120
Thank god I set the alarm clock.
Almost forgot.

233
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Oh no!

234
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,670
Oh no!

235
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,120
The master is dead!

236
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,630
The master is dead!

237
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,670
Someone murdered the master!

238
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,630
Someone murdered the master!

239
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,600
The master is murdered!

240
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,550
Everyone!

241
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,630
The master is murdered!

242
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,200
Everyone, Mr. Yao

243
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,240
died on the night before his 50th birthday!

244
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,120
Aren't you perfectly fine now?

245
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,360
Now I'm the host.

246
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,360
What we can know is that

247
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,270
the time of death of Mr. Yao
is between 7 pm and 9 pm.

248
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,030
Which is within two hours after we parted.

249
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,030
This shouldn't be the primary crime scene.

250
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,030
There are bloodstains on the soles,

251
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,600
but the yard is perfectly clean.

252
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,240
And there are bloodstains on the threshold,

253
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,320
which means the murderer dragged him here

254
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,440
after killing him.

255
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,960
There's something on his feet.

256
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,200
Bamboo leaves.

257
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,200
There isn't even a single bamboo
in this yard.

258
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,550
The body is neatly dressed

259
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,120
and has no signs of fighting,

260
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,160
so the murderer should be his acquaintance,

261
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,510
who's capable of carrying an adult male

262
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,480
and familiar with the estate.

263
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,400
That's not me!

264
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,920
I have an alibi!

265
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,160
Say something?

266
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,160
He's not the murderer.

267
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,030
I can prove that.

268
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,030
Let's all talk about
what we were doing last night.

269
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,590
Then we'll know who is most suspicious.

270
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,550
Players,

271
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,880
the murderer

272
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,590
is among you.

273
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,750
You can go to the tearoom

274
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,200
to talk about what you did last night.

275
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,310
According to the game rules,

276
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,960
please hand in your phone first.

277
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,070
We'll return them to you

278
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,830
when the game is over.

279
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,510
The tearoom is over there.

280
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,350
Let's go, Jie.

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,310
Let me inform my family.

282
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,032
Why are you standing here?

283
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,750
He said there was a murderer among us,

284
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm scared.

285
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,550
Don't be!

286
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,440
Just find the person you trust the most

287
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,270
and sit with them.

288
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,030
Why are you standing?

289
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:39,640
Take a seat.

290
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,350
I'll start.

291
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,880
After we parted,

292
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,160
I went outside the room with Li Nai,

293
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,000
and went to the kitchen to grab some food.

294
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,030
Then I went to Jill's room.

295
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,000
You two stayed in the room
until nine o'clock?

296
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,750
I was inside, he's outside the room.

297
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,160
What did you talk about?

298
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,640
Nothing important.

299
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,350
Dude,

300
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,030
that is too suspicious!

301
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,550
Just a casual talk.

302
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,550
He discovered that

303
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,240
I'm not
Yao Zhengling's biological daughter,

304
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,790
and came to inform me.

305
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,240
I was on duty in the kitchen last night,

306
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,440
and met Cui Can and Li Meng.

307
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,680
I met the former at around 7:10 pm,

308
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,240
and the latter around 8:45 pm.

309
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,680
I went to serve Ms. Zhu at 7:35 pm...

310
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,440
To serve Madame.

311
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,830
Then she was a bit hungry,

312
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,270
so I went to the kitchen to get some food.

313
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,000
After we dismissed yesterday,

314
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,750
I went to the garden

315
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,030
and met Zheng Fangxing at 7:45 pm.

316
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,510
We had a small chat.

317
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,110
Then I went back to my room
for it started to get windy.

318
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,920
But I don't remember

319
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,550
what time was that.

320
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,830
8:15 pm,

321
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,830
I can prove that.

322
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,060
(Contact Li Jidong)

323
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,440
He came to me
and gave me a pair of earrings.

324
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,070
I remember she did not

325
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,240
wear earrings last evening.

326
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,270
(Guard your love.)

327
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,270
(Maybe he will make mistakes,)

328
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,030
(maybe not.)

329
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,270
(Either way, you can't leave him anymore.)

330
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,960
Lei Shiyu, what did you do?

331
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,750
I went to the river last night
to feed the fish.

332
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,240
Can the fish prove that you were there?

333
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,240
I saw a fisherman.

334
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,550
None of us is fisherman.

335
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,590
Can you call him over?

336
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,270
I don't know him.

337
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,750
Then you're very suspicious.

338
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,400
My turn.

339
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,750
Yesterday,

340
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,920
I did go to the bamboo grove.

341
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,110
You went to the bamboo grove,

342
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,240
then you must be...

343
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,030
However,

344
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,510
I ran into Xia Ji there,

345
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,590
and we came back together.

346
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,750
So we all have our alibis.

347
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,240
Who's the murderer?

348
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,350
You can search for clues outside.

349
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,590
Please go in pairs

350
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,510
for the sake of safety,

351
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,400
and please do not gather.

352
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,000
You can blow this whistle

353
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,750
if you're in danger.

354
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,000
The staff will come over

355
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,510
as soon as possible.

356
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,750
Here, take the whistle.

357
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,070
Jie!

358
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,160
Let's go in pairs, Xiu.

359
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,920
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,556
Get out of the way!

361
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,070
Xiu, I'll protect you!

362
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,070
Easy.

363
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,160
Jiang Jie,

364
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,750
we've been here three times.

365
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,400
Can't you distinguish your left and right?

366
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,350
Of course I can.

367
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,350
Kids, let's play a game today, okay?

368
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,680
Okay.

369
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,920
Good.
Now please pair with your best friend,

370
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,270
and stand hand in hand.

371
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,550
Qiang Xie, I'm with you!

372
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,640
We will certainly win!

373
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,960
To the left!

374
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,590
A little more!

375
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,310
More to the left!

376
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,310
Qiang Xie, we won!

377
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,590
I knew it! Here.

378
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,400
We can definitely win!

379
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,480
Win what?

380
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,270
Why did you come to our side?

381
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,960
That's our pineapple!

382
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,270
Can't you distinguish your left and right?

383
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,070
You were like this when you're a kid,

384
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,920
aren't you?

385
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,310
Everyone has their
strengths and weaknesses.

386
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,720
But you're not affected
when you're driving.

387
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,790
Mobile navigation.

388
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,160
What if there isn't?

389
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,880
I'll call a cab.

390
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,750
Let's go.

391
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,920
Well, no navigation or cabs here.

392
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,070
You follow me.

393
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,200
Follow you?

394
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,070
What?

395
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,830
Don't you believe me?

396
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,920
I was the one defending you!

397
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,240
Although I don't know
if you are the murderer,

398
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,350
you did something last night, didn't you?

399
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,830
I'm not the murderer.

400
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,110
I don't care.

401
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,200
I'm on your side anyway.

402
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,310
For real?

403
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,550
Why would I lie?

404
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,270
Let's go.

405
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,030
Up here, and then turn right.

406
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,000
Right?

407
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,590
This is the right side.

408
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,550
Are you sure?

409
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,440
Can you keep up? You're slow.

410
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,310
Sure I can!

411
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Weird.

412
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,030
I just saw them walking this way.

413
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,920
Where are they?

414
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,200
How about this,
I'll go ahead see if they're here,

415
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,440
you take a rest here.

416
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,960
What if you betray me for Li Nai?

417
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,030
That's impossible.

418
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,400
No.

419
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,680
I'll carry you.

420
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,240
I don't need that.

421
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,110
That's what a sect brother should do.

422
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:10,830
Here.

423
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,000
Come on!

424
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,920
Be careful then.

425
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,480
You'd be dead if I fall!

426
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,960
Don't worry.

427
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,160
Let's go!

428
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,510
Let's go

429
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,590
find your brother.

430
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Where will they go?

431
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,200
You just saw them go this way,
so they must be right ahead.

432
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,720
He won't elope with Li Nai, will he?

433
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,270
He won't.

434
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,000
Careful.

435
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,550
It's smoking here?

436
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,790
There should be a clue around here.

437
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,590
Let's take a look.

438
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,790
Careful.

439
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,550
There's a space down here.

440
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,510
Maybe we can enter.

441
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:06,960
Are you scared?

442
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,400
Not at all.

443
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,880
Come, I'll catch you. Here.

444
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,550
Why do you have a phone?

445
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,310
Backup phone, for work.

446
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,680
What? You're so cautious.

447
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,440
Follow me, the light's dim.

448
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,400
There are matches.

449
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,550
What's this?

450
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,920
Shengyao, my friend,

451
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,000
my brother died because of me,

452
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,750
and I feel guilty for that.

453
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,750
If I could stop my brother when he went
to the imperial palace under my name,

454
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,440
he might not end up like this.

455
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,550
I've seen him before he's executed.

456
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,160
He hated me

457
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,200
and was jealous of me

458
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,960
because I was a more talented child
than him,

459
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,070
and our father loved me much more than him.

460
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,030
Whoever wrote this script,

461
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,590
really put in a lot of effort.

462
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,350
What do you mean?

463
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,400
Yao Buling went to treat
the empress dowager

464
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,981
under his younger brother's name
because he's jealous of the latter's talent.

465
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,830
And he ended up being killed for that.

466
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,110
Don't you think this story
is very familiar?

467
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,110
Many people in Baichuan know that

468
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,550
Jiang Yuanshan,
the eldest son of Jiang Ziqing,

469
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,880
was jealous of his younger brother's talent
when he was young.

470
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,440
He used his brother's name

471
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,400
to compete with others in cooking.

472
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,110
Later, he was expelled from the family

473
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,550
with his children.

474
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,830
Then,

475
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,720
Jiang Yuanshan died of an accident,

476
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
and his daughter
was taken back to the Jiang family.

477
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,590
How similar are the two stories.

478
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,830
So this is for you and Jiang Xiu?

479
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,400
But this is the staff trip of Chuncheng,
who else knows the destination?

480
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,720
And took the time to write this for you?

481
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,070
We should go.

482
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,240
Who's it?

483
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,960
Jiang Jie, know your place,

484
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,110
and don't try to take what's not yours!

485
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,160
That's not funny!

486
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
What should we do?

487
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,680
The ladder's gone...

488
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,030
My phone's out of battery.

489
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:52,960
I'm sorry.

490
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,110
According to the clues we have so far,

491
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,240
the suspects include

492
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,830
Yao Buling, who's already dead,

493
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,750
Yao Buling's missing son,

494
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,590
and me.

495
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,920
Put me down.

496
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,510
Let me.

497
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,310
You can't be.

498
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,590
Yao Buling's already dead.

499
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,070
So it must be his missing son!

500
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,110
His missing son is my brother.

501
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,240
The script was meant for him!

502
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,960
For your brother?

503
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,160
I'll go find him.

504
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,030
He's in danger!

505
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,550
Wait!

506
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,640
It's him?

507
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,310
It's not your fault.

508
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,030
You didn't set the trap.

509
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,400
No one can predict this.

510
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,880
Actually Chushi doesn't like Feixue at all.

511
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,270
He's the missing son of Yao Buling.

512
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,590
He only approaches Feixue

513
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,510
to use her.

514
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,200
Well, it's not the first time
you being a jerk.

515
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,200
I was not careful enough.

516
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,590
What's the smell?

517
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,880
Pickles?

518
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,830
Pickles.

519
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,110
Pickles?

520
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,070
Sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide

521
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,440
are produced when making pickles.

522
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,750
Li Nai!

523
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,960
Breathe slowly.

524
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,000
Li Nai! Li Nai!

525
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,920
Jiang Xiu?

526
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,440
Uncle, what are you doing here?

527
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,310
Let me go!

528
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm here on business.

529
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,510
Business?

530
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,310
Business of script writing,

531
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,270
or of killing people?

532
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,110
Jiang Xiu,

533
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,110
are you crazy?

534
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,400
Uncle,

535
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,550
you're old enough
to die of a cerebral hemorrhage,

536
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,880
myocardial infarct,

537
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,200
or any accident

538
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,160
without anyone suspecting anything.

539
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,310
Jiang Xiu,

540
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,720
I, I don't know what you're talking about.

541
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,750
Please let me go!

542
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,480
Cui Can and Xiu

543
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,750
will definitely look for us

544
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,720
when they find that
we had disappeared for so long.

545
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,400
Don't fall asleep, Li Nai.

546
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,400
Come, Jiang Jie!

547
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,070
- Jie.
- What's wrong, dad?

548
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,880
Don't make a sound!

549
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,440
Be quiet! Don't come out!

550
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,240
What are you doing?

551
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,110
What do you want?

552
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,480
What do you want?

553
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,590
Dad, what happened?

554
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,680
Jiang Xiu!

555
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,790
The cellar!

556
