Excuse me, Chef Li.

Your restaurant has topped several lists

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,920

Li Nai,

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,080
stop worrying.

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,680
Our achievement
has been beyond expectations.

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
about our secret weapon.

What secret weapon?

36
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,190
Oh right,

37
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,960
although I'm here to help for a few days,

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,980
I've got a few we-media to interview you.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,470
Interview is definitely off the table.

40
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,710
Why not?

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm like a stuffed dumpling now.

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,310
I've given myself away.

43
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,120
No wonder you're worried.

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,630
Turns out you're worried due to Jiang Jie.

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,680
I've had nightmares for a long time.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,470
I keep dreaming about
being caught by Jiang Jie.

47
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,400
But it's fair enough.

48
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,080
Because as this goes on,

49
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,080
Jiang Jie will notice
your restaurant for sure.

50
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,400
Leave this to me.

51
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,560
I have an idea.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,960
Jing,

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
it's actually a very trivial thing.

54
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,030
To help you
conceal the operator's information

55
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,800
is indeed a small thing.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,870
I'll take that as a yes then.

57
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,870
Is running a restaurant with your friends
what you wanna do?

58
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,030
Not really.

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,910
This is sort of
what I wanna do most for now.

60
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,430
I know you're the best.

61
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,310
Are you tired?

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,910
Do you remember our family motto?

63
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,590
Of course.

64
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,150
If you help me, I'll help you too.

65
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,560
But I haven't decided on
what I need you to do.

66
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,430
I'll let you know later.

67
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,710
No problem.

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,910
I've got to take this.

Hello. Got it.
I'll be there right away.

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,800
Your girlfriend.

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,950
No,

73
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,480
but I like her.

74
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,870
Alright,

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,920
I've got to go.

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,950
Don't forget my thing.

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,680

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,390
Surprised?

90
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,630
When I knew you opened the restaurant
with Li Nai,

91
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,480
I was quite surprised too.

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,190
Last time I was at Eating at Dusk,

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,390
why did you still lie to me?

94
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,750
What are you and Li Nai up to?

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,310
Sorry, I can't say it.

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,430
Not even to me?

97
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,830
Get lost.

98
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,190
Xiu.

99
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,040
Eat it while it's hot.

100
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,160
I'll get out of here.

101
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,950
Chef, every outfit of mine has the wrinkles
of being dragged by you.

102
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,600
Will you buy me clothes
if I have no clothes to wear?

103
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,240
Fine by me if you want.

104
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,630
You're paying me salary.

105
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,950
That's still my money.

106
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,310

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,190
No.

108
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,630
Don't you take me to any remote place.

109
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,040
Not a remote place,

110
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,480
but my place.

have feelings for you?)

114
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,270
something important to tell you.

115
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,480
It won't take too long.

116
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,310
But I have something to do tonight.

117
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,430

118
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,390

What do you wanna say to me?

134
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,480
Have you contacted your master lately?

135
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,720
Yes.

136
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,790
We contact each other a lot.

137

139
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,600

141
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,670

the other day?

I'm still in Sanya.

150

in the city hospital.

151

Are you alright?

Are you okay?

180

Master, how are you feeling now?

182
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,840
I'm fine.

183
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,030
If the doctor didn't disallow me
to do strenuous exercise,

184
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,480
I could have practiced Tai Chi here.

185

Master, slow down.

186
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,240
But

187
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,670
you'd better take the doctor's advice and

188
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,000
respond to the treatment positively.

189
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,960
Master,

190
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,750
I have an idea.

191
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,850
Today, I'll transfer you
to another hospital.

192
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,150
My sister has a classmate
who specializes in this.

193
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,360
You'll recover soon if he treats you.

194
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Don't. Don't bother.

195
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,180
- I think...
- I think Cui Can is right.

196
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,750
You must listen to us this time.

197
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,105
Yes.

198
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,030
No, not today.

199
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,480
We have something to do today.

200
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,320
Right, Cui Can and I opened a restaurant.

201
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,120
The business wasn't good before,
so we didn't tell you about it.

202
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,200
But it's looking fine lately.

203
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,030
Then what are we waiting for?

204
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,150
It's mealtime now. Help me get changed.

205
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,080
I'll go get your clothes now.

206
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,180
(Eating at Dusk)

207
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,020
(The restaurant is closed for one day)

208
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,120
Master, here comes the dish.

209
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,840
Here's one more dish.

210
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,200
Master.

211
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,870
Okay, all the dishes are served.

212
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,670
This?

213
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,720
Eating at Dusk.

214
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,960
Master, eat now.

215
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,480
Now Li Nai's cooking is really

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,600
awesome.

217
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,720
Try it.

218
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,440
- Then I must try it now.
- Try it.

219
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,000
This is my favorite sour-sweet flavor.

220
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,750
You've made progress in cooking.

221
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
You're better than me.

222
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,670
Impressive.

223
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,630
- Master!
- Master! Slowly.

224
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,840
- Are you okay, Master?
- Master! Have some water.

225
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,790
Bathroom.

226
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,200
Because I've got the drips,

227
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,600
I need to go to the bathroom.

228
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,240
I'll take you there.

229
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,960
I'm fine. I'm fine.

230
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,870
- Slowly. Slowly.
- Careful. Careful.

231
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm fine. I'm okay.

232
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Be careful.

233
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
It's salt.

234
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,720
Li Nai,

235
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,000
are you on the way?

236
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,750
Okay, I'll be there soon.

237
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,630
Li Nai!

238
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,510
Why are you sitting here?

239
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,870
Get up.

240
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,320
What's wrong?

241
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,200
I wanna eat the Noodles
with Snakehead Meat my master made.

242
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,480
Back then, to take me as his disciple,

243
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,840
my master badgered me for one month.

244
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,550
But I turned him down all the time.

245
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,670
Do you know why I agreed afterward?

246
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,440
My master always thought
it was because of the money.

247
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,150
Back then, Li Jidong suffered from
a lung infection all of a sudden,

248
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,000
and needed money for treatment.

249
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,270
What's wrong?

250
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,910
Can you lend me some money?

251
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,870
Yes, sure.

252
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,670
Come in first.

253
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,240
Actually,
it's not because of the 100,000 yuan,

254
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,360
but a bowl of Noodles with Snakehead Meat.

255
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,480
Have a bowl of noodles to get warm.

256
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,160
I'll take you to the hospital later.

257
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,070
The money is ready.

258
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,240
I... I have no appetite.

259
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,110
Eat.

260
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,550
Eat.

261
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,350
The fear of my father's possible death,

262
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,240
the panic of being an orphan,

263
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,480
the powerlessness of being unable to afford
the medical fee,

264
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,000
and the confusion about the future.

265
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,000
I thought my mind was all blank,

266
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,310
but actually I thought a lot.

267
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,510
My master made me a bowl
of Noodles with Snakehead Meat.

268
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,200
Actually, I'll say

269
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,640
it's the Noodles with Snakehead Meat
that saved me.

270
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,350
It's thanks to the bowl of noodles
that I realized

271
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,590
food could speak.

272
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,030
I could feel

273
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,830
the noodles were specially made for me.

(Challenge Letter)

300
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,720
The Chef of Eating at Dusk, as the successor
of the five-star knife of the Li family,

301
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,790
hereby initiates a knife-seizing challenge
to the Chef of Chuncheng, Jiang Jie.

302
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,750
The Li family?

303
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,310
The living two generations
are already existing only in name.

304
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,640
Why did they show up all of a sudden?

305
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,590
It only serves dinner every day.

306
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,030
And it was opened when I planned
to challenge the Ge family.

307
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
That was clearly aimed at you.

308
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,070
And the mastermind is likely to be someone
who knows well about you.

309
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
The Li family.

310
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,030
Li.

311
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,070
Li Nai.

312
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,240
It can't be her.

313
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,440
Think about this.
If she had the five-star knife,

314
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,590
why would she work at Chuncheng?

315
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,960
Oh right,

316
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,920
Zhu Hao has resigned.

317
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,440
Isn't she the mole
arranged by Jiang Xuyang?

318
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,160
Yeah.

319
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,440
She resigned at this moment.

320
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
That means Eating at Dusk has something
to do with the Jiang family.

321
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,030
More or less.

322
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,510
Anyway,

323
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,000
it must be right
to investigate Jiang Xuyang first.

324
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,920
Okay.

325
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,830
Even if Li Nai has nothing to do
with the Li family,

326
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,440
given your current condition,

327
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,920
you'll be doomed by her sooner or later.

328
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,240
You've thought too much.

329
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,070
She's rejected me.

330
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,820
- Thanks.
- Here. Take it.

331
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,480
Don't mention it.

332
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,960
You're so great, Zhouzhou.

333
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,960
Ma'am, I'll go inside then.

334
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,510
- Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
- Okay.

335
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,720
Li Nai.

336
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:19,920
Eat something.

337
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,550
Li Nai,

338
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,640
my 80,000 yuan

339
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,750
plus your 53,532 yuan

340
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,480
is 133,532 yuan.

341
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,750
The senior has accepted it.

342
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,960
I'm your new creditor then.

343
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,640
Thanks.

344
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,400
Is Jiang Xiu fine

345
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,640
with you working with me?

346
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,270
Li Nai,

347
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,000
you've worked under Jiang Jie for so long.

348
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,550
Did you find his shortcoming?

349
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,920
Shortcoming?

350
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,920
(Li Nai,)

351
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,310
(don't treat this place
as a low-level stall.)

352
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,920
(Every dish here
is the best result of repeated trials)

353
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,480
(in terms of taste and heating control.)

354
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,510
Before his shortcoming is exposed,

355
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,550
he has stifled it in the cradle.

356
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

357
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,350
Jiang Jie is clearly a tough guy.

358
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,480
Alright.

359
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,440
Jiang Jie will probably come and
investigate Eating at Dusk these days.

360
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,270
So, we must be prepared.

361
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,960
Given my understanding of him,

362
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,640
before he seizes the knife,

363
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,440
he will be determined to secure a victory.

364
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,350
Will him cause trouble for us?

365
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,310
Shall I hire a bodyguard?

366
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,480
If you have the money,

367
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
why don't you hire a few hatchets

368
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,110
to teach Jiang Jie a lesson first?

369
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,920
Seriously?

370
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,640
Of course

371
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
not.

372
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,830
Li Nai,

373
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,270
don't be too uptight.

374
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,270
Look, we've got seven more days.

375
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
We may be able to get lucky by then,

376
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,400
right?

377
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,020
Anyway, we'll figure it out.

378
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
Don't forget to pick up the goods
from Xijiangyue.

379
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,510
See you at the restaurant.

380
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,480
Bye.

381
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,640
Bye.

382
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,110
Xijiangyue.

383
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,070
Xijiangyue.

384
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,480
Eating at Dusk.

385
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,110
The Li family.

386
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,830
I thought this time, I'd merely

387
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,000
found out about
some romantic affairs of Jiang Jie.

388
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,480
I didn't expect to have such a surprise.

389
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,350
Xuyang.

390
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,830
I'm a bit worried.

391
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,790
Given Li Nai's cooking skills,

392
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,510
will Jiang Jie get the knife too easily?

393
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,550
I think you've thought too much.

394
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,510
Jiang Jie has finally fallen for a girl.

395
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,400
No matter what the result it is,
it'll affect his mentality anyway.

396
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,400
By then, he'll definitely lose
in the contest with the Jiang family.

397
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,260
So, in either case, we'll get
the better end of the deal.

398
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,960
Xuyang,

399
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,350
can I go back to you?

400
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,550
What's wrong?

401
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,640
Jiang Jie is so smart.

402
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,350
He'll figure out

403
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,790
it's me who told Li Nai
about Xue Congming soon.

404
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,200
And

405
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,590
whether he wins or loses,

406
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,720
his value will be gone soon, right?

407
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,270
Fair enough.

408
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,920
Then you may come back now.

409
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,590
Help me with the purchase
of the restaurants below three stars.

410
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,550
Xuyang,

411
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,240
I have another thing...

412
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,440
Let's talk later.

413
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,550
I have other things to do later.

414
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,030
You don't look well.

415
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,510
You didn't rest well, right?

416
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,400
Take care.

417
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,070
Here's your bag.

418
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,000
Jiang Xuyang.

419
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,440
Why are they together?

420
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,100
What are you looking for?

421
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,880
Why is Ms. Zhu not here?

422
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,350
She's resigned.

423
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,070
From now on,

424
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,510
you'll only need to do your routine work.

425
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,640
Don't I need to help you
prepare for the challenge?

426
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,290
No need.

427
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,880
This is normal.

428
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,070
What are the odds, Ms. Cui?

429
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,270
I didn't expect you
to have the time to come here.

430
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,640
I heard that there have been
tremendous changes in Baichuan.

431
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,960
The seniors in the Alliance are complaining

432
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,160
about some of your decisions.

433
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,920
Since I decided to make renovations,

434
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,160
some people's interests
would be damaged anyway.

435
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:42,920
It can't be helped.

436
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,880
Looks like your work is not easy.

437
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Actually,
this is why I came here for you today.

438
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,640
I hope someone can help me.

439
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,590
The market is too big for the Jiang family.

440
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,640
I wonder if you have a minute.

441
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,590
Great.

442
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,720
Xijiangyue has got a new Chef.

443
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,640
I haven't tried the new dishes yet.

444
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,720
You're saying the Li family
is behind Eating at Dusk

445
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,750
and has initiated a challenge to Chuncheng?

446
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,880
Yes.

447
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,790
Do we need to learn about Eating at Dusk?

448
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,440
No need.

449
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,960
Challenging Chuncheng?

450
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,030
How stupidly arrogant of her!

451
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,440
Stop it.

452
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,030
Chef.

453
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,590
Cui Can.

454
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,880
Only you order food ingredients
from Xijiangyue.

455
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,000
Do you think I can't tell it's you
because you're dressed this way?

456
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,200
Are you afraid of seeing me?

457
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,240
I thought you didn't want to see me.

458
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,720
I did ask you to get lost last time.

459
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,480
Fine.

460
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,480
I'll leave this time too.

461
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,100
(Xijiangyue)

462
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,400
(Why hasn't she run after me yet?)

463
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:21,750
This way, please.

464
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,270
Cui...

465
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:31,071
Careful.

466
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
Do you find the environment
is different from before?

467
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,400
The decoration looks nice.

468
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,560
Ouch.

469
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,160
What's your relationship with that woman?

470
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,550
That's my sister.

471
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,440
Does your brother have a girlfriend?

472
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,720
Which girlfriend are you talking about?

473
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Which girlfriend?

474
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,550
He's a love rat indeed.

475
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,960
I didn't expect you
to have so many secrets.

476
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,310
Mr. Cui.

477
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,110
Don't you want to know why your sister
is dining here with Jiang Xuyang?

478
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,270
Dear customers,

479
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,960
I'm the Chef at Xijiangyue.

480
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,920
I'll be responsible for your dishes today.

481
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,030
Is this Miss Jiang,
who is known as a genius, right?

482
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,880
Yes.

483
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,920
Good thing that Xiu is the Chef.

484
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Anyway,
I know nothing about cooking at all.

485
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,880
Bring the dishes.

486
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
The first dish,

487
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,720
Cheating Octopus.

488
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,640
The second dish,

489
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,640
Unfaithful Bitter Gourd.

490
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,070
The last one,

491
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,270
Stir-fried Prawns.

492
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,590
Ms. Cui,

493
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,480
I think my sister
may have a misunderstanding.

494
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,200
So does my brother.

495
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,110
Jing.

496
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,510
Let me tell you.

497
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,000
This man is dissolute,
fickle and unfaithful.

498
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,880
It's you.

499
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,920
Don't waste your time on him.

500
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,640
I'm here to talk business with Mr. Jiang.

501
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,640
Talk business?

502
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,790
Boring.

503
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,270
Is this your crush?

504
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,160
Mr. Cui, are you and Xiu in a relationship?

505
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,270
Does Grandpa know about this?

506
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,160
Actually, we're just...

507
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,550
We're just friends.

508
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,880
Since it's a misunderstanding,
I'll leave you alone then.

509
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,960
Enjoy.

510
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm out of here.

511
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,440
The young people are so unpredictable.

512
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,000
I'll go and take a look at them.

513
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,160
Please wait a minute.

514
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,440
Do you really think we're just friends?

515
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,750
Or else?

516
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,880
Since you dislike me, why did you kiss me?

517
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,510
I kissed you but it doesn't mean I like you.

518
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,070
Got it.

519
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,300
(Eating at Dusk)

520
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,920
What's wrong with you?

521
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,280
I'm crossed in love.

522
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,000
When were you in love?

523
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,550
You don't get it.

524
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You've never suffered for love.
You won't get it.

525
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,510
Why would I have to suffer?

526
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,230
Let's put that aside.

527
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,630
The game is around the corner.

528
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,150
Have you decided on the dish?

529
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,440
Hello? Anyone there?

530
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,630
Sir.

531
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,360
Sir.

532
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,280
Sir.

533
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,000
Sir.

534
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,630
Sir.

535
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,760
Shark fin.

536
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,840
Fish glue.

537
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,630
Does this have anything to do with you?

538
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,320
No, I don't even know them.

539
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,590
Can it be that Jiang Jie

540
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,360
