00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,030
Jiang Jie.

21
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,630
Where's she?

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,190
- Who?
- Li Nai.

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,470
- Li Nai?
- Is she alright?

24
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,430
Li Nai has been away with your sister
for ten minutes.

25
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,400
Got it.

26
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,630
Do you know where they have gone?

27
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,240
The Jiang family.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,750
The Jiang family?

29
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,590
Why on earth do you demand
to meet my grandpa?

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,240
Because someone gave me a test.

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,280
It's time to check the result.

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,240
I can't fail.

33
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,430
Oh, it's my brother.

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,590
I just can't get it.

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,870
You two keep tormenting each other.

36
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,870
Got to say you're really meant
for each other.

37
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,680
I really wanna be your sister-in-law.

38
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,080
Shame on you!

39
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,000
So what? As my dad said,

40
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,520
to find a spouse, one must be cheeky.

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,430
Fine.

42
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,590
My grandpa is in there.

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,280
Your grandpa and I

44
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,120
used to have a bond.

45
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,870
I've never met my grandpa.

46
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,080
But everyone knows about you in Baichuan.

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,630
The members of the Alliance
all respect you a lot.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,120
Xiu told me

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,470
you had something important
to discuss with me.

50
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,800
I do have a favor to ask of you.

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,430
Tell me about it.

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,150
You know, Eating at Dusk
will have the five-star review.

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,750
My family's succession has been severed
for two generations.

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,680
I really don't know how to handle

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,750
the review.

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
The star review

57
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,000
is the rule

58
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,560
set by my grandpa.

59
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,870
It's mainly to encourage the young people
in the Alliance.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,080
As long as they work well,

61
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,120
it won't be hard

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,310
to pass the review.

63
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,560
I've tried my best.

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,470
But rumor has it

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,560
that someone doesn't want me
to pass the review.

66
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,160
As you said, it's a rumor.

67
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,120
But the rumor isn't necessarily fake.

68
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,390
I wonder where Mr. Yuanfeng is.

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,720
I was honored to meet him once
the other day,

70
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,950
and he also asked me to wait for him.

71
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,190
I thought I could see him today.

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,310
He has gone to the capital city
on behalf of Xijiangyue

73
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,680
to attend the anniversary party
of the Chinese Food Association.

74
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,190
What are the odds?

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,390
Tell me about it.

76
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,190
If you wanna find out
who smashed your restaurant,

77
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,190
I can help you.

78
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,310
But it seems that these people
have done this a lot.

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,920
Maybe it's just that the tall tree
catches much wind.

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,830
It may not be a scheme against you.

81
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,190
I've just sent someone
to smash the restaurant.

82
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,680
Big deal.

83
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,000
The old man is such a nuisance.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,510
The older he gets,
the more cowardly he becomes.

85
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,870
How dare Li Nai force me!

86
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,870
I'll let her know what she'll get
for offending me.

87
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,270
Mr. Yuanfeng, what will one get
for offending you?

88
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,510
You're here for Li Nai?

89
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,830
18 years ago, the price of offending you
was a pair of hands.

90
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,390
18 years later, you seem to become wussier.

91
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,950
What do you want?

92
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,560
You're right. Even if I have evidence,

93
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,360
I can't catch him anyway
if someone is behind his back.

94
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,310
You're twisting my words.

95
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,160
We've got to pursue justice.

96
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,830
You're young.

97
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,600
You shouldn't be so negative.

98
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,270
Forget it.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,800
If I really can't pass the review
this time,

100
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,920
I'll follow Jiang Xuyang's example.

101
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,950
It seems that he intends to make all
restaurants in Baichuan into chain restaurants.

102
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,390
Even if I don't have the title
of a five-star restaurant,

103
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,870
I can swagger about in another province.

104
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,190
Mr. Jiang, it's late now.

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,750
I won't disturb you then.

106
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,160
Wait.

107
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,000
What do you mean by saying

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,480
the chain restaurant?

109
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,680
Don't you know that?

110
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,190
Jiang Xuyang and Cui Jing

111
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,630
have been purchasing the restaurants
below three stars under the Alliance.

112
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,240
I know that.

113
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,390
That's for the Alliance's development.

114
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,680
But I heard

115
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,430
they purchased these restaurants

116
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,630
not only for the unification
of the Alliance.

117
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,040
His idea is to test the waters
outside Baichuan with these restaurants

118
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,750
and then open chain restaurants
in the form of pre-made food.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,360
I haven't been in business for decades.

120
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,830
The Li family

121
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,510
is also a member of the Alliance.

122
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,190
The seven families are supposed to be
an integral whole.

123
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,830
I can do you

124
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,830
a favor.

125
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,700
(Eating at Dusk)

126
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,510
Good luck with the new business.

127
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,870
Jingjing, our restaurant
is successfully upgraded today.

128
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,390
How about not charging the first customer?

129
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,600
No problem.

130
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,790
A free meal to the first customer, huh?

131
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,630
What about the first employee?

132
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,700
(Eating at Dusk;
Certified by Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan)

133
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,600
What's going on?

134
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,870
I passed the test.

135
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,480
Look at your smug face.

136
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,840
Can you be prudent?

137
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,030
After all,
you're the boss of a five-star restaurant.

138
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't be jealous.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,120
Although he's seized your knife,

140
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,550
I've seized his knife too.

141
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,720
It's all the same.
I'll treat you the same way.

142
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Jiang Jie, come here.

143
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,030
What's wrong?

144
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,670
Your button isn't well done.
Let me handle it for you.

145
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,750
Li Nai,

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,670
you deliberately drew Jiang Yuanfeng
to the coffee shop, right?

147
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,480
The Jiang family has the most complicated
relationship I've ever seen.

148
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,270
What they have is just this big.

149
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,840
The old generation doesn't let go.

150
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,960
The middle generation

151
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,840
is incapable and troublesome.

152
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,440
The young generation is ambitious

153
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,670
but their ambition is too big.

154
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,200
I think if you're really looking for
a breakthrough point,

155
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,550
you should turn to Jiang Yuanfeng.

156
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,030
That's a real loser.

157
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,390
What did you tell him to irritate him?

158
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,720
I told him about your dad.

159
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,960
Sorry for leaking your private matter.

160
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,270
Do you know

161
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,270
he'd probably come to hurt you

162
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,840
if Jiang Ziqing didn't send him away.

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,670
As you said, I was bound to lose.

164
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,960
Of course I had to take some risks.

165
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,150
The fact proved that I won the bet.

166
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,600
You talked about the plan

167
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,750
about me before. What's that?

168
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,720
Jingjing. Zhao Jingjing!

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,550
- What's wrong?
- What a good day today!

170
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,240
We passed the five-star review

171
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,720
and Jiang Jie also joined us.

172
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,220
Let's have a celebratory dinner tonight.

173
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,670
You're the most obedient

174
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,600
and reassuring kid in this family.

175
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,120
Answer me.

176
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,870
What's the base of the seven

177
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,240
cooking families in Baichuan?

178
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,960
The seven chefs with unique skills.

179
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,000
Then why are you trying

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
to open chain restaurants?

181
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,630
Do you think I'm old?

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
Do you think I'm deaf?

183
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,510
Do you think I'm blind?

184
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,080
Opening chain restaurants
can make more profits.

185
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,390
I get it.

186
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,840
But opening the chain restaurants

187
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,270
lies in the brand,

188
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,080
not the cooking skills.

189
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,600
If you open chain restaurants,

190
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,440
you may gain popularity.

191
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,390
But the seven families in Baichuan

192
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
will be rotten radically.

193
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,390
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

194
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,030
It's the succession of 200 years

195
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,360
and seven families.

196
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,030
How can you lay your fingers on it?

197
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,630
Get lost.

198
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,550
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

199
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,000
Xuyang.

200
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,720
Tell me. What's wrong?

201
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,270
Jiang Jie

202
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,030
has officially joined Eating at Dusk.

203
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,440
I've underestimated Jiang Jie.

204
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,670
I didn't expect that
he'd be willing to bend.

205
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,440
I've belittled Li Nai.

206
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,270
I thought she was the woman

207
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,120
who climbed up
because of Jiang Jie's soft heart.

208
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,200
I didn't expect her to meet my grandpa.

209
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,670
What should we do next?

210
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,600
How did Li Nai know

211
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,840
about the chain restaurants?

212
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,550
Cui Can hasn't joined the plan
of the chain restaurant yet.

213
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,360
It's a huge thing.

214
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,030
It means that
we're not doing it well enough.

215
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,360
It doesn't matter who leaks this now.

216
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,360
Most importantly,
my grandpa has known about this.

217
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,840
He'll intervene with
the Alliance's affairs.

218
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,150
Do we have to continue waiting?

219
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,840
You've waited for years

220
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,670
and finally got such an opportunity.

221
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,440
No more waiting.

222
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
I can't wait anymore.

223
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,720
I was laughing at Cui Jing and Cui Can

224
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,200
about being too attached.

225
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,150
Now as it appears,
I've been not heartless enough.

226
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,670
Since we've got obstacles,

227
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,240
I'll get rid of them myself.

228
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,270
Mr. Zheng,

229
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,720
you're working at Xijiangyue.

230
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,630
Chef, there you are.

231
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,440
Let me introduce him to you.

232
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,510
This is our new Sous Chef.

233
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,870
We had only one Sous Chef before,

234
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,360
but somehow, Mr. Jiang

235
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,910
assigned him here.

236
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Jiang Xuyang?

237
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,390
Are you following Jiang Xuyang?

238
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,360
Does my brother know about this?

239
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,750
I'm following his example.

240
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,150
He has gone to work for Eating at Dusk.

241
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,720
Why can't I work for Xijiangyue?

242
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,200
What benefits does he give you?

243
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,750
If it's the Head Chef
of the chain restaurants,

244
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,510
you'd better give it up.

245
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,030
Because my grandpa has canceled his plan
of the chain restaurants.

246
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,630
Or are you

247
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,750
aiming at the position of the Head Chef
at Xijiangyue?

248
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,390
He can give me what I want anyway.

249
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,510
Fine. I hope you won't regret it.

250
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,000
(Sir, I need five copies of my resume.)

251
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Wait a minute.

252
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,030
Mr. Zheng, you haven't got a job?

253
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,960
I'm not as capable as you.

254
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,440
Got a new job right after resigning.

255
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,720
Among the five-star restaurants,

256
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,120
Firewood Rice and Cao's Fish both
rejected you.

257
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,510
Among the four-star restaurants, Yanyu and
Wooden Fish Collection dare not hire you.

258
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,270
Can it be

259
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,270
you'll be reduced to joining
a three-star restaurant?

260
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,390
Do you forget

261
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,960
Chuncheng also started with one star?

262
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,720
But that's because of Jiang Jie.

263
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,910
Couldn't I do anything without Jiang Jie?

264
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,030
What a waste of food!

265
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,480
Can't you even follow

266
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,150
the basic principle of the chef?

267
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,000
As long as you want to,

268
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,510
you can be the Sous Chef at Xijiangyue.

269
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,670
And Mr. Jiang promises

270
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,840
you'll be the Head Chef in one year.

271
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,120
This is what your deceased father
yearned for most

272
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,270
but couldn't get his whole life.

273
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,030
Wish a brisk business for Eating at Dusk!

274
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,600
Let's start eating.

275
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,110
(Jie, Zheng Fangxing agreed
with Jiang Xuyang to join Xijiangyue.)

276
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,830
(But I don't know what they're up to.)

277
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,500
(Okay, got it)

278
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,310
Miss Li, is it too stingy of you
to treat us to this for celebration?

279
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,110
Look at Sous Chef Jiang.
He doesn't eat anything.

280
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,030
Should you have a drink as punishment?

281
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:39,830
Sure.

282
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,510
That's not necessary.

283
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,880
I have no problems with this.

284
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,270
It's just that something came to my mind.

285
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,240
Come on. Let's eat.

286
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,909
Are the dishes not to
Sous Chef Jiang's taste?

287
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:53,110
Li Nai. There is a snack street at the back.

288
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,160
How about taking him there?

289
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,920
Sure. I'll buy you
whatever you want to eat.

290
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,200
Don't bother. These are okay.

291
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,960
- Let's go.
- Don't bother.

292
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,350
- Li Nai.
- Go. Go.

293
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,990
Have you eaten this before?

294
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,590
You want this?

295
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,920
It's already enough.
We may go back now.

296
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,200
The last one.

297
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,160
Ma'am, I'd like a sugar painting.
In the shape of a sunflower.

298
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,070
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

299
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,030
Look! Isn't the night market lively?

300
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,480
But when the day breaks,

301
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,790
all this will be gone.

302
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,070
Likewise,
the glory brought by knife seizing

303
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
looks dazzling

304
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,480
but is actually vulnerable.

305
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,110
Jiang Jie,

306
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,680
I've lied to you.

307
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,590
The first day you were back in Baichuan,

308
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,960
I told you if you wanted to seize knife,

309
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,480
Eating at Dusk would be your best choice.

310
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,350
I know.

311
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,790
You've never thought of seizing knife.

312
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,480
Your father's tragedy

313
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,720
and my master's

314
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,550
are both due to knife seizing.

315
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,920
So, Jiang Jie,

316
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,830
I hope we can

317
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
bring Eating at Dusk
to the No. 1 of the year

318
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,350
and then abolish knife seizing
at the Alliance Meeting.

319
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,880
Li Nai,

320
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,160
the abolition of knife seizing
is far from enough. Look.

321
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,110
Among the people we met
on the way here,

322
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,830
some of them are working part time,

323
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,750
just like what you did before.

324
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,640
Some of them can't afford to open a diner.

325
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,030
But more of them

326
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,350
are forced to come here because they can't

327
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,590
pass the Alliance's review.

328
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,200
Have you thought about who's responsible
for the review?

329
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,960
They're merely some laymen

330
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,550
who are attached to the seven families
and can't cook at all.

331
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,750
Why do the seven families have five stars
at the beginning?

332
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,680
And we common people have to work hard

333
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,000
our whole life starting from one star.

334
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,110
Some of us can't even pass the review

335
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,880
and have to run a food stall,

336
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,480
just like those peddlers.

337
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,000
Li Nai,

338
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,960
I've got the knife of the Ge family.

339
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,160
Well, you...

340
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:24,780
Come here.

341
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,680
Li Nai,

342
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,200
let me ask you again.

343
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,480
Will you work with me

344
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,480
to change the current situation
of the Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan?

345
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,270
Yes!

346
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,160
Are we on the same side now?

347
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,920
Let's go. They're still waiting for us.

348
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,790
Hurry. Let's go.

349
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,850
(Harmony at home brings prosperity)

350
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,240
Li Jidong, it's time to eat.

351
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,440
I wanna have a fried egg.

352
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,110
This is a fried egg.

353
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,440
The fried egg is supposed to be round.

354
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
It can be heart-shaped too.

355
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,510
The fried egg is round.

356
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,510
Li Jidong,

357
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,550
don't get on my bad side.

358
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,200
Hello.

359
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,960
What?

360
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,640
Something came up in the restaurant?

361
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,160
(Eating at Dusk)
Why isn't that young man here?

362
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,270
Right, why is he not here?

363
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,510
- Where is he?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,550
I've been waiting here for a while.

365
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,110
Will he not come today?

366
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,790
I've finally put on makeup today.

367
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,070
Are you robbed?

368
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,440
- I'd rather be robbed.
- What's going on?

369
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,550
I don't know. I was free this morning,

370
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,680
so I came to work early.

371
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,590
Those people just ran after me
upon seeing me.

372
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,480
Why the face?

373
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,880
Turns out you're not attractive to boys,

374
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,920
but to girls.

375
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,270
Come off it.

376
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,640
I don't wanna admit this,

377
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,510
but they were calling Jiang Jie indeed.

378
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,880
Jiang Jie.

379
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,240
Here comes Jiang Jie.

380
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,350
Jiang Jie is coming! Jiang Jie!

381
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,350
Open the door.

382
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,550
- Come again if you like our food.
- Okay, no problem.

383
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,590
Hello, do you like the food?

384
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,920
There are so many customers.

385
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,550
You've just joined us since yesterday.

386
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,720
Your fans have reported your whereabouts
to the Alliance.

387
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,440
It may not be done by my fans.

388
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,480
I have a lot of enemies.

389
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,750
Sous Chef Jiang.

390
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,960
- A customer demands your service.
- Take this.

391
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,310
What kind of enemy will demand his service?

392
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,110
(Eating at Dusk)
What's written on your sleeve?

393
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,160
Sous Chef Jiang, chef service.

394
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,680
Here it goes.

395
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,310
Smell this. I feel it has gone bad.

396
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,750
Sous Chef Jiang.

397
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,720
- Chef service.
- Actually, my daughter also cooks well.

398
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,790
Is it okay...

399
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,461
Here.

400
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,790
Hold on.

401
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,030
Jiang, service.

402
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,070
What chef service? I've got this.

403
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,960
If you have any questions,
you may ask me.

404
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,110
We have no questions.

405
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,830
If you don't need anything,
I'll excuse myself. Please enjoy.

406
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,000
Thank you.

407
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,590
Mr. Meng.

408
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,160
Chef Li.

409
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,350
Well, is there any specialty today?

410
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,110
Today, we've got the Pith-Removed
Orange Bowl.

411
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,960
Would you like to try it?

412
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,750
Then I'll have an Orange Bowl.

413
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,270
- And the Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs.
- The Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs.

414
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,680
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I can cook the roasted goose too.

415
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,400
- It's my favorite lately.
- Roasted goose, right? I like it too.

416
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,680
Why is he here again?

417
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,200
- Who is he?
- The guy over there.

418
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,550
He's come here to eat for over one month.

419
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,510
Looks like he's really fond
of Li Nai's cooking.

420
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,880
Oh yeah?

421
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,110
I don't think he only likes her cooking.

422
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:17,340
(Eating at Dusk)

423
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,790
Won't you continue your chef service?

424
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,440
I'm afraid if I keep taking over
the Chef's job,

425
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,400
I may be fired for putting my left foot
across the door first tomorrow morning.

426
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,960
Your worry is unnecessary.

427
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Given your influence,

428
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,960
which boss can bear to fire you?

429
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,680
Same here.

430
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,680
- What?
- Chef Li, you've progressed in cooking.

431
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,270
Your customer has come to the restaurant
for one and a half months in a row.

432
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
I've never met one in Chuncheng.

433
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,550
You mean Meng Shitong?

434
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,350
A regular customer indeed.

435
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,000
You're even aware of his name.

436
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,830
Don't tell me you know
what he likes to eat too.

437
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,750
Of course I do.

438
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,000
- Chef Li, someone wants to meet you.
- Coming.

439
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,750
Today I must thank you

440
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,830
for dining with me.

441
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,350
That's too flattering.

442
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,550
Mr. Jiang, it's my honor

443
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,960
to eat with you.

444
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,030
Cui Jing, you've managed the Cui family
well these years.

445
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,240
The Cui family isn't
one of the seven families,

446
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
but it still has a history of 200 years.

447
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,440
It's sorta connected
with the seven families.

448
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,350
To be honest with you,
Jiang Xiu is the Head Chef at Xijiangyue.

449
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,750
Our family's root

450
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,000
is in Xijiangyue.

451
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,960
Cui Can.

452
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,390
Mr. Jiang.

453
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,920
What do you think of my granddaughter?

454
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,240
Mr. Jiang, frankly speaking,

455
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,720
Jiang Xiu and I
were in a relationship before.

456
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,920
Oh yeah?

457
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,830
- That's great.
- But we've broken up.

458
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,480
We won't get back together.

459
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,510
Grandpa, Mr. Cui and I were goofing around.

460
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,000
Afterward, I found he was tedious
and brainless.

461
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,680
So, I quit. I got tired of him.

462
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
- Jiang Xiu.
- I didn't say anything wrong.

463
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,880
You wanna ally with them.

464
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,640
Maybe they wanna have a meteoric rise
with the help of the Jiang family.

465
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,070
Miss Jiang,

466
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,750
even if my family can ride on the wind
of the Jiang family,

467
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,110
why would I have to butter you up myself?

468
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,270
You're not in charge
of the Jiang family.

469
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,350
Cui Can.

470
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,790
Grandpa, I'm not feeling well.

471
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,550
- Where are you going, Xiu?
- I'm out of here.

472
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,880
You'd better remember what you've said.

473
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,960
Where's Jiang Jie?
I noticed he had gone out.

474
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,960
The mob is broken.
So, he has gone to buy one.

475
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,310
When he left, a pretty fan was waiting
for him at the door.

476
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,200
I'm done with this.

477
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,400
I have things to do. Got to go.

478
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,310
It's normal that Jiang Jie has many fans.

479
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,550
Don't be upset.

480
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,680
Get in the right mood.

481
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,270
I'm not upset. Who's upset?

482
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,200
Jiang...

483
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,590
Chef Li.

484
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Mr. Meng.

485
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,200
Did you leave anything behind?

486
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,480
Oh, yeah, I've left something behind.

487
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I was waiting for you.

488
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,270
Waiting for me?

489
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,790
I know

490
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,440
Eating at Dusk doesn't open
until 5:30 pm.

491
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,640
So, do you have time at noon tomorrow?
Will you watch a movie with me?

492
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,550
I...

493
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,550
She won't be available.

494
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,110
Jiang Jie.

495
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,030
Where is your fan?

496
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,550
She's got plans tomorrow.
She won't have time.

497
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,400
- The day after tomorrow then.
- Still no.

498
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,680
- Then two days after tomorrow.
- Not even then.

499
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,880
We have a lot to do at Eating at Dusk.

500
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,310
Mr. Meng,

501
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,720
let's talk outside.

502
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,660
(Eating at Dusk;
Closed)

503
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,310
Li Nai.

504
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,421
Li Nai.

505
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,270
I'm talking to you.

506
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,400
What did he say to you?

507
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,960
No. What did you say to him?

508
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
I told him two days,
or three days after tomorrow...

509
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,350
You can't go to the cinema

510
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,510
with him anytime.

511
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,070
Why?

512
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,310
Because...

513
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,640
- Because...
- Jiang Jie.

514
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,640
Why can't I go to the cinema with him?

515
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,110
Because I have a crush on you.

516
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,510
I have a crush on you.

517
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,160
And we're on the same side now.

518
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,270
You can't leave me.

519
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,030
I'll stand by your side forever.

520
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,240
Well...

521
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,790
How do you feel about me?

522
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,550
I have feelings for you too.

Li Nai!

00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,550
What's wrong?

527
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,680
On second thought,
it's better that you go with me.

528
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,350
I'll go too.

529
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,020
You'd better not.
My dad doesn't want to see you.
