20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,680
Chef,

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,150
the official announcement is already.

22
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,710
- Post it now.
- Yes.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,230
No official response?

24
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,350
The regulator has just taken
food samples from the welfare center.

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,040
- Will it damage Chuncheng's reputation?
- And it...

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
There's no evidence yet
that the food poisoning

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,870
has anything to do with Chuncheng,
why are you panicking?

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,120
I'm sorry, chef.

29
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,790
For now, Chuncheng is only cooperating
with the investigation.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
Before the results are in,

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,590
I don't want anyone

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,760
talking to the regulators or the media
more than necessary.

33
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,230
- Are you clear?
- Yes, Chef.

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,150
Where's Li Nai?

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,190
I just called her.

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,190
She's on her way.

(Customers Are All Fools)

38
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,800
Li Nai.

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,080
Li Nai, what's your opinion
about the video online?

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,470
Do you really think customers are fools?

41
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,800
Li Nai, when you got a kickback
for buying the ham,

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,750
what inferior material did you mix?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
Please answer this question.

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,590
Please explain.

45
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,956
Li Nai, please answer my question directly.

46
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,520
Chef,

47
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,910
there's something wrong
with Li Nai's ham order.

48
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,840
What's wrong?

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,750
Tao's has changed its internal rules

50
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,400
for orders since August last year.

51
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,870
(Tao's Ham Order Sheet)
Each order has a unique number.

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,430
The ham Li Nai bought yesterday

53
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,000
wasn't ordered from Tao's.

54
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,280
So it's all because

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,400
Li Nai bought an inferior ham?

56
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,030
I've checked the ham she bought.

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,280
Although its origin was unclear,
it had no quality problems.

58
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,910
I'll punish her for what she did.

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,710
But I don't want us to suspect each other.

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,800
Chef,

61
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,680
there's a video online
that's causing a stir.

62
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,590
I bought the ham
at the Flower and Bird Market,

63
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,630
as long as the work is done,

64
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,800
the idiot customers
can't tell the difference.

65
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,590
That's not true, Chef.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,150
I was with Li Nai at the time,

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,290
and she was just saying
that she bought it somewhere else,

68
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,520
but it was really Tao's ham.

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,280
This video

70
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,190
has been edited and post-processed.

71
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:26,210

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,520
Turn it off now.

73
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,000
Could you please explain?

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,870
Please answer my question.

75
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,400
With a black-hearted person like you,

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,910
no wonder Xue's Noodles closed down.

77
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,030

78
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,280

79
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,960
What the heck do you want?

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,840
Are you worthy of the children's trust?

81
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,190
Li Nai, can you explain?

82
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,030

83
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,360

86

I didn't say that.

87
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,840
I didn't buy inferior food.

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
I know.

89
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,360
You go home.

90
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,470
I'll take care of this.

91
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,840
I did nothing wrong.

92
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,910
I'm not going home.

93
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,800
It's the Chuncheng's work arrangement.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
Do what I say. Come on.

95
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,960
Go home and get some sleep.

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,870
Don't even think about it.

97

Jiang Jie, are you going
to cover for Li Nai?

98
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,000
Jiang Jie, was it a personal
or Chuncheng's misconduct?

99
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,040
This food poisoning incident,

100
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,270
Chuncheng will come to
a satisfactory solution.

101
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,630

102

151
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,390
Tell me the truth,

152
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,560
are we one of the seven families
of Baichuan culinary, the Li family?

153
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,720
Don't look around.

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,390
I have sent the nanny away for a moment.

155
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,870
No one can help you now.

156
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,360
It doesn't work.

157
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,070
Give me that. I'll do the talking.

158
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,720
Uncle Li,

159
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,560
I have a few questions for you.

160
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,070
Your grandfather,

161
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,160

He's one of the Seven Master Chefs.

168
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,600
But how did our family end up like this?

169
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,240
Even the knife becomes so rusty.

170
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,510
I don't know about that.

171
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,360
I only know that the cooking skills of
Li family have been lost for two generations

172
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,950
and you're the first
of the seven families to fall.

173
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,830
We don't have talent.

174
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,560
I don't think so.

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,510
I'm quite talented.

176
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,240
Li Jidong,

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
what else are you hiding from me?

178
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,510
Like a family heirloom

179
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,720
or a vault or something.

180
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,840
Who are you?

181
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,900
I understand
why I've lived for over 20 years,

182
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,490
only now have I realized
that we are the Li family,

183
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,510
one of the seven families
of Baichuan.

184
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
Hello, dean.

185
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,870
They are discharged.

186
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,600
Okay.

187
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,030
All the facilities and regulations
of Chuncheng

188
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,910
are in line with safety standards.

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,080
This poisoning

190
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,790
is caused by ingredients.

191
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,030
- Thank you for your hard work.
- I'm just doing my job.

192
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:09,150
Please provide a detailed report

193
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,750
on the ingredients as soon as possible,
Chef Jiang,

194
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,840
so that you can give an explanation
to the public and the relevant departments.

195
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,510
We willl.

196
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,870
Chuncheng will definitely
give the public a proper resolution.

197
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
Then I'll be going.

198
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,750
Thank you.

199
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,870
Zhu Hao, see them off.

200
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,670
It's hard to get a lift here.

201
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,750
Let me hail a cab for you.

202
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,550
Thank you.

203
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,910
I told you,

204
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,320
none of you guys at Chuncheng are reliable.

205
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,270
Isn't the Chef of Xijiangyue working today?

206
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,270
Are you upset?

207
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,480
Jiang Xiu,

208
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,120
how many times have I told you

209
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,960
to leave Xijiangyue?

210
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,550
You'd rather have that loser, Li Nai,

211
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,240
than let me into your restaurant.

212
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,030
If I didn't go to Xijiangyue,

213
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,080
you wouldn't have the time to notice me.

214
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,630
You know what I'm up to.

215
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,870
I do.

216
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,510
I am helping you.

217
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a good thing for you
that I become the Chef of Xijiangyue.

218
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,150
Whatever.

219
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,910
I've said many times
that the dining hall must be tidy.

220
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,030
He is upset.

221
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,000
That's good.

222
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,080
He's upset for me.

223
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,580
(All for children, for all of children.
Children's Care and Protection Center)

224
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,840
You and Jiang Jie have grown up.

225
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,480
Jiang Jie?

226
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,790
He's been asking me to let you know

227
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,150
when the kids get out of the hospital.

228
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,200
What are you doing here?

229
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,870
Thank you.

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,790
And thanks for having the dean call me.

231
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,790
No big deal.

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,910
What were you doing just now?

233
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,790
I've been playing with the kids
for a while.

234
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,790
The food poisoning thing...

235
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,047
It has nothing to do with you.

236
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,000
How come I have nothing to do with it?

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,080
I'm an employee of Chuncheng.

238
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,550
I was in charge of the ingredients.

239
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,910
And now Chuncheng is...

240
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,360
That's my job to sort it out.

241
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,200
If you don't want to tell me,

242
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,360
I can ask someone else.

243
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,510
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

244
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,790
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

245
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,580
I'm sure there are discussions
in the Alliance forum.

246
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,200
Li Nai,

247
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
the test report is out.

248
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,440
It's the ham.

249
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,510
I know it's the ham.

250
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm the prime suspect.

251
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,510
I admit I didn't buy ham from Tao's.

252
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,360
But it is really Tao's ham.

253
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,270
I told you, I'm gonna sort it out.

254
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,120
It's not your business.

255
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,790
Go home.

256
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,150
Fine.

257
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,750
Take it easy.

258
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,600
Slow down.

259
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,000
Wait a moment.

260
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,240
Hello?

261
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,270
What's wrong?

262
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,910
I just met Jiang Jie at the welfare center.

263
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,030
He's picking on you again?

264
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,630
Wait for me.

265
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,600
I've got your back.

266
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,870
How could I be picked on by him?

267
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,440
But I know what he'll be dealing with me.

268
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,510
What do you mean?

269
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,150
I was looking forward
to going back to work in Chuncheng.

270
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,670
After all, he only told me to go home.

271
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,670
He didn't say he'd fire me.

272
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,480
But he has given obvious hints.

273
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,440
What about our previous plan?

274
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,870
So I've come up with a new one.

275
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,240
Open a new restaurant.

276
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,910
A new restaurant?

277
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,390
Noodle Shop of Xue's Apprentice
didn't last a day.

278
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,870
That's because Jiang Jie got in the way.

279
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,390
Besides, it will be different this time.

280
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,080
We have a five-star knife.

281
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:54,790
Okay.

282
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,472
I'll definitely follow you.

283
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,200
Good for you.

284
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,240
Come with me tomorrow to rent a place.

285
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,670
No problem. Just give me a call.

286
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,720
Bye.

287
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:02,720
Bye.

288
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,630
Don't try to steal it from me.

289
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,870
Psycho.

290
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,870
Do you like this place?

291
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,550
Yes.

292
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,790
How much is the rent?

293
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,080
- Thirty thousand yuan a month here.
- Thirty thousand yuan?

294
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,150
(For lease)
We'll take it.

295
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,910
We'll take it.

296
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,320
We've been looking around all day.

297
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,440
Why are rents so high?

298
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,480
Li Nai,

299
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,320
I can't do it anymore.

300
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,790
I'm exhausted.

301
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,270
How about we just swipe the card?

302
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay.

303
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,270
You finally made your decision.

304
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,720
Which one do we choose?

305
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,240
I prefer the one in the mall.
It's got a lot of customers.

306
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,120
The one at the underground entrance
is not bad too.

307
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
It's in a good location.

308
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,750
And...

309
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,720
What I meant was

310
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,750
swipe the card for two bottles of water.
I'm so thirsty.

311
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,360
Wait here.

312
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,720
Isn't that Liu Ping,
the one who lost to Jiang Jie?

313
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,510
They must be up to something together.

314
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,750
Such a rare visitor!

315
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,550
Chef Jiang,

316
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,790
which one do you like?

317
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,150
Chef Zhao didn't just call me

318
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,910
to take care of your business, did you?

319
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,030
How about this one?

320
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,790
Which one?

321
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,670
That's the pillar of the shop.

322
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,270
The price is a bit high.

323
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,480
Okay.

324
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,390
I'll take it.

325
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,960
No problem.

326
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,030
Zhong,

327
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,000
the old pillar is finally sold.
Come and pack it up.

328
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,150
Who is out of mind to buy
that ugly, expensive fish?

329
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,630
You didn't force him, did you?

330
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,790
Credit card or cash?

331
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,510
How are you doing with Chuncheng?

332
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,150
I think I'm being targeted.

333
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,390
Are you sure?

334
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,030
Just a guess.

335
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,750
At the time of the five-star review,

336
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,080
I contacted a few shops
that had closed because of you.

337
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,390
I wanted to do a gimmick, but then

338
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:53,630
I changed my plans
because of the seize knife contest.

339
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,270
Some of the chefs

340
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,000
in these shops were unhappy with you.

341
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,910
Thanks for inspiring them.

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,480
I'm not as cheap as them.

343
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,680
From what I heard, they contacted
some of the established ingredient shops

344
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,110
and paid them a large sum of money

345
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,030
to make sure
they wouldn't sell you anything.

346
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,200
In that case,

347
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,510
Yuan's and Tao's are both involved.

348
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,550
Is that all?

349
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,440
One of those chefs targeting you

350
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,790
is named Liu Ping.

351
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,550
Liu Ping contacted
a Chuncheng's employee,

352
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,310
the one you trust the most.

353
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,160
Zheng Fangxing.

354
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,070
That's quite a conspiracy.

355
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,790
Their plan is more sophisticated
than yours.

356
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,440
I heard you fired Li Nai.

357
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,510
It's a suspension.

358
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,750
In this current situation,

359
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,350
it is pretty much the same for her.

360
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,720
Chef Jiang,

361
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,070
if you want to fire her,

362
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,960
let her come to me.

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,790
Come to you for what?

364
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,640
To help you sell fish here?

365
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,960
Zhong, take the fish to send him off.

366
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,340
(Liu)

367
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,110
What an unexpected suspect.

368
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,030
Liu Ping lost to Jiang Jie.

369
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,000
But your Sous Chef Zheng
showed up at this place.

370
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,160
There must be something wrong.

371
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,720
Right. So what should we do?

372
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,750
Jiang Jie checked the ham I bought,

373
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,030
so the ham must be clean.

374
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,640
There is only one possibility.
Someone switched it.

375
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,240
You scared me.

376
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,070
Zhao Jingjing said Liu Ping came to you.

377
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,160
Yes.

378
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,160
Should I tell you in advance?

379
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,790
The two of you conspired

380
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,720
to bring down Chuncheng.

381
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,480
Is that what you think?

382
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,030
Now you're doubting me on the ham thing.

383
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,270
You're the last person I'd ever suspect.

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
You're my brother.

385
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,550
This boy doesn't talk much.

386
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,680
Yeah, I know.

387
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,550
Jiang Jie,

388
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,720
do you recognise me?

389
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,240
Sous Chef Zheng of Xijiangyue.

390
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,480
I have left Xijiangyue.

391
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,030
From now on, call me Uncle Zheng.

392
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,640
Come.

393
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,350
This is my son, Zheng Fangxing.

394
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,640
You two played together.

395
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,510
Come and say hello.

396
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,920
Jie.

397
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,240
Jiang Jie,

398
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
would you like to live with us?

399
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,510
Will you teach me to cook?

400
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,960
I know what you want.

401
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,030
I'll help you with it.

402
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,400
What are you looking for?

403
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,070
Licorice.

404
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,030
It seems to be expired.

405
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,680
Go ask Li Nai.

406
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,480
Okay.

407
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,030
Double-yolked.

408
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,790
Double-yolked.

409
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,030
Even if I'm talented,
when faced with a genius,

410
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
I'm nothing.

411
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,030
I learned to cook five years before you,

412
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,640
but you beat me in six months.

413
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,310
Even though you have such talent,

414
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,400
you were rated as mediocre
by the Jiang family.

415
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,920
It's nothing.

416
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,110
I just try a little bit harder than you.

417
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,550
You're really bad at talking.

418
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,110
But I'm looking forward to the day

419
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,160
when our shared goal is achieved.

420
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,000
We will.

421
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,880
After all, we've come this far.

422
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,030
I'm sure it will be.

423
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,030
Tell me.

424
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,480
What do you want me to do?

425
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,070
Make an appointment with Liu Ping

426
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,270
and his gang for me.

427
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,678
You want to confront them face-to-face.

428
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,640
Li Nai got that ham
from Three-Eyed Qiao.

429
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,110
Everyone knows his relationship
with Mrs. Tao.

430
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,640
He's willing to vouch

431
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,750
that the ham was indeed from Tao's.

432
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,790
What's the point?

433
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,550
Even if the ham is really fine,

434
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,550
they can still blame it
on the cooking of Chuncheng.

435
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,460
Yeah, it can't get Chuncheng
out of the crisis.

436
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,310
But...

437
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,240
It will help Li Nai.

438
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,960
You already know who did it.

439
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,160
You want to see Liu Ping
just to clear Li Nai's name, right?

440
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,550
She's suspecting me.

441
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,310
Jie,

442
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,000
it's me or him.

443
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,790
Maybe Chuncheng is better off closed.

444
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:49,941
Enough of the teasing.

445
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,200
Who's the mole?

446
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,790
Except for you, me and Li Nai,

447
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,350
there are seven employees in Chuncheng.

448
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,070
If we're looking for the mole,

449
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,750
Zhu Hao is the first one to rule out.

450
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,640
How's Jiang Jie?

451
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,440
He is quite calm,

452
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,240
as if nothing happened.

453
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,200
He has always been calm and composed.

454
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,200
What are we going to do next?

455
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,200
You asked me to assist Jiang Jie
in seizing three five-star knives

456
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,716
so as to weaken the power of the other
six families in the alliance.

457
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,480
If Chuncheng is in trouble now,

458
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,880
your plan...

459
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,480
If he can't handle such a thing,

460
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,640
how can he be my best weapon?

461
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,790
All we have to do now is wait and see.

462
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,000
Today I saw Jiang Xiu has officially
taken up her post in Xijiangyue.

463
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,030
Are you all right?

464
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,640
How can I not be right?

465
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,480
I proposed to grandpa that Jiang Xiu
should serve as the Head Chef in advance.

466
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,240
I'm the one who persuaded her to go.

467
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,960
Do you think I'm all right or not?

468
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,880
I don't quite get it.

469
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,790
Jiang Jie, he wants to seize the knife
of the Jiang family.

470
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,000
Jiang Xiu is the Head Chef
of the Jiang family.

471
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,030
A duel between siblings

472
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,680
is a lot more exciting, don't you think?

473
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,200
Just wait to see who wins.

474
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,480
One more knife and you can come back.

475
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,160
Just hold on a little longer.

476
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,200
Xuyang,

477
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,030
I'm so glad

478
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,350
I could help you.

479
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,790
I am so lucky to have you with me.

480
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,590
Why does he have nothing to do?

481
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,240
Are you sure he's here
to see his accomplice?

482
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,110
They just met yesterday.

483
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,590
It's unlikely they're meeting again.

484
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,240
What?

485
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,510
Then why did you make me follow him?

486
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,590
Just in case.

487
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,160
Take a taxi and follow me.

488
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:27,920
Okay.

489
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:36,960
Hello?

490
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,240
You summoned us here at this hour.

491
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,070
What for?

492
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,960
Zheng Fangxing, Jiang Jie's Sous Chef,
set up this meeting.

493
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,640
Don't we already have an insider?

494
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,160
Why bother contacting him?

495
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,160
Although public opinion is fermenting
over the ham incident,

496
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,960
most of it is focused

497
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,350
on an unknown lowly employee.

498
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,350
I'm afraid Jiang Jie
will get away again this time.

499
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,720
To make sure he is no longer a threat,

500
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,750
we must turn to those closest to him.

501
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,640
We've been wasting our time.

502
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,790
Let's meet him first.

503
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,270
Jiang Jie.

504
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,350
It's been a while, everyone.

505
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,550
Hello?

506
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,830
The subscriber you dialed...

507
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,270
What the heck?

508
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,310
I'm always the one to save the day.

509
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,200
Why don't they even turn on the lights?

510
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,750
Take off your sunglasses, idiot.

511
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,480
Good day, sir.

512
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,400
Do you have a reservation?

513
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,440
- You have to make reservations here?
- Yes, sir.

514
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,960
I made a reservation.
The guy in white. I'm with him.

515
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,270
Sir, which box is your friend in?

516
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,070
Number one.

517
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,640
Two, number two.

518
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,590
Sir, our boxes are all named in Chinese.

519
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,350
Chinese.

520
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,550
So embarrassing.

521
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,240
How about this?

522
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,600
The owner
doesn't need a reservation, right?

523
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,270
I'm buying this place.

524
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,000
Change the box names to numbers.

525
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,030
Mr. Liu,

526
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:21,400
you're still very vigorous, especially
when it comes to setting people up.

527
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:21,880
You...

528
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,160
Jiang Jie,

529
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,310
what do you want?

530
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,750
This is the very question

531
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,200
that I would like to ask all of you here.

532
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,680
What do you want?

533
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,830
You've done something bad
and you're getting punished for it.

534
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,480
Don't you deserve it?

535
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,880
Mr. Yuan is right.

536
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,030
I deserve it.

537
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,960
Because of my own selfishness,

538
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,680
your not-so-good restaurants are closed.

539
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,590
It's my fault
for not taking care of your feelings.

540
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,070
Most of us here are your elders.

541
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,960
Don't you dare insult us.

542
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,720
I am not.

543
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,440
I'm here today to admit my mistake.

544
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,200
Admit your mistake?

545
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,070
Do you admit it?

546
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,830
Well, you admit to us all,

547
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,480
and

548
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,880
shut down Chuncheng.

549
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,000
This is justice for everyone.

550
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,200
Yes.

551
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,640
I said I would admit my mistake.

552
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,350
But it doesn't mean I regret it.

553
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,680
You,
you're messing with us, aren't you?

554
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,920
I'm telling you, evildoers never escape.

555
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,640
Evildoers.

556
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
I just beat you in a more than fair way

557
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,790
by seizing your knives.

558
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
If that's evil,

559
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,880
then what are you, poisoning children

560
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,640
and Cyber-bullying innocent people,
just to get me?

561
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,814
I don't know what you're talking about.

562
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,200
Are we expecting someone?

563
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,510
That would be my guests.

564
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,920
Which box are they in?

565
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,790
Hello?

566
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,400
Who's there?

567
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,070
It's you.

568
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,350
Don't make a sound.

569
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,830
Li Nai, Cui Can,

570
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
you two are so late.

571
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,310
Xiu,

572
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,960
what are you doing here?

573
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,440
Where's my brother?

574
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,790
Jiang Jie.

575
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,110
Master Qiao.

576
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,790
Come here.

577
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,350
I'm here today to talk about one thing.

578
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,720
The ham used in Chuncheng
was bought from me.

579
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,240
My ham was given to me

580
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,550
in the property division

581
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,350
when I left Tao's last July.

582
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,400
Take a look at this.

583
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,400
This is my divorce settlement.

584
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,590
And here's my employee card
for working at Tao's.

585
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,750
You don't have any proof.

586
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,350
I don't remember that there was any ham
in the divorce settlement.

587
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,350
Mrs. Tao,

588
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,000
I understand that you're aging
and losing your memory.

589
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,218
Take your time to recall.

590
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
Let me tell you something else.

591
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,720
This is a sample of the ham
that Chuncheng stored,

592
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,580
in accordance with
the rules of the Alliance,

593
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,710
on the day of the poisoning
of the children in the welfare center.

594
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,160
The ham has been inspected
by the Food Safety and Inspection Bureau

595
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,240
and it was all clean.

596
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,830
And so what?

597
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,160
Even if the raw materials are clean,

598
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,400
improper storage
while cooking and delivering

599
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,830
can cause food to spoil.

600
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,720
And this low-quality ham
is most likely to go bad.

601
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,310
This is the ham from the rice balls
the children ate that day.

602
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,200
According to the bureau,

603
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,680
the ham used in it

604
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,590
doesn't match the ham
we use in Chuncheng.

605
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,310
What does it prove?

606
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,830
Who knows if you've mixed it
with other hams?

607
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,480
What you're talking about

608
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,590
is exactly what the bureau is considering.

609
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,174
That is why I also handed over the list

610
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,680
of suppliers of ham for Chuncheng

611
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,110
to the bureau this morning.

612
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,510
By the way,

613
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,000
most of the people here
have worked with us before.

614
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,640
Where did that man buy the ham?

615
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,480
Well,

616
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,070
I don't know either.

617
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,590
All ham suppliers respect you, Mr Liu.

618
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,240
Since he seized your knife,

619
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,830
no one has supplied ham to Chuncheng.

620
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,310
Jiang Jie,

621
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,640
are you trying to drag us down?

622
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,400
Stop your nonsense.

623
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,750
Before this food poisoning thing,

624
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,480
we haven't sold you any ham at Yuan's.

625
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,070
Perhaps my memory is not so good,

626
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,270
but in Chuncheng we always

627
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,680
keep an inventory of ingredients.

628
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,920
Mrs. Tao,

629
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
do you recall?

630
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,160
Where did Mr. Qiao's ham come from?

631
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,550
The ham bought by our employee, Li Nai,

632
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,590
whether it came from Tao's or not,
with an official record?

633
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,250
I...

634
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,350
One more thing,

635
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,960
this thing will take a clear record

636
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,680
of every word we say today

637
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,960
and post it on the Alliance forum.

638
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,480
Qiao Rui's ham

639
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,070
was indeed given by me.

640
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,110
Go on.

641
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,830
The ham Li Nai bought

642
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,550
was regular,

643
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,110
not a three-no product.

644
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,350
So you and my brother planned this

645
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,960
to bring us here,

646
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,440
including Li Nai and this guy.

647
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,070
I'm...

648
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,350
I'm Cui Can.

649
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,270
I know.

650
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,270
You know me.

651
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,110
The loser who idles around all day.

652
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:24,000
I had detectives investigate you.
It wasted a lot of my time.

653
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,590
Are you two done?

654
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,310
I didn't expect you to come here, Xiu.

655
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,720
Tell me,

656
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,310
where's Li Nai?

657
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,920
He's asking you.

658
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,200
Master Qiao,

659
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,270
I really appreciate your help today.

660
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,960
Thank you.

661
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:48,880
You're welcome.

662
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,350
The ham was sold by me.

663
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,200
I'm doing it for my reputation, too.

664
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
But there's one thing I don't get it.

665
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,240
You went to all this trouble today

666
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,590
to prove that the ham Li Nai bought
was regular,

667
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,550
but it can't help Chuncheng
get out of the crisis.

668
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,750
It happened because of me.

669
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,670
Li Nai is my employee.

670
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,480
I should defend her reputation.

671
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,710
That's it?

672
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,670
That's it.

673
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,920
As for the crisis you just mentioned,

674
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
to solve it,

675
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,280
all we have to do
is to prove that our lunch is clean

676
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,960
and catch the person who switched it.

677
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,400
We already know who did it.

678
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,550
That's good.

679
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,840
If there's nothing else, I'm going.

680
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,000
Take care!

681
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,800
Goodbye.

682
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,380
(Zheng Fangxing)

683
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,590
How's it going in there?

684
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,920
Li Nai is missing.

685
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,920
(Li Nai, I've got some leads on the ham.)

686
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,670
(Will you come to Chuncheng?)

687
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,230
Song Duo.

688
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,190
