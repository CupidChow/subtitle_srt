(Baichuan Chefs' Alliance
Review Notification)

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,840
What is this five-star review for?

22
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,230
Good question.

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,310
- I didn't catch that.
- Right.

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,230
Your knife was seized by Jiang Jie.

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,400
Boss, do you want me to quit?

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,150
Don't. I apologize to you.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,200
As usual, the Alliance would come to you
within a month after the restaurant opens.

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,400
But I was not exposed back then,

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,040
so they didn't know
I had a five-star chef's knife.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,680
Then what about you
having seized Jiang Jie's knife?

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
They didn't come either.
It's been two months,

32
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,310
and now they come.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
Did you smell a rat?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,470
Not exactly.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
I just feel a little weird.

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
It doesn't look good, anyway.

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,150
Then what to do with it?
I was gonna go back in two days.

38
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,000
Go back? Where?

39
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,910
Nowhere. Don't you have any experience

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,590
that passed on in Zhaoyeqing?

41
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,800
Compared to the decades of
outdated experience from my family,

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,310
I'd rather you to your new know-it-all.

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
My know-it-all?

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,590
He bulldoze his way
from one star to five star,

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,960
accumulating way too much experience.

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
You mean Jiang Jie?

47
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,680
Miss Jiang,

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,590
it's not the business hour yet. Miss Jiang.

49
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,280
Can you wait for a while? Miss Jiang.

50
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,560
We haven't started business yet.
Miss Jiang. Miss...

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
Li Nai, where's my brother?

52
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,400
How is he possibly be here?

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,240
I saw a post in the Alliance's forum,

54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,960
saying that somebody had seen my brother.

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,190
I thought you'd found him.

56
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,280
Jiang Jie's back to Baichuan?

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,500

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,590
Jiang... Jiang Jie...

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,400
Sorry. I got the wrong door.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,150
Chef Jiang, you can reach me anytime.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,400
See you.

62
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,560
I'll wait for your call 7/24.

63
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,520
Please feel free to make requests,

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,840
and we'll offer you way better than others.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,150
Got it. Thank you.

66
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,000
Jiang Jie.

67
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,030
I think I've made it quite clear.

68
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,590
I...

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,150
I'm here for something serious,

70
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,470
very serious.

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
If you have nothing to say,
I'm gonna go sleep.

72
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,310
I'm a little thirsty. Can I get some drink?

73
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,830
There is no clean glass,

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,480
and the disposal cups have been run out of.

75
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,310
In the second layer drawer
of the closet over there.

76
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,950
Jiang Xiu brought me here before,

77
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,870
and I put them there.

78
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,390
You've changed the password,
so I haven't entered this house since then.

79
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,950
I'm here to invite you to Eating at Dusk.

80
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,000
Are you kidding, Chef Li?

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,630
No kidding.

82
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,070
As long as you accept it,

83
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,870
I can promise you whatever you want.

84
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,600
Do you know

85
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,920
how many visitors I've met
within the past two hours

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,390
since I came back?

87
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,430
Ten visitors from ten restaurants

88
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,270
said the same words as you did.

89
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,390
But if you want to challenge,

90
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,120
Eating at Dusk is your best choice.

91
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,480
Hasn't it ever occurred to you that

92
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,120
I came back with the knife
I'd seized from Ge Qunshan?

93
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,430
Then you wouldn't bothered
to deal with the visitors,

94
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,950
because you never do anything unnecessary.

95
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,040
Eating at Dusk is a five-star restaurant.

96
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,430
Besides Li family's knife,

97
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,310
I also have the knives
you've seized before.

98
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,120
With these knives, you can challenge
Jiang family anytime if you want.

99
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,430
I seized your knife just for my master.

100
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,390
Hello.

101
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
It's me, Jiang Jie.

102
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,600
Cao's Fish?

103
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,950
I just got back.

104
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,870
I'm not ready for work right now.

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,630
How about on the weekend?
I'll meet you then.

106
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,560
Even if Cao's Fish
is a five-star restaurant,

107
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
it doesn't have as many knives as I do.

108
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,630
Besides, even if you choose them,

109
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,560
they don't necessarily wanna share
the risk of seizing knives.

110
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,390
Zhao Jingjing is working
at Eating at Dusk, isn't she?

111
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,270
Hasn't she told you that

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,120
only the ones passing the five-star review
are actually five-star restaurants?

113
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,000
You can leave now.

114
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,560
What if I pass the five-star review?

115
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,310
Will you come?

116
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,430
We'll talk about it then.

117
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,270
If I pass the five-star review,

118
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,270
will you come to Eating at Dusk?

119
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,830
If you pass it,

120
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,070
I'll come.

121
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,390
It's a deal.

122
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,160
(You don't want Eating at Dusk
to pass the five-star review?)

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,270
You asked me to vote for Li Nai before,

124
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,800
and I thought you wanted to support her.

125
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,480
Now the three-star restaurants in Baichuan

126
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,800
are almost in the control of you and me.

127
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,480
It's just the five-star restaurants
that prevent us from setting up chains.

128
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,920
My family and the senior reviewers
are seemingly in charge of the Alliance,

129
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,430
but we are actually
restricted by the seven families.

130
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,800
If the seven families disagree,

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,190
we can't even possibly proceed
with the chain plan.

132
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,800
Like Cao Liang,

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,950
I visited seven times
but wasn't able to see him.

134
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,270
After master Cao got a stroke,

135
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,510
Cao Liang bypassed his father
and directly took over Cao's Fish.

136
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,000
Though in his early age,

137
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,600
he is no less sophisticated.

138
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,310
Then why don't we
trade the review results with Li Nai?

139
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,510
Besides Ge family
which has almost disappeared,

140
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,800
Eating at Dusk is the weakest.

141
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,800
Li Nai is Xue Congming's disciple,
and she's also learned from Jiang Jie,

142
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,750
she'll by no means trade with us.

143
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,270
So what's your plan, Mr. Jiang?

144
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,360
Tell me.

145
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,870
Ms. Cui, to seek agreements

146
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,510
is no better than to seize the power
in your own hands.

147
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,360
You mean

148
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,390
- to replace the seven families?
- Yes.

149
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,910
The seven families have been in charge of
the Alliance for nearly 200 years.

150
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,150
They insist it be the essence to pass on
the cooking skills of Head Chefs.

151
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,840
When it comes to chains,
my grandpa would reject it first.

152
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,720
But now of the seven families,

153
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,960
only four families are on business.

154
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
If Eating at Dusk fails to pass the review,

155
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,600
there'll be only three families left,

156
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,600
which will definitely
weaken their credibility.

157
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,630
- Be careful. Hold her.
- Jing.

158
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,270
Can, what are you doing here?

159
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,630
I'll get her. Thank you.

160
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,120
I know you'll drink today,

161
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,550
so I'm coming to pick you up.

162
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,030
It's good to have a brother.

163
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,320
Ms. Cui said
you're doing well in the Alliance,

164
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,840
and helped her a lot.

165
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,720
- It's nothing between brother and sister.
- You're right.

166
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,960
It's easier
to communicate between you two by blood

167
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,440
than fellows taught by the same master,
isn't it?

168
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,854
Yes.

169
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,910
Ms. Cui was so happy today
that she couldn't help drinking more.

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,270
If you are available next time,

171
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,510
you can come over with Ms. Cui.

172
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,870
No problem, Mr. Jiang.

173
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,030
Safe trip.

174
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,790
Bye.

175
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,870
Cui Can is the reviewer
of the Alliance now,

176
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,550
then will it be okay

177
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,910
with the review on Eating at Dusk?

178
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,750
He is not the only one reviewer.

179
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,790
Even if he wants to help Li Nai,

180
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,320
there's nothing he can do.

181
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,510
And Cui Jing cares for her brother so much.

182
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,630
If he really did something wrong,

183
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,480
it'll be easier to control her.

184
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,360
This is the burden

185
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,270
brought by unnecessary kinship.

186
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,120
You hardly drank tonight.

187
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:29,323
I've been a little uncomfortable
in my stomach lately.

188
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,440
Now the only threat is Jiang Jie.

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But what worries me more

190
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,550
is that Cao family and Chai family
unite with him.

191
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,600
As long as Eating at Dusk
fails to pass the review,

192
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,720
it's not gonna work even if they unite.

193
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,510
There is no knife for them to seize,

194
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,030
nor can they pose any threat
to Jiang family.

195
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,150
Now the only chance for Jiang Jie

196
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,440
is to join Eating at Dusk,

197
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,000
but surely it can't pass the review,

198
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,670
nor will he beg Li Nai.

199
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,270
Jing, why did you drink so much?

200
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,200
I'll get it.

201
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,550
What is so important? Be careful.

202
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,390
Please rest assured, Mr. Jiang,

203
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,630
I won't let Eating at Dusk
pass the five-star review.

204
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,030
(Eating at Dusk)
It's all done!

205
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,240
In this five-star review,

206
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,480
how many points can we get?

207
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,270
Regardless of the personal preferences
of the reviewers,

208
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,670
I think we can get 89.

209
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,600
Then to what extent can their
personal preferences influence the result?

210
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,120
Probably between 1 and 89, I guess.

211
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,200
Then let's forget about the things
out of control.

212
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,018
We'll try our best
and leave the rest to God's will.

213
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,360
Let's get to work!

214
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,750
She even defeated Jiang Jie, after all.

215
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,030
Cool.

216
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,750
Any chance that those on table 3
are reviewers?

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,150
Isn't it typical of those
from the Alliance to be bald?

218
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,150
No. He's already paid the bill.

219
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,840
Did we find out too late?

220
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,150
No. It's definitely that table.

221
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,000
They came together
but there was no communication at all.

222
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,870
It's table 1.

223
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,390
She ordered so many dishes alone,

224
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,630
which is way too much for her.

225
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,150
And she took photos for each dish,

226
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,720
and is typing on the phone.

227
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
She must be taking notes.

228
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,720
Li Nai, you said trying our best
and leaving the rest to God's will,

229
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
but you've been looking for reviewers
for three days.

230
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,550
If you keep doing like this,

231
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,840
we can't get even one point.

232
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,440
Hello sir, here is the big table
reserved for you.

233
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,390
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

234
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,320
- Sir, here is the menu.
- I'll handle this.

235
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,200
Sir, here is the menu.

236
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,150
Can, way to go, man!

237
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,320
You've been on new your job for two months.

238
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,120
It's never happened.

239
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,120
Are you doing something confidential?

240
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,870
I haven't heard from you at all
these two months.

241
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,440
Your favorites are on page 3, 5 and 6.

242
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Why are you looking at the menu
made by yourself so carefully?

243
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,000
I want this, this,

244
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,510
and this.

245
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,030
Thank you.

246
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,910
Thank you? Cui Can.

247
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,080
I can be cool with that
you suddenly disappeared,

248
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,870
but what is going on right now?

249
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,600
Have you lost your memory or suffered
from senile dementia like Li Jidong?

250
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,870
- Don't you even serve water in here?
- I...

251
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,080
You stay here for me.

252
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,790
You'd better tell me
you've found the reviewer,

253
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,750
or I'll stir fry Cui Can alive for you!

254
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,669
I did find out the reviewer.

255
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,270
Which one?

256
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
- The one you wanted to stir fry.
- Stir fry?

257
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,120
You mean... Cui Can is the reviewer?

258
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,150
Focus on your food.

259
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,440
Jie, didn't you seize Ge Qunshan's knife?

260
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,790
I did.

261
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,960
Then why'd you work at Eating at Dusk?

262
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,510
Are you so into Li Nai?

263
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,120
Who said I'd work there?

264
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,790
You did.

265
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,080
You said

266
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,750
you'd work at Eating at Dusk
if it passed the review.

267
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,120
Don't tell me you don't know

268
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
Cui Can is the reviewer now.

269
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,000
You're obviously helping Li Nai.

270
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,200
Cui Can may help her,

271
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,870
but will Jiang Xuyang help her?

272
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,720
Can Cui Can alone help Eating at Dusk
pass the review?

273
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,910
So are you gonna open a restaurant again?

274
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,240
Let me be the Sous Chef.

275
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,080
It's not decided yet.

276
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,270
What?

277
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,620
(When I get all things done
in the restaurant, I'll be back!)

278
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,720
Don't forget your stuff.

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,630
Okay.

280
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,080
I mean

281
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,720
don't forget what you've learned

282
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,480
from the chess for so long.

283
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,270
I won't.

284
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,480
A horse crossing a river alone
will probably die.

285
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,960
Li Nai is a good girl.

286
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,510
You can work with her.

287
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,360
I mean I haven't decided yet.

288
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,480
- Why is that look?
- Jie.

289
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,200
You seem to have changed

290
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,910
since you came back this time.

291
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,087
Really?

292
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,150
Actually I haven't decided

293
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,630
what to do next.

294
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,298
Li Nai.

295
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,910
Li Nai.

296
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,790
You are so ruthless!

297
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,720
You actually didn't lose memory, did you?

298
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,720
- It hurts so bad.
- Seriously?

299
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,590
You don't really know you strength, do you?

300
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,920
How is it?

301
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,550
Very hurt. Very very hurt.

302
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,110
I mean my respectable reviewer,

303
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,200
how is the review result?

304
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,110
It should be 93.

305
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,440
With personal preferences?

306
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Fair and square. Li Nai,

307
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,480
you run Eating at Dusk so well.

308
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,720
Then why don't you come back?

309
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,920
Do you wanna rest on our laurels

310
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,590
after we pass the five-star review?

311
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,110
Come on.

312
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,160
I was kidding.
You just do whatever you want.

313
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,270
Li Nai, it's hardly possible

314
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,960
to pass the review.

315
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,110
What is the problem?

316
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,440
It's the Alliance.

317
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,352
Somebody doesn't want you to pass it.

318
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,310
Is it Jiang Xuyang or your sister?

319
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,270
Jingjing told me that
they've been hanging together lately,

320
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,200
and made some big moves.

321
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,720
Actually it's both of them.

322
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,790
What about you? Are you with them?

323
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,270
If you wanna pass the review,

324
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
I can tell you the inside information.

325
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,070
What?

326
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,400
Jiang Xuyang should dare do that?

327
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,790
Then what are we gonna do?

328
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,790
Can we threat him?

329
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,590
You want me to figure out

330
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,270
the relationships
among Jiang family members.

331
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,110
Okay. What about you?

332
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,350
Stop eating. You can't be any fatter.

333
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,750
You have plans?

334
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,440
It's weekend,
and what's more important than the review?

335
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,200
- It's a little hot.
- Yeah.

336
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,790
Shall we go to the supermarket
for grocery shopping at noon?

337
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,240
Okay. We can go supermarket shopping.

338
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,030
- What are you shopping for?
- I'll see later.

339
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,720
Jiang Jie, good morning.

340
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,160
Cao's Fish meets you so early.

341
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,960
Such an employer which requires work
even on Saturday

342
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,110
is definitely not a good one, isn't it?

343
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,750
Excuse me.

344
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,750
Thank you.

345
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,350
Excuse me.

346
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,310
Jiang Jie!

347
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,960
Buying the watermelon?

348
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,750
But they don't taste good in winter.

349
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,480
Jiang Jie!

350
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,200
When did you take to jogging?

351
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,750
It's really mean to have you come here.

352
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,240
Jiang Jie, where are you going?

353
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,160
(Zhao Jingjing)
(My shift now. I won't let you escape.)

354
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,110
It's already 11:00 pm.

355
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,270
He won't go to meet Cao's Fish, I guess.

356
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,720
Finally I can change shifts with Li Nai.

357
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,440
Jiang Jie!

358
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,400
What are you doing downstairs so late?

359
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,070
To throw the rubbish.

360
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,000
Where is the rubbish?

361
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,920
I forgot to take it.

362
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,400
Li Nai,

363
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,790
it's no point

364
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,110
repeating the same thing.

365
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,550
It's okay. I don't care.

366
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
As you like.

367
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,270
Bye.

368
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,680
(Harmony Makes Family Prosperous)

369
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,920
Where is it?

370
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,350
Li Jidong,

371
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,680
what are you looking for?

372
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,880
There it is.

373
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,030
What exactly is it? A family heirloom?

374
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,270
You know nothing!

375
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,200
This is the ring I used to propose
to your mom.

376
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,680
You were different then, weren't you?

377
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,830
Then my mom just accepted it?

378
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,030
Back then I first met her,

379
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,510
when I was having dinner with my buddies,

380
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,070
and she was with her besties

381
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,880
next to us.

382
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,030
I fell for her

383
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,720
at first sight.

384
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,400
But I had nothing to give her,

385
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,510
then I just

386
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,830
took the ring pull tab from the can

387
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,960
and proposed to your mom with it.

388
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,110
You mom just took it.

389
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,160
How naive my mother was then!

390
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,830
It was really a flash marriage.

391
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,440
Your mom just threw it outside right away.

392
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,590
Then I picked it up.

393
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,270
You deserve it.

394
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,510
Then how did you get my mom later?

395
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,160
Chasing her regardless of dignity.

396
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,400
I went to pick her up from work,

397
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,680
and asked her out during her vacation.

398
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
When she got upset,

399
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,590
I would please her.

400
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,720
When she was happy,

401
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,270
I was happy too.

402
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,960
It took me two years

403
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,000
to move your mother.

404
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,590
No.

405
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,510
Li Jidong, you've recalled the past?

406
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,270
Who are you?

407
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,000
Why are you at my place?

408
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,310
(Regardless of dignity.)

409
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,440
(Move him.)

410
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,310
(The Alliance's forum)
This post became hot on the forum,

411
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,790
(Will Chef Jiang join Eating at Dusk?)
but up to now,

412
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,160
Jiang Jie hasn't showed any intention
to join Eating at Dusk.

413
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,270
How is Cui Jing doing with the review?

414
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,200
There were three reviewers,

415
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,030
and only Cui Can gave the highest grade.

416
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,310
As was expected.

417
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,920
It's okay.

418
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,270
After tomorrow, Eating at Dusk
will be excluded from the Alliance.

419
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,070
But Jiang Jie met Cao Liang today.

420
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,110
Just like Li Nai,
he was just floundering around.

421
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,030
Jiang Jie has came back.

422
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,000
Does Jiang Yuanfeng know this?

423
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
No, he doesn't.

424
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,110
Then don't let him know

425
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,510
in case he would act on impulse.

426
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,760
(Jiang Jie and Cao Liang will meet
at Fengxin at 1:00 pm)

427
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,590
Excuse me, do you know where room 607 is?

428
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,640
Okay, thank you.

429
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,830
- What?
- Have you had breakfast?

430
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,076
I've brought you small steamed buns.

431
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,750
I'm not hungry.

432
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,960
Then give me a ride by convenience.

433
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,480
How do you know it's by convenience?

434
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,030
I just know it.

435
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,327
Hands off.

436
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,790
- Shotgun.
- Okay.

437
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,030
Li Nai.

438
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,920
From the back.

439
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
There seems to be something
dug into the back tire.

440
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,880
- Okay.
- Have a check on that.

441
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,590
There's nothing.

442
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,400
Jiang Jie, I haven't got on yet!

443
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,240
Chef Jiang,

444
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,070
I'm not gonna beat around the bush.

445
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,480
Cao's Fish would like to hire you
as the Head Chef.

446
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,640
As long as you come, the five-star
chef's knife of Cao family will be yours.

447
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,110
What's your condition?

448
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,640
I just don't believe

449
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,270
there is a free lunch in the world.

450
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,830
The only condition is that
you can't seize knives any more.

451
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,070
I thought all I have now

452
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,480
is the reputation for seizing knives.

453
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,790
You're being modest, Chef Jiang.

454
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,680
To my knowledge, all the four-star
restaurants have visited you.

455
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,720
In Baichuan, you are a knife
that everyone wanna seize.

456
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,240
So Cao's Fish just wants to bring it back

457
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,680
and set it aside.

458
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,030
You are really brilliant.

459
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:23,440
The reason why
the four-star restaurants want you

460
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,790
is nothing but that they want to upgrade.

461
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,550
But that only drives them
where Cao' Fish is now.

462
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,310
The seven families, including Cao's Fish,
have a long history of 200 years.

463
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,200
What we want is not to create our glory,

464
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,640
but to continue the glory.

465
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,070
Only by stepping on other restaurants

466
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,590
can you continue your glory?

467
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,240
Are you serious, Chef Jiang?

468
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,640
You've seized 24 knives,

469
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,160
leaving them no choice but close business.

470
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,830
Now you're even telling me

471
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,240
you care about the small restaurants?

472
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,440
Seems nothing but two hypocrites.

473
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,310
Cao Liang,

474
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,110
you bypassed your father
and took over Cao's Fish.

475
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,830
I even thought you're unusual.

476
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,880
Now it seems you're nothing
but a young lad.

477
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,480
Your grandpa probably has gone gaga.

478
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,590
Both my family and your family

479
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,550
are among the seven families
of the Alliance in Baichuan,

480
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,510
but this man in front of you

481
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,200
is just an opportunistic mediocre person.

482
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,110
Why are you complimenting him like this?

483
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:26,270
Mr. Jiang, now it's a private meeting
between me and Chef Jiang.

484
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,830
Please leave us alone.

485
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,440
What's so funny?

486
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
An opportunistic mediocre person

487
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,680
is better than an overbearing
good-for-nothing.

488
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,550
What do you mean?

489
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,640
Jiang Jie, I'll teach you a good lesson

490
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,160
for your father.

491
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,680
Who are you?

492
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,880
Li Nai from Eating at Dusk, his boss.

493
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,830
Jiang Jie,

494
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,200
you only deserve to be with such losers,

495
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,510
just like your father.

496
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,030
Yes. I am a loser,

497
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,960
but you are a big potato, Mr. Jiang.

498
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,160
What if you are photographed
and posted on the forum?

499
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,880
You probably don't know

500
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,680
how gossipy

501
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,110
they can be.

502
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,790
They can make a thorough survey

503
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,510
on one's life,

504
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,270
including how he made his brother

505
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,160
bear the blame for him.

506
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,550
Jiang Jie, you told everything to others.

507
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,680
Okay. We'll see!

508
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,030
Stop it!

509
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,240
Wipe it.

510
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,000
When did you become my boss?

511
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,030
Anyway, Eating at Dusk will surely
pass the review.

512
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,510
I just used my power as your boss
in advance.

513
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,790
I just helped you.

514
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,240
Can you promise me something?

515
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,590
As I said before,

516
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,270
I won't join Eating at Dusk

517
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,510
before it passes the review.

518
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,550
What are you thinking of?

519
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,920
I will never take advantage of you.

520
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,790
I just want you to come with me
to buy a coat.

521
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,240
See? My coat got wet.

522
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,750
Li Nai,

523
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,680
aren't you buying a coat?

524
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,160
Why are you buying so much food?

525
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,310
You're right.

526
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,160
I'll stop when I finish this.

527
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,270
Jiang Jie, this is the only one coat
that hasn't been pulled by you.

528
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,960
Should I just have let you be hit?

529
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,160
There it is. Let's go.

530
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,110
Finally.

531
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,720
Fang.

532
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,400
Fang.

533
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,510
- Fang.
- Li Nai.

534
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,000
She is not here.

535
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,960
- Aren't you coming to buy a coat?
- Yes, I am.

536
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,480
Would you help measure me?

537
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,270
Hurry. Are you waiting for me
to digest the pie?

538
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,310
Think about joining Eating at Dusk.

539
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,480
You said you wouldn't take advantage of me.

540
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,880
Just a piece of advice.

541
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,070
Why should I join Eating at Dusk?

542
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,310
Out of sympathy?

543
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,640
Or

544
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,550
you wanna calm down the public opinion

545
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,270
for seizing my knife?

546
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,790
It's because I need your help.

547
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,880
I have a plan,

548
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,920
and only you can help me with that.

549
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,830
Sounds like

550
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,030
I'm quite useful for you.

551
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,720
You do the rest.

552
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,029
I...

553
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,880
I haven't measured you yet.

554
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
I'm taking you here

555
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,400
to make a chef's uniform for you.

556
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,510
Li Nai,

557
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,510
I think you're too naive about the review.

558
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,110
I'm eighty percent certain
about the review.

559
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,960
Once I pass the review,

560
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,270
I'll tell you my plan.

561
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,680
What about you?

562
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,310
When will you tell me your plan?

563
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,480
You left Yu Village,

564
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,110
which meant you must have a new plan.

565
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,400
If I'm not giving you a satisfying answer,

566
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,830
are you gonna strangle me with this?

567
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,720
Nai, you're so early.

568
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,200
Did I interrupt you?

569
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,920
Fang, I'll tell you the size.

570
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,000
- Are you insane?
- Did Jiang Yuanfeng come over?

571
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,400
No. Why?

572
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,630
Jiang Jie,

573
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,320
I'm not kidding.

574
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Did you tell Li Nai your father's story?

575
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,190
It's none of your business.

576
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,590
Now he insisted that

577
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,190
you made this public,
and he also said Li Nai had threatened him.

578
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,920
What? Is he scared?

579
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,280
Don't you know how crazy he is?

580
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,630
Jiang Jie, you told everything to others.

581
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,840
Okay. We'll see!

582
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,280
What do you mean?

583
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,280
Stay away from him.

584
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,000
Jiang Xuyang!
