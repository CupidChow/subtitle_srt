What's wrong?

22
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,590
Jie.

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,680
Can you push me?

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,400
Sure.

25
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,740
(You're flying.)

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,040
(Isn't this fun?)

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,960
(You're flying.)

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,750
Flying, you're flying.

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,800
You're flying.

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,120
- Isn't this fun, Xiu?
- It's fun.

31
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,150
You're flying.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,280
Jie.

33
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,280
I was supposed to stay with you
at the welfare center

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,870
and go abroad together,

35
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,750
but I didn't.

36
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,590
For the sake of living,

37
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,470
I stayed in the Jiang family.

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,960
I lived alone,
cautious of their expressions

39
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,910
and learned how to cook.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,750
I was just another chess piece.

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,280
Jie,

42
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,360
I feel like

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
I've failed at life.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,870
Xiu.

45
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,190
Do you know

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,080
that when I first arrived
at the welfare center,

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,470
I wasn't talkative,

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
so I ended up being bullied.

49
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,150
Later, Uncle Zheng found me.

50
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,960
After we left Baichuan,

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,590
he taught me to cook.

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,870
My first dish was

53
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,750
stir-fried vegetables but it was all burnt.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,560
I even scalded the back of my hands.

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,560
After that,

56
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,190
I studied abroad when I turned 18.

57
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,310
I didn't have the money
for cooking classes,

58
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,800
so I could only help out at restaurants.

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,470
Of course, I got bullied.

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,030
Things like getting tripped,

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,560
getting splashed with dirty water,

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,470
or being forced to wash dishes
with iced water

63
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,680
because it was some special tableware.

64
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,470
But it didn't matter.

65
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Later, I became the Chef's assistant.

66
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,560
I found ways

67
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,910
to force those who bullied me
out of the way.

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,400
But these were nothing.

69
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,120
In the last 18 years,

70
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,030
the hardest thing was

71
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,680
thinking about mom and dad every day,

72
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,870
and being worried about you all day.

73
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,870
Jie, I'm sorry I couldn't
be there with you.

74
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,190
I couldn't even help you.

75
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,480
I should be the one to say I'm sorry.

76
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,160
Who am I to decide
that you have to live a peaceful life?

77
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,830
Who am I

78
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,800
to decide that I need

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,510
to avenge mom and dad alone?

80
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,070
Who am I to never consider

81
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,510
your desire to help me in this matter?

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,950
Xiu,

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
from today onward,

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,240
you have the power

85
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,750
to make decisions for yourself.

86
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,390
Just do whatever you wanna do.

87
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,480
And

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
let me tell you a secret.

89
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,270
Tomorrow,

90
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,950
Eating at Dusk will announce
that it is challenging Xijiangyue.

91
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,040
Actually, I had expected it.

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm actually quite scared.

93
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm scared of losing,

94
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,240
but I'm more scared of winning.

95
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,070
I told you before.

96
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,720
You have the power to decide now.

97
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,120
You have the right
to represent Xijiangyue in the contest,

98
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,510
or come back to my side.

99
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,430
Don't forget.

100
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,310
You are the rising star and genius
of the culinary world.

101
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,240
You are a genius
who will never let yourself down.

102
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,830
I won't give up.

103
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,510
Because I said

104
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,310
that your opponent can only be me.

105
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
This way,

106
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,390
no one can step over me

107
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
and hurt you.

108
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,310
Don't tell anyone what happened.

109
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,510
It's embarrassing.

110
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,560
Jiang Xiu was crying here.

111
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,830
Let's go.

112
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,630
Let's go home. It'll be fine.

113
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:39,950
(Jiang's Residence)

114
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,360
(The Knife-seizure Contest is coming soon.)

115
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,270
(Knife-seizure Contest)
(With the Jiang family in trouble,)

116
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,430
(can this genius girl uphold
the final dignity of her family?)

117
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,510
(Is the genius girl Chef truly skilled
or is it just hype?)

118
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,040
(If Jiang Xiu loses to Li Nai,)

119
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,750
(the reputation of the Jiang family
over the years)

120
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,310
(would be doomed this time.)

121
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:17,359
(The record of championship matches)

122
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,920
Since the founding of the seven families,
there have only been five championship matches.

123
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,360
And all five ended in failure.

124
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,070
A championship match is
different from a contest.

125
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,480
A contest focuses on
the chef's signature dish

126
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,310
but in a championship match,

127
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,720
you are free to choose

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,720
from the ingredients
prepared by the Alliance

129
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,950
to make your dish.

130
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,190
So, it's completely dependent
on a chef's individual skills.

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,920
At the match's core,

132
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,750
it tests the chef's highest standard.

133
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,830
Everyone in the Jiang family is a genius.

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,920
Your genes are so good.

135
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,310
To be able to become the Head Chef,

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
she gotta be.

137
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,800
There is still a small gap

138
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,480
between you and Jiang Xiu,

139
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,750
but I will train you
in the strictest way possible.

140
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,920
Come on, let's get familiar
with the previous matches.

141
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,510
Look at this match.

142
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,510
In the 26th year of
Emperor Guangxu's reign...

143
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,030
- What's wrong?
- Have you forgotten something?

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,240
Before the match with Xijiangyue,

145
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,240
there is a match between us.

146
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,910
I...

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,150
The result of the previous
knife-seizure contest

148
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,270
doesn't count, right?

149
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,360
Li Nai.

150
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,080
That contest...

151
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,960
Okay.

152
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,790
We'll have a rematch.

153
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
Go-kart?

154
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,910
This is really your style.

155
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,720
Don't take this lightly.

156
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,000
You beat me in cooking,
but maybe not this time.

157
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,790
Don't worry, I'm going all out.

158
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,750
Good.

159
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,083
(International Kart Track)

160
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,080
Li Nai.

161
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,750
Are you okay?

162
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,750
I'm fine. This is a match, go back.

163
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,630
I'll get mad if you go easy on me.

164
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,910
I'll get your kart back in position.

165
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
Jiang Jie wins.

166
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
(Xijiangyue
Certified by Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan)

167
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,840
Chef Zhao, everyone online said
our Head Chef is gonna go easy on them.

168
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,360
It's her brother, after all.

169
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,320
Chef Zhao,

170
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,840
- we won't close down, right?
- Yeah.

171
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,360
What nonsense. Don't listen to rumors.

172
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
No one informed me
that we're closed today.

173
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,550
We're open.

174
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,080
Why is everyone

175
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,030
standing around like a broken puppet?

176
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,720
Go, do your work.

177
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,720
Chef, about that match...

178
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
From today on,

179
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,790
I will start preparing
for the match with Eating at Dusk.

180
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,630
My opponent is not easy.

181
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,870
So, I'm going to give it
everything I've got.

182
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,840
Understand?

183
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,080
Understood.

184
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,270
Do you need an assistant?

185
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,960
Do you know what they call me?

186
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,030
Genius girl.

187
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,510
Are you trying to find someone
to hold me back?

188
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,480
Get back to work.

189
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Yes, Chef.

190
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,780
(List of Ingredients)

191
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,790
Did we just have a meal?

192
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,320
Nai, I'm hungry.

193
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,390
I'll cook something for you later.

194
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,870
Li Nai, go sleep in your room.

195
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,200
Go to bed. Don't catch a cold.

196
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,750
Stop.

197
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,200
It hurts.

198
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,720
(Xijiangyue)
Xiu.

199
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,030
Do you always follow your nose?

200
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,870
Why are you so nosy?

201
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,630
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,600
Don't say sorry.

203
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,150
Cui Can,

204
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,000
you didn't do anything to be sorry about.

205
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,790
I made you unhappy.

206
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,150
I am wrong for that.

207
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,390
Cui Can.

208
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,600
Actually,

209
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,910
I can feel it when others treat me well.

210
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,670
I know you've done a lot of things for me.

211
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,600
But

212
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,240
we're not suitable for each other.

213
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,600
Why not?

214
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,150
Because I cannot accept it

215
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,790
when others suddenly disappear.

216
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,790
I don't want to keep guessing

217
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,240
what others are thinking.

218
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,480
I don't want to be lied to,

219
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,360
be rejected,

220
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,320
or be kept in the dark.

221
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,510
I also don't want anyone to tell me

222
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,750
that it's all for my own good,

223
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,840
and then leave me all alone.

224
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,030
That's why we're not suitable
for each other.

225
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,840
Cui Can,

226
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,080
we should never meet again.

227
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Jiang Xiu,

228
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,550
let's get married.

229
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,320
Xiu,

230
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,030
let's register our marriage
tomorrow morning.

231
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,240
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,750
I've made you suffer all this time.

233
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,390
From today onward,

234
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,320
I'll never leave you alone,

235
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,630
keep anything from you,

236
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,320
or leave you behind.

237
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,030
I want to start a new family with you.

238
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,910
Will you be willing to?

239
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,350
Who would hide
the household register in the office?

240
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,440
Did she marry her job?

241
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,220

00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,440
It's auspicious.

250
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,030
My mother prepared the banquet.

251
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,030
I invited a lot of people to our wedding.

252
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,510
I'm sure they'll bless us.

253
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,440
Jing, let me out.

254
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,510
Cui Jing,

255
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,350
you're violating my freedom.

256
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,750
You're committing a crime, Cui Jing.

257
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,310
Jing, you cannot get married
to Jiang Xuyang.

258
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
How is it?

259
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,030
It's no good.

260
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,830
It's really no good.

261
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,880
I really can't come up with a new recipe.

262
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,640
We've already tried so many.

263
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,550
Don't worry. I'll think with you.

(Date; Item; Income; Expense; Balance)

265
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,750
If this continues,

266
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,240
will I be broke
before the match even starts?

267
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Nai, eat meat and grow taller.

268
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,510
Oh, dear. Grow taller.

269
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,400
Li Jidong.

270
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,350
Li Jidong, these aren't toys.
They're expensive.

271
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,160
Nai, eat meat and grow taller.

272
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,440
Nai is tall enough.

273
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,640
Go away, don't disturb me.

274
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,070

276

Uncle Li, come here.

277
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,680
Did you forget
that Li Nai had her lunch at school?

278
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,160
- She ate?
- Yeah.

279
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,160
She just told you
when she came back from school.

280
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,680
Go outside. I'll take care of this.

281
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,750
Go on.

282
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,640

Let me show you my treasure.

284
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,000
- Treasure?
- Come, come.

285
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,510
I'm telling you.

286
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,880
I hid all my valuables in here.

287
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,640
Look.

288
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,000
I got it.

289
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,440
I'm telling you.

290
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,240
This mirror is magical.

291
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,350
Look into this mirror.

292
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,750
It can show us
what Nai will look like as an adult.

293
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,920
Look, look.

294
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:11,030
Look.

295
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,510
Nai,

296
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,070
what happened today?

297
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,440
Are you unhappy?

298
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,750
Nai, look.

299
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,350
How about Daddy buy you a candied fruit?

300
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,400
No.

301
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,270
Then,

302
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,440
how about a cotton candy?

303
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,160
Li Jidong, when will I become an adult?

304
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,480
Why are you in a rush to be an adult?

305
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,160
Because someone said I don't have a mommy.

306
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm really angry

307
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,550
but I cannot beat them up.

308
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,270
Nai,

309
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,480
I'll make Dongpo pork tonight.

310
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,400
After you eat meat, you'll grow taller.

311
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,000
Then, you can punch one person
with one fist.

312
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,160
I gotta eat more.
I wanna punch three persons with one fist.

313
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Good, three persons it is.

314
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,480
Let Daddy fish some up.

315
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,030
Are there any fish over there?

316
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,200
Li Jidong,

317
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,790
Nai said she wants to become an adult.

318
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,830
I told you, didn't I?

319
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,880
Nai wants to eat meat and grow taller.

320
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,160
Grow taller.

321
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,000
I'll help you.

322
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,550
I'm coming to help, too.

323
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,750
(Marriage Contract)
I confiscated his phone immediately.

324
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,240
Don't worry. I checked his chat history.

325
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,590
He hadn't sent to anyone yet.

326
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,270
Ms. Cui,

327
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,750
I always have complete faith

328
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,000
in our cooperation,

329
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,160
but it was your brother

330
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,900
who leaked information
about the chain restaurants,

331
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,240
which led to Li Nai
selling me out to my grandpa

332
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,960
and got his help
to pass the five-star review.

333
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,640
I'm sorry, I was negligent in my work.

334
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,750
There is no problem

335
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,000
with your working attitude.

336
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,480
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to manage
such a huge corporation alone.

337
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,000
However, I think

338
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,480
you act emotionally sometimes.

339
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,920
I only have one brother.

340
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,960
I didn't mean for you
to hurt your own brother.

341
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,440
I believe

342
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,830
one begets another.

343
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,440
Before the match ends,

344
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,240
I don't want any so-called

345
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,880
family members

346
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,960
to cause trouble for us.

347
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,070
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him.

348
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,480
I won't let him out before the match ends.

349
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,070
Good.

350
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,510
As long as there are no new problems,

351
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,880
our cooperation will
ensure Xijiangyue's victory.

352
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,400
The chain restaurant business in Baichuan
will only get better.

353
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,440
You added dried bamboo shoots?

354
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,880
I don't think it's a good idea.

355
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,310
What's wrong?

356
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,240
Would it be too arrogant

357
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,270
to think that you can win this?

358
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,720
Jingjing, you scared me.

359
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,830
Li Nai, you seem to have
unlocked your potential

360
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,880
ever since that beef soup with radish.

361
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,070
My master said I need
to cook with emotions.

362
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,200
We still have time
and room for improvement.

363
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,790
We should not underestimate
our opponent, after all.

364
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,750
Are you going to try the dishes
at the diner or go home?

365
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,590
I'll stay here with you.

366
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,830
Come on, then.

367
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
It's my master.

- What are you doing here?
- Terrible news.

370
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,160
What's wrong, Mr. Ge?

371
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,270
I'm glad you're all here.

Master,

375
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,510
why did Cui Can send you this document?

376
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,350
I don't know.

377
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,920
I was helping Mr. Li move his flowers,

378
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,510
then this kid suddenly sent me this.

379
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,590
And then, he wouldn't reply.

380
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,640
He wouldn't answer my call.

381
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,510
I thought something felt off,
so I came to find you.

382
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,640
This document can only be kept by
Cui Jing and Jiang Xuyang.

383
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,160
Cui Can must have been caught,

384
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,880
so he quickly sent it to a random person.

385
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,590
Cui Jing is Cui Can's sister,

386
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,750
she wouldn't hurt him

387
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,590
but this document involves another person.

388
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,590
It's Jiang Xuyang.

What do we do?

390
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,000
- He went to steal the household register.
- Steal the register?

391
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,750
His sister must have
locked him up at home.

392
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,000
We're running out of time.
Let's go save him.

394
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,640
- Master, too dangerous. Stay out of this.
- Be careful.

Come in, Master.

396
