Jiang Jie,

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,560
happy new year.

22
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,070
Happy new year.

23
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:18,840
Li Nai.

24
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,310
Stop playing with your phone
and go to bed.

25
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,710
Good night.

26
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,150
Good night.

27
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,960
Xiu.

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,080
Why are you sitting there?

29
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,150
You're awake?

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,470
It's late.

31
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's go home.

32
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,000
No.

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,470
I don't wanna go home.

34
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
That place

35
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,840
isn't my home.

36
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,360
Okay.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,750
We won't go back.

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,750
But can you get down first?

39
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,087
Here.

40
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,870
You...

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Do you like me?

42
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,830
What are you doing?

43
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,240
Let's pack everything up,
and we can leave.

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
Didn't you say we ran out of gas?

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,720
I found the oil container in the trunk

46
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,160
where the spare tire is stored.

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
I missed it yesterday.

48
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,390
Come on, let's pack up.

49
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,680
This is for you.

50
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,720
What kinda flower is this?

51
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,950
I dunno.

52
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,510
It looked pretty,
so I picked them yesterday.

53
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,720
Just take it.

54
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,240
Why are you giving me flowers
out of the blue?

55
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,600
Isn't Uncle Li
learning Chinese art recently?

56
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,789
Let him practice with these.

57
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,480
After Jiang Jie took Li Nai
away last night,

58
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,560
he didn't go home.

59
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,240
They didn't show up
at Chuncheng today either.

60
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,270
Li Nai?

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,630
Xue Congming's disciple?

62
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
This is interesting.

63
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,600
Then, keep an eye on them.

64
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,560
Sorry to trouble you.

65
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,830
Okay.

66
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,220
(Eating at Dusk)

67
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,360
Hello.

68
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,630
Miss,

69
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,240
do you serve Western food?

70
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,070
We don't.

71
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,390
Well, thank you.

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,480
Most Western restaurants
should be closed by now.

73
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,630
Yes, I asked quite a few restaurants.

74
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,430
I saw that you're still open,
so I came over to ask.

75
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,160
Today is my daughter's birthday.

76
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,000
She never had Western food.

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,950
This is my fault.

78
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,360
I was so busy,
I didn't keep track of the time.

79
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,830
We don't serve Western food

80
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,950
but we serve a new type of
Western-style Chinese food.

81
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,120
Would you like to try?

82
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,830
Is it expensive?

83
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,240
You are our first customer.

84
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,920
It's free.

85
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,950
She made these look so lovely.

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,950
Here you go.

87
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,190
Enjoy your meal.

88
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,800
I'll go get your dessert.

89
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,070
Sure, okay.

90
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,927
Here.

91
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,560
Mom, have this too.

92
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,950
It's delicious.

93
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,310
This is better than the Western food
my classmate mentioned.

94
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,430
Later, you must thank her.

95
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,070
She is a skilled cook.

96
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,430
Here are your desserts.

97
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Thank you.

98
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,120
You're welcome.

99
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,430
I hope you enjoyed them.

100
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,120
Miss, your cooking
is the best I've ever had.

101
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,160
Enjoy your meal.

102
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,630
Sure.

103
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Thank you very much.

104
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,240
No problem.

105
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:18,950
Come.

106
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,430
Say goodbye to her.

107
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,240
Goodbye.

108
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,750
Bye-bye. Take care.

109
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,920
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

110
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,310
Mom, wait for me.

111
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,310
Miss.

112
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,070
What is it, Zhouzhou?

113
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,120
Do you have any flyers?

114
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,120
My mom can help
promote your restaurant tomorrow

115
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,240
when she's open for business.

116
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,150
Sure. Thank you, Zhouzhou.
Happy birthday.

117
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,630
You're welcome.
I made a wish just now.

118
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,720
I wanna become an amazing chef like you
when I grow up.

119
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,150
Let's go.

120
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,600
Why did you come
to the restaurant this late?

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,150
Aren't you here too?

122
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,840
It's normal to be at my own restaurant.

123
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,080
That's not important.

124
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,840
Jiang Jie,

125
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,360
I'm really, really, really,

126
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,240
really happy right now.

127
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,840
What made you so happy?

128
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,390
Because

129
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,550
you're worth every penny.

130
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,000
That's very flattering.

131
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
A new batch of ingredients arrived.

132
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,150
Wanna try them?

133
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:53,934
Yeah.

134
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,870
Let's eat.

135
00:09:59,352 --> 00:09:59,861
Okay.

136
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,200
We'll eat at the coffee table.

137
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,390
Don't just stand there.
Help me serve these.

138
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,200
Chef, please sit inside.

139
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,390
I usually like to sit in this spot.

140
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,630
Can't you

141
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,360
be gentler?

142
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,630
Be glad I didn't step on you.

143
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,150
Here.

144
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,120
Try it.

145
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,120
What do you think?

146
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,080
Delicious.

147
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,200
Go on, then.

148
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,150
You have some, too.

149
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,670
Were you laughing at me?

150
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,360
No.

151
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,390
You were laughing.

152
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,790
You saw wrong.

153
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,030
As thanks for this crab,
I'll pretend you didn't.

154
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,630
Thanks for the treat, Chef.

155
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,510
You're welcome.

156
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,630
I'll go get you water.

157
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,240
The wine is in the room's wine cabinet.

158
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,030
I never learn my lesson.

159
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,840
It's only been a month and a half

160
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,750
since you seized my master's knife.

161
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,510
Li Nai,

162
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,910
I...

163
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,550
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,790
I should have known you were like this.

165
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,550
Don't you wanna know

166
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,200
why I challenged your master?

167
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,000
Come with me.

168
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,550
Why did you bring me here?

169
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,390
Noodle Shop of Xue's Apprentice.

170
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,630
I remember the Chefs' Alliance forced it

171
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,360
to close down within a day.

172
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,630
What do you want to say?

173
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,960
Back then,

174
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,120
my dad loved cooking.

175
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,200
Despite being told that he had no talent
and that his cooking was mediocre,

176
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,840
he loved cooking so much
that he wanted to open his own restaurant.

177
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,510
After he was expelled from the house,

178
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,150
he opened up a restaurant of his own.

179
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,960
What happened next?

180
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,120
It closed down, of course.

181
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,630
Others believed that he was expelled
from the Jiang family

182
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,030
for being unfilial,

183
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,390
so he was judged to be unqualified
for the one-star review.

184
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,320
And the person who made that judgment
was my dad's best friend,

185
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,360
Zhong Haiyang.

186
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,600
- But that's the rules.
- Rules?

187
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,120
Who made them?

188
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,480
Are they the high-and-mighty seven families
who boast a century of heritage?

189
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,600
My master has never
had the authority of the seven families.

190
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,360
But he had at least enjoyed the benefits.

191
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,150
Selfless,

192
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,510
kind,

193
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,080
and loyal.

194
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,510
These are the things people say
about your master.

195
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,510
But that year, after my dad...

196
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,320
After my dad passed away,

197
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,960
Jiang Xiu and I were about to be sent
to the welfare center.

198
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,600
I knelt right there.

199
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,120
I begged him to adopt Jiang Xiu

200
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
but he refused me.

201
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,120
(He feared offending the seven families)

202
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,510
(and the Jiang family.)

203
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,790
Impossible.

204
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,360
In any case,

205
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,030
you shouldn't use others' efforts

206
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,480
to challenge the authority
of the seven families.

207
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,630
Is it their effort
if they can't defend it themselves?

208
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,574
Li Nai,

209
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,080
do you think

210
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,750
there is a fairer way to challenge them

211
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,600
than seizing their knives?

212
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,550
Someday,

213
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,030
I will also challenge you.

214
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,200
Okay.

215
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,670
I'll be waiting.

216
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,550
Li Nai.

217
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,870
Do we have customers?

218
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Make a call for me.

219
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,510
My phone has shut down.

220
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,400
If you aren't receiving any calls,

221
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
it means she doesn't intend
to call you at all.

222
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,160
No.

223
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,880
She must be busy.

224
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,920
Yes.

225
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,880
Do you think I'm not busy?

226
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,030
We don't have customers, anyway.

227
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,240
Welcome.

228
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,030
- Are you here to dine in?
- Yes.

229
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,270
- Table for two?
- Yes.

230
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,550
Come on in.

231
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,240
We have customers.

232
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,460
Over here.

233
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,510
Please have a seat.

234
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,400
Is Jiang Jie up to something?

235
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,270
Your restaurant is really hard to find.

236
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,640
I thought Zhouzhou's mom
was joking with my mom.

237
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,510
Did she recommend our place to you?

238
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,750
Yes. We're regulars at her store.

239
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,590
She highly recommended your restaurant.

240
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,590
We got curious,
so we came to check you out.

241
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,270
- Don't worry, we won't disappoint you.
- Okay.

242
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,510
Welcome.

243
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,310
Is this "Eating at Dusk"?

244
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,640
- Yes, yes.
- I'll serve them.

245
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,310
This way, please.

246
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,400
- Hurry up, Li Nai.
- Okay.

247
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,700
(We're sold out for the day.
Closed early)

248
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,400
Where is Li Nai?

249
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,750
She is on leave.

250
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,550
- From whom did she request it?
- From you.

251
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,550
She said she sent you a text message.

252
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,720
I never check my texts.

253
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,510
Besides, I haven't approved it.

254
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,640
Who uses texts nowadays?

255
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:00,101
(Chef, I need the day off today)
She wasn't hoping you'd approve it anyway.

256
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
I'll refill the soy sauce.

257
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,510
(Make way, make way.)

258
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,640
(This patient here needs
to go to the ER. Make way.)

259
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,960
(Make way.)

260
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,270
Are you at the hospital?

261
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,310
Yeah, I accompanied Li Jidong
to the hospital.

262
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,920
Are you looking for me?

263
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,510
Chef?

264
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,830
Is Uncle Li okay?

265
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,030
He's fine. He came here for a checkup.

266
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,440
Number 26, Li Jidong.

267
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,830
(Are you here?)

268
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,110
(Here, here.)

269
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,790
(Chef,)

270
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,550
it's our turn now. I'm hanging up.

271
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,830
Have you hung up?

272
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,030
I have.

273
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,070
Li Nai,

274
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,720
I didn't expect you

275
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,550
to open up a restaurant
behind Jiang Jie's back.

276
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,920
Just between us,

277
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,920
this sort of secret operation
is quite exciting.

278
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,440
If you're doing something like this again,

279
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
you'd better count me in.

280
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,750
Don't bring that up.
When you were talking to him,

281
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,200
- I thought you spilled the beans.
- Spill what beans?

282
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
How many times
have I watched Spy x Family?

283
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,440
Okay, back to business.

284
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,480
What should I do?

285
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,110
You came to me

286
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,030
because your income and expenses

287
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,790
aren't reaching a break even level, right?

288
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,070
That's very normal.

289
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,440
It's because you're completely
influenced by Jiang Jie.

290
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,550
Other things aside,

291
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,070
Jiang Jie is nitpicky
about the quality of his ingredients.

292
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,070
You are subconsciously influenced by him.

293
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,070
So, when you pick your ingredients,

294
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,310
you followed the standards for Chuncheng.

295
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,350
But mine is just
a newly opened small diner.

296
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,270
What I can do now is
to reduce the cost of ingredients

297
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,270
or raise the price of the food.

298
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,000
Stop. Increasing the price of the food

299
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,640
is gonna backfire on a small diner.

300
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,350
Did you come to me

301
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,030
to supply you with cheaper ingredients?

302
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,750
I wish I could help you.

303
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,640
Zhong's shop may be small,

304
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,480
the ingredients he supplies

305
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
are not cheap.

306
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,440
Have you spoken to your master?

307
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,110
Xue's Noodles has been opened for years,

308
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,720
it should have its own suppliers.

309
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,750
I'm still far from challenging anyone.

310
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,400
So, I don't wanna trouble my master.

311
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,720
Forget it.

312
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,270
I'd better contact other suppliers.

313
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,480
Wait.

314
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,640
It's not often I get to see
Jiang Jie being defeated.

315
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,070
I will definitely regret it

316
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,400
if I don't get involved.

317
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,240
Actually, there is another way

318
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,960
to ensure the quality of your ingredients

319
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,480
and cut your cost by more than half.

320
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,350
What is it?

321
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,920
You only need to look for one person.

322
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,790
Who is it?

323
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,310
(Some restaurants are
similar to the old Zhaoyeqing.)

324
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,750
(They purchase
the highest quality ingredients)

325
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,510
but there is actually an optimal
freshness period to use them

326
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,200
before its expiration date.

327
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,680
(High-end restaurants
will get rid of ingredients)

328
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,750
(that have reached
their peak freshness)

329
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,510
(but have not yet expired or spoiled.)

330
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:53,090
Hello.

331
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,440
Are you Chef Li?

332
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,550
Nice to meet you.

333
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,070
- I'm Li Nai.
- Nice to meet you.

334
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,510
I'm Jiang Xuyang from Xijiangyue.

335
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,030
Xijiangyue?

336
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,750
So, you and Jiang...

337
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,350
Jiang Xiu are...

338
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,030
Xiu?

339
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,160
Xiu is my younger sister.

340
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Do you know Xiu, Chef Li?

341
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,240
No, no. I've only heard of her.

342
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,880
- Please come inside.
- Sure. After you.

343
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,110
Please enjoy your meal.

344
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,640
Chef Li,

345
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,270
come sit with me.

346
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,790
Sure.

347
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,830
I heard you would like
to purchase batches of ingredients

348
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,960
that are past their peak freshness
from us.

349
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,480
- Yes.
- At Xijiangyue,

350
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,830
we value environmental protection
and the quality of ingredients.

351
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,574
That's why we place
great importance on ingredients

352
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,070
that are close to their expiration date.

353
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,400
Truth is, when I heard from Chef Zhao

354
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
that you want to purchase our ingredients,

355
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,640
I was really surprised.

356
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,350
Don't misunderstand. I only hope

357
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,240
that everyone
who purchases our ingredients

358
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,720
can properly bring out their potential.

359
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,270
After all, every ingredient
shouldn't go to waste.

360
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,160
Am I right?

361
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,030
Don't worry.

362
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,720
Although my cooking skills
are not outstanding

363
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,830
and this diner is not famous,

364
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,110
I promise you

365
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,310
that I will value each ingredient.

366
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,070
Okay.

367
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,480
I trust you.

368
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,070
I got the answers I wanted
from your dishes.

369
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,070
However...

370
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,110
Is there a problem?

371
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,750
I believe partnership

372
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,480
is a process
where both parties test each other.

373
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,310
I wonder if I may invite you

374
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,110
to Xijiangyue

375
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,160
to inspect

376
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,920
our ingredients on site.

377
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,680
May I?

378
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,510
Of course.

379
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,640
It's your right to do so.

380
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,030
Thank you.

381
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,030
Are you cold, Chef Li?

382
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,510
Should I turn up the air-conditioning?

383
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,030
No, it's fine.

384
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,790
I saw someone I know.

385
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,790
Do you mind if I get down and say hello?

386
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,070
Sure, no problem.

387
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,110
I'm quite free today.

388
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,270
He is very different from Jiang Jie.

389
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,260
(Lake Hill Yuntai Garden)

390
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,400
What a coincidence.

391
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,710
(Fire Exit;
Do Not Block The Way)

392
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:37,367
Li Nai.

393
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,480
What are you doing?

394
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,720
Wait for me.

395
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,680
Are you okay?

396
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,440
Why were you hiding there?

397
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,110
I remember
there is a good spice over there,

398
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,030
so I came to have a look.

399
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,270
Spice?

400
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,110
This isn't really good.

401
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,480
My leg hurts so much.
Quick, help me inside.

402
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,070
Walk slower.

403
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,830
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Very.

404
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,830
Let's find a place to sit down.

405
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,920
(Let's talk about a partnership next time.)

406
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,590

Or...

432
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,830
He's not inside.

433
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,590
Chef, what are you doing here?

434
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,298
To pick you up.

435
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,160
I'm fine. Look.

436
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,920
Besides, I fell down myself.

437
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,400
Don't feel bad about it, Chef.

438
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,200
It's fine, okay?

439
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,960
Get in.

440
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,510
Are you two dating?

441
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,640
Lunch time is over

442
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,790
but he is still here.

443
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Isn't he waiting for you?

444
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,310
We're not dating.

445
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,550
It's the unusual reaction of a cunning fox

446
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,110
being crushed by a rock
called moral standards

447
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,400
after it hurt a young girl.

448
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,030
This dish needs to be simmered
for an hour.

449
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,030
Are you going to stand here for an hour?

450
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,750
This is the last dish.

451
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,550
Just keeping an eye on it
won't make it delicious.

452
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,880
I'll do it.

453
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,790
Why are you still standing here?
Go and sit down.

454
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,960
What do you think of the Chef?

455
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,000
He is infuriatingly outstanding,

456
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,000
has lots of experience,

457
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,720
and is accurate as a robot when matching
ingredients and their cooking time.

458
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
What about

459
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,680
as a man who might like you?

460
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Did you sprain it again?

461
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,750
No, no.

462
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,310
Don't tell me horror stories.

463
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,960
What is it?

464
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,440
Li Nai?

465
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,680
We're here.

466
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,830
I'll send you upstairs.

467
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,920
No need.

468
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,070
I'll be going now.

469
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,440
- Are you sure?
- Yes, no need.

470
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,440
You're here, Chef Li.

471
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,160
What happened to you?
Are you hurt?

472
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,030
I'm sorry about yesterday, Mr. Jiang.

473
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,720
You don't have to force yourself.

474
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,310
It's okay to come by
after you've recovered.

475
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,720
I'm really okay.

476
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,550
I'm very healthy.

477
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
So, shall we take a look
at the ingredients?

478
00:31:31,614 --> 00:31:32,160
Okay.

479
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,440
- Come with me.
- Okay.

480
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,440
Mr. Jiang is here.

481
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,440
- Jiang Xuyang?
- Yes, Chef.

482
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,680
It seems he brought a business partner
to check the ingredients.

483
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,550
Chef set is ready.

484
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,070
I'll leave the other dishes to you.

485
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,720
Okay.

486
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,240
No wonder Xijiangyue is this.

487
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
The quality
of your ingredients is excellent.

488
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,790
Even if they're close to expiring,

489
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,310
their quality is much better
than other restaurants.

490
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,200
It's worthy of a five-star restaurant.

491
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,640
Mr. Jiang,

492
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,790
are you really willing

493
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,830
to resell these ingredients
to my unknown diner?

494
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,200
I told you before

495
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,200
that I found the answer I wanted

496
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,640
in your dishes, Chef Li.

497
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,680
I think you shouldn't be so modest.

498
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,110
I think Eating at Dusk

499
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,550
is comparable to the seven families.

500
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,790
Perhaps, it just needs
a little bit more time.

501
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,200
I hope you're right.

502
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,830
I only speak the truth.

503
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,960
Eating at Dusk?

504
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,720
Is that what you and Cui Can
have been plotting every day?

505
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,960
Xiu, why are you here?

506
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,000
What's wrong?

507
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,680
Don't you know that you will bump into me

508
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,510
if you come to buy ingredients
from Xijiangyue?

509
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,830
I'm here because I'm willing
to take the risks.

510
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,790
How tough.

511
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,510
Say,

512
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,350
how would my brother feel
if he finds out that his assistant

513
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,880
secretly opened up a diner outside?

514
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,110
I can't hide it from him forever.

515
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,270
But you don't look all that relaxed.

516
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,680
Don't worry.

517
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,000
I won't tell my brother about this

518
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,590
because I look forward to the day
he finds out himself.

519
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,920
That way, Jiang Jie will understand

520
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,830
that the only person
he can trust in this world

521
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,880
is only me.

522
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,590
I'm sorry, Chef Li.

523
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,310
She has always been like this.

524
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,160
Please forgive her.

525
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,200
Did something happen

526
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,830
between you and Jiang Jie?

527
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,270
My relationship with Jiang Jie
is a bit complicated.

528
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,680
So, can you

529
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,840
keep it a secret

530
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,030
that I opened Eating at Dusk?

531
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,030
This is your private matter.

532
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,630
By right, I shouldn't have asked

533
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,760
but Jiang Jie is my younger brother.

534
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,760
I hope you won't hurt him.

535
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,440
I just want to get something back.
