(Zhaoyeqing)
Master.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,960
You care so much about Jingjing,

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,840
why don't you tell her the truth?

33
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,080
What truth?

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,240
That I didn't leave the country with them

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,400
for Zhaoyeqing,

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,470
- but for her and her mother.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
If you were Jingjing,

38
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,840
would you believe it?

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,030
But it's the truth.

40
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,310
It was because of your wife, Master.

41
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,470
She doesn't want to take it over.

42
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,120
That's why you did.

43
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,870
- She doesn't need to know this.
- Master.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you like the way things are going today?

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,280
Jingjing has talent,

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,430
but she's a bit arrogant.

47
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,910
For Jingjing,

48
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,520
Jiang Jie is like a perfect whetstone.

49
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,800
Win or lose,

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,400
it can only be good for Jingjing.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,840
You lost to me deliberately so that
I would have to compete with Jiang Jie?

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,150
After all these years,
what are you concerned about?

53
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,190
Master is most concerned about you,
of course.

54
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,080
Since you went abroad,
Master misses you every day.

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,470
He's getting old,

56
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,750
and he's learning everyday

57
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,360
from the youngest apprentice
how to use the Internet on his mobile phone

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,680
and he prints out all the pictures of you

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,560
- that your mother posted on the Internet.
- Lu Ke.

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,710
You hate the Master for not wanting to see her.
But he doesn't want to miss your graduation.

61
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,910
He even followed you abroad

62
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,430
and only dared to look at you from afar.

63
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,590
How can Zhaoyeqing
be more important than you?

64
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,520
It's because
you want to take over Zhaoyeqing,

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,710
that's why
Master let you have it so easily.

66
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,960
Jingjing, you've been too hard on yourself.

67
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,470
In fact,
the Master only wants you to be happy,

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,680
to be the cheerful self you used to be.

69
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,870
No need to worry. We've seized the knife.

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,150
Let's go.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Perhaps the outcome of this competition
is not a bad thing for Zhao Jingjing.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,600
If you have the time to care about others,
think about the banquet that's coming.

73
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,950
If we fail the five-star review
of the Chefs' Alliance,

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,040
it will certainly be bad for Chuncheng.

75
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,270
Does that mean I get to help
prepare the main meal of the banquet?

76
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,870
I'm a man of my word.

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,310
Is there any work
at the restaurant tonight?

78
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,190
I can work some extra hours.

79
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Yeah, if you want to.

80
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,340
Can I ditch the warehouse suit
and change into the Chef's' uniform?

81
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,190
Yes.

82
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,310
Get me a bigger one.

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,830
Taste some wines from the winery.
Make sure the vintage of the wine is correct.

85
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,830
Mr. Zheng.

86
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,310
Something happened between them
while I was away.

87
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,390
Yeah, how did they get so close?

88
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,160
What do you mean by that?

89
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,750
Nothing.

90
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,830
Mr. Zheng, I heard that Master Jiang
from Xijiangyue will be here.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,950
Mr. Xu Kang is really someone.

92
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,510
The international reputation of Mr. Xu
is booming.

93
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,800
The Jiang family is full of snobs.

94
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,920
It's normal.

95
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,070
Come on. Let's go to the kitchen.

96
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,870
We'll be busy when the Chef leaves.

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,560
The Chef will leave?

98
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,070
- It's so boisterous.
- Mr. Xu Kang.

99
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,630
Do you mind
if we interview you before we start?

100
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,830
A few words, please.

101
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,190
Come on.

102
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,870
Don't you keep an eye on them?

103
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,750
If we need to do that,

104
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,000
they might as well quit their jobs.

105
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,000
(Baichuan Culinary Conference)

106
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,160
I would like to thank

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,920
the Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,390
for arranging such a great reception
for me.

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,270
I'm really flattered.

110
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,390
Now, our Mr. Jiang

111
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,720
will announce a great event.

112
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,390
You're leaving now.

113
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,720
- Or what?
- Grandpa has an announcement to make today.

114
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,120
You don't even want to know what it is.

115
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,190
What does the Jiang family's good news
have to do with me?

116
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,390
Don't be so sure yet.

117
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,360
What I'm announcing is a family matter.

118
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,430
We are grateful to Mr. Xu.

119
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,160
My granddaughter Jiang Xiu

120
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,630

(Today I would like to announce)

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,920
(that I am stepping down
as Head Chef of Xijiangyue.)

123
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,950

Hello, everyone, I'm Jiang Xiu.

127
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,680
She's back.

128
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,600
And starting from today,
she has a one more identity,

129
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,510
that is, the Head Chef of Xijiangyue.

130
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,830
You already knew.

131
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,160
Grandpa didn't have this plan
for a day or two.

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
Hello.

133
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,950

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,800
Chef, my dad's missing. I have to go.

135
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,240
I'll go with you.

136
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,310
You haven't seen Xiu for so long,

137
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,830
don't you want to congratulate her
in person?

138
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,680
Xiu, you...

139
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,430
Why didn't you wear that pink dress?

140
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,720
This isn't a wedding.

141
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,390
Look at you.

142
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Come on, go see your master.

143
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,270
Come on.

I'm sorry, Miss Li.

146
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,920
We saw him before lunch,

147
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,390
- but the next thing we knew, he was missing.
- Where was he last seen?

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,360
He was playing chess with someone
in the corridor.

149
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,160
Are you sure he's here?

150
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,270
Could he be in the cold room
or somewhere more dangerous?

151
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,480
It's the surveillance of the neighbourhood.

152

- Miss Li.
- I'm looking for him now.

153

Get in the car. I'll drive you.

161
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,320
It's too slow to find him like that.

162
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,750
He hasn't left the neighbourhood
since he moved here.

163
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,910
He might go to his old place.

164

We lived in that place for over 20 years.

165
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,440
Or maybe he's gone to the city hospital.

166
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,670
We used to go there every Friday.

167
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,910
Where else could he be?

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,080
but he looked normal.

181
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,480
He said he came to pick up his kid.

182
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,440
We have employees
whose children attend this nursery.

183
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,630
So I let him in.

184
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,600
Is this the man?

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,080
Yes. He talked to me.

186
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,650
He seems to know
our welfare center very well.

187
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,750
Oh, he made a visitor registration.

188
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,720
Right here.

189
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,000
(Baichuan Welfare Center
Visitor Registration; Li Jidong)

190
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,750
He still remembers these.

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,440
Sir, can we go in there and look for him?

192
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:26,960
Yeah.

193
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,630
But you have to register too.

194
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,390
Okay.

195
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,390
Li Nai.

196
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,600
Li Nai.

197
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,440
The welfare center is quite big.

198
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,150
Is there anywhere your dad might go

199
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,000
or anyone he knows well?

200
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,960
I don't know, but he used to work here
as a security guard.

201
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
He knows this place pretty well.

202
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,200
Well, let's split then.

203
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,790
I'll check the inside,
you check the outside.

204
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,030
Don't miss the playground

205
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,000
or any of these places.

206
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay, go.

207
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,510
Li Jidong.

208
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,600
Li Jidong.

209
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,960
Uncle Li.

210
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,630
Uncle Li.

211
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,440
- Jiang Jie.
- Uncle Li.

212
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,440
Uncle Li.

213
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,750
How could that be?

214
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,840
- How come there's someone in the tree?
- Dean.

215
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,630
Li Jidong, what are you doing?

216
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,670
Get down from there! It's dangerous!

217
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
Get down.

218
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,670
Who are you?

219
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,480
I'm Li Nai, Li Jidong.

220
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,120
Look at me. I'm Li Nai.

221
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,080
That's not right. Nai just turned six.

222
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,910
- Li Jidong, get down.
- Li Nai.

223
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,360
Calm down. The more you yell at him,

224
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,030
- the worse it's gonna get.
- Here's a ladder.

225
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,870
- Li Jidong, don't panic.
- Put the ladder here.

226
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,390
I'll come up and get the balloons for you.

227
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,910
- I'll go up.
- No. Let me do it.

228
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,720
You won't be able to pull him back
if something happens.

229
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,480
Li Jidong, I'm Qiang Xie.

230
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,480
Qiang Xie is here to help. Wait.

231
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,270
Watch out.

232
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,240
Li Jidong, hold him tight.

233
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,720
We got him. You can let go.

234
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
Li Jidong, you are scaring me to death.

235
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,030
What should I do
if something happens to you?

236
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,550
- I really worried about you.
- Is he okay?

237
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,150
Nai.

238
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,870
Yes, I'm Nai.

239
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,120
This is for Nai.

240
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,390
Nai is working very hard.

241
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,270
(Happy)
The health supplements I bought for her

242
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,030
were thrown away.

243
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,270
I'm looking for a new gift for her.

244
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,390
Wait a moment.

245
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,200
Nai is in the welfare center

246
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,910
waiting for me to pick her up.

247
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,870
Dad, I was so worried about you.

248
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,390
Dad,

249
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,440
I was so worried about you.

250
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,500
(Happy)

251
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,270
See you tomorrow, Qiang Xie.

252
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,910
How's Uncle Li?

253
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,420
What did the doctor say?

254
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,720
Still the same.

255
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,840
Don't worry about it.

256
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,270
I still plan to hire a nanny
to take care of him.

257
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,750
Let me know if you have any difficulty.
l am here to help.

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,630
- I'll definitely turn to you in need.
- Okay.

259
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,270
One more thing.

260
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,180
(Baichuan Wildlife Zoo)

261
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,120
You've changed jobs again.

262
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,790
The last time I borrowed a car
from my boss,

263
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,390
he insisted that
I scratched up the car and blackmailed me.

264
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,670
I'm telling you,

265
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm working there

266
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,870
as a leader.

267
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,360
Bring Uncle Li to see me one day.

268
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,510
Definitely.

269
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,150
What's going on with Jiang Jie today?
He helped you.

270
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,080
Then he's not a bad guy.
How are you going to thank him?

271
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,670
Take care of Li Jidong for me.

272
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,240
Good evening, Chef.

273
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,840
What's the matter?

274
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,600
Thank you very much for today.

275
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,960
You haven't blown dry your hair yet.

276
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,440
Let me help.

277
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,320
Chef,

278
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,120
your hair is so soft.

279
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,080
I've heard that people with soft hair
are also soft- hearted.

280
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,670
Then don't hear these nonsense again.

281
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,960
Did you change your shampoo?

282
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,550
You didn't smell like this before.

283
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,960
This ginger shampoo for hair growth
is a scam.

284
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,870
You're too young to fall for that.

285
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,670
If you don't need that nose
for anything else,

286
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,720
don't use it.

287
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,910
Thank you so much for today.

288
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,390
Thank you so much for today.

289
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,630
You've said that so many times.

290
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,840
Okay, that's enough.

291
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,360
Chef,

292
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,360
I'd like to

293
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,320
have a day off tomorrow.

294
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,840
So you're doing all this to get a day off.

295
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,390
If you've learned some art of speaking,

296
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,480
you'd be less annoying.

297
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,750
I want to go to the zoo with Li Jidong
tomorrow morning.

298
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,200
(Baichuan Wildlife Zoo)
You can come along if you want.

299
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,600
You've only been with Xue Congming
for half a year,

300
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,870
how come you're so close to that Cui Can

301
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,080
and Master Xue?

302
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,320
Friendship doesn't
depend on the length of time.

303
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
After all this time,
you haven't connected with anyone else.

304
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,750
Then don't go if you don't want to.

305
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,270
You're asking me to take time with you.

306
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,030
Do you want to
leave the Chuncheng undermanned?

307
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,790
Right.

308
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,720
I didn't think of that.

309
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,630
- I'll give you something else, then.
- No need.

310
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,790
You blow-dried my hair. We're even.

311
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,390
I'm going to sleep now.

312
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,720
I'll be off then.

313
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,480
Thank you so much for today.

314
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,070
You don't need to send me off. Bye.

315
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,240
What have you been up to while I was away,

316
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,200
letting Jiang Xiu take over
the position of Head Chef?

317
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,440
Dad, keep your voice down.
Grandpa just went to bed.

318
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,070
Besides,
when she became Xu Kang's apprentice,

319
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,270
she was destined to be
the Head Chef of Xijiangyue.

320
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,000
Don't tell me you haven't figured that out.

321
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,400
Are we talking about now?

322
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,160
Grandpa's still in good health.

323
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,960
You're just a general manager of the group.

324
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,000
At this rate,
the whole Jiang family will be Jiang Xiu's.

325
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,720
What's the big deal, dad?

326
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,240
Xiu is nominally your daughter.

327
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,880
It doesn't matter if it's yours or hers.

328
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,310
How can it be the same?

329
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,480
Yes, after all,
I'm not your biological child.

330
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,640
How can it be the same?

331
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,030
You're here, Xiu.

332
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,070
Uncle,

333
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,070
I heard that the most popular one
in Baichuan is Jiang Jie.

334
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,200
After today,

335
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,400
no one will be as popular as you.

336
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,310
Really?

337
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,590
But

338
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,680
I didn't really want to be
the Head Chef at Xijiangyue,

339
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,240
but grandpa had to force it on me.

340
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,880
Uncle, I'm jet-lagged recently,

341
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,110
so I hope you enjoy

342
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,400
these last few days.

343
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,400
She's as uneducated as her father.

344
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,270
Dad.

345
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,750
I told you, grandpa just went to bed.

346
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,830
Can you keep your voice down?

347
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,110
Don't wake him up.

348
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,110
Will you be a real man?

349
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,400
How long will I have to live like this?

350
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,000
It will not be long.

351
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,310
Everybody,

352
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,640
today's first table
will arrive half an hour early,

353
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,440
so you can start preparing in five minutes.

354
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,000
Mr. Zheng,
can the Chef be here in five minutes?

355
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,960
He's not coming today.

356
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,830
- He's not coming.
- I'm covering today.

357
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,240
Go all out!

358
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,960
Visitors who want to get on the tour bus,
please hurry up,

359
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,350
we will be leaving soon.

360
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,110
The tour bus's over there. Let's go.

361
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,590
- I'll buy you a balloon later, okay?
- Okay.

362
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,030
Mind your head.

363
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,750
Okay.

364
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,480
Li Jidong, don't drink too much.
You haven't gone to the bathroom yet.

365
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,750
Drink less.

366
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,160
Fasten your seatbelt. Here.

367
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,270
Done.

368
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,720
Thank you.

369
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,720
Jiang Jie.

370
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
Qiang Xie.

371
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Li Jidong.

372
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,440
Uncle Li, you remember me.

373
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,750
You're Qiang Xie.

374
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,070
His name is Jiang Jie, Jiang Jie.

375
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,550
Qiang Xie.

376
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,030
Sorry about that.

377
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,830
You know how my dad is.

378
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,880
- It's okay.
- Chef,

379
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,240
you've come here. What about Chuncheng?

380
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,440
I'm paying Sous Chef Zheng very well.

- Yeah.

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,920
Swans.

401
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,200
I want to feed the swans.

402
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,400
You need to take some food
to feed the swans.

403
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,550
Here, feed them.

404
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,110
Feed more.

405
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,590
Nai.

406
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,680
Why do you have a picture of Nai?

407
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,000
Do you like...

408
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,640
Li Jidong, what's going on?

409
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,550
He, he...

410
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,460
What's wrong with him?

411
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,960
I saw there was water in his bag
and I wanted to drink it.

412
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,350
Water, wait a moment.

413
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,310
Swans. I want to feed the swans.

414
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,790
Swans.

415
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,030
I got no food.

416
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,720
Li Nai.

417
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Li Nai.

418
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,720
- Li Nai.
- Cui Can.

419
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,550
Look at your outfit.

420
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,070
Are you hot?

421
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,750
It's so freaking hot.

422
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,880
I thought he wasn't coming.

423
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,920
I never really got him.

424
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,750
- You're just pretending to be a puppet.
- Not so much.

425
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,830
I also feed bamboo to pandas.

426
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,510
Do you know how cute pandas are?

427
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,680
I get you.

428
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,680
Let me, Uncle Li.

429
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,070
Are you hungry, Uncle Li?

430
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,000
Yes.

431
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,550
Li Nai.

432
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,160
Uncle Li is hungry.

433
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Let's go for lunch.

434
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,310
- Let's go.
- Cui Can.

435
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,920
You go to work. We're off to lunch.

436
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,440
I need to go to the bathroom.

437
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,920
Bathroom.

438
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,960
Uncle Li, wait for me, I'll be right back.

439
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,790
Mom, that old man's pissing his trousers.

440
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,070
- Uncle Li.
- Li Jidong.

441
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,880
It's okay.

442
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,270
It's okay.

443
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,920
- It's okay.
- Cui Can.

444
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,480
- Do you have a lounge here?
- Yes.

445
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,200
Li Nai,

446
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,400
you take Uncle Li there.

447
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,680
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

448
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,360
- Let's go, Uncle Li.
- It's alright.

449
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,680
What are you photographing?

450
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,060
(Lake Hill Pantai Garden)

451
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,030
Thank you.

452
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,480
Why are you staring at me?

453
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,070
You're just like you were
when you were a kid.

454
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,070
Every time you got sick,

455
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,750
you're like a little marshmallow.

456
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,480
You were cute,
but you just refused to take your pills.

457
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,160
You remembered it the wrong way.

458
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,160
When I was young,
I didn't dare to get sick.

459
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,240
Getting sick would cause a lot of trouble.

460
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,270
Fortunately, now that I have grown up,
it will cause less trouble.

461
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,510
Yeah, you've grown up.

462
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,160
But don't you also owe me an explanation

463
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,110
for taking time off

464
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,400
to go to the zoo with Li Nai

465
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,720
and ended up with a cold.

466
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,010
Do you have a crush on her?

467
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,680
Let me straighten you out.

468
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,920
I didn't do it for her.

469
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,640
I did it for her father.

470
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,440
Uncle Li helped me a lot when I was young.

471
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,880
The employee who was hired
in spite of the rules,

472
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,720
the assistant who was taken
to the challenge,

473
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:41,160
and there's a warehouse keeper
who's got a shot to cook the main meal.

474
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,750
It's always Li Nai, isn't it?

475
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,720
It's not like
you don't know my childhood with her.

476
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,640
I told you that
even if she chose to take a side,

477
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,440
it would be on my side

478
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,240
not Xue Congming or Li Congming's.

479
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,400
I get it.

480
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,510
Since you were eight years old,

481
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,640
you've been a possessive friend
for 18 years,

482
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,550
right?

483
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,640
Eighteen years have passed,
I don't know if she remembers you or not,

484
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,960
and I don't know if this friendship

485
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,790
has turned into love.

486
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,790
Don't be ridiculous.

487
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,110
There's no way I'm going to fall for her.

488
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,960
You'd better not fall for her.

489
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,550
If you don't take this pill,

490
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,960
- I'll take you to the hospital.
- No.

491
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,720
I'll go myself if I feel sick.

492
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,400
Okay.

493
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,920
Call me if you need anything.

494
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,110
Jiang Jie,

495
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,000
you said before that you chose me,

496
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,240
so you know what my value is.

497
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,350
We won.

498
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,590
Sorry, Chef.
You fell ill because of me again.

499
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,270
You've said you're sorry so many times.

500
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,830
Is there anything I can do for you?

501
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,480
Take this.

502
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,960
How's Uncle Li?

503
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,920
He's asleep. Cui Can is with him.

504
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,880
Cui Can.

505
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,720
Why are you closing the door?

506
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,920
You're sick.
It's not good to leave the door open.

507
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,000
So I have to jump out of a window
to get to the hospital?

508
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,830
By the way, Chef,

509
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,070
my dad said
he saw your mobile phone at the zoo.

510
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,590
What did Uncle Li say
about my mobile phone?

511
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,510
He saw that your phone was low on battery.

512
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,270
Do you want to charge it before leaving?

513
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,740
(Garage One; Entrance)

514
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,160
Are you trying to get me
an orthopaedic appointment too?

515
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,480
That scooter was like
five metres away from us.

516
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,480
Safety first.

517
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,048
(The temperature now is too high.)

518
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,750
Li Nai,

519
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,000
are you planning to cure my cold with heat?

520
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,790
Let me turn it down.

521
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,880
Is it cool enough?

522
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,510
Do you think my temperature
isn't high enough?

523
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,240
You're really picky today.

524
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,310
Who's always apologising?

525
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,270
Chef, is this okay?

526
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,660
(Haifu Hospital)

527
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,640
- What's wrong?
- Cold.

528
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,590
- You don't feel cold anymore, do you?
- Hot.

529
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,300
Are you still feeling hot?

530
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,680
Okay, okay. Hand's sore.

531
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,680
- My hands are not sore.
- I mean my hands.

532
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,830
Anything else, Chef?

533
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,960
Water.

534
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,350
Coming right up.

535
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,480
Li Nai.

536
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,720
Li Jidong said

537
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,920
that if you hit your head with an egg
when you're ill,

538
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,200
you'll soon get well.

539
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,310
When I was a kid, every time I got sick,

540
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,030
Li Jidong would hit me
in the head with an egg.

541
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
This is what Li Jidong said.

542
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,240
If you're sick, hit your head with an egg

543
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,310
and you'll get well soon.

544
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,830
Are all fathers

545
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,720
so full of weird theories?

546
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,400
Your dad too?

547
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,480
I'm sorry.

548
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,550
Sweetheart, time to eat.

549
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,590
When I was a child, my father used to

550
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,960
make radish and beef soup
for everyone's birthday,

551
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,750
saying it would give them a long life.

552
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,350
It doesn't work at all.

553
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,620
You want some?

554
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,350
What's Xiu doing today?

555
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,110
Why didn't she go to Xijiangyue?

556
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,000
Grandpa,

557
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,880
Xiu just got back.

558
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,400
She's still jet-lagged.

559
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,400
Jet-lagged.

560
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,920
She's jet-lagged,
but instead of staying in,

561
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,110
she's out running.

562
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,320
You're Xiu's older brother.

563
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,400
You need to discipline her

564
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,280
- and guide her.
- Dad,

565
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,800
Xuyang has a lot to deal with in the group,

566
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,320
how can he have time for her?

567
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,710
Then you just resign from the group.

568
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,280
Grandpa, I'll try to persuade Xiu
to work at Xijiangyue.

569
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,670
No matter how busy the group is,

570
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,360
you have to remember

571
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,070
that the roots of the Jiang family
are in Xijiangyue.

572
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,590
The future of Xijiangyue

573
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,230
depends on Xiu.

574
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,480
Your duty

575
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,550
is to assist her well.

576
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,920
Everything else

577
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,190
is not so important.

578
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,960
Yes,

579
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,710
