(Baichuan)
(Baichuan City is named after its location)

21
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,510
(and is well-known for its foods.)

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,230
(It is said that 200 years ago,)

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,430
(the emperor traveled eastward)

24
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,870
(and passed Baichuan at night,)

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,920
(local officials gathered cooks)

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
(and prepared a banquet.)

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,350
(Li, Xue, Ge, Zhao, Cao, Jiang, Chai)
(Seven dishes was praised by the nobility.)

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,070

was given a knife with a five-star carving.)

(However,)

32
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,070
(due to their monopoly,)

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,520
(cooks with no background
have no space to grow.)

34
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,190
(To earn their own places,)

35
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,870
(some grass-rooted cooks)

You…

42
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,630
Master. Master.

43
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,030
Master, are you okay?

44
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,150
Master, what's the matter?

45
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,960
Master.

46
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,310
Jiang Jie.

47
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,080
You seize my knife.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,960

49
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,870
I wish you

50
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,960
long longevity.

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,480

rises in Baichuan.)

Madam.

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,040
In the martial arts world,
one may challenge another.

59
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,070
In the culinary business,
it's called knife-seizure.

60
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,190
Due to the rules
of Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan,

61
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,560
it takes one at least 40 years

62
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,070
to start from 1 star to 4 stars.

63
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,160
And no one knows how long it takes
to become a five-star cook,

64
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
so to shorten the time,

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,510
one may seize knifes.

66
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,120
(Xue's Noodles)
They can challenge cooks of the same stars.

67
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,720
The losers will close their restaurants

68
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,800
and hand in all the kitchen knives.

69
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,600
Seize 7 knives to move
from 1 star to 2 stars.

70
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
2 stars to 3 stars, 6 knives.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,120
3 stars to 4 stars, 5 knives.

72
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,040
To become a five-star cook,

73
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,310
you will need to seize…

74
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,390
A total of 22 knives.

75
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,560
Yes.

76
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,360
Morning.

77
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,190
22 knives.

78
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,120
Morning, Nai.

79
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,160
Nai.

80
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,430
Master has been waiting
for your fish for half an hour.

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,680
Take this.

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,310
I'm Li Nai.

83
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,830
I've had someone pick it up.

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,120
OK, thanks.

85
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,120
Nai.

86
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,750
The fish is at least
30 kilograms.

87
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,920
It's only 27.5 kilograms.

88
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,480
Li Nai.

89
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:21,870
Fish.

90
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,600
Sure.

91
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,000
Mop the floor, please.

92
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,240
22 restaurants closed.

93
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,920
He's a handsome young man.

94
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,870
But he's cold.

95
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,070
Congratulations,
you are now a five-star chef.

96
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,950
Chef,

97
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,240
are you sure you will challenge

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,000
the Xue's among the seven families?

99
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,190
Is there a problem?

100
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,680
Xue Congming ranks top.

101
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,240
Also, he has a good reputation.

102
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,310
If you try to seize his knife,

103
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,920
it may bring you bad comments.

104
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,510
Master Xue,

105
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,830
my sister is really gifted.

106
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,120
Can you accept her
as your apprentice, please?

107
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,980
(Filial)

108
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,040
I will pay you
when I start making money.

109
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,310
Please accept her.

110
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,520
Make an appointment for me.

111
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,830
I'd like to meet Xue Congming's successor.

112
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,680
Got it.

113
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,220
(Xue's Noodles)

114
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,070
Qian.

115
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,070
Get that.

116
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,340
(Xue Congming,
five-star Cook, Xue's Noodles)

117
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,600
Master,

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,480
you changed the gas tank yourself again?

119
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,270
I didn't.

120
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,190
I can smell the gas.

121
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,240
Good nose.

122
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,310
Sure thing.

123
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,160
My nose smells everything.

124
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
I told you,

125
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,510
your lumbar doesn't allow you
to move the gas tank.

126
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,750
Take a break, alright?

127
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Leave it to me.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,190
I know

129
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,630
what you are up to.

130
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,720
Not a chance.

131
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,950
Master,

132
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,070
I've been here for nearly 6 months.

133
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,680
When can I start cooking?

134
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,870
When it's 6 months.

135
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,950
You are impatient.

136
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,070
Skills are easy to train,

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,600
but not the heart.

138
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,720
Serving every customer with your heart

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,630
and making the food that satisfies
every customer

140
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,390
is the goal of Xue's Noodles.

141
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,720
It's also how we connect
to our customers.

142
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,160
Xu.

143
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,720
Li.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,390
You are late tonight.

145
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,240
The Alliance is on the patrol
at Chunxi Road.

146
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,310
I took a detour.

147
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,360
When will you be ready?

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,750
You can come back later.

149
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,160
Li,

150
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,830
you've got a job
at a five-star restaurant.

151
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,630
Why are you still selling
street food?

152
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,830
I need to keep practicing.

153
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,480
You don't get to cook food
at a five-star restaurant?

154
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,440
Here.

155
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,120
Take it.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,390
Here.

157
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,030
Thanks.

158
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,080
What do you want?

159
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,200
Noodles with Snakehead Meat.

160
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,600
I don't have snakehead fish right now.

161
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,270
How about pork?

162
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,750
Or sausage?

163
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,000
I just want snakehead noodle.

164
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,960
Sorry, but I don't serve it.

165
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,240
Li,

166
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,750
you need snakehead fish?

167
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,240
Yes, can I borrow one?

168
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,240
Help yourself.

169
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,120
Don't worry,
I run an honest business.

170
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,870
Keep the edge at 30 degrees,

171
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,870
so the fillets are even.

172
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,320
You know quite a lot.

173
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,200
You…

174
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,550
Nothing.

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,720
Hello, Chef.

176
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,480
Zhu Hao.

177
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,030
Are you sure she's the one?

178
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,630
The girl in the photo
that I sent to you

179
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,120
is the successor to Xue Congming.

180
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,390
She sets up her stand
at Yuqiao West Road every Sunday.

181
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,320
Dude.

182
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
Hey, she's talking to you.

183
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,030
Take-away or eat right here?

184
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,790
Dine in.

185
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,510
Dine in, huh?

186
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,320
Chef.

187
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,390
What's the matter?

188
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,670
Nothing.

189
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,790
Pick me up later.

190
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,720
Yes, Chef.

191
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,270
Right now?

192
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,840
OK, OK.

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,440
Li, run!

194
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,150
The patrol is on the way.

195
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,320
Run! Run!

196
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,790
Quickly!

197
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey, you!

198
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,750
I…

199
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,080
My noodles.

200
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,320
Next time.

201
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,480
Hey!

202
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,720
Next time?

203
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,360
Keep order. No street food.

204
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,440
She's the successor? Unbelievable.

205
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,630
Xue Congming is an old fool.

206
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,480
You are still here.

207
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,840
You can have your noodles.

208
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,030
I'm so sorry.

209
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,960
I bet the Alliance
is short on cash.

210
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,720
It's not even close
to the end of the year.

211
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,600
They are abnormally active.

212
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,120
Mrs. Zhang has returned?

213
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,600
OK.

214
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,510
I will deliver the food
myself tomorrow.

215
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,270
Bye.

216
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,790
Finished?

217
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,620
Still want the noodles?

218
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,240
Are you mad?

219
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,600
Sorry, but I had no choice.

220
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,910
Street vendors like me

221
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,630
are afraid of the Alliance.

222
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,480
If they catch me,
my cart will be confiscated.

223
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,000
I will share a secret with you.

224
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,150
I sell a street food,

225
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,200
but I learn from a master.

226
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,150
The Noodles with Snakehead Meat
is his signature dish.

227
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,270
I want it.

228
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,600
OK.

229
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,000
Take-away or eat right away?

230
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,670
I'll have it right here.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,320
OK.

232
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,870
The noodle is not mushy yet.

233
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,030
Here's your noodle.

234
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,550
Hey, you! Business's over!

235
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,720
I owe you one.

236
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,700
(Xue's Noodles,
Credentials by Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan)

237
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:02,870
What's the matter?

238
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,360
Master.

239
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
The car is right at our door.

240
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,790
I want him to leave.

241
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,120
Maybe he's still sleeping.

242
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,570
He'll leave when it's work hour.

243
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,270
Chef.

244
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
The Alliance will arrive
in 10 minutes.

245
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,500
I've prepared an umbrella for you.

246
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,440
I don't need that.

247
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,510
I'll go in there on my own.

248
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,790
Oh, right.

249
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,840
Move the car later.

250
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,480
Sure.

251
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,390
We'll be open at 9 o'clock.

252
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,630
Please wait a bit longer.

253
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,870
Who's there?

254
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,790
It's so early.

255
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,270
Jiang Jie.

256
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,080
I'm here to seize your knife.

257
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
I knew I'd be the next.

258
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,030
But it's sooner than I expected.

259
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,790
I don't want to miss it.

260
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,720
After all,

261
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,960
you've got a successor already.

262
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,750
You're well prepared for the seizure.

263
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,670
You are one of the seven families.

264
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,150
I take it very seriously.

265
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,030
You came before we're open.

266
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,120
You're ready, aren't you?

267
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Nai,

268
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,840
what's going on?

269
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,790
Why is Jiang Jie here?

270
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,960
Go ask your idol.

271
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,120
He's not my idol.

272
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,480
Master,

273
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,200
is he here to seize your knife?

274
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,390
Can I ask you two questions?

275
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,600
You came to me on purpose
that night, didn't you?

276
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,550
Yes, I did.

277
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,840
You ordered the noodles
on purpose, too, right?

278
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,080
I wanted to see what Xue Congming's
successor was like,

279
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,260
but you make me disappointed.

280
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,360
You never wanted to eat
the noodles, did you?

281
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,480
Consider your hygiene,

282
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:11,960
cutting skill,

283
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,910
and your cooking skill,

284
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,720
I didn't want to eat your noodles.

285
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,950
You really want to seize his knife?

286
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,270
This is the third question.

287
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,030
Jiang Jie.

288
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,960
My master loves cooking.

289
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,240
And he's getting old.

290
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,870
Like you said,

291
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
I will most likely
take over the restaurant.

292
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,030
If you must seize the knife,

293
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,030
wait for me to…

294
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,030
I can't.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,960
I see.

296
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,200
According to the Alliance's rule,

297
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,240
the dish in a knife-seizure contest,

298
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,080
should be the speciality dish
of the target restaurant.

299
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,480
So you will both
make Noodles with Snakehead Meat.

300
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,510
The Alliance has prepared
the ingredients and condiments.

301
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,120
Each of you can appoint
an assistant.

302
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,510
Any more questions?

303
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,960
No question.

304
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,750
I need no assistant.

305
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,400
The game is officially on.

306
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,960
Master,

307
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,030
it's not even 6 months yet.

308
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,720
If I lose,

309
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,440
you will never have a chance
to use the knife.

310
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,920
You won't lose.

311
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,880
Don't make any mistakes.

312
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,000
Remember,
keep the knife edge at 30 degrees.

313
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,480
Start slowly, but finish quickly.

314
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,830
Take it slowly.

315
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,790
Pay attention to the heat.

316
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,550
Gently.

317
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,350
Don't mash the fish.

318
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,680
Good. Make it quick.

319
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,300
Alright.

320
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,200
This is it.

321
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,480
There's only one last step.

322
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,200
Jiang Jie and I have a story.

323
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,640
Win or lose,

324
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,680
I should bring it to closure.

325
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,500
Wait.

326
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,510
What are you doing?

327
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,270
Due to an unknown reason,

328
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,000
Chef Xue chose to make

329
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,790
a special instruction
at this point,

330
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,680
but after all,

331
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,600
the Noodles with Snakehead Meat
is his signature dish.

332
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,350
It's too easy for him.

333
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,440
Two minutes left.

334
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,550
Everybody knows

335
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,110
that it's Jiang Jie's habit

336
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,400
that he's always on time.

337
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,960
Pretentious.

338
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,020
(Jiang Jie, Xue Congming)

339
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,310
It'll be okay.

340
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,200
Two more votes.

341
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,020
(Jiang Jie, Xue Congming)

342
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,880
What?

343
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,270
Jiang Jie's version.

344
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,200
He roasted the fish,

345
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,310
so it's more tender.

346
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,640
The fish soup is rich.

347
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,350
Master Xue's Noodles

348
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,270
is cooked right to the point.

349
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,200
It's near perfection,

350
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,270
but…

351
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,000
Master Xue is getting old.

352
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,240
He's lost his control

353
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,270
on flavor.

354
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,160
According to your description,

355
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,590
there is a chance
that he has hypogeusia.

356
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,680
And it's been a while.

357
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,160
Didn't he find that?

358
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,590
My master has run the restaurant
for almost his entire life,

359
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,000
so his dose of condiments
is muscle memory.

360
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,510
And

361
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,550
I have uniformed the brand
and the production batch

362
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,680
of the condiments.

363
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,510
But the degeneration of taste buds
is caused by many reasons.

364
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,000
Some may affect other functions
of a person's body.

365
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,790
I suggest you take him to see me.

366
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,070
Xue Congming,

367
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,830
I believe you heard
what happened to my sister.

368
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,400
Do you regret your decision?

369
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,830
That night,

370
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,070
if you tasted the noodles,

371
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,640
you would understand why I chose her.

372
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,790
Regardless,

373
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,590
Xue's Noodles will not exist anymore.

374
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,880
I admit

375
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,880
you won.

376
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,860
(Xue's Noodles)

377
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,750
Congratulations, Chef.

378
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,720
Let's go. Where's the car?

379
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,200
Over there.

380
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,200
Jiang Jie.

381
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,440
Drive the car here.

382
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,160
You knew the Alliance will
prepare the condiments,

383
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,130
and plotted against my master.

384
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,230
You knew his sensitivity
to taste has decreased, right?

385
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,310
So what if I knew?

386
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,830
If my master got the flavor right,

387
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,160
you had no chance to defeat him.

388
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,240
But there's no if.

389
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,030
Jiang Jie,

390
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,480
you think this is over?

391
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,640
Come back, Li Nai.

392
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,750
(Li Nai.)

393
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,130
Hey.

394
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,780
Wait.

395
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,440
What's your name?

396
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,440
None of your business.

397
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,510
How time flies.

398
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,240
18 years have passed.

399
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,440
Mrs. Zhang,

400
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,200
I need the information
on someone.

401
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,350
Li Nai, right?

402
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,200
You were best friends
back in the orphanage.

403
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,680
She came to see us often.

404
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,150
But after she graduated
from college,

405
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,510
she stopped coming here
for no reason.

406
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,480
I see.

407
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,590
I have a picture of hers.

408
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,720
She took it when she got
admitted to college.

409
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,160
Great.

410
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,480
I'll send it to you.

411
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:28,880
OK.

412
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,240
Master,

413
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,240
what will you do
after you closed the restaurant?

414
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,880
Your senior sister always asked
me to stay with her.

415
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,200
Now, I'm officially retired.

416
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,510
You don't like her place.

417
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,510
You couldn't even stay there
for a week last year.

418
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,440
Cui Can,

419
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,160
what's your plan for the future?

420
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,400
I don't know.

421
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,000
I'll do whatever I want to do.

422
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,270
You know me.

423
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,030
If it wasn't for you and Li Nai,
I would've left.

424
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,480
You are young,
you can try more things.

425
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,350
You have no talent in culinary anyway.

426
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,440
It hurts, Master.

427
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,440
Don't be so harsh.

428
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,240
Alright.

429
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,160
We'll be closed tomorrow.

430
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,680
But we're still open today.

431
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,200
It's no big deal.

432
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,110
You

433
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,240
clean up the restaurant.

434
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,920
You tidy up the kitchen.

435
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,070
OK. Get to work.

436
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,000
OK, OK.

437
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,960
Master.

438
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
I'm old now.

439
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,310
I can't even knead doughs.

440
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,920
Master,

441
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,350
Table 7, two bowls of
Noodles with Snakehead Meat.

442
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,310
OK.

443
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,680
Old habit is hard to change, right?

444
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,960
Li Nai,

445
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,590
get me a new knife.

446
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:34,790
Okay.

447
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,720
Easy. Easy.

448
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,140
(Xue's Noodles, Time-honored Brand)

449
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,960
Be careful.

450
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,110
This way.

451
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,740
(Xue's Noodles,
Time-honored Brand Starting from 1822)

452
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,720
Master,

453
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,350
I'll be off.

454
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,750
Master,

455
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,550
let's go together.

456
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,240
It's late.

457
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,400
Won't you go home?

458
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,750
I've already called home.

459
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,510
Thank you.

460
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,750
You…

461
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,240
I won't agree.

462
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,880
Won't you think about it?

463
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,550
I know your situation.

464
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,960
If you come to work at my restaurant,

465
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,720
the work hour is flexible.

466
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,400
If you need to go home,

467
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,440
you can leave.

468
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,560
The salary is not enough for me
at a noodle restaurant,

469
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,070
I can make more money as a street cook.

470
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,750
I can pay you the highest salary
that I can afford.

471
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
We can discuss it.

472
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,160
I don't want to take advantage of you.

473
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,350
If you change your mind,

474
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,960
come to see me
at Xue's Noodles.

475
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,960
OK, thanks.

476
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,310
Master,

477
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,400
I will take back your knife.

478
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,550
But you will have to wait.

479
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,880
I will not.

480
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,480
Why?

481
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,680
Xue's Noodles is my business.

482
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,030
I owe Jiang Jie.

483
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,310
I deserve it.

484
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,640
The story between you two,

485
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,110
what was it?

486
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,550
It has nothing to do with you.

487
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,440
I lose to him

488
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,790
because he's better than me.

489
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,960
No.

490
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,440
You love to cook.

491
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,200
To be able to run the restaurant,

492
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,590
you choose not to leave
even if you miss senior sister.

493
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,920
To be able to run the restaurant,

494
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,850
you don't stay in the hospital
even if your lumbar is injured.

495
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,550
Yes, yes, yes.

496
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,880
I love to cook.

497
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,110
I don't want the restaurant
to be closed.

498
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
I'm even old

499
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,240
enough to be Jiang Jie's grandfather.

500
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,440
It's humiliating

501
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,400
to lose to a young man.

502
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,200
But I lost,

503
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,030
and that's the fact.

504
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,200
You can win it back.

505
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,640
Do you know

506
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,510
why I only asked Cui Can

507
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,030
but not you about the future?

508
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,030
Because Cui Can

509
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,030
doesn't know what he wants,

510
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,510
but he knows what he doesn't want.

511
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,510
So he will not give himself a hard time.

512
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,510
But you are different.

513
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,680
You look decisive,

514
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,750
but you always put others first.

515
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,680
It was selfish of me

516
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,030
to keep you at the restaurant.

517
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,880
Then you should know better

518
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,030
that I don't make a decision
that I will regret.

519
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,750
It doesn't matter if you choose to let go,

520
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,160
but I will get your knife back.

521
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,200
Is the candy for me?

522
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,440
Thank you.

523
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,240
Li Nai, can you play with me?

524
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,640
You are a nuisance.

525
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,510
You take away things from others.
I won't play with you.
