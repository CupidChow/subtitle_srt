80
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,120
Chef, I was just kidding.

81
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Teach me one more time.

82
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,920
- What are you doing?
- Has everything been take care of?

From when we decided to go back
to Baichuan to the site selection,

89
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,950
all the way until now,

90
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,630
we've been always on the same boat.

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Take it.

92
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,630
I did lose.

93
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,600
Both you and I are clear about Li Nai.

94
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,800
Even if she practices her cooking skills
day and night,

95
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
she can't possibly exceed you
within such a short term.

96
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,510
What do you want to say?

97
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,390
Both you and Jiang Xuyang know that.

98
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,750
Firewood Rice and Cao's Fish
even haven't been kicked out,

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,950
how could he help the Li family now?

100
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
And I did some investigation,

101
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,240
and found out Cui Can

102
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,630
is actually Cui Jing's little brother.

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,390
Li Nai wouldn't do it.

104
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,040
You still believe her.

105
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,830
Did you forget she opened a restaurant
behind you,

106
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,390
and tricked you like a fool?

107
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,870
It's just because your feeling for her
blinded your eyes

108
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,560
that you ended up like this.

109
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
It's not that.

110
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,720
Do you really think Cui Jing would take
such a big risk for her little brother?

111
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,720
And this is only your guesswork.

112
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay. Let's lay it aside.

113
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,600
As long as you nod, we can start over.

114
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,270
We can make all the details
public through media.

115
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,980
As long as the public opinion
is strong enough,

116
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,190
maybe we can compete with
Eating at Dusk again.

117
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,870
I'll never believe you'll lose to Li Nai.

118
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,800
And it's never been easy for us.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,390
Now it ended up like this.
Is this really what you want?

121
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,260

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,720

124
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,750
Everybody, Chef Li is not available today.

125
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,080
I'll answer your questions.

126
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,030
It's said you are Cui Jing's little brother.
Is it true?

127
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,200
It was your sister's secret help

128
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,390
that made Li Nai defeat Jiang Jie.

129
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,000
- Is it also true?
- Watch your mouth.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,720
Cui's family is special in the Alliance,
is it your plan to help Li family come back?

131
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,200
Did Cui Jing really cheat
in the challenge?

132
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,910
Please answer it.

133
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,960
Answer it please.

134
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,360
Wait!

135
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,720
Ms. Cui,
did you really cheat in the challenge?

136
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,030
Can you explain it?

137
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,080
How was it even possible
that Li Nai won the game?

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,120
Ms. Cui!

139
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,600
Cui Can, get off!

140
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,120
Did Cui Jing really cheat?

141
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,910
Xiu, even you don't believe me?

142
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,390
Do you know how much harm it did

143
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,030
to my brother?

144
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,790
Why did she cheat?

145
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,630
Did you make her?

146
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,030
I didn't.

147
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,750
I don't know why it became like this.

148
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,320
Xiu, you have to believe me.

149
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,240
I really have no idea.

150
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,270
Then go figure it out.

151
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,870
If someone cheated,

152
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,550
the challenge can be restarted.

153
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:47,636
Okay.

154
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,960
(Finally you answer my phone.)

155
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,360
Sorry, Ms. Cui.

156
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,120
I was in the meeting.

157
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,630
It's just over.

158
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,510
You seem to have figured out
how to explain.

159
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,600
I hope you are not that kind of person
who burns the bridge.

160
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,720
(Don't get me wrong, Ms. Cui.)

161
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,440
I have nothing to do with it.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,150
Hardly had I reached an agreement with you

163
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,120
when I was questioned for cheating.

164
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,030
(How can I believe you?)

165
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,270
The media are just making
groundless accusations.

166
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,720
(Listen to me,)

167
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,790
I work with you for long-term benefits.

168
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,320
Why would I give up
such a strong partner like you

169
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,480
only for Jiang Jie?

170
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,030
But now I, the whole Cui family,

171
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,120
and even my brother have been pushed
in the teeth of the storm.

172
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,510
It is a solid truth.

173
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,480
(Don't you forget)

174
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,440
who got me in trouble.

175
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,440
Please rest assured.

176
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,320
I'll take care of it soon.

177
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,260
I voted for Li Nai instead of Jiang Jie
who I should've voted for

178
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,600
because I trusted you.

179
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,720
(So Mr. Jiang,)

180
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,440
don't let me down.

181
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,630
Jing.

182
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,320
Cui Can?

183
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
When did you come?

184
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,000
You really cheated on voting?

185
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,270
Xuyang,

186
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,720
Cui Jing is obviously dragging you
into this.

187
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,550
It's simply like a a piece of cake
for Cui family.

188
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,240
If she doesn't want drag me into this,

189
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,750
it'll really worry me.

190
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,270
At least it seems

191
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,630
Cui family wants to work with me
sincerely.

192
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,630
Now we've got rid of Jiang Jie,

193
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,390
then Cui Jing would be a key
to my next step.

194
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,960
I know what you want, Xuyang.

195
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,390
I'll help you.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,270
Who were you speaking to?

197
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,630
It's obviously not for me.
Who made you do this, Jing?

198
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,240
It's none of your business.

199
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,480
Are you kidding?

200
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,120
Did you hear the voice outside?

201
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,550
They asked me if my sister had cheated.

202
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,960
How should I respond to this?

203
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,360
Don't you also wanna seize the knife back
for your master?

204
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,200
Do you want me to tell the reporters this?

205
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,320
Then you and Li Nai
hand Xue Congming's knife to Jiang Jie!

206
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,150
What's this?

207
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
I've always been treating you
as a child before,

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
but I was wrong.

209
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,630
You should know what trouble
Cui family got into right now.

210
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,080
(Property Mortgage Contract)

211
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,790
Cui family's knife factory debt repayment?

212
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,960
How did this happen, Jing?

213
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,000
Can,

214
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,720
Cui family is in grave danger.

215
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,960
I had to do this.

216
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,720
Mutual help is Cui family's precept.

217
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
As long as you keep silent about this,

218
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,000
we'll get through this difficulty soon.

219
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,960
Nai,

220
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,030
why don't you have breakfast?

221
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,960
Uncle Li,

222
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,240
morning.

223
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,870
Feeding fish?

224
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,030
Morning, Can.

225
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,600
I'll get you some drink.

226
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,870
No.

227
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm good.

228
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,120
Cui Can.

229
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,910
How did it go with the cheating issue?

230
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
It's nothing.

231
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,870
They are just jealous of you.

232
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,000
You mean your sister didn't cheat?

233
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,960
Of course not.

234
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
I asked her in person,

235
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,440
and the answer was definitely no.

236
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,790
So Li Nai,

237
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
you won fair and square.

238
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,790
Our master's knife

239
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,960
will never be seized away.

240
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,120
I'm relieved a lot.

241
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
I still can't believe that

242
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,240
I defeated Jiang Jie.

243
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,550
Cui Can.

244
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,600
What's wrong with you?

245
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,000
Nothing.

246
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,150
Right.

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,720
I gotta go.

248
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,000
I have a date with Xiu.

249
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,381
Go ahead.

250
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,750
Bye, Uncle Li.

251
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,790
What are you doing here?

252
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,720
I need to tell you something.

253
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,360
My brother wanna seize your knife
because of me.

254
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,120
He wanted you to take care of me.

255
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,080
If I hadn't begged you,

256
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,390
you would have agreed.

257
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,960
I agreed to your request,

258
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,550
but you didn't stay
by your brother's side.

259
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,910
It's the same now.

260
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,270
Even if you made him return the knife,

261
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,630
it would

262
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,790
change nothing at all.

263
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,720
Back then

264
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,510
I wasn't able to help you,

265
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,870
including your father.

266
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,390
This is it.

267
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,120
Xue Congming didn't let me tell you,

268
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,200
but I think

269
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,270
you should know the truth.

270
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,750
Sorry.

271
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,600
Sorry, Jie.

272
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,790
It's not your fault.

273
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,020
(Thief! Cheating! Go to hell!)

274
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,030
Jiang Jie.

275
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,590
You...

276
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,510
Don't follow me.

277
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,105
(Jiang's Residence)
Where is Xiu?

278
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,920
Jiang Jie got hurt.

279
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,790
Xiu was there with him the whole night.

280
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,960
Just for a woman,

281
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,920
he lost the game,

282
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,110
and even got into hospital.

283
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,110
What a good-for-nothing!

284
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,720
Grandpa.

285
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,110
Dad has been on business in Rujiang
for a long time.

286
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,640
Then let him come back.

287
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,480
It's kinda empty in the house,

288
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,000
cold and cheerless.

289
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,480
Okay.

290
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,920
Dad will be happy.

291
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,310
Jiang Jie got hurt so bad for you,

292
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,030
and you're just sitting here like this?

293
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
Mr. Zheng.

294
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,510
Chef Li, don't call me that.

295
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,750
I don't deserve this.

296
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,400
Sorry.

297
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,000
Have you heard of the story of Yao family?

298
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,270
Jiang Jie told me it was made up
to mirror Jiang family.

299
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,480
The story actually meant that

300
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,790
his father was expelled from the family
after he had made a mistake.

301
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,310
What if his father never made a mistake?

302
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,750
I'll tell you

303
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,270
a real story.

304
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,680
Jiang family was the champion
of the seven families in Baichuan.

305
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,440
Jiang Ziqing, the host of the family,
had a pair of twin boys.

306
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,440
(Jiang Yuanshan, the elder one,)

307
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,030
(was Jiang Jie's father.)

308
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
(He was not much of a gifted child,
but he'd never been troubled by that.)

309
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,070
(He just got married and bore children
like the most people.)

310
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,680
(He had a boy and a girl,
and they were very cute.)

311
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,110
But Jiang Yuanfeng, Jiang jie's uncle,

312
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,440
was super gifted

313
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,920
but also arrogant.

314
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,480
He competed with others everywhere.

315
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,000
(Finally he got defeated in a game.)

316
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,830
(Jiang Ziqing had to save Jiang family's
glory and reputation,)

317
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,510
(Jiang Residence)

318
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,830
(but he didn't want to give up
the more gifted son.)

319
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
(So he got an idea.)

320
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,440
(He made his twin sons)

321
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,960
(Jiang Yuanshan and Jiang Yuanfeng)

322
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,160
(exchange identity.)

323
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,440
So the one who competed with Ge Qunshan

324
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,000
wasn't Jiang Jie's father.

325
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,310
How could he treat his son like that?

326
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,790
For one's own sake,

327
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
people can do anything.

328
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,880
That why Jiang Jie wanted to
challenge Jiang family.

329
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,920
It's all for his father.

330
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,830
Jiang Jie's father is best tempered man
I've even seen.

331
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
Besides, after he had been expelled
from the family,

332
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,880
he promised Jiang Ziqing

333
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,070
he would never let Jiang Jie bear grudge.

334
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,640
Then how did Jiang Jie's father die?

335
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,550
Let's go back to Yao's story.

336
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,830
Yao Zhengling and his wife and children
were expelled from the family,

337
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,790
but with his persistence and hard work,

338
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,030
it took not long for him

339
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,070
to get a little reputation.

340
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,680
But it had been not long

341
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,830
before he got hurt in his hand.

342
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,030
Jiang Jie, let's go.

343
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,400
Get in there.

344
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,110
What happened, dad?

345
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,750
Keep silent. Don't come out.

346
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,160
What are you doing?

347
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
What are you doing?

348
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,400
What are you doing?

349
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,270
Brother, don't blame me.

350
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,960
It's all because you always showed off
too much,

351
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,440
dad wants you back now.

352
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,480
You're such a jerk!

353
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,240
(All this was caught by Jiang Jie
hiding behind.)

354
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,480
Jiang Jie has been timid and introverted
since he was little.

355
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,750
His personality is completely different
from Xiu's.

356
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,830
It's just back then in the welfare center,

357
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,830
a friend told him

358
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,030
if you got bullied one day...

359
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,240
If you get bullied again,

360
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,030
you must get back at him.

361
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,510
Okay.

362
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,790
Over these 18 years,

363
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,160
he has always been careful
not to make any mistake.

364
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,830
There was only one step to success,

365
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,160
but this friend just appeared
at this moment.

366
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,030
This friend used him,

367
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,510
hurt him,

368
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,270
and deceived him,

369
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,070
ruining his 18 year's efforts

370
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,110
in a short while.

371
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,790
(Jiang Jie. Jiang Jie is here!)

372
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,880
Jiang Jie!

373
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,310
It's said you have something to declare.

374
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,880
Is it about the cheating issue
in the challenge?

375
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,980
Did you get hurt for Li Nai,
the Head Chef of Eating at Dusk?

376
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,400
- What's going on between you two?
- Jiang Jie, can you explain it?

377
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,440
Jiang Jie.

378
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,400
Any inside story, Jiang Jie?

379
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,160
This is the hospital!

380
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,680
Ask one by one.

381
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,680
Would you answer the question directly?

382
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,310
- Yes.
- Everyone,

383
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,350
about the knife-seizure contest between me

384
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,350
and Li Nai,
the Head Chef of Eating at Dusk,

385
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,000
nobody cheated.

386
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,720
I did lose.

387
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,030
So I hope

388
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,000
this is it.

389
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,110
Please go back.

390
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,030
Thank you.

391
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,550
Did you get what you want?

392
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,440
Please go! This is a hospital!

393
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,880
Just leave!

394
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,640
I think I've got you.

395
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,790
Zheng,

396
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,880
I owe you, and I'll pay you back.

397
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,920
Though I'm elder than you,

398
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,550
I've been always following you

399
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,720
all the way.

400
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,480
I forgot this road is not wide enough,

401
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,720
and we've kinda diverged

402
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
gradually.

403
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,200
Sorry.

404
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,070
I've heard about your father

405
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,160
from Mr. Zheng just now.

406
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,750
Li Nai,

407
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,160
you were right.

408
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,750
There is never "if".

409
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,270
Xue Congming once

410
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,750
refused to take Jiang Xiu,

411
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,070
and it turned out that
it was all Jiang Xiu's idea.

412
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,070
I misunderstood him.

413
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,550
I owe him an apology.

414
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,070
Now

415
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,440
we are even.

416
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,310
Li Jidong.

417
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,400
Nai.

418
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:22,960
Nai.

419
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,750
Jiang Jie...

420
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,590
Qiang Xie is gone.

421
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,550
Nai.

422
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,640
Don't cry.

423
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,480
Qiang Xie will come back.

424
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,680
Trust me.

425
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,200
Don't cry.

426
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,480
He won't come back.

427
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
He won't.

428
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,440
Nai.

429
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,270
When you grow up,

430
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,510
you can go meet him.

431
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,160
Then you'll see him. I promise.

432
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,340
♪So many expectations♪

433
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,540
♪So much waiting♪

434
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,420
♪So much bravery♪

♪Worry about the should or shouldn't♪

438
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:22,750
Xiu.

439
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
Not fun.

440
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,110
So

441
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,110
have you found the answer?

442
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,830
Did your sister cheat?

443
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,920
No.

444
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,350
So

445
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,640
my brother did lose the game?

446
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,350
Yes.

447
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,920
My brother was almost there,

448
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,790
with only a step to go.

449
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,550
He's been struggling all the way here,

450
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,270
and I didn't do anything for him.

451
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm really good for nothing.

452
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,550
I did nothing for him. I'm useless.

453
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,110
What's wrong with all this?

454
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,440
Cui Can. I'm such a useless person.

455
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,180
(Eating at Dusk)

456
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,340
(Nai, I found a new job)

457
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,350
Li Jidong, what are you doing?

458
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,510
It's never too late to remedy the loss.

459
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,640
Am I right, little fish?

460
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,000
Eat more and grow bigger.

461
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,590
(What's your name?)

462
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,030
Jiang Jie.

463
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,240
What?

464
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,790
Qiang Xie.

465
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,510
Jiang Jie.

466
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,160
No worries, Qiang Xie.

467
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,030
I'll protect you later.

468
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,000
Jiang Jie.

469
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,480
Happy New Year.

470
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,270
Happy New Year.

471
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,880
Wrong password.

472
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,270
Don't touch it if you don't buy it.

473
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,680
How can I sell it if it is stained?

474
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,270
A pile of counterfeit goods.

475
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,680
I don't even wanna touch it.

476
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,830
What are you talking about?

477
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
I'm gonna call the police
if you keep messing around like this.

478
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,640
Do it.

479
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,480
Selling counterfeit goods,

480
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,310
you'll get fined and make compensations.

481
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,920
A real shark's fin

482
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,830
should be thicker and rounder on one end,

483
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
becoming thinner like a needle
on the other end.

484
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,160
And there is flesh
connecting the fin's needles.

485
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,000
So how does your fin meet the standards?

486
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,200
Finally we got an expert.

487
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,000
What did you say?

488
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,960
Call the police?

489
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:44,960
Do it.

490
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,310
Let's see what's gonna happen.

491
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,240
It's not counterfeit. It's...

492
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,400
Hands off!

493
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,790
Give it to me.

494
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,160
Never would I let you do this any more.

495
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,350
Sir,

496
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,240
here is a real one.

497
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,350
Take a look.

498
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,510
This one?

499
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,270
I'm telling you

500
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,510
don't sell counterfeits any more.

501
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,640
I promise I won't.

502
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,830
Where are you going?

503
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,070
Are you blind?

504
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,270
Sorry.

505
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,200
Sorry, buddy.

506
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,350
Sorry, buddy.

507
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,350
My...

508
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,590
My eyes

509
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,550
are blind,

510
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,790
so I can't see anything.

511
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:53,790
Boss!

512
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,960
Get him!

513
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,960
Where is he?

514
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,680
He's gone.

515
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,880
Boss, he is there.

516
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,270
Awake?

517
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,190
Sorry for bothering you.

518
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,000
Mister. I can pay for the ride.

519
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,630
How much should I pay?

520
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,880
Forget it.

521
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,030
Come. Have a sit.

522
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,630
Thank you.

523
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,360
You helped me

524
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,630
in the store before.

525
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,110
It's not a big deal.

526
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,880
They are two separate things.

527
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,960
The charges for the ride,

528
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,940
accomodation, and the increased fuel
for your weight...

529
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,400
Okay. Just tell me a number.

530
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,510
Five hundred?

531
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,320
Five thousand. Thank you.

532
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,030
Okay.

533
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,320
Have you seen my phone?

534
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,960
No.

535
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
Well... I'm sorry.

536
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,320
I've kinda lost my phone.

537
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,920
This is all I have with me.
I'm giving you this first.

538
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,320
Are you kidding me?

539
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,360
- No. I...
- Stand up!

540
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,510
With no money,
how are you gonna pay me?

541
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,392
No.

542
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,320
What if I buy a phone around here,
and apply for the SIM replacement?

543
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,190
You wish!

544
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,740
What if you slip away?
Where should I find you?

545
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,110
Stay here.

546
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,190
Mister,

547
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,070
you really think I'll slip away
for just five thousand yuan?

548
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,710
Then stop just

549
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,030
paying lip service.

550
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,280
Give me the money. Come on.
Where is your money?

551
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,920
Fine.

552
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,320
Then what do you want me to do?

553
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,700
(Elderly's Restaurant of Yu Village)

554
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,670
Everyone,

555
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,230
I'm introducing a new neighbor to you.

556
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,000
Master Ge,

557
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,110
who's this?

558
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,710
What a cute young man!

559
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,630
This is a new carer.

560
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,320
Anyone'd like to hire him
at 200 yuan per week?

561
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,550
Do you wanna hire him?

562
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,320
Easy.

563
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,880
Auntie Zhang.

564
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,960
Young man,

565
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,590
do you have a date?

566
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,190
I have a 28-year-old granddaughter.

567
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,550
Auntie Zhang,

568
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,440
it's only 500 yuan for a blind date.

569
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,510
No. It's too expensive. No.

570
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,710
300 yuan.

571
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,320
- 150 yuan.

573
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,190
Okay. 100 yuan it is.

574
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,960
50 yuan.

575
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,030
- 20 yuan.

576

Free of charge!

577
