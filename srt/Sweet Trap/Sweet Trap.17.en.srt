00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,400
Nobody needs your work?

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,310
- No.
- Your...

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,000
Your big and tall frame is wasted.

23
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,470
Shouldn't the dishes be clean at least?

24
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,470
What if they are not?

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,840
They are cheap,

26
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,190
so the diners shouldn't be picky.

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,630
As a cook,
how can you have no work ethic?

28
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,280
Stop talking nonsense.

29
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,870
Spend your time thinking about
how to pay me back.

30
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,280
Considering the condition you are in,

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,030
we can see you have no choice.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,520
But can he do it?

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
We are accustomed to your cooking.

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,150
If the food cooked by him
is not tasty...

35
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,400
Director,

36
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,960
he is only my assistant

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,030
and works under me.

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,590
The cooking is mainly my work.

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,910
I can do it with one hand.

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,030
Don't worry.
It's a piece of cake.

41
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,470
As a casual worker,

42
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,750
once you enter my kitchen,

43
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,120
you should obey me. Got it?

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,430
And about your pay...

45
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,820
I will give all my pay to you.

46
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,840
You are sensible.

47
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,980
Can you cook?

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,190
Forget about it. I can see you can't.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,630
You know how to wash the vegetables, right?
Come on, wash these vegetables.

51
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,960
Hello, I am here to collect my package.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,430
Go in to look for it yourself.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,150
- OK.
- Go ahead.

00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,150

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,020
(Eating at Dusk)
Come again, please. Bye.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,050
Come in, please. Bye-bye.

58
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,560
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

59
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,590
Thank you.

60
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Thank you.

61
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,870
Hello, how do you like the food today?

62
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,520
Chef Li,

63
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,750
the new dishes on the menu sell well

64
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,000
and are well-received.

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,750
Really?

66
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,720
Bye-bye. Thank you.

67
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
Bye-bye.

68
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,180
(Sold out today)

69
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,340
(Closed)

70
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,480
I am leaving, Chef.

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
Bye-bye.

72
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,190
- Jing, bye-bye.
- Bye, thank you for your hard work.

73
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,600
I can finally get off work and go home.

74
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,560
Chef Li,

75
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,680
is there anything else
you should do today?

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
Today we stopped work so early.

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,310
Don't you dare skip the interview again.

78
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,120
Let's go.

79
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,270
- Let's get started, Chef Li.
- OK.

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,510
After you defeated Jiang Jie
two months ago,

81
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,560
you stopped challenging
other famous chefs.

82
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
Do you have any future plans
for seizing knives?

83
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:03,070
No.

84
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,190
Are you worrying you can't defeat

85
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,430
Chef Jiang of Xijiangyue?

86
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,240
I took part in the knife-seizure contest

87
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,480
to get back what belongs to my master.

88
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,950
Now I have achieved that.

89
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,420
In the days to come,
I will focus on running my shop,

90
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,310
treat all guests heartily and

91
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,360
carry forward
the cooking philosophy of my master.

92
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,920
Some said you were the grass-root heroine
in Baichuan's catering industry.

93
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,480
You stopped Jiang Jie
seizing knives from the seven families

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,800
and saved the face
of the Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan.

95
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,720
Do you agree?

96
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,000
I said I seized the knife
for my master's sake

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,160
and it has nothing to do with others.

98
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,720
It is said that after you defeated Jiang Jie,
his fans attempted to assault you,

99
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,920
but he protected you.

100
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,040
Is that true?

101
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,630
Yes, it is true. However...

102
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,390
You ever worked in Chuncheng.

103
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,190
In the contest
between Chuncheng and Zhaoyeqing,

104
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,560
you acted as his assistant.

105
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,510
How do you define the relationship
between you two?

106
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,430
Sir, please ask questions
following the outline.

107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,310
We won't answer improvised questions.

108
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,120
Sorry. The last question.

109
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,950
Someone said Jiang Jie hadn't been seen
in Baichuan for two months.

110
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,190
Where exactly is he now?

111
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,950
Do you think he has left Baichuan?

112
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,980
Sorry, the interview is over.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,720
Please leave.

114
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,000
These reporters are foxy.

115
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,950
I have checked their interview outline,

116
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,560
but they changed the questions
at the site.

117
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:15,720
It has been two months
since Jiang Jie vanished.

118
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,750
Why bother mentioning him?

119
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,120
My shop and me are inseparable
from Jiang Jie. It's normal.

120
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,950
Sorry. I didn't do a good job this time.

121
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,120
Don't mind, Jingjing.

122
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,870
You have helped me with many things.

123
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,360
I haven't done enough.
Don't you remember our goal?

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,190
I suddenly thought of our first meeting.

125
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,830
But back then,

126
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:39,430
I was the one who wanted to hire you.

127
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,430
As long as you agree to work
in Eating at Dusk,

128
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,830
you can ask for anything you want.

129
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,190
To be honest,

130
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,950
I need not worry about food
and clothing and am rich,

131
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,510
so I have no reason to
condescend to work as a lobby manager.

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,750
But you like working
in the catering industry, right?

133
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,830
Did my dad tell you that?

134
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,120
I have accessed the information
of the alliance recently

135
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:00,920
and realized that

136
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,000
if you hadn't been beaten,

137
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,750
you would have run Zhaoyeqing
in a very different way.

138
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,360
Therefore,
I want to invite you to help in my shop.

139
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,310
Help with what?

140
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,680
Help your shop grow bigger and stronger?

141
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,160
I heard there is a rule
made by the alliance,

142
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,120
that is, the restaurant of the year
with the highest rating in all senses

143
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,630
can put forth a proposal about

144
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,120
the alliance's rules
in a new year at its meeting

145
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,750
and the alliance can't object.

146
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,830
What proposal do you want to put forth?

147
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,040
Of course I remember.

148
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,360
Our goal is to abolish
the knife-seizure system.

149
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,120
To accomplish our goal,

150
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,750
we need to make more efforts.

151
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,430
I must say

152
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,600
inviting you to work here is
the best decision I have ever made.

153
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,000
Ms. Zhao, please give me instructions.

154
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,870
For the next,

155
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,160
- let's wrap up and get changed.
- Go.

156
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,040
(Someone said Jiang Jie hadn't been seen
in Baichuan for two months.)

157
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,310
(Where exactly is he now?)

158
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,070
(Do you think he has left Baichuan?)

159
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,950
Hello. Here is your food.
Please offer a good review.

160
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,000
- OK. Thank you.
- Thank you.

161
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,270
I dropped in

162
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,390
on my way home.

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,950
Your shop is
over ten kilometers away from here.

164
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,430
You traveled far to arrive here.

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,840
You want to see Jiang Jie?
Sorry, he is not in.

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
Then I will take my leave.

167
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,240
Why do both of you
like seizing people's collars?

168
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,240
Have you slept with Jiang Jie?

169
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,600
You are a grown-up. Need you overreact?

170
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:11,658
We ever slept together.

171
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,030
How could it be possible?

172
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,270
Jiang Jie and...

173
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,910
You?

174
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,150
We are both grown-ups.
Why need I tell a lie?

175
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,480
When?

176
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,320
At that time.

177
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,840
When we were seizing the knife
from Zhaoyeqing. In the kitchen.

178
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,320
I knew it.

179
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,630
You fooled me.

180
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,120
I told the truth.

181
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,720
What do you want?

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,320
Do you fancy Jiang Jie?

183
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,600
Yes. I do fancy him.

184
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,510
Do you want to know where he is now?

185
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,200
Yes.

186
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,240
Drink all of them. Then I will tell you.

187
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,750
All of them?

188
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,910
Jie,

189
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,480
where are you?

190
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,720
(What is the matter?)

191
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,080
Can you tell me where he is now?

192
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:01,960
Of course.

193
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,320
Sorry.

194
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,910
This is

195
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,270
the chat history from two months ago.

196
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,750
You haven't seen Cui Can
for quite a while, right?

197
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,360
Don't try to tantalize me.

198
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
I am not as stupid as you.

199
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,720
I just know

200
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,390
the cat-and-mouse strategy

201
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,510
only works on one's lover.

202
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,360
He wasted two months in vain.

203
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,960
So pathetic.

204
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,120
He had to hide here and there.

205
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,240
Where is he?

206
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,910
He is not worthy of my care.

207
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,390
Jiang Xiu.

208
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,360
Jiang Xiu.

209
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,870
You...

210
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,270
Who are you?

211
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,720
Jiang Xiu.

212
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,960
Where is

213
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Jiang Jie?

214
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,790
Li Nai,

215
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,320
I recognized you. You are...

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,670
Li Nai.

217
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,720
Jiang Jie's goal

218
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,390
is always the same.

219
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,270
When he is back,

220
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,870
you will

221
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,960
be

222
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,840
done for.

223
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,240
Jiang Jie's goal?

224
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,820
(I don't know where Cui Can is.
I won this time!)

225
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,750
Hello. Are you the designated driver?

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I reached the gate.

227
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,200
What crappy living quarters?

228
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,800
The designated driver is unwilling to come.

229
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,550
Sir. Madam.

230
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,510
You are back?

231
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,840
- Jie.
- Ride it carefully.

232
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,180
- Jiang.
- Hello.

233
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,360
I'll replace the flowerpot
for Mrs. Sun in a while.

234
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,200
Second uncle's cell phone was fixed.

235
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,240
I will bring it to him.

236
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,200
You

237
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,270
have worked under me for two months.

238
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,600
When will you
return the 5,000 yuan to me?

239
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,720
Here is 6,300 yuan in total.

240
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,630
It includes my return trip expenses.

241
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,360
How much do you want?

242
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,550
You are capable.

243
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,030
You deserve to be
a member of the Jiang family.

244
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,360
You can thrive wherever you go.

245
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,790
Which Jiang family do you mean?

246
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,200
I can use the Internet here.

247
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
How can I not know you, Jiang Jie?

248
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,790
You almost turned Baichuan upside down.

249
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,600
Ge Qunshan,

250
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,600
you recognized me
at the beginning, right?

251
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,750
Why didn't you tell me till now?

252
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,390
You also knew I am Ge Qunshan,
didn't you?

253
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,670
Then why didn't you order me to cook?

254
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,240
Won't it be quick this way?

255
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,030
Do you think anyone
can be the Chef here?

256
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,870
Just because you can cook
doesn't mean you can cook here.

257
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,000
I know what you want.

258
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,790
You want the crappy knife, right?

259
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,960
I will give it to you if you want it.

260
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,414
What do you want in return?

261
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,080
You are clever.

262
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,000
- Can you play chess?
- No.

263
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,120
It is simple.

264
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,480
If you beat all the villagers here
in the chess game,

265
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,720
that knife will be yours.

266
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,030
I told you I can't play it.

267
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,080
When you thought of
seizing the Jiang family's knife,

268
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,200
could you cook?

269
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,550
You couldn't, right?

270
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,840
Checkmate.

271
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,910
Do you know how to play chess?

272
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,720
You should move the piece
in this way.

273
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,240
Fatty started learning chess a year ago.

274
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,830
He is the weakest player in the village.

275
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,310
But this guy has been losing all morning.

276
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,310
Should Fatty go easy on him?

277
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,750
He should fight for victory

278
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
and others can't concede him victory.

279
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,750
This is a good move, right?

280
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,110
Use your mind.

281
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,200
Because we lost the supply from Xijiangyue,

282
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,420
our purchase prices rose by nearly 40%.

283
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,830
If we can't solve this problem,
we'll have to raise the price of our food.

284
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,550
Boss, we have to raise the price.

285
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,680
Raise the price?

286
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,200
We only opened our shop
less than one year ago.

287
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,480
We definitely can't raise the price.

288
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,110
Otherwise, our reputation
will be ruined.

289
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,720
Our business has been good recently.

290
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,200
Actually, we can raise the price.

291
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,200
Baichuan is a small place.

292
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,830
You know clearly
how much good ingredients cost.

293
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,000
If we don't raise the price,
we'll always be in the red.

294
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:56,440
Back then, the suppliers of our Zhaoyeqing
sold ingredients

295
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
at a higher price than this.

296
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,240
How about we start from
the top of the supply chain?

297
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,200
That will be a lot of work.

298
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,750
Do you know the number of
the agricultural bases around here

299
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,200
and the number of
the distributing and wholesale centers?

300
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,920
Do you know what Jiang Jie will do
facing such a cost problem?

301
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,480
You went to see him last evening?

302
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes. But I didn't see him.

303
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I really don't know
how Jiang Jie will solve this problem,

304
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,440
but I do know

305
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,790
if we don't solve this problem,

306
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,880
we will have to raise the price.

307
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,750
Therefore,

308
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,030
let's go find solutions in the market.

309
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,590
As you wish, Miss Zhao.

310
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,680
How many times did you lose today?

311
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,510
Twenty times.

312
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,880
This is unexpected.

313
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,270
Your defeats will soon outnumber
your victories in the knife-seizure contest.

314
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,680
I won't keep losing.

315
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,200
You had better not.

316
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,960
It's better that way.

317
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,030
Don't keep me waiting for too long.

318
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,110
Stop studying it today.

319
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,830
Go downtown
to transport some goods for me.

320
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,240
- Aren't you afraid that I will run away?
- Will you?

321
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,480
You again?

322
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,000
Don't sell me shoddy goods.

323
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,750
I can tell.

324
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,030
Rest assured.
I know you are well-informed.

325
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,000
Just a moment.
I will prepare the goods for you.

326
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,830
Why do you look so familiar?

327
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,200
Are you that...

328
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,350
Sir, I am in a hurry. Please be quick.

329
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,240
The goods here are really superior,

330
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,790
but the wholesale price is too high.

331
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,750
We have visited quite a few shops.

332
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,750
If there's no way here,
we will visit the production base.

333
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,750
Though around here, there are
many agricultural product bases,

334
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,830
most of them
are in cooperation with the alliance.

335
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,400
Now their attitudes are vague.

336
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,830
Your visit may not be welcome.

337
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,200
How can they give up
lucrative business opportunities?

338
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,510
I also know another businessman.
I will make a call and ask.

339
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,440
Jiang Jie?

340
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,640
Who?

341
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,310
The driver seems to be Jiang Jie.

342
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,350
Are you clear-headed?

343
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,640
How could a goods van driver
be Jiang Jie?

344
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
You are right.

345
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,880
He didn't answer the phone.

346
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,720
Let's continue our search.

347
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,550
Let's go.

348
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,100
(Yu Village)

349
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,220
(Lijia Village; Anxi County)

350
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,240
(Baichuan's seven families)
Li jidong, you dropped litter again.

351
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,160
Don't throw it away.

352
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,160
I promised Nai a square weekend meal.

353
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,580
(Chef Ge Qunshan retired mystically)

354
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,790
(Jiang Jie's goal is always the same.)

355
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,310
Jiang Jie's goal is
to win the knife-seizure contest.

356
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,400
Before I beat him in the contest,

357
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,110
he was planning to visit Ge Qunshan.

358
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,380
(Qingfengnian's Chef Ge Qunshan
shows up in Yu Village)

359
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,400
Li Jidong!

360
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,400
Let's go eat a big meal at weekends.

361
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,750
We will eat the freshest food.

362
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,830
Checkmate.

363
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,790
Within only a few days,

364
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,510
you made remarkable progress.

365
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
It's because you taught me well.

366
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,160
You young people are keen-witted.

367
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,240
In the past few days,

368
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,720
you have defeated Liu,

369
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,790
Li and Zhang.

370
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,550
Now you even defeated me.

371
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
For the next,

372
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,480
you only need to make another move.

373
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,160
It's time to go home and have a meal.

374
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,270
Ge Qunshan,

375
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
I want to play chess with you.

376
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
Can't you see I am cooking noodles?

377
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,110
Let's do it now.

378
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,880
All right. Get out the chessboard.

379
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,960
Checkmate.

380
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,510
Come on.

381
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,790
From a man who can't play chess

382
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,440
to a man who deserves to
play chess with you,

383
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,640
I thought I made fast progress.

384
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,070
You really did.

385
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,000
But in fact,

386
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,400
all your moves on the chessboard
are flawed.

387
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,640
Flawed?

388
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,030
That's because

389
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,590
since you dropped the first piece,

390
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,350
you have been thinking about winning.

391
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,270
I am not skilled at chess,

392
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,480
so I must fight a quick battle

393
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,070
to win.

394
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,590
Thus, we say

395
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,480
one cannon can't bring victory and
one horse can't cross the river safely.

396
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,200
Today I am expecting an important guest.

397
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Help me pick her up.

398
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,510
Don't cause me any trouble.

399
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,270
Meanwhile, go purchase some wine.

400
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,070
Why are you still here? Go quickly!

401
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,310
A big fish. Big fish.

402
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,440
That is a big carp.

403
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,590
Big carp! Great! Wonderful!

404
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,820
- I will go catch it.
- Li Jidong, wait for me.

405
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,070
I will make a call.

406
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,550
I arrived.

407
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,240
I have contacted them.

408
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,400
Tend the shop for me, please.

409
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,400
I know. I'll go back ASAP.

410
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:31,960
Bye-bye.

411
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,640
Li Jidong!

412
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,270
Li Jidong!

413
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,510
Li Jidong!

414
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,440
Mrs. Li.

415
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,480
You are purchasing wine for Ge again?

416
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,720
Yes. Please fill this pot.

417
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,160
OK. You should persuade Ge.

418
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,640
Though my wine is good,

419
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,480
drinking too much is bad for health.

420
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,830
I will be so glad if he listens to me.

421
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,920
Just try persuading him.

422
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,240
Maybe he will listen to you.

423
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,480
I personally think

424
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,720
Ge is quite patient with you.

425
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,000
Grandma,

426
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
I want lollipops.

427
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,790
You want it again?

428
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,920
Didn't we agree you eat one a day?
Don't you want your teeth to be good?

429
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,310
I won't eat it.

430
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,480
I will give it to him.

431
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,480
Qiang Xie.

432
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,590
Mr. Li.

433
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,550
Jie.

434
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,960
Do you know him?

435
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,750
He seems to have got lost.

436
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,550
Mr. Li,

437
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,240
why are you here?

438
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,350
Well, no. Where is Li Nai?

439
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,440
- Nai?
- Right, Nai.

440
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,920
Where, where is Nai?

441
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,440
Could Nai have got lost?

442
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,070
Nai!

443
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,310
Nai!

444
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,640
Li Jidong!

445
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,260
(Nai, have you got lost?)

446
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,070
(Come here quickly.)

447
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,070
Where, where is this place?

448
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,110
The entrance to the elderly's canteen.

449
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,240
(Hurry to the gate
of the elderly's canteen.)

450
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,400
(If you can't find it, ask the villagers.)

451
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,400
Li Jidong.

452
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,350
- Nai.
- You scared me.

453
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,830
Nai, don't run around alone again.
Do you get it?

454
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,640
All right. I got it.

455
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,680
I was so worried.

456
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,510
Listen to me. I saw Qiang Xie.

457
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,590
Jiang Jie.

458
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,390
Jiang Jie!

459
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,590
What a coincidence!

460
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,720
Is it accidental or deliberately planned?

461
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,720
I thought at least you
wouldn't use your father as a tool.

462
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,070
It's not what you think.

463
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,830
I, I guessed you are here.

464
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,480
Li Jidong just got lost accidentally.

465
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,400
I hope so.

466
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,640
Jiang Jie!

467
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,110
I should be useless to you now, right?

468
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,200
No, it is not that.
I only want to ask you

469
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,350
whether you know where Ge Qunshan lives.

470
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,110
Did you investigate me?

471
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,200
- I didn't. I only...
- Only what?

472
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,880
What unspeakable reason
do you have this time?

473
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,270
Is it because
you're addicted to knife-seizure?

474
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,110
Is Ge Qunshan your new target?

475
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,110
I am only here
to investigate the ingredients.

476
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,440
It has been two months since we last met.
You are worse at telling lies.

477
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,920
What? The ingredients of Xijiangyue
are not enough for your shop?

478
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:24,683
Why are you here
instead of the village entrance?

479
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,440
I was stalled by something.

480
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,070
Mr. Ge, I am Li Nai.
I have contacted you through WeChat.

481
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,030
- Li Nai, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

482
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,880
Why did you bring her here?

483
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,750
This is the canteen.

484
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,160
You are pulling a long face again.

485
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,880
We said we were hungry.

486
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,480
That is why he brought us here.

487
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,030
You, you haven't had a meal?

488
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,550
That man...

489
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,750
He is my dad.

490
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,440
All right. Take a seat.

491
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,070
I will cook you something to eat.
Take a seat.

492
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,110
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

493
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,790
Food is coming.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

494
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,920
If you don't need me, I will be off.

495
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,960
Jiang Jie,

496
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,880
aren't you and Mr. Ge eating with us?

497
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,550
Kindness shouldn't be refused.
I will eat more.

498
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,680
I've had my meal.

499
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,030
Qiang Xie,

500
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,920
be seated and eat with us. Be seated.

501
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,920
Jiang Jie, go fetch
two sets of chopsticks and bowls.

502
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Come on, dig in.

503
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,440
Li Nai, you said you would investigate
the ingredients.

504
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,880
The fastest way to do that is eating.

505
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,880
Look! Jiang Jie dug out all these
this morning.

506
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,030
Jiang Jie dug them out?

507
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,500
He dug them out, washed off the dirt
and cut them into pieces.

508
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,240
It is delicious.

509
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,780
Jiang Jie, your cooking skills
improved again.

510
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,830
However, I cooked the dishes.

511
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,510
Now he is only my assistant.

512
00:30:04,938 --> 00:30:06,030
He is not qualified to cook dishes.

513
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,680
Sorry.

514
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,880
Anyway, the dish is very tasty.

515
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,000
Come on, eat.

516
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,240
By the way, Jiang Jie,

517
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,110
in the coming days,

518
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,680
you should keep them company
and show them around in the village.

519
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,920
You should also treat them to

520
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,967
the special local dishes
made with special local ingredients.

521
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:23,880
Why should I?

522
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,270
Customers come first.

523
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,510
They will pay us.

524
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,000
He will do whatever you say.
Just give him instructions.

525
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,440
I am stuffed.

526
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,830
He is bad-tempered.

527
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,510
Can pride feed him?

528
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,110
He is not sensible.

529
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,440
It's all right. He doesn't want to see me.

530
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,440
Li Nai,

531
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,680
did you come to our Yu Village
because of Jiang Jie?

532
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,340
I do want to find an agricultural base
for long-term cooperation.

533
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,400
You did come here
for Jiang Jie's sake, right?

534
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,030
Yes. He has been away for quite a while.

535
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,030
Why are you here?

536
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,720
I am asking why you are here.

537
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,830
What did you say just now?

538
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,750
Why are you here?

539
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,720
Mr. Ge said the village hostel
was not comfortable

540
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,070
and invited us to stay at his home.

541
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Sorry. We occupied your room.

542
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,589
How long will your investigation last?

543
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,240
It was supposed to last two days.

544
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,400
But I can prolong it.

545
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,240
Leave quickly when it is the time.

546
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,920
Moreover,
stay away from me during your stay.

547
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,440
I am afraid I can't promise you.

548
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,510
What do you mean?

549
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,310
Mr. Ge wants you to take me out
for a field survey this afternoon.

550
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,160
Ge Qunshan!

551
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,110
Ge Qunshan!

552
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,350
(You were paid 10,000 yuan via Alipay.)

553
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,880
Old chap, your daughter is generous.

554
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,750
Let's go.

555
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,720
I will take you to buy candies.

556
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,030
Great!

557
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,830
Jiang Jie,

558
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,480
I heard that Yu Village
grows delicious vegetables.

559
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,070
This is my first visit to the field.
You will have to teach me by then.

560
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,590
Li Nai, can you be quiet?

561
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,310
The villagers are napping after lunch.

562
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,550
Shouldn't vegetables be collected
in the morning?

563
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,440
It is the most nutritious
after being in the sun during the day.

564
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,030
I see.

565
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Which one should we take?

566
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,880
The ones

567
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,400
like this one can be harvested.

568
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,047
OK.

569
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,510
I am fine.

570
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,590
I will get into trouble
if your hands are hurt, Chef Li.

571
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,790
Thank you.

572
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,960
Organic fertilizer.

573
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,720
In other words, manure is applied.

574
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:37,380
(Jie)

575
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,680
(Hello, the number you dialed...)

576
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,880
Jiang Jie,

577
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,760
are you thirsty?
Would you like some water?

578
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,590
I am not.

579
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,190
During your two-month absence,

580
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,000
Baichuan changed a lot.
Do you want to hear?

581
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,360
I have access to the Internet here.

582
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,590
How is Jiang Xiu these days?

583
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,550
She is doing well.

584
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,440
We ate a late-night snack together
a couple of days ago.

585
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,960
She asked about Cui Can.
There is nothing else worth mentioning.

586
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,670
By the way,

587
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,150
Cui Can no longer works in Eating at Dusk.
His whereabouts is unknown.

588
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,440
- I can't reach him these days.
- Li Nai,

589
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,920
I am only interested in
Jiang Xiu's affairs.

590
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,960
Let's go on talking about Jiang Xiu.

591
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,230
Since she became the Chef of Xijiangyue,

592
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,590
her reputation is getting better.

593
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,510
Can't you be careful?

594
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,230
You'd better lead the way.
