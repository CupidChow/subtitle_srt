Li Jidong, why are you back so early?

25
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,800
I came back
right after the activity was over.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,470
Today is the first day
of the freshman year. You can't be late.

27
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,870
Why are you still in bed?

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,910
Hurry and freshen up.

29
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,910
Chop, chop, chop.

30
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,080
- I'll make the bed for you.
- Oh, got it.

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,840
Wait. Hold on.

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,400
Come here.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Here. Go out with me.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,750
Go out. Let me tell you.

35
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,800
Well, Li Jidong.

36
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,080
I'm a bit hungry.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,960
Make breakfast for me
in the kitchen, okay?

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,000
Then I'll go get changed, okay?

39
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,240
Sure.

40
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,470
But it's your first day of high school.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,430
I'll teach you to make the bed.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,150
Nai.

43
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,630
Are you

44
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,960
in love?

45
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,840
What?

46
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,520
Why is there such short hair?

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,680
This is your hair, Li Jidong!

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,560
Are you under too much pressure lately?

49
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,430
You're getting a bit bald.

50
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,430
Come here. Let me take a look.

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,280
Maybe I didn't see it clearly.

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
Let me take a close look at you.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,280
Oh my, you've got gray hair.

54
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,590
Well, here's gray hair too.

55
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,870
Here it is. Here it is.

56
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,120
- Where is it?
- Eh, here.

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,240
I'll take a careful look for you.

58
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,000
Here it is.

59
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,030
This side is fine.

60
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,840
Where is it?

61
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,310
Well, eh, not here.

62
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,280
There are two strands of hair.

63
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,470
It's okay. It's okay.

64
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,800
It's fine. It's fine.

65
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,590
You can look at yourself in the mirror.

66
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,950
You must rest well these days.

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,040
You've got gray hair.

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,510
I almost forgot this. Got to go.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,310
Wait.

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,430
See you later.

71
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,190
Jiang Jie has joined the Li family.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,480
How well-informed of you!

73
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,750
He and Li Nai have stirred up
so many things.

74
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,510
It's like a melodrama.
He's such a disgrace.

75
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,680
Luckily, I didn't bring him back.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,070
You're right.

77
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,630
After all, our family has already got

78
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,720
a class clown as Uncle Yuanfeng!

79
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,120
Nonsense!

80
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,000
Grandpa,

81
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,560
since the affair of Eating at Dusk,

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,240
dad has suffered fractures,

83
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,190
and he's in hospital for a while.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,070
How about...

85
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,000
Let him rest well there.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,160
No need to hurry back.

87
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,560
And I heard you've been close
to that secretary lately.

Don't be as muddleheaded as Jiang Jie.

89
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,120
Don't follow your father's example either.

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,160
Back then, because your dad hooked up
with your mother,

91
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,000
he became increasingly absurd.

92
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,480
I won't, Grandpa.

93
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,270

186
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,150
It didn't take long to make the cake,
but a long time to conceive the shape.

187
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,550
That cake is

188
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,030
round.

189
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,120
Nonsense.

190
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,030
Li Nai!

191
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,440
I'm coming.

192
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,270
What's going on?

193
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,270
Jiang Jie was trying the dish.

194
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,720
And it tasted so bad that he fell
to the ground?

195
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,150
Just tell me why you came to me.

196
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,720
I need to ask for leave.

197
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,390
I meant to come early
and arrange everything.

198
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,840
But since you're here...

199
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll leave the restaurant to you.

200
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,750
- Just get going. Go.
- I'm off then.

201
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,720
Bye.

202
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,320
Jiang Jie.

203
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,440
Jiang Jie.

204
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,360
Li Nai.

205
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,670
Is our relationship so unpresentable?

206
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,150
Of course not.

207
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,440
It's just that I seized your knife

208
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,030
and you seized Jingjing's knife.

209
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,750
Now the three of us are working
in a restaurant.

210
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,550
I'm afraid Jingjing will feel upset
when she sees us being lovey-dovey.

211
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,960
Aren't you afraid I may feel upset?

212
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,240
Jiang Jie.

213
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,440
Jiang Jie.

214
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,720
- By the end of the Alliance Meeting.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,360
Besides,

216
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,960
while our relationship is concealed,
you must make it up to me.

The door is locked.

223
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,440
It's not the closing time yet.

224
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,840

229

Ma'am, it's 3,425 yuan in total.
May I ask how you're gonna pay?

230
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
- By credit card.
- Okay.

231
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,270
Oh right, Ma'am.

232
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,960
We can offer free delivery to your car
if you spend more than 1,000 yuan.

233
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
May I ask
where your husband's car is parked?

234
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,910
He's a bit busy. He didn't come with me.

235
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,750
Okay.

236
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,670
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,840
Is this the first time you've got here?

238
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,120
I've heard this from my sister.

239
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,000
I was once brought here
after I was just born.

240
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,080
That was more than 20 years ago.

241
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,910
Mr. Jiang.

242
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,480
It's my bad.

243
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,960
I should've visited you more often.

244
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,910
Today, I asked you to come here

245
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,390
because I need to ask a favor of you.

246
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,440
Just let me know what you need.

247
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,670
I know you're currently working
at the Alliance.

248
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
This year's Alliance Meeting is scheduled

249
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,390
to be held next Wednesday.

250
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,480
Yeah, this is the current arrangement.

251
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,910
I'm a bit embarrassed to say this.

252
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,270
Next Wednesday

253
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,120
happens to be my 70th birthday.

254
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,270
How about this?

255
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,270
I'll go back and ask if it's possible

256
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,360
- to stagger the time.
- No.

257
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,790
That's not necessary.

258
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,240
The Alliance Meeting is a huge thing.

259
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,960
How can its time be changed for me?
No way.

260
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,080
But

261
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,910
since the two dates have coincided,

262
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,630
it happens

263
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,390
Xijiangyue is the No. 1 of this year.

264
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,360
How about celebrating two events

265
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,320
- at the same time?
- Celebrating them at the same time?

266
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,440
Well, this year, the Alliance has come
across a lot of things.

267
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,150
Like, your master's Xue's Noodles

268
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,550
and the Zhao family's Zhaoyeqing are
both closed.

269
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,670
As a senior,

270
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,870
I should do something.

271
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,150
I wanna draw the young people

272
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,360
of the seven families

273
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,550
and the Alliance together.

274
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,840
I got it, Mr. Jiang.

275
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,870
I'll tell them your idea.

276
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,720
You've followed me all the way.
Will you stop it?

277
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,510
Cao Liang!

278
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,080
Let me tell you.
I don't care what my grandpa tells you.

279
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,550
I won't like you or cooperate with you.

280
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,120
Miss Jiang, don't rush to reject me.

281
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,030
Mr. Jiang is looking for a suitable man
for you in the Alliance.

282
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:24,550
How can there be any good man
in the Alliance?

283
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,240
They're merely some good-for-nothing

284
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,080
who covet the Jiang family's position.

285
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,320
Don't make it sound like you're not.

286
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,030
Of course I'm different.

287
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,510
I have Cao's Fish which is
only second to Xijiangyue.

288
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,870
I'm not after your position.

289
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,240
But if you need help,

290
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,120
I have enough experience.

291
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,720
Another man may be an appendage,

292
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,120
but we can be partners.

293
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,080
Are you done?

294
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,150
You're obviously calculating.

295
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,440
Since you covet nothing,

296
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,600
why are you badgering me?

297
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,630
Of course it's because I like you.

298
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,480
Don't worry.

299
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,480
I won't ask you to cooperate.

300
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,160
Instead, I'm at your service anytime.
Like, now.

301
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,240
You're...

302
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,440
Cao Liang, didn't you say
you wanted to see my room?

303
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
What are you waiting for?

304
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,240
- Mr. Jiang.
- It's okay.

305
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,880
Xiu is always so willful.

306
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,000
Just let her be.

307
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,640
I have a visitor here.

308
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,720
I won't see you off then.

309
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,400
Never mind.

310
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,750
When the plan comes out,

311
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,000
I'll tell you at once.

312
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,590
It's a deal then.

313
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,160
Thank you for your hard work.

314
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,400
See you next time.

315
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,830
Mind how you go. Bye.

316
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,240
Why are you here? Where's Wang?

317
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,640
I asked him not to come.

318
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,680
I'm worried you may feel sick
after drinking,

319
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,830
and he can't take good care of you.

320
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,720
You've worried too much.

321
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,000
Just leave this to Wang.

322
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,920
I can't be reassured.

323
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,240
Xuyang,

324
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,270
will you return to Shengting tonight?

325
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,400
I've got something to show you.

326
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,680
I won't go back for now.

327
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,270
I need to go to Li Park.

328
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,350
It's my grandpa's arrangement.

329
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,720
You still have to socialize later?

330
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Yes, it's for a private business.

331
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,400
With the daughter of Mr. Zhang
from Zhengguang.

332
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,000
Did you not use the additional card
I gave you lately?

333
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,310
I've never received any message
of your spending.

334
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,880
Yes, I did.

335
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,640
Maybe the messages are blocked
as trash messages.

336
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,640
Anyway, whatever you wanna buy,

337
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
just buy it

338
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,030
as you like.

339
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,070
I've got things to do.

340
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,720
Take care when you go home.

341
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,220
(Your credit card spent 1,032 yuan
in a maternal and infant store.)

342
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,900
(Is it normal to miss my boyfriend
after just seeing him?)

343
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,300
(Is it normal to miss my boyfriend
after ten minutes?)

344
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,860
(What if I want to be with my love
every day?)

345
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,350
Xiu has stopped loving me.
What should I do?

346
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,920
Li Nai, what should I do?

347
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,160
I've never been to her room.

348
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,240
How can he...

349
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,750
Don't wake Li Jidong up.

350
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

351
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,000
Xiu doesn't love me anymore.
What should I do?

352
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,550
It serves you right.

353
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,550
It was fine for you to be a spy.
Why did you ghost her?

354
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,070
Well, you ghosted her. Fine.

355
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,640
Why did you reject her

356
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,000
when Jiang Ziqing tried to set you two up?

357
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,640
If I were with Xiu,

358
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,070
my sister and Jiang Xuyang wouldn't
trust me for sure.

359
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,480
They'd take precautions against me.

360
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,000
Why don't you come back?

361
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,480
Just as well Eating at Dusk is aiming
to be the No. 1 of next year.

362
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,110
You can apologize to Jiang Xiu.
I'll help you.

363
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,830
Do you think she'll forgive me?

364
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,640
I'll ask Jiang Jie to help you.

365
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,440
No, no, no.

366
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,750
Then you can continue being the mole

367
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,310
and watch Jiang Xiu

368
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,880
live a happy life with another man.

369
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Li Nai, listen to me.

370
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,550
Hear me out, Li Nai.

371
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,240
Here's the thing.

372
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,640
The Alliance Meeting is about to begin.

373
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
I'm thinking if Jiang Xuyang
has any plan,

374
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,750
I can let you know in the first place.

375
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,030
Besides, you know,

376
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,400
the Alliance Meeting and Jiang Ziqing's
birthday party will be held together.

377
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,920
Be held together?

378
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,350
It's such a huge thing,
but you didn't tell me until now.

379
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,680
What's wrong? Got any plans?

380
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,270
Not really.

381
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,830
Oh no.

382
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,880
Yes, I do. I have a plan.

383
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,310
If it can be realized,

384
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,030
without Jiang Jie's help,

385
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,070
Jiang Xiu will forgive you.

386
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,440
(Something came up all of a sudden.)

387
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,070
(Next time we're on day-off,)

388
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,590
(I'll definitely accompany you
to do what you wanna do together.)

389
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,400
Hello, Jingjing.

390
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,720
(Chef, help me take care of my child.)

391
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,780
(Xijiangyue)

392
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,310
We need to talk.

393
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,750
The lunch time is about to start.

394
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,590
Let's talk after that.

395
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,750
Your child?

396
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
- Your birth child?
- Of course.

397
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,480
You're married?

398
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
And your child is already so big.

399
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,110
It's a long story.

400
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,480
I have plenty of time.

401
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,480
Anyway,

402
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,920
my ex-husband suddenly died.

403
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,350
Now I need to go to his funeral.

404
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,480
My dad is abroad. So...

405
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,240
I need you to take care of my child.

406
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,960
But I've never
taken care of a child before.

407
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,640
Didn't you babysit your dad before?
It's more or less the same.

408
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,200
Look at her! How adorable!

409
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,640
Zaizai, say hi to this lady.

410
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,510
Hello.

411
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,920
Don't you want to experience what it'll
be like after you marry Jiang Jie?

412
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,960
- How did you know this?
- I'm not blind.

413
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,680
Don't you mind it?

414
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,030
Why would I mind it?

415
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,550
As long as you pay me the salary on time,

416
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,510
just be with anyone as you like.

417
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,240
Fine, just leave this kid to me.

418
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,550
Zaizai, call me gorgeous.

419
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,830
Aunt Nai.

420
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,160
Gorgeous.

421
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,750
- Aunt Nai.
- Gorgeous. Gorgeous.

422
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,750
Call me gorgeous.

423
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,960
I need to go back by car. I can't drink.

424
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,790
Let's drink this.

425
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,240
How did he threaten you?

426
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,920
Can't it be my voluntary choice?

427
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,350
- You wouldn't.
- Like I said,

428
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,750
we're taking two different paths.

429
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,000
So, I would.

430
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,750
Did you forget why your father

431
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,550
left Xijiangyue back then?

432
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,350
Did you forget what he had suffered?

433
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,640
All I remember

434
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
is he worked for the Jiang family
as the Sous Chef all his life.

435
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,790
And he was forced to be
Jiang Yuanfeng's substitute.

436
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,240
Afterward, he only wanted to open
his own restaurant.

437
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,469
But he was suppressed by Jiang Yuanfeng
and had to stop being a chef.

438
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,440
Just because I remember all of that,

439
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,030
I joined Xijiangyue.

440
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,640
Jiang Xuyang promised you
the position of Head Chef?

441
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,160
You're making the same mistake.

442
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,400
Do you know what he's up to?

443
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,030
He and Cui Jing

444
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,640
plan to open the restaurants in Baichuan

445
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,720
across the country in the form
of chain restaurants.

446
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,240
In his eyes, a chef is merely

447
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,160
a tool that can be replaced anytime.

448
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,790
It's none of my business.

449
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,440
Jiang Jie, do you think you're awesome?

450
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,750
Without you and Chuncheng,

451
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,720
I can be a Chef anyway.

452
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,160
This is what the Jiang family
owes my family.

453
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,000
Jiang Jie, you're finally back.

454
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,160
You're finally back.

455
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,110
Hello. Come here. Get up. Get up.

456
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,030
Li Nai, who is this?

457
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,110
Jiang Jie, I don't know your door code.

458
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,880
Jiang Jie, I don't know your door code.

459
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,030
Which question is more important now?

460
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,920
I don't know your door code.

461
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,440
(010, the door is unlocked.)

462
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,310
Our love anniversary?

463
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,270
Childish!

464
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,350
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

465
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,070
- What's wrong?
- We've got a kid here.

466
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,920
So what?

467
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,550
You haven't told me yet.

468
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,590
She's Jingjing's daughter, Zaizai.

469
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,310
Jingjing's child?

470
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,550
I wanna fly a kite.

471
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,310
This kite is of poor quality.

472
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,790
Aunt Nai, you can't fly it.

473
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,590
I'm Gorgeous.

474
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,440
I'll take her to fly the kite. Zaizai.

475
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,270
- I'll take you to fly the kite.
- Okay.

476
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,920
Take a rest over there.

477
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,750
Aunt Nai is so childish.

478
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,200
It's Gorgeous.

She's finally sleeping.

505
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,550
I'm exhausted.

506
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,750
I'll have two babies in the future

507
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,200
so that they can play with each other.

508
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,680
We'll have two babies.

509
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,070
You're taking advantage of me.

510
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,200
Who will have babies with you?

511
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,270
If you don't have babies with me,

512
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,830
with whom will you have babies?

513
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,510
Are you mad?

514
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,070
Seriously?

515
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,440
Don't be mad.

516
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,400
If you keep doing this, I'll go

517
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:30,830
ballistic.

518
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,640
Didn't you say she had fallen asleep?

519
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,880
She was indeed sleeping when I got out.

520
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,830
Zaizai, be careful.

521
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,780
(Eating at Dusk)

522
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,240
What's wrong with you?

523
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,160
Did Zaizai cause trouble?

524
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,590
No.

525
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,030
She just taught us a lesson.

526
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,070
We can't handle two.

527
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,440
Hello, here's your parcel.

528
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,110
The Alliance has made a new move.

529
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,980
(Invitation)

530
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,440
Coincidentally, Mr. Jiang will celebrate
his 70th birthday.

531
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,110
This year's Alliance Meeting will be held
in the form of a dinner party.

532
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,350
Li Nai, Chef of Eating at Dusk,
is cordially invited to the event.

533
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,480
The Alliance Meeting and Jiang Ziqing's
birthday party are held on the same day.

534
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,160
I smelt a rat.

535
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,510
Jiang Ziqing must wanna take the chance
to enhance the seven families' position.

536
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
After all, his grandson
has made great waves.

537
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,270
This is what the Alliance wants.

538
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,700
- They also wanna hype it up.
- Shall we attend the event?

539
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,680
- Of course.
- Sure.

540
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,960
We're striving to be the No. 1
of next year.

541
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,960
Since the proposal system,

542
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,680
Xijiangyue has been No. 1 for 20 years
in a row.

543
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,110
That is, our opponent next year is
Xijiangyue.

544
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,920
Know the enemy and yourself,
and in every battle you will be victorious.

545
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,750
Turning down the extra money...

546
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,960
Would be a foolish act.

547
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,500
(Li Nai is specially invited
to cook for the dinner party)

548
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,580
(Promote new five-star restaurants
to fill the seven families)

549
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,830
As for the Initiative Ordinance of the
Alliance Meeting, you can refer to this.

550
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,960
Well.

551
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,590
Any problems?

552
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,720
Promote the new five-star restaurants
to fill up the seven families.

553
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,480
Will the other restaurants be dissatisfied?

554
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,350
The positions of the Caos, the Lis,
the Chais remain unchanged.

555
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,200
How can they have any problems?

556
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,440
As for the Xues, the Ges, and the Zhaos,

557
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,580
they don't even have the face
to maintain a foothold in Baichuan.

558
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,110
Even if they have any problems,
it doesn't matter.

559
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,830
But even so,

560
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,310
they've been passed down for 200 years.

561
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,880
It's the name of the seven families
that's been passed down for 200 years.

562
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,590
Now the selected restaurants,

563
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,880
in 200 years,

564
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,960
will be century-old restaurants too.

565
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,920
Without soldiers,

566
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,830
how could the Jiang family be
the general?

567
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,510
Yes, Grandpa.

568
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,070
How impressive!

569
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,720
If it really works,

570
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,200
our plan for the chain restaurants will
be off the table.

571
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,960
(How is it going with
what I asked you to do?)

572
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,590
Rest assured. The invitation will
be delivered on time.

573
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,440
(Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan Invitation)
We need to fan the flame.

574
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,790
You're so harsh.

575
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,310
Jing,

576
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:11,920
who were you speaking to on the phone?

577
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,400
It was about work.

578
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,541
Are you done with sending out
the invitations?

579
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,720
Yes.

580
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,070
Whose card is this?

581
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,830
It's for a client. I'll give it to him
when I dine with him later.

582
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,720
Fine, Jing.

583
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,790
Do you know what the Jiang family's
initiative ordinance is?

584
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,720
Why did you suddenly ask that?

585
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,310
Nothing.

586
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,590
It's just that I'm asked to host
the meeting tomorrow.

587
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,680
- I need to make preparations.
- Host?

588
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,680
Then I'll prepare a new outfit for you.

589
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,550
Go. Let's talk on the way.

590
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,720
People will drink at the party.

591
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,880
Adding a radish soup that can
alleviate a hangover...

592
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,960
For the sake of the birthday party,

593
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,440
the Alliance Meeting is held
in the Jiang family.

594
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,230
Their position is so high.

595
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,880
One can't stand firmly
if he's at too high a position.

596
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,280
Even if he holds onto his position,

597
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,360
we'll push him down anyway.

598
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,150
