20
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,840
Chef Jiang,

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,020
I've heard a lot about you.

22
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,350
You are...

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,350
I'm Zhao Jingjing

24
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,350
from Zhaoyeqing.

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
What a coincidence!

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,230
Hello, Chef Jiang, Chef Zhao.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,870
Director Jin.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,560
Thank you for taking the time
to hold the meeting.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,950
We're so privileged.

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,230
I'm flattered.

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,860
This is Mr. Jiang from the Jiang Group,

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,680
and the only grandson of
Xijiangyue's Head Chef.

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,710
You know about him?

34
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,950
Of course I do.

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,000
He is the number one bachelor in Baichuan.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,750
You flattered me.

37
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,590
Right? Then you should keep in touch!

38
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,280
Chef Zhao, nice to meet you.

39
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,560
Likewise, Mr. Jiang.

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,680
Chef Jiang.

41
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:19,960
Mr. Jiang.

42
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,520
Speaking of which,
you have the same surname.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,470
He's the Jiang from Xijiangyue,

44
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,810
and I'm the Jiang from Chuncheng.

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,710
Director Jin, let's go inside.

46
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,030
OK, let's go.

47
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,630
Why do you act like that?

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,750
At least we share the same surname!

49
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,310
Yeah, but we don't share
the same personality.

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,150
Director Jin,

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,310
I heard that Mr. Xu Kang's

52
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,120
return to Baichuan
to the culinary conference

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,710
is all because of you.

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
The credit is not mine.

55
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,470
If it weren't for

56
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,030
you young and extraordinary chefs here,

57
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,310
then he won't come here

58
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,910
no matter how I persuade him.

59
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,120
You're being humble, Director Jin.

60
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,310
Actually

61
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,150
half of the chefs in the Alliance

62
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,560
should see you as their teacher.

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,360
Well, the main purpose for Mr. Xu's return

64
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,800
is to accompany his little disciple.

65
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,560
You know that, Mr. Jiang, right?

66
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,630
My sister is young and naïve,

67
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,960
please look after her a little

68
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,560
when she comes back.

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,590
Allow me.

70
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,320
Sure.

71
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,150
Chef Jiang,

72
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
you and Chef Zhao are top

73
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,240
of the young chefs in Baichuan.

74
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,630
You should communicate more!

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,400
We kinda do.

76
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,630
She praised one of my staff a few days ago.

77
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,120
Yeah.

78
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,400
There are many talents in his restaurant,

79
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,150
I'm so jealous.

80
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,190
Chef Zhao, your dad is going to be upset

81
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,710
if you say that.

82
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,840
The staff members he hired

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,150
are the backbone of Zhaoyeqing!

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,080
Am I right, Mr. Jiang?

85
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,310
I agree.

86
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,590
You're right, Director Jin.

87
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,360
Speaking of which,

88
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,590
I haven't been to Zhaoyeqing

89
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,800
ever since the Head Chef changed.

90
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,870
Now that Mr. Jiang and Chef Jiang
are both here,

91
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,680
Zhao,

92
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,630
why not show us your skills?

93
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,250
Director Jin, how about this,

94
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,390
I'll ask them to close
for one day tomorrow,

95
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,430
and we'll serve you only?

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,310
There's no time like the present.

97
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,120
Why wait for tomorrow?

98
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,950
This clubhouse is fully

99
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,040
equipped with kitchen utensils.

100
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,270
Move the kitchen set here.

101
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,680
Let Mr. Jiang and Chef Jiang
have a taste, too.

102
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,600
Then I'll show my immature skills,
Director Jin.

103
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,580
(Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan)

104
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,750
Director Jin,

105
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,560
Velvet Tofu,

106
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,040
please enjoy.

107
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,190
Zhao, your knife skills are impressive.

108
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,510
This is a work of art!

109
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,390
Mr. Jiang,

110
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
why do I feel it's not lively enough here?

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,360
There's few

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,040
female chefs in the Alliance.

113
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,000
Is it because they're not as strong as men

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,600
and can't flip the wok?

115
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,830
Director Jin,

116
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I'll make another dish for you.

117
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,000
Sure.

118
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,360
Impressive!

119
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Nice flip!

120
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,160
Nice flip!

121
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,310
Good!

122
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,360
Excuse me.

123
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

124
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,070
Please send some grapes
to the table inside,

125
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,390
put them before the one wearing glasses.

126
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,920
Yes, madam.

127
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,240
Eating seafood and grapes together

128
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,920
can cause gastrointestinal discomfort,

129
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,480
by a large amount, though.

130
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,600
Are you going to report me then?

131
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,680
Food safety is also
the responsibility of chefs.

132
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,070
I might do that.

133
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,070
Chef Zhao, why don't we come to the point

134
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,550
instead of beating around the bush?

135
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,310
What do you mean?

136
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,620
How about we have a competition first,

137
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,870
one that only focuses on culinary skills,

138
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,360
instead of being picked by

139
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,480
the Alliance?

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,720
Chef Jiang, you seized the knife
from Xue Congming,

141
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,870
why will I compete with you
in culinary skills？

142
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,830
Didn't you seize your father's knife?

143
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,870
You don't trust yourself?

144
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,160
No need to provoke me.

145
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,600
I know what you're thinking.

146
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,070
In terms of culinary skills only,

147
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,360
we are comparable.

148
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,750
However,

149
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,870
with Zhaoyeqing's centennial history,

150
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,800
our relationship with the Alliance,

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,560
and our status in the catering industry,

152
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,510
I guess I'm in a slightly

153
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,870
more advantageous position than you.

154
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,830
Indeed.

155
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,000
You investigated Li Nai before,

156
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,390
so you should know that

157
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,720
she has a good sense of smell and taste.

158
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,680
Just two days ago,

159
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,240
she went to Zhaoyeqing, and tasted

160
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,360
your father's
Soy-braised Pork with Abalone.

161
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,560
She was full of praise for the dish.

162
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,680
You mean that Zhong Haiyang let me win?

163
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,870
You were raised aboard,

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,630
but I'm sure you have tasted

165
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,720
your father's cookings after you return.

166
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,630
I think

167
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,190
you know the truth.

168
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,270
Also,

169
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,920
Zhong Haiyang betrayed my father back then

170
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,680
and now he's avoiding me.

171
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,870
Does he feel guilty?

172
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,430
Or he is afraid that
I might destroy what he values?

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,630
Jingjing, you're here?

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,630
Jingjing.

175
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,270
Why did you intentionally lose to me?

176
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,440
How could that be?

177
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,510
I'm getting older,

178
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,870
and my skills are unstable!

179
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,240
Unstable?

180
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,550
Or are you feeling guilty and avoiding him,

181
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,150
for fear that you'll lose Zhaoyeqing?

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What did he say to you?

183
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,750
What did you do to his father?

184
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,910
I was told that

185
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
you voted against me on my one-star review.

186
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,870
I don't believe others,

187
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,510
I want to hear it from you.

188
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,200
Yes.

189
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,720
I voted against you.

190
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,440
You are my best friend,

191
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,910
how could you do this?

192
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,510
You can't set up this restaurant.

193
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,540
(Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan, Zhaoyeqing
Credentials by Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan)

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
What happened between me and Jiang Jie

195
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,720
is too complicated.

196
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
Zhong Haiyang,

197
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,750
I don't understand.

198
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,320
Back then, you sent my mother and I
abroad for ten years, leaving us alone,

199
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,870
just because you want the position
of the Head Chef in Zhaoyeqing.

200
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,550
Now you deliberately lost to me

201
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,750
because of that Jiang Jie,

202
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,630
giving up the restaurant.

203
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,860
What on earth do you value?

204
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,790
What I value hasn't changed.

205
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,000
I see.

206
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,270
You'll lose everything you love then.

207
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,360
I'll challenge Jiang Jie.

208
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,940
(Closed for 3 days)

209
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,320
Who are you?

210
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,870
So you're Li Nai.

211
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,600
Am I so famous now?

212
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,150
Yeah.

213
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,960
I am Zheng Fangxing,

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,790
Sous Chef.

215
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm a bit older than you and Jiang Jie.

216
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,910
You can call me Zheng.

217
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,320
Zheng.

218
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,000
Why is Chuncheng closed for three days?

219
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,120
You didn't see the text either?

220
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,870
What text?

221
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,440
(Jiang Jie
Chuncheng is closed for three days.)

222
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,870
I just saw that.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Me too,

224
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,440
or I won't be sitting here with you.

225
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,600
Isn't he preparing for five-star review?

226
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,080
Why is he seizing knife now?

227
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,510
Because they both benefit him.

228
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,390
How can being challenged benefit him?

229
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,030
I have tried Zhao Jingjing's dishes before,
she's good.

230
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,670
Which one of his opponents is not good?

231
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,360
Your master is one of them,

232
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,480
and he still lost to Jiang Jie.

233
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,270
Doesn't it feel nice though

234
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,150
that the one who keeps challenging others

235
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,750
is suddenly challenged by others?

236
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm joking.

237
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,910
Of course I'm happy about that!

238
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,360
Xue's Noodles' shutting down,

239
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,630
and my master's being forced to resign,

240
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,790
are all because Jiang Jie's challenge.

241
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
And both happened within 15 days!

242
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,240
I guess it's perfectly fair for me

243
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,870
to be happy about that.

244
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,720
I didn't expect you
to be so straightforward!

245
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,200
I admire you a bit now.

246
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,360
Thanks.

247
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,840
Though it feels nice,

248
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,270
I need to be the one

249
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,150
who seizes your Head Chef's knife!

250
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,840
Hope you can achieve your target soon,

251
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,240
then I'll retire soon!

252
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,080
Let's go then.

253
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,930
Jiang Jie closes himself at home
to study new dishes

254
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,670
before each knife-seizure contest,

255
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,960
so our restaurant is closed for a few days.

256
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,600
Get used to it.

257
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,510
Study new dishes?

258
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,840
Nice chance!

259
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,360
Manager Zhu.

260
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,720
Why are you here?

261
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,080
You didn't see the message?

262
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,750
We won't be here if we did.

263
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,320
Please tell the Chef not to send messages.

264
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,540
How can I see his
among a bunch of junk messages?

265
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,030
Why do you have Jiang Jie's kit?

266
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,960
I went to fetch the Chef's knives
sent for maintenance.

267
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm also bringing him
two bottles of brandy.

268
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,150
That's a lotta work.

269
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,910
Let me help you.

270
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,550
Actually, I live right downstairs
from the Chef.

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,080
I'll get the brandy then.

272
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,720
I'm the warehouse keeper, I'm on it!

273
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,870
I'll go!

274
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,660
(Opening Hours: 11:00 to 21:00)

275
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,360
Lu Ke,

276
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,870
you take care of the restaurant.

277
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,080
It's hard to defeat Jiang Jie.

278
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,550
I will be preparing dishes at home
these days.

279
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,030
What's on your mind?

280
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,600
I don't understand

281
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,720
why you challenge him now.

282
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,320
According to the standards of
five-star review,

283
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,840
there's a 60% chance we'll win.

284
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,630
Failing the review

285
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,320
means shut down for Chuncheng,

286
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,360
and to us...

287
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,960
To Zhaoyeqing,

288
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,870
it only means changing the Head Chef.

289
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,390
Zhong Haiyang can come back at any time,

290
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,270
right?

291
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,510
But Zhaoyeqing is a century old restaurant,

292
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,600
there're many families that

293
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,220
have been working here
for three generations!

294
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,840
So even you think
I'm not as good as Zhong Haiyang

295
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,080
and Jiang Jie.

296
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,710
(Zhaoyeqing)

297
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,290
I just want Zhong Haiyang

298
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,670
and all of you to see

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,550
how Zhaoyeqing grows stronger in my hands.

300
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,150
And Zhong Haiyang

301
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,000
will never return.

302
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,600
Excuse me, how much is this abalone?

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,670
Not for sale.

304
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,630
Don't you want to do your business?

305
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,390
You're Jiang Jie, right?

306
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,240
You can't buy abalone in Baichuan.

307
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,350
Zhong Haiyang doesn't allow you to sell it?

308
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,960
Master Zhong didn't say anything.

309
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,600
We don't want to sell it ourselves.

310
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
That's how we show our respect to him.

311
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:01,960
Off you go.

312
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,200
Chef, I have to work from my salary,

313
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,520
and I should help you share your worries!

314
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,790
Too hypocritical.

315
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,790
Let's be more straightforward.

316
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,600
He's not at home?

317
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,750
Hello, Chef?

318
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,670
I came to bring you
your things for Manager Zhu.

319
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,510
Aren't you at home?

320
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,420
Enter Jinghai City.

321
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,200
No, I'm not.

322
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,960
Chef,

323
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,840
you're not in Baichuan?

324
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,000
I have something to do.

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,080
Just put the things inside.

326
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,120
When will you be back?

327
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,510
The password is 0113.

328
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,200
It's open.

329
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,240
0113?

330
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,790
You rush back,

331
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,480
because you're afraid
I might know the truth?

332
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
The truth?

333
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,510
j0h1w1r3.

334
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,880
The information posted by this account is

335
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,840
(Noodle Shop of Xue's Apprentice)
inconsistent with the fact.

336
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
I originally wanted to show you a post,

337
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,640
but it was deleted

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,590
on the day I was employed in Chuncheng.

339
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,830
Are you so sensitive to numbers

340
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,750
because you studied accounting in college?

341
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,400
You criticized me so harshly
in person that day,

342
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,350
yet you posted this right on the Alliance's
forum recommending my restaurant.

343
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,640
That's ill-intended praise!

344
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,350
That article should've helped you

345
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,270
if you're skilled enough.

346
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't confuse things!

347
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,160
Did I give you a bad rating,

348
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,240
cause you to shut down,

349
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,070
or force you to interview in Chuncheng?

350
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,000
But you've been using me, haven't you?

351
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,000
You know that Zhao Jingjing wants me,

352
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,880
so you took me to Zhaoyeqing,

353
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,200
so you got the news of Zhao Jingjing.

354
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,790
And you took me to meet Zhong Haiyang,=

355
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,960
and asked me compare his dishes
with Zhao Jingjing's.

356
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,790
I guess that you said something to Zhao,

357
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,310
so she wants to seize your knife, right?

358
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,030
I confess.

359
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,640
Zhao and Zhong don't get along well.

360
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,070
If she knows that

361
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,070
she didn't defeat Zhong legitimately,

362
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,480
what will she do?

363
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,550
Since you've used me already,

364
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,270
how about I help you one more time?

365
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,790
However,

366
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,000
I need some reward this time.

367
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,110
What do you mean?

368
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,480
You need abalone now, right?

369
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,030
So?

370
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,680
Zhaoyeqing is a century old restaurant,

371
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,550
with the specialty of abalone,

372
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,160
so they must boast a high status
in the seafood market.

373
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,480
Now that you offended Zhao and Zhong,

374
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,000
no one in Baichuan
will sell abalone to you.

375
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,160
That's why you want to go to Jinghai.

376
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,680
You're right.

377
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,510
But I can still buy it,

378
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,680
I just need to go a little further.

379
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,830
But I can find abalone
of the same quality as Zhaoyeqing's!

380
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,000
You should know that

381
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,510
Zhaoyeqing is one of the seven families

382
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,400
not only because of their culinary skills.

383
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,790
Even if I can't buy one
with the same quality...

384
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,400
No,

385
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,350
if you don't have one
with the same quality,

386
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,750
you won't have 100% chance of
winning over her.

387
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,830
I've seen videos of you
on the Alliance's forum.

388
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,350
You always ring the bell
at the last second.

389
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,310
That's not because
you're not skilled enough,

390
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,960
but because you have confidence
in every contest.

391
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,350
You don't allow any possibility of failure.

392
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,960
Unfortunately,

393
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,200
not every chef of the seven families
will experience taste degradation.

394
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,680
Even if Zhao is not skilled enough,

395
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,590
Zhaoyeqing is enough to back her up,

396
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,640
and enough to pose a threat to you.

397
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,270
That's why you think

398
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,070
I need you?

399
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,480
Jiang Jie,

400
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,920
you said that

401
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,550
it's you who chose me.

402
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,400
So,

403
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,550
you know where my value lies.

404
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,790
Alright.

405
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,960
So,

406
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,070
what's the deal?

407
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,510
I will be your assistant
during the contest.

408
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,110
And after that,

409
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,720
I'll participate in the main meals.

410
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,310
There are still 31 hours left
until the contest.

411
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,480
Buy me the abalone before dark.

412
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,550
You scared me!

413
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,070
I didn't wash this.

414
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,310
Don't throw it!

415
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,070
If I only need to compensate for
the damage to the items in the restaurant,

416
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,510
I will definitely blow up
Jiang Jie's head first!

417
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,920
Then I'll invest on you!

418
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,830
Keep your eyes on the road!

419
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,550
I have to be alive to dream.

420
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,700
(Fuyuan Seafood, Authentic Seafood)

421
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,790
I'll have these two.

422
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,440
Li Nai,

423
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,010
wipe yourself, don't catch a cold.

424
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,550
Should we go back and change clothes?

425
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,920
There's no time!

426
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,830
Let's go to the next place.

427
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,110
(In case of sudden rainstorm in Jinghai,)

428
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,790
(please pay attention to your travel safety.)

429
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,790
(Please avoid going to river courses)

430
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,750
(and areas with latent geological hazards.)

431
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,960
(Please don't stay under billboards...)

432
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,590
Hello?

433
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,070
Hi, Chef, I'm Song Duo.

434
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,880
What's the matter?

435
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,680
I heard that no one here
sells abalone to Chuncheng.

436
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,720
In case you need it,

437
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,510
I went to Jinghai
and found some nice abalone.

438
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,720
I don't need it.

439
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,270
Goodbye.

440
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,200
Chef, I'm back!

441
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,830
How about it? It's not dark yet!

442
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,590
Come in here.

443
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,630
Cold doesn't count as work-related injury.

444
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,350
Quickly, wipe up.

445
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,680
And find some dry clothes
in the bedroom to change.

446
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,510
Wait,

447
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,720
your hand's injured!

448
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,640
It's okay. Just a scratch.

449
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,110
Bandaids can affect cooking,

450
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,160
this is common sense.

451
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,920
I know.

452
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,960
But I'm your assistant now, I can help you.

453
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,260
And also common sense:
it'll get infected if not bandaged.

454
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,790
Hurry up.

455
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,310
Yes, Chef!

456
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,960
One-third chopped scallions,

457
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,790
slice the red dates.

458
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,240
Good?

459
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,640
Is that enough?

460
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,790
Have a try.

461
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,590
It's okay. Let's keep trying.

462
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,310
Have a taste.

463
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,030
Similar to Zhao Jingjing's.

464
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,160
That's not enough.

465
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,440
Let's continue.

466
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,590
How about we add some passion fruit in it?

467
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,270
Uncle Li, what are you doing?

468
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,550
You're still awake?

469
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,590
Waiting for Nai.

470
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,550
No sleeping allowed.

471
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,310
I said that

472
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,440
she's staying at school today.

473
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,400
That Hong Tunan travelled through time.

474
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,440
This one's better than Zhao Jingjing's!

475
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,750
Jiang Jie,

476
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,110
what happened?

477
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,270
Jiang Jie?

478
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,830
Jiang Jie!

479
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,680
(Is he dead?)

480
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,110
(It's burning.)

481
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,960
You're awake.

482
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,830
When did I fall asleep?

483
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,350
You suddenly fell down yesterday.

484
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,830
You just sat here
and took care of me all night?

485
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,750
I also slept for a while.

486
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:57,830
Right,

487
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,110
that passion fruit...

488
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,400
That's better than Zhao Jingjing's!

489
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
Compared to Zhong Haiyang's...?

490
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,400
Continue.

491
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,830
So is this how his calluses all come from?

492
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,830
He cooks over and over again

493
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,160
just to have a 100% chance of winning.

494
00:28:29,237 --> 00:28:30,024
Please.

495
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,830
Li Nai,

496
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,350
Zhaoyeqing's invitation to you

497
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,200
will always be valid.

498
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,110
Excuse me,

499
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,000
we're quite happy with each other now.

500
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,070
Chef Jiang,

501
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,310
I hope you can still be happy

502
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,790
after the contest.

503
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,790
Carry on.

504
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,200
Allow me to introduce to the judges

505
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,270
the two camps of the knife-seizure contest.

506
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,440
The challenger is Zhao Jingjing
from Zhaoyeqing,

507
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,030
and the defender is Jiang Jie
from Chuncheng.

508
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,790
The contest begins now.

509
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,160
Zhao once beat Soy-braised Pork with Abalone
that has been handed down

510
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,030
for over 100 years in Zhaoyeqing
with Golden Abalone.

511
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,240
This time,

512
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,830
will she make the same dish again?

513
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,920
Yes! She's making Fried Abalone!

514
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,440
Zhao is playing her best card here,

515
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,920
yet Jiang Jie is still
brewing chicken soup.

516
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,960
Zhaoyeqing's abalone
is already in the oven,

517
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,830
and Jiang Jie is...

518
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,920
That looks cold!

519
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,920
The pastry has gradually turned brown

520
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,720
in the oven,

521
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,110
I'm even feeling hot right now!

522
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,790
Both started making the sauce.

523
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,240
As is known to all,

524
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,920
sauce is extremely important

525
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,480
to dishes with abalone.

526
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,550
Zhao Jingjing's sauce
turned out to be yellow!

527
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,440
She is indeed the Chef
who defeated Master Zhong Haiyang,

528
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,550
she's even more excellent
than her own father!

529
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,440
However,

530
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,720
Jiang Jie's sauce is green?

531
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,550
Jiang Jie completed
in the last second again.

532
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,640
The first dish is
Zhao Jingjing's Golden Abalone.

533
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,030
Please try it out, judges.

534
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,300
(Zhang Jingming)

535
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,640
You added prunes?

536
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,200
Yes,

537
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,550
I added prunes to this dish,

538
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,960
giving this traditional dish a new flavor.

539
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,720
(Wang Xiaoran)
That's the finishing touch!

540
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,240
Relieving the greasiness
and adding a fruity aroma to the abalone.

541
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,720
It's nice to see you creative young chefs.

542
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,400
There are some traditions
that need to be broken.

543
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,590
Seems like the judges are satisfied with

544
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,480
Zhao's improved version of Golden Abalone.

545
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,680
Zhao is truly the top among
the new generation of the seven families.

546
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,830
The next dish
is Jiang Jie's Drunken Abalone.

547
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,480
Countering the thick Golden Abalone
with a cold dish

548
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
is indeed a good strategy,

549
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,960
but with prunes added, the greasiness

550
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,440
and freshness are already balanced

551
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,830
in Zhao's dish.

552
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,310
I'm afraid that Jiang Jie's cold dish

553
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,240
might not impress the judges.

554
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,070
Jiang Jie,

555
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,750
what is the green sauce made of?

556
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,440
Sea grapes.

557
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,110
There's only one abalone left.

558
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,310
We'll see what we can do later.

559
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,310
Jiang Jie,

560
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,200
it suddenly came to me that

561
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,000
the reason why the abalone dish
in Zhaoyeqing is famous

562
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,920
is that the original flavor of abalone
is saved,

563
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,160
which is why they won so many contests.

564
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,750
Whether it's Golden Abalone
or Soy-braised Pork with Abalone,

565
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,240
they're quite strong and smelly.

566
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,880
So what if we go just the opposite?

567
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,160
Just the opposite?

568
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,960
A light taste...

569
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,200
If we save the flavor of abalone,

570
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,920
and add something refreshing...

571
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:04,960
This!
