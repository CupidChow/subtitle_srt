=Episode 22=

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,680
I'm not here for the first time,

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
but I still wanna say,

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,480
dang it, capitalists!

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,790
You're here not for the first time.

24
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,480
Can you tell me
where the kitchen is then?

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,870
The kitchen is...

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,070
I'm sorry, guys.

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,520
There are too many guests today.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,630
Sorry about the impolite welcome.

29
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,840
Impolite indeed.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,120
We've prepared an open kitchen
for the dinner party.

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,680
I'll take you there now.

32
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,280
Let's go.

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,400
Did you see that?

34
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,400
Let's talk about it later.

35
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,520
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,710
As per your list, we've got

37
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,400
cooking utensils,

38
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,680
condiments and vessels for you.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,750
Just let me know if you need anything,

40
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,590
including the bathroom.

41
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,680
If I remember it correctly,

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,310
when you still had problems
losing your way here,

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,800
my brother had been able to hide

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,000
in the hidden compartment
of Grandpa's study.

45
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,840
You were worried for nothing.

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,120
You're right.

47
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,470
After all, Jiang Jie used to live here

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,030
for eight years.

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,630
Oh right.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,120
Given the duration of stay here,

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,280
no one lives longer than the gardener.

52
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,280
I'll let you work.

53
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,430
Got to go.

54
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,470
In the nick of time.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Why did Zheng Fangxing appear here?

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,400
And he's dressed in a chef's suit.

57
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,750
Waiting to get the goods on you
and then replace you.

58
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,520
This is what the sous chef does.

59
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,870
I'm not talking about you.

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,000
But if you want to, I can help you.

61
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,430
Stop talking nonsense.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,630
What's going on
between you and Cao Liang?

63
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,190
Nothing. We're just goofing around.

64
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,430
Jiang Xiu.

65
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,430
This way, please.

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,910
I want you to go shopping with me.

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,910
Okay, okay. You're the boss.

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,150
- I wanna go to the cinema tonight.
- Okay, no problem.

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360
Answer me.

70
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,920
Can your cooking rival Jiang Jie's?

71
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm merely a sous chef.

72
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,360
- It's none of my business.
- Xuyang, calm down.

73
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,430
Today, it's not about cooking.

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,160
It doesn't matter how good his cooking is.

75
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,480
Yes.

76
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,190
After today,

77
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,070
he won't deserve to compare with me at all.

78
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,480
We've spent so much time,

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,510
energy, resources and money on you.

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,830
We've got to make it work.
Do you understand?

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
Still worried about Zheng Fangxing?

82
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,270
I can't help feeling uneasy.

83
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,950
Can it be Jiang Xuyang has convinced

84
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,270
Jiang Ziqing to open chain restaurants?

85
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,390
Impossible.

86
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,120
In Jiang Ziqing's eyes, nothing is
more important than the Jiang family.

87
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,510
The plan of chain restaurants,
in some way,

88
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,120
will destroy the seven families'
credibility.

89
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,240
Jiang Ziqing won't allow anything

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
to shake the Jiang family's position.

91
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
Guys, mind your manners.

92
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,600
Mr. Chen, Mr. Wang, long time no see.

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,950
- Hello. Hello.
- Please enter.

94
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,160
My grandpa has been waiting inside.

95
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,600
Hello, welcome. Welcome.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Long time no see.

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,430
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

98
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,920
What? You won't be the host,

99
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,630
but a sunshine boy here?

100
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,390
I just don't want you to catch a cold.

101
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,070
You know what,

102
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,830
getting sick may

103
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,830
liven things up.

104
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,480
Cao Liang

105
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,190
- is a lot more fun than you.
- Xiu.

106
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,920
We've broken up. Don't call me that.

107
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,070
I never agree to break up with you.

108
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,040
What's wrong with you today?

109
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,070
Why are you being so cheeky?

110
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,870
Xiu. Xiu.

111
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,480
I don't agree to break up with you.

112
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,430
Even if you wanna goof around,

113
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,750
your playmate can only be me.

114
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,510
Give me one more night.

115
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,480
I'll definitely tell you everything.

116
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,510
Silly.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,920
If you trust me,

118
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,630
you should tell me.

119
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,270
Sorry.

120
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,070
It's inconvenient for me to greet you.

121
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,720
The Xue's way of slicing fish.

122
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,390
The double slices

123
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,390
can not only preserve the fish's nutrition.

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,000
The fish slice is also bigger.

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,190
Your basic skills are great.

126
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,390
It's thanks to my master's teaching.

127
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,390
You're a member of the Li family,

128
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,720
but you're apprenticed to Xue Congming.

129
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,120
The young people like you are
what the seven families need.

130
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,680
As my master said,

131
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,310
cooking is all about pleasing oneself

132
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,510
and satisfying the eater.

133
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,680
No wonder he was defeated by Jiang Jie.

134
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,870
Since you've beaten Jiang Jie,

135
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,430
you should be somewhat ambitious.

136
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,560
She's the least ambitious person.

137
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,950
Mr. Jiang,

138
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,510
please don't push her.

139
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm afraid that she'll fail
your expectations.

140
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,840
She may vanish into thin air
if she's not careful.

141
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,120
- Are you blaming me?
- Of course I dare not.

142
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,270
We're here mainly to celebrate
your birthday.

143
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,840
Wish you a long life

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,390
and boundless happiness.

145
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,630
You're so different from your father.

146
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,630
I'll leave you alone.

147
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,080
Don't be mad.

148
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,870
The last one to whom you expressed
birthday wishes was almost arrested.

149
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm not mad.

150
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,750
I just can't believe

151
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,240
he just talked about my dad so calmly.

152
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,910
Rest assured.

153
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,000
He'll pay for it. Definitely.

154
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,480
My waist is so sore.

155
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,480
Any better?

156
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
I'll go to the bathroom.

157
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
- I'll go with you.
- No need.

158
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,510
Keep an eye on those dishes.

159
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,670
In case anyone may mess around.

160
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,080
Take care.

161
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,120
- Rest assured.
- Go ahead.

162
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,270
- Does that guy know about this?
- No, he doesn't.

163
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,720
I'll take you to the break room. Go.

164
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,270
Chef Jiang, Chef Cao.

165
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
The dinner party is about to start.

166
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,030
What are you doing here?

167
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,120
Ms. Cui said her brother was practicing
his speech in the break room.

168
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,390
I'm worried that he may be hungry.

169
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,750
So, I wanna ask him to eat something.

170
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,080
I've told you.

171
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,960
Jiang Xuyang's secretary

172
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,150
is indeed a capable woman.

173
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,600
She could manage a five-star restaurant
before.

174
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,000
Now she can manage
the whole Jiang family.

175
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,790
Does she meet your requirements?

176
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,270
She's the assistant I want indeed.

177
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,870
But I guess Mr. Xuyang must be reluctant
to let me have her.

178
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,440
Chef Cao, you must be kidding.

179
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,960
There's nothing I can't bear to let go.

180
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,270
We were talking about
your capable secretary.

181
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,480
That's too flattering.

182
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,600
Since Chef Cao has given you
such a compliment,

183
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,320
Miss Zhu,

184
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,750
should you give him a toast
to say thanks?

185
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,320
I've emptied this.

186
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,120
Chef Cao has had a drink,

187
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,150
you can't hurt his feelings, right?

188
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,510
I've taken a sip of this.

189
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,550
How about getting another glass
to make a toast to him?

190
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,960
Miss Zhu, here's another reminder.

191
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,960
I have some issues with Cui Can.

192
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,030
You'd better not worry about
if he is hungry.

193
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,150
Tonight,

194
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,150
just stay where you should be.

195
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,150
Don't cause trouble for me anymore.

196
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,390
Master Jiang, congratulations.
Congratulations.

197
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,240
Welcome. Welcome.

198
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
Please be seated.

199
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,910
Take a seat.

200
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,240
Look. Here comes Cui Can.

201
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,600
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

202
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,120
I'm Cui Can,

203
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,910
the host for tonight.

204
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,240
- Host?
- Today is Master Jiang's birthday.

205
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,440
Master Jiang, here's a birthday wish to you
on behalf of the Alliance.

206
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,910
Wish you a long life

207
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,600
- and boundless happiness.
- Great!

208
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,030
I'll empty it. Be my guest.

209
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,670
Thank you.

210
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,870
Guys, I wonder if you're satisfied
with today's food.

211
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,390
Absolutely.

212
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,390
Great that you like it.

213
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,750
I hope you won't hate me
for holding you back from eating.

214
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,750
I've been asked to do a favor.

215
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,120
Someone has ordered two dishes
for Master Jiang

216
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,670
and also wanted me to tell a story.

217
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,080
Salted Pork Soup.

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,080
Grandpa, I'll go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

219
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,910
Here's the story.

220
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,390
Once upon a time, there was
a medical family.

221
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,200
Mr. Yao, who owned a clinic,

222
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,150
had twin sons.

223
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,320
His older son was considerate
and down-to-earth

224
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,960
but his talent was mediocre.

225
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,200
His younger son was a bit talented

226
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,750
and yet aggressive.

227
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,120
One day, his younger son competed
with someone.

228
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,960
He promised if he lost,

229
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,870
he'd leave home himself.

230
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,550
Guys, guess how it went in the end.

231
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,000
The younger son lost.

232
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,390
Yes, finally, the younger son lost.

233
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,320
Grandpa, there are so many guests here.

234
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,120
Don't you want to hear the story out?

235
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,600
But later on, the younger son
went back on his word.

236
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,960
He couldn't give up the position
and wealth of the Yao family.

237
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,960
So, he begged Mr. Yao with tears.

238
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,440
And Mr. Yao adored his younger son.

239
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,870
He made his older son take the blame.

240
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,000
Eventually,

241
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,270
the older son was expelled from home.

242
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,360
All this is your plan, right?

243
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,030
I'm sorry to have kept this from you.

244
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,480
Dad.

245
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,120
What?

246
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,870
What do you mean?

247
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
Didn't you say my old man agreed with me
to come back?

248
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,550
Why did I have to take the back door?

249
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,790
I've put in a good word for you

250
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,390
in front of Grandpa. A lot of good words.

251
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,720
So, he reluctantly let you back home.

252
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,510
I've told you
about today's situation before.

253
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,390
Don't cause extra trouble, okay?
No extra trouble.

254
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,030
Me causing extra trouble?

255
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,240
The old man is a dotard.
Are you a dotard too?

256
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,840
Jiang Jie has come back.
If I don't come back,

257
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,630
Jiang Xiu and Jiang Jie

258
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,000
will overturn this family soon.

259
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,392
Dad.

260
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,320
What? Are you gonna tell me what to do?

261
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,440
Grandpa has been not well lately.

262
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,270
The doctor said he must
keep a light diet.

263
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,670
He can't be crossed.

264
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,960
You're finally back here.

265
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,510
Mind your manners.

266
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,390
Everybody,

267
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,150
I've finished the story.

268
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,750
As for the one to offer birthday wishes,

269
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,960
he'll arrive soon.

270
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,840
Guys, I'm sorry. I came late.

271
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,440
Dad, wish you a long life

272
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,600
and boundless happiness.

273
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,790
Jiang Yuanfeng?

274
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,790
As per our arrangement,
it should be Mr. Ge.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
My master is here too?

276
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:15,910
Where is he?

277
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,910
He's in the room back there.

278
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,960
Guys,

279
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,670
enjoy the dinner.

280
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,200
It should be done by Jiang Xuyang.

281
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,440
Here's the thing.

282
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,120
You'll go and find out
what Zheng Fangxing is doing.

283
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,150
- I'll go to meet my master.
- Okay.

284
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,120
Li Nai, thank you.

285
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,030
I'm really happy.

286
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,270
Master.

287
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,390
- Thank you for coming.
- Never mind.

288
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,440
Chef Jiang, is it you who invited
Jiang Yuanfeng here?

289
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,640
It should be Jiang Xuyang's arrangement.

290
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,400
It's a bit surprising,

291
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,400
but Jiang Yuanfeng's appearance
just makes things better.

292
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,790
Is this good for us?

293
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,580
It should be an intentional arrangement.

294
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,310
The greatest resistance of his plan
of chain restaurants is Jiang Ziqing.

295
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,750
He must want to bring him down
by leveraging us.

296
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,510
Master, I'll leave this to you then.

297
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,480
Salted Pork Soup.

298
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,000
This season is
the best time to eat this. Here.

299
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,110
Here, Dad. Please try it.

300
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,000
Dad.

301
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,440
Dad.

302
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,720
It's been a while.
You should be mollified now.

303
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,750
Master Jiang.

304
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,000
Are you not satisfied

305
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,240
with the dish I ordered?

306
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,070
Guys, long time no see.

307
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Ge Qunshan.

308
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,750
Aren't you already retired?

309
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,750
Are you still trying to make it

310
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,030
to the seven families?

311
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,960
You got me wrong.

312
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,270
Today, I'm here mainly to give
my disciple a boost.

313
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,790
And passingly, I'll tell you a story.

314
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,640
- Jiang Jie is your disciple?
- Can't you

315
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,310
tell from the Salted Pork Soup,
the signature dish of the Ge family?

316
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,650
Smash it. Even if you smash everything,

317
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,110
you can't change
the existence of this dish.

318
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,720
Nor will it change the fact
that you once lost to me.

319
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,920
Isn't it Jiang Yuanshan,
Master Jiang's elder son,

320
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
who competed with Mr. Ge at that time?

321
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,510
That's what I believed before.

322
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,920
So,

323
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,550
I ruined an innocent cook who was
passionate about cooking.

324
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,200
Oh I remember.

325
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,960
No wonder the Yao family's story sounds
so familiar.

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,510
The medical family in the story

327
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,030
is equivalent to the cooking family.

328
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,310
Yao family is equivalent to Jiang family,
the head of the seven families.

329
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,960
Master Jiang

330
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,000
covered up for his younger son

331
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,110
by sacrificing his older son.

332
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,640
- But aren't they both his sons?
- Tell me about it.

333
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,200
That's total nonsense.

334
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,240
Am I talking nonsense?

335
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,590
Why don't you take a look
at the last dish?

336
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,160
It has taken Eating at Dusk

337
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,750
a lot of effort

338
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,640
to prepare the two dishes for today.

339
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,400
This dish,

340
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,110
Uncle Yuanfeng,

341
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,310
I guess you are familiar with it.

342
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,200
You chose not to make Ginger Duck Stew
back then.

343
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,750
Is it because you lost to my master
on this dish,

344
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,400
or is it because you feel a bit guilty

345
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,160
for your brother took the blame for you?

346
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,660
(Fish Flavored Shredded Pork;
Pre-made dish)

347
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,790
Is Jiang Xuyang gonna use
these pre-made dishes to

348
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,440
- fulfill his dream of chain restaurants?
- You'll soon know

349
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,070
whether he can make it.

350
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,720
Stop looking. Keep working.

351
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,270
Fangxing.

352
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,510
Why are you becoming like this?

353
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Do you know
what the pre-made dishes mean?

354
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,830
Cooks will be replaced.

355
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,240
Customers can only eat those
replicated dishes

356
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,200
that look delicate and yet emotionless.

357
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,000
Cooks aren't respected in Baichuan at all.

358
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,200
Don't you know that?

359
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,720
Those nights when the cooks are pushed
around like dogs by the Alliance

360
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,070
and have to worry about being censored.

361
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,590
So, we should change the Alliance

362
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,750
so that every cook can
open a restaurant freely

363
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,270
rather than help the snobs
like Jiang Xuyang

364
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,000
to turn the cook into an object.

365
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,440
The Alliance has a history of 200 years.

366
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,960
How can it be changed easily?

367
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,110
It's at least better than holding a candle
to the devil.

368
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,270
Dad.

369
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,920
Dad, help me.

370
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,200
Dang it!

371
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,070
How dare you collude with your brother

372
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,720
to deceive me?

373
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,350
Back then, how did you make your brother
a scapegoat for you?

374
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,680
And why did he come to me and say

375
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,960
he was the one who lost the game
to someone else?

376
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,480
Tell me.

377
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,110
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,880
I'm sorry, everyone.

379
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,400
I failed to educate my sons properly,

380
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,920
but I really didn't know about this.

381
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,590
Yuanshan and Yuanfeng

382
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,920
are twin brothers.

383
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,310
Yuanshan has adored his brother
since their childhood.

384
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,070
I didn't expect them to do this.

385
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,400
What a shame!

386
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
What a shame!

387
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,350
Yuanshan passed away too early.

388
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,270
Otherwise, I'd clear his name for sure.

389
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,480
Well said. Well said.

390
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,500
It's not too late
if you stand up for him now.

391
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,070
Yeah. I must report this to the Alliance

392
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,720
and put this matter on record.

393
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,830
Old man,

394
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,240
this is not what I mean.

395
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,200
Well,

396
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
what is it then?

397
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,200
What are you doing?

398
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,030
Back then, when you hurt your brother

399
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,240
and ruined his hands,

400
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,920
did you treat him as your brother?

401
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,830
Jie,

402
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,200
is what you said true?

403
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,200
Weren't our father's hands ruined
by himself?

404
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Yeah, his hands were hurt by himself.

405
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,310
By himself?

406
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,830
18 years ago,

407
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,590
on January 13,

408
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,880
was it a ghost that I saw when I hid
in the wardrobe that night?

409
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,400
Yuanshan,

410
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,270
don't blame me for being too ruthless.

411
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,440
It's because you like showing off

412
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:32,790
- that our father wants you back home.
- You jerk!

413
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,310
So...

414
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,110
I don't know that.

415
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,640
- You jerk!
- I have no idea.

416
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,070
Let go!

417
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,680
Yuanfeng,

418
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,440
is what Jiang Jie said true?

419
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,270
- Dad.
- Don't call me dad.

420
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,480
Tell me. Where did you go that night?

421
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,270
Is it really you who cut Yuanshan's hands?

422
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,720
Dad.

423
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,200
That's because he had two faces
and always acted against me.

424
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,270
He said he wouldn't compete with me
for being the Chef.

425
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,200
But he still opened a restaurant
by himself.

426
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,640
And he also put it on the map.

427
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,550
He was your brother.

428
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,270
How could you...

429
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,270
Dad.

430
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,510
Isn't this what you taught me?

431
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,200
Since you've picked me,

432
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,720
you shouldn't have paid attention to him
when he opened a restaurant.

433
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,920
You also said you'd regretted
your decision.

434
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,720
You...

435
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,200
You unfilial son!

436
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,270
I did regret my choice.

437
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,680
I shouldn't have

438
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,200
indulged you.

439
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,070
- Grandpa.
- Master Jiang! Master Jiang!

440
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,270
Grandpa. Grandpa.

441
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,200
- Are you alright?
- Call an ambulance.

442
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,590
This has nothing to do with me.

443
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,000
Call an ambulance!

444
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,780
(Chang'an Traditional Chinese
Medicine Hospital)

445
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,960
They still didn't give up the idea
of the chain restaurants.

446
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,830
Zheng Fangxing is making pre-made dishes.

447
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,680
But I don't know what he is up to.

448
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,110
We must have been used.

449
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,640
- What?
- Jiang Xuyang must know Cui Can is a spy.

450
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
He deliberately used us
to get rid of Jiang Ziqing.

451
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,070
Then in the name of Xijiangyue,
the No. 1 restaurant of the year,

452
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,480
he proposed his plan.

453
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,790
I was too careless.

454
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,920
And your father's name
wasn't fully cleared.

455
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,790
You've done enough.

456
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,200
Jiang Xuyang

457
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,960
must have been ready
when Jiang Ziqing made that choice.

458
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,960
What should we do now?

459
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,510
Let's go. Master, we'll go back first.

460
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,480
Okay.

461
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,270
Xiu.

462
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,200
- Go away!
- I won't!

463
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,310
I don't want us to be apart.

464
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,880
You don't want us to be apart?

465
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,070
Based on what?

466
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,400
Cui Can, do you think you're awesome?

467
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,830
You pretended to break up with me

468
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,200
and worked undercover,

469
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,000
trying to prove my father innocent.

470
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,960
What? Should I be grateful to you now?

471
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,480
- I don't.
- You do.

472
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,680
I hate it most when someone is arrogant
to think it's for my own good.

473
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,920
Xiu.

474
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,750
Cui Can,

475
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,550
we're done for good.

476
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,640
(Xijiangyue proposes)

477
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,030
(from now on,)

478
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,110
(the three-star restaurants nationwide)

479
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,240
(will start trial operation
of the chain restaurants,)

480
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,880
(and increase dish-serving efficiency)

481
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,110
(in the form of pre-made dishes.)

482
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,240
The seven families' signature dishes
become pre-made dishes.

483
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,640
How dare they!

484
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,750
What can we do?

485
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,440
It's the proposal by the No. 1 of the year.

486
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,720
The Alliance can't veto it.

487
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,550
Besides, most members of the Alliance

488
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,350
agreed on the proposal.

489
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,110
Because the chain restaurants
with pre-made dishes

490
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,310
can save costs and create more profits.

491
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,510
This pattern does save the costs.

492
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,070
And it can save the chefs too.

493
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,200
They only care about interests.

494
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,400
There's a way to stop them.

495
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,030
What is it?

496
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,200
That is, Eating at Dusk obtains the No. 1
of next year and proposes a new plan.

497
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,510
Don't worry.

498
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,110
Let's work together.

499
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
Well, we don't have a choice.

500
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,590
But I'm still unconvinced.

501
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,880
Unconvinced?

502
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,750
Then we can only go on a date.

503
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,510
Can't you give your boyfriend

504
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,200
a chance to cheer you up?

505
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,160
How sweet of you!

506
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,750
Of course I am!

507
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,310
But I need to go home and get changed.

508
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,720
Sure. I'll pick you up later.

509
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,200
Xiu.

510
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,240
Did you sleep well last night?

511
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,830
Xiu.

512
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,110
Look at this.

513
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,750
Does it look like me?

514
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,790
Now it looks like you.
Don't come to me anymore.

515
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,880
Xiu!

516
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,110
Cui Can.

517
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,550
Aren't you coming home?

518
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,960
Being a spy for a woman's sake?

519
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,680
Now you've failed, you're mad at me.

520
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,440
I did all this to protect the people
I care about.

521
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,030
Aren't I protecting you
and the Cui family?

522
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,960
- Your protection is to cheat and scheme.
- You!

523
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,350
Do you think the so-called justice
can bring you any benefit?

524
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,720
What you're doing is a total joke.

525
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,590
So what?

526
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,590
I won't regret my choice
even if I fail 100 times.

527
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,790
Because justice isn't absurd in my eyes.

528
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,550
Do you have a minute, Chef Li?

529
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
I wanna talk with you.

530
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,480
I'm sorry. I have things to do.

531
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,590
It's about the knife-seizing contest
between you and Jiang Jie.

532
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,160
Hello, Li Nai.

533
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,680
(Hello, Jiang Jie.)

534
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,590
Where are you?

535
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,720
(Something has come up.
I'm afraid we have to put off our date.)

536
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,880
What happened?

537
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,350
(Well, it's...)

538
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,400
(Something happened to Li Jidong.
It's nothing serious.)

539
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,200
Okay. Call me if anything.

540
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,200
Okay.

541
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,480
I haven't congratulated you yet.

542
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,550
You've passed the Alliance's
five-star review.

543
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,350
Mr. Jiang, don't beat around the bush.

544
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,880
Just cut to the chase.

545
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,160
Then I'll get this straight.

546
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,750
About your competition against Jiang Jie,

547
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,110
someone did manipulate the votes.

548
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,590
Why did you tell me this?

549
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,720
I thought you and Cui Jing were allies.

550
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,720
I just don't think you should
be kept in the dark.

551
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,720
Jiang Jie is a really thoughtful man.

552
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,350
You must know that well.

553
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,160
Don't tell me you think
he has no clue about it.

554
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,070
Since he knows that,

555
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,070
why did he still join Eating at Dusk?

556
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,510
Are you saying

557
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,200
Jiang Jie is harboring evil designs?

558
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,110
He's Ge Qunshan's disciple.

559
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,110
He can challenge you anytime.

560
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,590
You're the one harboring evil designs!

561
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,030
Do you think
you've reached your goal at the party?

562
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,400
Supposedly,

563
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,200
Jiang Jie and I are no longer
a threat to you,

564
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,510
at least within one year.

565
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,240
- This is the truth.
- No.

566
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,680
Not really.

567
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,680
Even I was almost cheated by Jiang Jie.

568
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,070
Apart from waiting for one year,

569
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,960
I have another way to stop you.

570
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,440
To seize the Jiang family's knife.

571
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,030
If the Jiang family isn't the head
of the seven families,

572
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,480
your proposal would be invalid then.

573
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,590
Thank you for the advice.

574
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,720

Thank you.

586
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,680
I've decided to seize the knife.

587

No problem.

588

I remember

596
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,240
when I was little, it was you
who taught me to hold the knife.

597
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,510
I was too young at that time.

598
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,160
Somehow,

599
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,270
my parents and brother

600
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,350
were all gone.

601
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,550
So, for a while,

602
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,920
I was dependent on you.

603
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:11,440
Now, whenever I recall that period,

604
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,070
I feel

605
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,960
very disgusted.

He's just released a new term
at the Alliance Meeting.

Now, I assume

611
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,150
he's busy opening chain restaurants.

you should have expected this to come.
