20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,200
Jiang Xiu,

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,680
this is where the contest will take place.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,950
Is it appropriate to bring him here?

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,710
- Why not?
- The Head Chef of Eating at Dusk, Li Nai,

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,510
is his junior.

25
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,760
Most of the time,

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,710
I feel like he is my junior instead.

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,000
Chef Li,

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,040
do you find

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
word games like this interesting?

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,430
But he isn't part of my team today.

31
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,750
Sorry, he's my husband.

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,190
Let's go.

33
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,870
You're married?

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,310
Did Grandpa agree?

35
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,870
- Did he agree to your marriage?
- Grandpa?

36
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,590
How dare you bring him up?

37
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,030
You must have made Grandpa so angry

38
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,960
that he suffered a stroke.

39
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,400
Besides, my brother agreed.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,710
Does your opinion matter?

41
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,430
(Eating at Dusk; Xijiangyue)

42
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,870
Let's go.

43
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,470
Li Nai,

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,680
do your best.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,310
Don't disappoint me.

46
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,710
To underestimate the enemy is
to underestimate oneself.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
I came prepared.

48
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,030
You had better be.

49
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,360
Did Jiang Xuyang ask you
to be my Sous Chef?

50
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,000
Cui Can,

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,590
some people's zodiac sign is Cancer.

52
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,800
Meaning, eight legs aren't enough
for him to jump around.

53
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,750
Go and watch from the sidelines.

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,280
A free laborer sent himself over.
Waste not, want not.

55
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,560
Okay.

56
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,280
Shout for me if you need anything.

57
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,430
I'm going to the toilet.

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,910
You siblings are exactly the same.

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,240
Equally arrogant.

60
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,190
That's because we have the right to be.

61
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,300
(Toilet)

62
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,750
- Don't you regard me as your sister?
- Which sister?

63
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,480
The sister who locked me up?

64
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,630
Or the sister who grew up with me?

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,510
I told you I'm doing this
for the Cui family.

66
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,390
It's just you and me in the Cui family.

67
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,720
Look at me.

68
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,950
Jing,

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,830
can you just give up?

70
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,270
Even if the Cui family goes into debt

71
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,070
and is no longer as glorious,

72
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,830
isn't it enough that we have each other?

73
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,310
Besides, I've grown up. I can help you.

74
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,070
We can work hard together

75
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,600
and make the Cui family better again.

76
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,120
Cui Can,

77
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,000
I've already set myself on this path.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,270
Can I even turn back?

79
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,720
I know now.

80
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,190
Turns out, it's not up to me

81
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
whether you're my sister or not.

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,390
What did I tell you?

83
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,040
Family love

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,680
will always make a person hesitate.

85
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,480
Xuyang,

86
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,000
do you expect Cui Jing
to turn against you?

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,000
At the very least,
I wouldn't bet my entire stake on her.

88
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,240
If she turns against me
at the last minute,

89
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,680
Li Nai is most likely to win.

90
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
What is your plan?

91
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,600
It's always the safest

92
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,000
to have a backup plan.

93
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,510
Have you found Li Jidong?

94
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,560
Mr. Li, we've been walking for an hour.

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,830
It's going to rain soon. Let's go back.

96
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,720
I want to buy a blue cotton candy.

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,240
I must complete the mission Nai gave me.

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,630
The candyman

99
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,000
wouldn't come in this weather.

100
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,120
I want to buy blue cotton candy.

101
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,152
Hello.

102
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,160
Are you Mr. Li and Ms. Wang?

103
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,680
Who are you?

104
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,190
I'm a friend of Li Nai's.

105
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,310
Are you here to bring me to meet Li Nai?

106
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,830
But you...

107
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,750
You don't look like him.

108
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,720
I am here to take you to her.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,630
Okay, okay.

110
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,190
Wait, wait.

111
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,160
Hello. What's wrong, Ms. Wang?

112
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,510
Downstairs?

113
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,830
Okay, I got it.

114
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,630
Is something wrong with Uncle Li?

115
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,720
- Li Jidong is here for me.
- Right now?

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,560
How did he finish his mission so soon?

117
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,270
I remember the candyman isn't
selling today.

118
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,270
I'll go take a look with you.

119
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,870
I'll be right back.

120
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,680
You don't need to go.

121
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,720
Be careful of sabotage.

122
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,680
May I leave for a while?

123
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,000
You must come back three minutes
before the contest begins.

124
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:47,345
The rules state that the challenger
forfeits the contest if he is late.

125
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,630
I got it.

126
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,480
- Come back soon.
- Okay.

127
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,240
What's wrong?

128
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,270
Uncle Li is here.

129
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,680
It'll be fine.

130
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,680
Mr. Li.

131
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,190
Don't be anxious.

132
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,070
Why isn't she here yet?

133
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,680
Li Nai will be here soon.
Don't be anxious.

134
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,000
Drink some water.

135
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,510
- Drink some water, okay?
- I don't want to.

136
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,310
Do it.

137
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,960
Chef Jiang.

138
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,270
Zhu Hao?

139
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,000
What's wrong?

140
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,670
I have something to tell you.

141
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,550
Say it.

142
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,390
Li Nai is in danger.

143
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,200
Jiang Xuyang has plans for Li Nai.

144
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,670
What do you mean?

145
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,458
The elevator stopped at the 12th floor.

146
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,390
How long until the contest begins?

147
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,390
Ten minutes.

148
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,630
You guys go back.

149
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,870
- I just need to find her.
- I'm coming too.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,670
No.

151
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,320
If you don't show up,

152
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,550
- your reputation is gone.
- So what?

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,080
You said I can make my own decisions.

154
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,750
Honey, honey.

155
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Honey, listen to me.

156
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,390
Even if you both miss the contest,

157
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,869
Eating at Dusk will be the loser.

158
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,240
This is the rule.

159
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,840
It's okay. Go back, I'll go with him.

160
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,240
Okay.

161
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,080
I'll be at the stage.

162
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,000
Good luck. Go.

163
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,630
Li Nai, Li Nai.

164
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,200
Li Nai.

165
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,390
- Li Nai.
- Jiang Jie.

166
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,390
You're not deprived of oxygen, are you?
Are you hurt?

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,480
I'm fine.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,320
- I'll get the staff.
- Hurry.

169
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,750
Li Nai, don't be afraid.

170
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,030
I'll stay here with you.

171
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,390
Jiang Jie, I'm fine.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,120
How long until the contest begins?

173
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,000
That isn't important right now.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,720
No, the contest is
the most important thing right now.

175
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,200
In five minutes.

176
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,910
Five minutes?

177
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,480
I can't get out in five minutes.

178
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,320
Li Nai.

179
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,150
Li Nai.

180
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,670
I'm here. Jiang Jie.

181
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,150
Next,

182
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,910
you must listen to me carefully.

183
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,960
Don't say it. I'm not leaving.

184
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,870
If we lose,

185
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,440
everything will go up in smoke.

186
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,670
Your 18 years of effort,

187
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,510
Jiang Xiu's 18 years of effort,

188
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,510
Mr. Ge's 20 years of effort,

189
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,600
and also mine and Jingjing's.

190
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,120
Although we didn't work as long,

191
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,440
every single day of hard work we put in

192
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,910
would all be for nothing.

193
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,440
So, just do as I say.

194
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,020
(Eating at Dusk)

195
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,340
(Xijiangyue)

196
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,600
Three minutes.

197
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,390
We're three minutes away from the contest

198
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,480
but the Chef of
Eating at Dusk has yet to arrive.

199
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,600
Why isn't she here yet?

200
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,790
Everyone, we're one minute away
from the contest

201
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,030
but the Chef of Eating at Dusk is
still nowhere to be seen.

202
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,270
I should remind everyone

203
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,720
that not showing up as the challenger

204
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,910
would result in being deemed to have lost.

205
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,660
(Cui Jing)

206
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,630
Let us give them another ten seconds.

207
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,550
Ten.

208
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,750
Nine.

209
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,790
Eight.

210
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,960
Seven.

211
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,080
Six.

212
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,200
Five.

213
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,200
Four.

214
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,480
Three.

215
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,840
Two.

216
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,030
One.

217
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,870
Eating at Dusk...

218
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,030
Wait.

219
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,860
♪Take back the lost glory♪

220
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,900
♪I know how difficult each battle is♪

221
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,060
♪Hold the knife in hand♪

222
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,820
♪To be worthy of the brilliance♪

223
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,420
♪I share this glory with you♪

224
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,750
Jiang Jie of Eating at Dusk, present.

225
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,320
Since the contestant
from Eating at Dusk is here,

226
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,840
- our contest can now...
- Wait.

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,390
A knife-seizure contest is

228
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,630
a competition between
the Head Chefs of two restaurants.

229
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,240
If I remember correctly,

230
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,200
aren't you just the Sous Chef?

231
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,750
The Alliance didn't specify

232
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,270
that the Sous Chef cannot
represent the Head Chef in the contest.

233
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,080
Jiang Jie,

234
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,630
this is a championship match,
not a game.

235
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,270
Are you trying to play word games with us?

236
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,550
How about this?

237
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,150
Why don't we let our judges vote to decide

238
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,080
if the Sous Chef can
represent the Head Chef in this contest?

239
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,660
(Cui Jing)

240
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,120
Sure.

241
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,120
I'll accept it.

242
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,910
Alright. We shall leave the decision
to our three judges.

243
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,150
Despicable.

244
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,980
(Under Maintenance)

245
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,480
- Nai, Nai.
- Uncle Li, it's dangerous.

246
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,270
Li Jidong, listen to me.

247
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,320
Nai is completing her mission.

248
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
- Wait a bit longer, okay?
- It's okay, Uncle Li.

249
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,240
Okay.

250
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,240
I want to play with Nai.

251
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,480
I won't trouble Nai.

252
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,870
Nai, I'm sorry.

253
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,030
I gave you trouble.

254
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,600
It's fine, Ms. Wang.

255
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,670
Come this way.

256
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,320
Cui Can,

257
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,910
has the contest started?

258
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,480
What happened?

259
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,200
Jiang Xuyang argues that Jiang Jie cannot
represent Eating at Dusk as the Sous Chef.

260
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,000
He wants the Alliance's judges
to vote on it.

261
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,750
Other than your sister,

262
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,550
who else listens to Jiang Xuyang?

263
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm not sure about that.

264
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,750
I agree.

265
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,150
I object.

266
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,200
- I...
- I request a suspension of the vote.

267
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,180
(Baichuan Food Heritage)

268
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,360
Where is she?

269
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,440
Why are you here? What about her?

270
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,120
Don't worry. Help has arrived.

271
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,600
No matter how much you delay,
it's useless.

272
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,630
Li Nai is late.

273
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,630
Even if she comes now,

274
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,790
she isn't qualified to compete.

275
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,440
Everyone,

276
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,840
I object to the vote
because it is unnecessary.

277
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,670
Jiang Jie is not competing
as the Sous Chef,

278
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,840
but as the Head Chef of

279
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,240
Eating at Dusk.

280
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,000
Are you taking us for fools?

281
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,240
We all know

282
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,000
that the Head Chef of
Eating at Dusk is Li Nai.

283
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,020
Correct.

284
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,960
Before 1:20 pm on April 14th,

285
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,150
(Li Nai was the Head Chef of
Eating at Dusk.)

286
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,790
But after that,

287
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,030
Li Nai lost a rematch to Jiang Jie,

288
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,600
the Ge family's successor.

289
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:57,898
Therefore, Jiang Jie now possesses
the Li family's five-star knife.

290
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,600
This is the written agreement.

291
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,910
You must be joking, right?

292
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,000
The Alliance rules state

293
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,600
that a staff member

294
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,030
must be present
at the contest to testify.

295
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,120
I believe everyone knows

296
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,960
that I am a registered reviewer
with the Alliance.

297
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,720
Therefore, I can testify

298
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,390
that Jiang Jie is the Head Chef of
Eating at Dusk.

299
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,390
Jie, good luck.

300
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,440
Go-kart?

301
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,720
Smart move.

302
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,440
Honey,

303
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,200
you have my support.

304
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,750
Get down and watch the showdown.

305
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,680
Good luck.

306
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,750
Don't affect the contest,
unlike someone else.

307
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,200
(You're only allowed to win, Chef Jiang!)

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,960
Silly girl.

309
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,900
(Jiang)

310
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,830
Jiang Jie of Eating at Dusk,

311
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,680
present.

312
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,440
Jiang Xiu of Xijiangyue,

313
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,440
present.

314
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,920
(The rules of this contest are)

315
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,510
that both parties may
choose the items they need,

316
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,830
including but not limited to
the ingredients.

317
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,590
Once the ingredients leave the table,
you cannot change your mind.

318
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,510
The time limit is three minutes.

319
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,750
This rule is

320
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,550
not beneficial for Jiang Jie.

321
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,350
Subsequently, both parties have two hours

322
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,000
to prepare one dish.

323
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,110
Now, let the contest begin.

324
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,880
Everyone, Jiang Xiu has taken the beef.

325
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,880
As we all know,

326
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,440
out of all the previous five-star chefs,

327
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,750
only Jiang Jie uses beef as
an ingredient for his signature dish.

328
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,480
Xijiangyue took all the oil.

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,200
Why is Xijiangyue doing this?

330
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,680
What are you doing?

331
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,830
- Xijiangyue took all the salt.
- That's...

332
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,640
It's fine. This is a contest.

333
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,550
This isn't a contest at all.

334
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,110
That's too much.

335
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,640
How is he gonna cook?

336
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,000
The Head Chef of Eating at Dusk was
supposed to be Li Nai.

337
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,720
Obviously, Jiang Jie did not
expect this situation

338
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,110
and has not prepared a dish.

339
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,550
Baby,

340
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,510
do you also want mommy to do good?

341
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,550
Get away.

342
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,270
Chef.

343
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,270
Please leave right now,
you despicable person.

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,680
What kind of person
do you think Jiang Jie is?

345
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,756
He will destroy everything you have
sooner or later.

346
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,750
He has always been a self-centered
and selfish person.

347
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,790
So what if he is?

348
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,510
This contest is between me and Jiang Jie,
everyone else can stay out of this.

349
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:09,110
There appears to be a conflict between
the Head Chef and Sous Chef of Xijiangyue.

350
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,350
This is for the effort we've put in.

351
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,880
(Director.)

352
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,790
(Where is heaven?)

353
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,000
My daddy said mommy has gone to heaven.

354
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,550
Only the prettiest
and kindest people go there.

355
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,440
Heaven

356
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
is the most beautiful place.

357
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,640
Everything in there is white,

358
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,960
- untainted by anything dirty.
- Really?

359
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,510
Yes.

360
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,030
- Xiu.
- Jie.

361
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,310
(Xiu, the director said
that heaven is a pure white place.)

362
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
(The snow is also pure white.)

363
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,920
(Let's bury this picture in the snow
so mom and dad can see us.)

364
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,310
Jie, I miss mom and dad.

365
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,830
I wanna stay with you.

366
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,790
I cannot take you away yet

367
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,880
but I've decided to learn cooking.

368
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,110
When I become super good,
I'll come back for you.

369
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,110
Will you cook something for me?

370
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,750
I thought my classmates' lunchboxes
looked really good.

371
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,110
I will. I'll cook something for you.

372
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,070
(To truly love cooking.)

373
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,680
(To cook every meal with emotions.)

374
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,750
Xiu,

375
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,920
I still owe you a meal.

376
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,350
Jiang Jie has no assistant.

377
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,680
He is now rendering pork fat.

378
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,000
This will greatly affect
the dish's flavor.

379
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,920
At first, I didn't understand
what Jiang Jie is doing,

380
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,680
but now I see that he is using jellyfish
to produce salt.

381
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,550
He is such an experienced professional.

382
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,790
(Jiang Jie, you will be punished.)

383
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,680
(Jiang Xiu, be good.)

384
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,160
(Jiang Jie, you are a good-for-nothing
and despicable kid.)

385
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,960
(Jiang Xiu, are you crazy?
You're just a chess piece.)

386
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,680
The contest has ended.

387
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Let's welcome the two contestants
to the center of the stage.

388
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,590
You worked hard.

389
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,880
It was okay.

390
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,750
Now, let's have our three judges
taste the dishes.

391
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,200
We'll start off with
Xijiangyue's Crispy Beef.

392
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,750
Next, we have Eating at Dusk's
Kiddy Lunchbox.

393
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,070
Our judges have tasted the dishes.

394
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,750
Let's move on to witness
the final segment,

395
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,110
the vote.

396
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,750
Now, who will get the final vote?

397
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,270
Wait.

398
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,200
Ms. Cui Jing,

399
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
I want to ask you a question.

400
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,830
No one is allowed to disrupt the judges

401
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,550
until the result is finalized.

402
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,480
As a judge for this contest,

403
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,440
will Ms. Cui make a fair decision

404
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,270
without any guilt?

405
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,640
Before the voting ends,

406
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,160
no one is allowed to disrupt the judges.

407
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,270
Therefore, I refuse to answer.

408
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,550
Now, please make the final vote.

409
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,000
(Jiang Xuyang, I will vote for Li Nai
as per our agreement.)

410
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,680
(Jiang Xuyang, I will vote for Li Nai
as per our agreement.)

411
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,830
(Jiang Xuyang, I will vote for Li Nai
as per our agreement.)

412
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,510
This is slander.

413
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,160
This is fake news.

414
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,270
This is an accusation.

415
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,550
Stop taking photos.
Put your equipment away.

416
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,510
Stop taking photos.

417
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
Without any conclusive evidence,

418
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,000
the Jiang family

419
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,200
reserves the right to pursue legal action.

420
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,400
Does Mr. Jiang want evidence?

421
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,070
- It's here.
- It's Chef Li.

422
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,000
Li Nai.

423
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,160
Are you okay?

424
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,200
Zhu Hao?

425
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,750
I will not let my baby

426
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,830
pay for your mistakes.

427
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm Zhu Hao.

428
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,640
I hereby reveal that Mr. Jiang Xuyang
and Ms. Cui Jing committed fraud

429
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,830
during the knife-seizure contest
between Eating at Dusk and Chuncheng.

430
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,590
Furthermore, he used the Jiang family's
influence in the Alliance

431
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,720
to force small and medium restaurants
to surrender their operating rights

432
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,070
- in order to establish chain restaurants.
- Nonsense!

433
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,110
Everyone, everyone.

434
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,160
This person used to be
the lobby manager at Chuncheng.

435
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,480
It is very possible

436
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,240
that she was sent here by Jiang Jie

437
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,510
to make a false statement.

438
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,030
And what is
the most disgusting thing of all?

439
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,750
She used her baby to threaten me.

440
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,000
She is a selfish person

441
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,310
who only values personal gain.

442
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,510
Can her words be trusted?

443
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,400
The authorities will verify her statement.

444
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,240
As a judge who has committed fraud,

445
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,270
does her vote hold any value?

446
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,480
She is right.

447
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,790
Tell everyone.

448
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,200
You didn't commit fraud.

449
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,310
You didn't cast a fraudulent vote. Say it.

450
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,590
Tell everyone.

451
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
In the contest between
Eating at Dusk and Chuncheng,

452
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,750
it was difficult to pick a winner
between Li Nai and Jiang Jie.

453
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,110
Due to an agreement,

454
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,310
I voted for Li Nai.

455
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,070
I have committed fraud.

456
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,590
Cui Jing!

457
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,980
(Jiang Xiu, Xijiangyue;
Li Nai, Eating at Dusk)

458
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,960
But this time,

459
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,270
I choose to uphold the truth.

460
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
I am willing to be punished by the law.

461
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,520
Cui Jing.

462
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Have you gone insane?

463
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,590
Do you know what you're doing?

464
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Have you gone insane?

465
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,680
Jiang Xuyang, don't touch my sister.

466
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,880
Take the photo.

467
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:18,830
Don't move.

468
00:30:19,214 --> 00:30:20,830
You instructed others
to sabotage the elevator

469
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,070
and endangered the public.

470
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,200
We've already called the police.

471
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,590
Yes, bring him to justice.

(Eating at Dusk)

473
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,310
The opposite of being gifted
isn't mediocrity.

474
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,640
Victory isn't impossible with hard work.

475
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,590
That isn't always the case.

476
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,590
But if you're on my side,

477
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,920
I will definitely win.

478
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,440
Thank you.
