How can you fall

You freaked me out!

00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,870
This Persian blue salt,

23
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,920
a pound is enough

Take a sip.

Oh, by the way,

26
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,900
I'm here to tell you that
starting from tomorrow,

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,470
the kitchen staff will be responsible for
the staff meal,

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,240
including you.

29
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,960
And I will also...
You can't spit it out.

30
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,100
If you spit it out,
I'll find another warehouse keeper today.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,590
What made you so happy?

32
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,310
Won the lottery?

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,630
Nothing.

34
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,470
Didn't you say you had something for me?

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,460
Look at you. I care about you,
and you're impatient.

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,710
Do you have too much free time?
Give me that and go back to work.

37
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,960
When I was at the Alliance office,
I saw it.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
So I've brought it for you.

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,910
Oh, they also gave one to Zhaoyeqing.

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,870
Chef,

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
what is this for?

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,680
To notify me of the time and form
of the five-star review.

43
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,800
Is it really necessary?

44
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,080
Isn't it usually a surprise review
a month later?

45
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,000
Every five-star restaurant must
go through it when changing the Head Chef.

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,430
But this time is different.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,750
(Baichuan Chef Alliance Review Notice)
Mr. Xu Kang will visit Baichuan City in ten days

48
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,470
for cultural exchange
between Chinese and Western cuisines.

49
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,280
At that time,
the Alliance will hold a reception banquet

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,590
co-hosted by a five-star restaurant.

51
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,150
The co-host restaurant will be chosen
between Chuncheng and Zhaoyeqing.

52
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,590
The result will be based on
the five-star review standards.

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,240
Only one of Chuncheng and Zhaoyeqing
can pass the review.

54
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,870
The Alliance is really interesting.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,400
Are you alliance members so afraid

56
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,750
that the new five-star chef will
shake the status of the Seven Families?

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,630
What are you gonna do?

58
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,080
I have to win.

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,680
I really don't understand.

60
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,360
Why are you so happy about
doing two jobs for one salary?

61
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,520
You don't understand.

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,120
The staff meals in Chuncheng
were made by the Sous Chef before.

63
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,910
The personnel like us
never had a chance to cook.

64
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,310
Without a chance to cook,

65
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,840
when can I learn cooking skills?

66
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,590
No.

67
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,000
Obviously we are on the righteous side.

68
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,710
Why are we behaving like thieves?

69
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,960
When Heaven chooses me,
I must get close to Jiang Jie first,

70
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,590
win Jiang Jie's trust,

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,310
and see through Jiang Jie.

72
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,870
OK.

73
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,310
Then I hope you always embrace the light
even in the darkness,

74
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,070
fulfill the entrusted task
and defeat Jiang Jie.

75
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,360
Li Nai.

76
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,040
Do you need this?

77
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,720
No. I don't need it.

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
I just wanna ask

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,870
if we can change the order
for the staff meal?

80
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,830
I haven't decided what to cook tomorrow.

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,430
Fair enough. I just wanna be the first.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,040
Really?

83
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,360
Thank you then.

84
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,870
No problem.

85
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,800
Go ahead.

86
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,560
Chef,

87
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,800
the guests at table one
will arrive at 10:45.

88
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
The guests at table two and three

89
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,160
will arrive at 11:20.

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,390
Serve the first appetizer at 10:50.

91
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,630
Chef.

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
Why are you dressed like this today?

93
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,950
Chef,

94
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm in charge of the staff meal today.

95
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,270
I remember it should be Song Duo today.

96
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,510
Anyway, now it's me.

97
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,160
Chef, do you need help?

98
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,070
Step aside.

99
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,870
Chef, towel?

100
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,070
No need.

101
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,070
Lunch is over.

102
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,240
The staff meal is also ready.

103
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,510
Have a try.

104
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,630
There's plenty in the kitchen.
You can eat as much as you like.

105
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,750
Li Nai, the wonton smells so good!

106
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,830
Even the skin tastes like meat.

107
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,630
I kneaded dough
with the remaining broth from lunch.

108
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,000
No wonder.

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,270
It's just a bit bland.

110
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll get some salt.

111
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,310
It's OK. I'm good.

112
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:27,560
Is it OK?

113
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,120
OK. OK.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,870
Do you want some salt?

115
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,040
Jiang Jie.

116
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,360
Is there a problem with the wonton?

117
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,270
Why do you think
I let you make the staff meal?

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,870
Because you want to test us.

119
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,430
Test you?

120
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,240
OK.

121
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Test you what?

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,390
Making staff meal
should be quick and efficient.

123
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,920
Making a staff meal
without mandatory dishes isn't difficult,

124
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,830
but it's overlapped with lunch time,

125
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,870
when both the cutting area
and the stove area are in use,

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,360
so I have to
make full use of the intervals.

127
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,070
And?

128
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,630
While there are no mandatory dishes,

129
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,750
to make sure the ingredients for customers
are the freshest,

130
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,070
the restaurant won't prepare ingredients
unrelated to the day's dishes.

131
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,040
Then I need to make full use of
the kitchen's waste ingredients.

132
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,870
Li Nai,

133
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,830
having you make the staff meal

134
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,480
is a torment

135
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,630
for Chuncheng's staff.

136
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,000
What do you mean?

137
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,870
Come with me.

138
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,830
Tell me,

139
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,390
what do you smell?

140
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,240
Beef,

141
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,240
carrots,

142
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,510
water chestnuts,

143
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,870
eggs,

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,800
peppercorns,

145
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,550
conch.

146
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,440
Conch?

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,720
There is no conch at all in your wonton.

148
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,840
But there was a Cold Conch
in today's lunch.

149
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,550
You probably didn't clean the cookers
when handling the beef.

150
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,440
Am I right?

151
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,120
You're right.

152
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,320
You've never thought about
adding conch to the wonton filling,

153
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,550
so you didn't pre-treat the fishy smell.

154
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,240
That's why your filling

155
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
has a faint fishy odor.

156
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes.

157
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Yet, this isn't your most serious mistake.

158
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,910
After all, few people have
such a keen sense of smell like you.

159
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,030
Here is your most serious mistake.

160
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
The moment a dish is served,

161
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
it means the dish has been completed.

162
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,080
Any subsequent remedy

163
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,120
can only prove your failure.

164
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,960
But people have different tastes.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,360
Just because people have different tastes,
you just accommodate them.

166
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
You'll probably end up like Xue Congming.

167
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,000
What's wrong with being like my master?

168
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,200
Xue's Noodle's concept is
to let customers eat satisfying food.

169
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,270
Is there a problem with that?

170
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,630
Xue's Noodle emphasizes
old brands and affordable prices,

171
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,080
attracting more returning customers
and low-income groups.

172
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,720
But these groups
tend to have a heavy taste.

173
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,060
Long-term consumption of strongly
flavored food can numb the taste buds.

174
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
The so-called concept of Xue's Noodle

175
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,960
may well be one of the causes
harming Xue Congming.

176
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,840
Chuncheng never makes food
that satisfies everyone

177
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,270
but the food that no one can question.

178
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,670
I'll give you two options.

179
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,510
Either leave now,

180
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,600
or

181
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,000
accept my rules.

182
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,670
Song Duo.

183
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,630
Doesn't the wonton taste good?

184
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,910
Everyone said it was pretty good, right?

185
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,150
It's not that.

186
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,550
It's just not super good.

187
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,270
Yesterday's staff meal was made
by the Chef.

188
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,630
So

189
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,630
the staff meal you made was
actually quite good.

190
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,200
I see.

191
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,960
Zhu Hao,

192
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,720
send me the reservation information.

193
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,440
Did you see Li Nai just now
in the changing room?

194
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,600
So you saw her...

195
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,030
I've made my decision.

196
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,270
You sure?

197
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,240
I didn't come to Chuncheng
for an interview in just ways,

198
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,480
neither did you when you hired me.

199
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,870
Then we are even and it's over.

200
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,440
Jiang Jie, I'm no longer your subordinate.

201
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,750
You still owe me a meal.

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,940
Noodles with Snakehead Meat.

203
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,910
It's just a meal.

204
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,390
I'll pay you back someday.

205
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,390
Tonight it is.
I'll send you the reservation information.

206
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,030
This way, please.

207
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,240
Ma'am. This is your reserved table, No. 17.

208
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,910
Thank you.

209
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,120
Enjoy your meal.

210
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,240
No menu?

211
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,150
I've already reserved the chef set.

212
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,030
(Chef set.)

213
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,870
(Sounds expensive.)

214
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,270
Is that Jiang Jie?

215
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,500
I've never thought he would
come to Zhaoyeqing at this time.

216
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,600
How about I prepare the dishes he ordered?

217
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,030
No need.

218
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,390
He came just in time to see
how strong his opponent is.

219
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,270
Got it.

220
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,910
By the way,

221
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,630
who's that woman with Jiang Jie?

222
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,240
She looks kinda familiar.

223
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:14,910
It's Li Nai.

224
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,360
Li Nai.

225
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,550
Li Nai?

226
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,060
Yes.

227
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,720
Interesting.

228
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,750
(It's really expensive.)

229
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,510
You...

230
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,650
Why are you looking at me like this?

231
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,790
Do you have to have dinner
carrying your bag?

232
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,120
What?

233
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,840
Did I violate any rules?

234
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:01,840
No.

235
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Anywhy,

236
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,440
Zhaoyeqing's chef set would cost 1,200 Yuan.
Are you okay with that?

237
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,510
Since you asked,

238
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,080
I do feel it's expensive.

239
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,000
How about I treat you the other day?

240
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,150
OK.

241
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,270
Really?

242
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,750
But you have to promise me something.

243
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,080
You're really interesting.

244
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,510
You said I didn't hire you in just ways?

245
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,240
Yes. I applied for all the positions
except warehouse keeper.

246
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,360
I chose you.

247
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,720
To be exact,

248
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,630
I chose you on behalf of
the warehouse keeper position.

249
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,320
What's this interview for?

250
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,360
Warehouse keeper.

251
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,750
The three jars in front of you

252
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,390
contain common condiments.

253
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,550
In 30 seconds,

254
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,910
you should write out the names
of the condiments in the jars.

255
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,200
Are you sure?

256
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,240
There is so strong a smell of peppercorns.
Can't you smell it?

257
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,910
Your nose...

258
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,960
you have a really sharp nose.

259
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,120
It's easy to remember the food ingredients.

260
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,150
And that's exactly what I need.

261
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,320
But I'm already leaving.

262
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,550
What did you tell me that?

263
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,670
But I didn't approve it.

264
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,720
You came to Chuncheng for an interview

265
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,510
which means this is
your best choice for now.

266
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,270
Right?

267
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,840
If I'm right,

268
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,750
would you give it a shot

269
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,790
and prove my decision is right?

270
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,320
Then can I do the main meal?

271
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,120
Or

272
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,510
is the chance getting any bigger?

273
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,750
It's good to have the ambition.

274
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,150
What do you want me to do?

275
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,670
I'm stuffed.

276
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,910
Thank you.

277
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,790
The first dish is
Rice Cakes with Spare Ribs.

278
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,750
The sweet taste is due to
the use of pear soup for juice absorption.

279
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,270
The second dish...

280
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,480
You don't have to tell me right now
as long as you remember the taste.

281
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,720
OK.

282
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,030
I got it.

283
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,870
Can I go now?

284
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,750
Wait a second.

285
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,910
Something's on your mouth.

286
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,030
Wipe it.

287
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,720
Nobody is peeking at you phone.

288
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,080
I got something else to do. I gotta go.

289
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,510
I'm taking the bus.

290
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,400
Let me help you.

291
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,920
Thank you.

292
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,110
Thank you.

293
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,110
Hello.

294
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,310
I'm the boss and Head Chef of Zhaoyeqing,

295
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,400
Zhao Jingjing.

296
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,640
Hello.

297
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,440
You wanna hire me to work for Zhaoyeqing?

298
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,200
Yes.

299
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,830
But I'm already hired by Chuncheng.

300
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,510
Doesn't matter.

301
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,000
To be honest,
I hire you just because of Jiang Jie.

302
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,880
What do you mean?

303
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,240
Both Jiang Jie and I

304
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,590
have just won the five-star title.

305
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,790
So now we are both
facing the same challenge,

306
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,350
which is the five-star review.

307
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,350
But it has nothing to do with me.

308
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,480
It had nothing to do with you.

309
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,350
But this year, because of Jiang Jie,

310
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,680
the Alliance changed the rules.

311
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,550
Between Chuncheng and Zhaoyeqing,

312
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,270
only one can pass the review.

313
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,750
You were saying

314
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,000
if Jiang Jie
didn't pass the five-star review,

315
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,030
then his Chef's knife...

316
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,270
Would be taken back by the the Alliance.

317
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,070
So you want me to help you with the review.

318
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,310
But what can I do?

319
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,310
Don't you forget

320
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,160
even my master was defeated by him.

321
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,240
But you can
contribute to the public opinion.

322
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,640
Zhaoyeqing, the century-old restaurant
in Baichuan City,

323
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,510
couldn't stand the evil deeds
that Jiang Jie did to Xue's Family

324
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,510
and united together

325
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,110
as the Avengers of justice.

326
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,750
What do you think?

327
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,110
You wanna use me to cause public opinion
so as to put Jiang Jie under stress?

328
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,830
Not exactly.

329
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,790
I don't think
I will lose to him in cooking.

330
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,440
I was just thinking this can
cause pressure to him

331
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,960
and also advertise for Zhaoyeqing.

332
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,070
Why not?

333
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,240
What do you think?

334
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,590
Would you accept it?

335
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,510
Don't you wanna
seize your master's knife back

336
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,000
and revenge for him?

337
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,350
You are right.

338
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,030
I will revenge for my master,

339
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,400
but

340
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,510
I will seize my master's knife
from Jiang Jie on my own.

341
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,270
Okay.

342
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,790
I didn't expect
to pursuade you at one time.

343
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
You've tasted my dishes, haven't you?

344
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,680
How were they?

345
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,160
They were great.

346
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,240
There are still plenty of surprises for you
in Zhaoyeqing.

347
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,160
What do you want me to do?

348
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,510
First of all, use your nose

349
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,550
to bear firmly in mind

350
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,160
the taste of every dish here.

351
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,920
Secondly,

352
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,590
if Zhaoyeqing's Head Chef
Zhao Jingjing comes to you,

353
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,750
but you're not leaving Chuncheng,

354
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,920
then no matter what she says to you,

355
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,480
or gives to you,

356
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,400
you must tell me in no time.

357
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,350
Remember,

358
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,440
in no time.

359
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,480
What are you doing here?

360
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,200
What's this?

361
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,140
It's too heavy. Help me.

362
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,030
I thought it was for me.

363
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,590
It's from Zhao Jingjing.

364
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,880
(Zhaoqyeqing VIP)

365
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,000
It's really a generous gesture.

366
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,400
Isn't she afriad that you could
eat much enough to bankrupt Zhaoyeqing?

367
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,400
What are you talking about?

368
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,590
Do I really eat so much?

369
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,480
Are you attracted?

370
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,070
Will you let me go if I say yes?

371
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,200
No.

372
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,920
Zhao Jingjing is gonna rally all the chefs
whose knives were seized by you

373
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,070
to press you with public opinion.

374
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,790
They are even trying to
put pressure on me and the Alliance.

375
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,160
I haven't finished yet.

376
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,790
What else?

377
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,160
They said you are as evil,
cruel and cunning as a beast.

378
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,720
It's what you want to say, isn't it?

379
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,880
How do you know she will come to me?

380
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,880
She targeted you long time ago.

381
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,550
She just hasn't thought
you would go to Chuncheng.

382
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,110
And you think
I treated you today for nothing?

383
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,590
You are such a crafty old scoundrel.

384
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,110
Go to a place with me tomorrow.

385
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,750
Chef, I'm just a warehouse keeper.

386
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,240
We are looking for new food ingredients.

387
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,680
OK.

388
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,240
Then this should be overtime work,

389
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,270
and I should get paid.

390
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,790
It depends on your performance.

391
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,720
Hey, what's wrong?

392
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
My heat-preserving container.

393
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,000
I forgot that. I'll send it to you now.

394
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,510
Never mind. You keep it.

395
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,680
I even thought it was for me.

396
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,270
He just let me carry it.

397
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,400
Brown sugar ginger jujube soup.

398
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,680
Good for me to prevent cold.

399
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,030
Li Jidong, hurry.

400
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,920
I'm quite busy today. Be quick.

401
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,920
Hurry up.

402
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,030
Go.

403
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,070
My socks.

404
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,750
What?

405
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,720
My socks.

406
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,240
Aren't they on your feet?

407
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,440
Go.

408
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,510
My chess.

409
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,640
In my hand.

410
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,790
Go.

411
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,110
Li Jidong, hurry up. I'm late.

412
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,270
Hurry.

413
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,400
Hurry.

414
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,750
Be careful.

415
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,920
Easy.

416
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,590
You kicked my hat like a ball?

417
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,310
No.

418
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,000
You're so naughty.

419
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,880
What are we doing here?

420
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Do you know Three-Eye Qiao?

421
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,510
The one who is obsessed with
making condiments?

422
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,750
Isn't he living in suburbs?

423
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,400
He'll be here playing chess every Saturday,

424
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,200
and showing off

425
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,790
his newly collected condiments.

426
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,740
What are you doing?

427
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,640
I've got a cold.

428
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,000
Let's go and see what's new this time.

429
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,440
Here. Here.

430
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,510
A real gentleman will keep silent
when observing chess.

431
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
But I'm not a gentleman.

432
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
You know well about yourself.

433
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,510
That's it. You win.

434
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,270
Quickly. Take out your precious things!

435
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,110
Zhong is already getting impatient.

436
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,440
I'll leave you alone. I'm going home.

437
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,480
Master Qiao,

438
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,000
we also want what you you've brought today.

439
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,830
You don't even know what it is.

440
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,920
Isn't it dried tangerine peel?

441
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,680
Zhong, what's wrong?

442
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,880
Information runs so fast.

443
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,830
I can offer a higher price.

444
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,480
I can report you for bulling the market.

445
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,920
Little girl,

446
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,680
this is the ten-year dried tangerine peel
from Xinhui.

447
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,110
It won't be less expensive
even at the original price.

448
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,880
This is exactly what I want.

449
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,200
I have no money, but he has.

450
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,880
Qiao,

451
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,880
you know me well.

452
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,680
I gotta have
the dried tangerine peel today.

453
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,920
Easy. Easy.

454
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,750
To get the dried tangerine peel,

455
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,720
you gotta show something real.

456
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,160
Among these jars of dried tangerine peel,
only one is what you want.

457
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,070
Look at the time.

458
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Where is Li Nai?

459
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,200
Chef is coming soon.

460
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,070
Everybody,

461
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,830
Chef is busy with something else now,
and will come later.

462
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,480
Song Duo,

463
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,720
prepare the work
as the Chef told you yesterday.

464
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,030
OK.

465
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,920
Neither Li Nai nor the Chef is here.

466
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,350
Have they gone out together?

467
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,350
Doesn't make sense.

468
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,200
Chef just scolded Li Nai yesterday.

469
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:40,790
Stop it.

470
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,550
Chef must be out for a reason.

471
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,830
Dark red with a slight sweet fragrance,

472
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,070
this should be the dried tangerine peel
between five years and ten years.

473
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,270
Little girl,

474
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,070
you're just smelling it
without even observing it?

475
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,030
I've smelled the ten-year dried tangerine
peel from Xinhui, and I can make it out.

476
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
What a boaster!

477
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,270
You'll see.

478
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm done.

479
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,920
We've been using dried tangerine peel
for decades.

480
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,510
Are you gonna lose to a little girl?

481
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,400
She is bluffing.

482
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,920
It must be one of these.

483
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,110
I know.

484
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,270
What?

485
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,750
Master Qiao,

486
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,000
if Master Zhong didn't pick the right one,

487
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,590
are you still gonna sell it to him?

488
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,720
Absolutely no.

489
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,680
Qiao, you...

490
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,000
How about this, Master Zhong?

491
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,000
Let's make a bet.

492
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,400
If we win,

493
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,440
you must promise us something.
What do you think?

494
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,750
How can I make a bet with
such a young man like you?

495
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,400
What's more, it must be one of these two.

496
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,160
I got like fifty-fifty chance to win.

497
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,110
What if you lose?

498
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,350
You don't have to worry.

499
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,200
We won't ask for too much.

500
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,750
It's almost noon now.

501
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,070
We haven't had lunch yet.

502
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,750
How about you making a meal for us?

503
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,640
How do you know I can cook?

504
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,310
I've fortunately had
the chef set of Zhaoyeqing.

505
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,510
That's all you want?

506
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,400
That's all.

507
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,200
Then what can I get

508
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,440
from the bet?

509
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,590
If we win,

510
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,200
the dried tangerine peel is also yours.

511
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,480
If we lose,

512
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,830
we can also help you exclude the wrong one.

513
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,240
As you said, it looks like a one-way bet.

514
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,550
OK. I'm in.

515
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,160
You must win.

516
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,160
I'll pick this one.

517
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,160
Actually, this is also
the dried tangerine peel from Xinhui,

518
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,480
but it's not pure enough.

519
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,590
I wanna hear about it.

520
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,830
The quality of the dried tangerine peel
from Xinhui depends on the aging time,

521
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,920
aging method, storage location

522
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,030
and the climate in Xinhui.

523
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,350
There is only a subtle difference
between them,

524
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,830
but still not the same.

525
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,270
Then you tell me
what kind of dried tangerine peel this is.

526
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,960
This should be the five-year
dried tangerine peel bought from Xinhui,

527
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,070
and continued to age for five years
in Baichuan.

528
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,480
OK. Zhong.

529
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,270
You lost.

530
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,830
Go to prepare the meal.

531
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,030
I accept it.

532
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,550
Tell me.

533
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,110
What dish is the dried tangerine peel
in exchange for?

534
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,830
Soy-braised Pork with Abalone.

535
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,590
It's your specialty.

536
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,510
You come prepared.

537
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,790
By the way,

538
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,680
you look familiar.

539
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,960
It's you.

540
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,960
To avoid me, you even left Zhaoyeqing.

541
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,920
I thought you must bear my face

542
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,880
firmly in your mind.

543
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,310
Why would I avoid you?

544
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,590
It's just I'm old enough to retire.

545
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,110
Moreover,
your father and I are old friends.

546
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,920
Really?

547
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,070
How come I don't remember

548
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,510
my father has such an old friend like you?

549
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,400
You have a grudge against him.
Will he refuse to make the meal?

550
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,240
No. He won't.

551
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,880
He has been the Head Chef of Zhao family,

552
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,590
I believe he would keep his promise.

553
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,480
Taste it carefully.

554
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,750
Are you Xue's disciple?

555
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,110
She is Li Nai,

556
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,550
working for Chuncheng.

557
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,160
Eat and leave as soon as possible.

558
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,000
Which one tastes better?

559
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,400
Master Zhong's abalone is way better than
Zhao Jingjing's fried abalone.

560
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,720
It's true.

561
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,200
What?

562
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,070
What happened these two days

563
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,350
must be kept to yourself.

564
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,750
It's a secret.

565
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,200
Why did you lie just now?

566
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,550
We've never had Master Zhong's chef set.

567
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I didn't lie.

568
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,440
I was saying I'd had Zhaoyeqing's chef set

569
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,680
not his.

570
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,640
What a wily old fox.

571
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,440
The lunch is about to start.

572
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,030
Being late

573
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,480
will cause deduction in pay.

574
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,350
Chuncheng is competing with Zhaoyeqing
in the five-star review.

575
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,880
It's kinda like a bully.

576
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,350
What?
You're afraid that your idol will lose?

577
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,830
It's impossible! He is the Head Chef.

578
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,480
It's just Zhaoyeqing is at least
a century-old restaurant.

579
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,640
It's none of your business.

580
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:21,960
By the way,

581
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,110
did you go out with the Chef?

582
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,110
It's overtime work. Really annoying.

583
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,750
You should've felt honored to work overtime
with the Chef.

584
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,750
You will definitely learn a lot from him.

585
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,000
Maybe.

586
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,160
My taxi is coming. I gotta go.

587
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,070
OK.

588
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:42,750
Bye.

589
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,310
Bye.

590
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,750
Li Jidong.

591
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,030
Li Jidong, you haven't taken a shower
in five days.

592
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,000
I smell good.

593
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,310
Where is Uncle Li?

594
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,240
Uncle Li.

595
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,400
Uncle Li.

596
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,720
Uncle Li.

597
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,200
Can.

598
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,030
Uncle Li, I missed you so much!

599
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,240
Uncle Li,

600
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,310
I found a new job.

601
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,160
It's rubdown worker. What do you think?

602
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,350
Wanna have a try?

603
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,510
Li Nai.

604
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,750
Have you heard that?

605
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,550
Rubdown not only makes you comfortable,

606
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,440
but also makes you look younger
and prolongs your life.

607
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,880
Really?

608
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,350
Sure.

609
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,240
There was this old man,
looking like 60 years old when he came.

610
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,960
After I gave him a rubdown, guess what?

611
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,590
What?

612
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,200
He was thought to be under 30.

613
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,030
Then it must be worth a shot.

614
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,750
For sure.

615
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,000
You're even trying to trick me into that?
I'm just having Alzheimer's disease,

616
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,830
but I'm not an idiot.

617
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,270
I'm taking a shower.

618
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,030
Uncle Li, let me help you.

619
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Don't you go to work tomorrow?

620
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,280
Jiang Jie has a meeting

621
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,710
about the five-star review.

622
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,760
Speaking of this, I thought of a person,

623
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,030
the former Head Chef of Zhaoyeqing.

624
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,960
He might be the luckiest one
of the Alliance.

625
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,190
Zhong Haiyang?

626
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,800
Yeah.

627
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,000
He married Zhaoyeqing's
former Head Chef's daughter

628
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,190
and took over Zhaoyeqing smoothly
as the son-in-law.

629
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,840
And he hurried to retire
from the position of Head Chef

630
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,070
to save his later reputation.

631
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,320
What do you mean?

632
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,670
I heard on the grapevine that

633
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,670
Jiang Jie's next target to challenge
would be Zhaoyeqing.

634
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,030
So

635
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,880
passing the position to the family member
is better than losing it to Jiang Jie.

636
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,760
(To avoid me, you even left Zhaoyeqing.)

637
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,030
(I thought you must bear my face
firmly in your mind.)

638
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,280
When did Zhong Haiyang retire
from his position?

639
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,840
After our master's knife was seized.

640
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,280
(Zhao Jingjing was raised abroad
by her mother.)

641
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,000
(She returned suddenly three years ago,)

642
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,550
(when Zhaoyeqing was still operated
by her father in a traditional way,)

643
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,840
(with the Soy-braised Pork with Abalone
as the specialty.)

644
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,280
(After Zhao Jingjing came back,)

645
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,110
(she could've inherited Zhaoyeqing,
but she insisted on competing with her father.)

646
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,190
(They agreed on that both parties cooked
one dish each with abalone as the theme,)

647
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,590
(and the loser had to leave.)

648
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,400
(Zhong Haiyang refused it at first,
but he suddenly changed his mind recently.)

649
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,840
You mean

650
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,150
to avoid Jiang Jie,

651
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,920
Zhong Haiyang intentionally
let Zhao Jingjing confront Jiang Jie.

652
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,510
Right.

653
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,510
But I don't think Jiang Jie
is excellent enough

654
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,960
to scare away Zhong Haiyang.

655
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,070
Chef Jiang,
I've heard a lot about you.

656
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,480
You are...

657
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,480
Zhaoyeqing,

658
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,230
Zhao Jingjing.
