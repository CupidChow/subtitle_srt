Li Nai,

21
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,680
in the cellar that day,

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,840
you were awake, right?

23
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,230
You know,

24
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,280
one will be unconscious
due to a lack of oxygen.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,870
When one is unconscious,

26
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,030
he'll do something wild.

27
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,680
Today, I'm here

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,630
to apologize

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
for what I did that day.

30
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,840
Sorry.

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
Don't mention it.

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,400
I'll take it as a dog bite.

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,760
A dog?

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,960
I mean hot dog.

35
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,870
Hot dog.

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
I heard

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,280
what one does in a state of unconsciousness

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,030
is what he wants to do most subconsciously.

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,870
What he wants to do most

40
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
subconsciously?

41
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,430
It may be some nonsense.

42
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,910
Anyway, that's all for this matter.

43
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,430
You don't have to avoid me in Chuncheng.

44
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,680
I don't.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,150
It's just that I've been too busy lately.

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,030
Great.

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,840

the dream about Banana Princess
versus the three-legged monster.

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,040
It's just that our restaurant will open.

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,630

85
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,600
Xiu wasn't feeling well last night.

86
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
And we couldn't get a taxi.

87
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,560
I carried her back.

88
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,680
Indeed,

89
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,120
love will wear down one's willpower.

90
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,870
Better stay away from it.

91
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,390

105
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,200
We've got no customers today.

106
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,910
It's okay. It's the first day of business.

107
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,240
It's normal that we've got no customers.

108
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,030
We had too many customers before.

109
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,320
That's why we got those negative reviews.

110
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,550
We must be patient.

111
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,043

- Sir.
- Hello, our restaurant is newly opened.

116
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,390
Here's a typo.

117
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,510
Don't forget to revise it.

118
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,960
Cheer up.

119
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,440
(Reduced price)
This will definitely work.

120
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,200
Do you want me to lose a fortune?

121
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,630
Welcome...

122
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,910
Get up.

Li Nai.

124
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,790
Is it because sending out leaflets
barely works?

125
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,720
How about advertising our restaurant
on a big screen?

126
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,000
Or I can rent a vehicle for advertisement.

127
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,600
Business is closed.

128
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,440
Let's call it a day.

129
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,750
Li Nai.

130
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,200
You'll close the door. I've got to go.

131
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,790
Li Nai.

132
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,270
How romantic!

Watching stars here late at night.

134
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,000
Jiang Jie.

135
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,390
How did you make it?

136
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,720
Just to seize the knife.

137
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm not talking about the five stars.

138
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,360
Before seizing the knife, how did you

139
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,870
manage to open this restaurant?

140
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Just like you,

141
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,910
research,

142
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,200
study,

143
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,200
inquire,

144
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,270
and learn.

145
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,270
I did a market research,
studied the dish ranking,

146
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,670
inquired about the public needs,

147
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,120
and learned about management.

148
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,390
But these are

149
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,360
what I had to do as the restaurant owner.

150
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,910
You only need to turn
to the last page of the menu.

151
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,720
Then you'll know about Chuncheng.

152
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,000
Can you give me more details?

153
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,670
Do I look idle?

154
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,510
No, you're busy.

155
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,960
I thought you wanted me

156
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,150
to talk about the specific processes.

157
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,240
Any problems?

158
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,790
Sure,

159
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,440
but I'm expensive.

160
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,840
Bye.

161
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,080
You've received a payment of 1,000 yuan.

162
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,080
Thanks.

163
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,080
I'll report you
if you don't show me some real stuff.

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,080
Let's get started.

165
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,670
Go get changed then.

166
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,200
The time for changing clothes
must be excluded.

167
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,120
Are you done?

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,200
If you're still not ready,

169
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,840
I'll start to count time.

170
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,000
Coming. Coming. Don't press me.

171
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,320
So stupid.

172
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,840
Turn around.

173
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:15,960
Done.

174
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,080
It's indeed the service worth 1,000 yuan.

175
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,270
With this, what will you make?

176
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,120
Scrambled Egg with Tomato.

177
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,750

If you stay in this mind,

183
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,030
you can't even pass

184
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,870

Do you understand?

210
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Tell me more about it.

211
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,550
In Baichuan, there are lots of good chefs.

212
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,840
With the same mindset as yours,

213
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,440
if I open a Chinese restaurant

214
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,750
or a Western restaurant

215
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,750
with a special flavor,

216
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,030
I can make it to four stars at best.

217
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,600
Isn't a four-star rating good enough?

218
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,790
Of course not.
Do or do not, there's no try.

219
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,720
So, you analyzed the Chinese food
in a Western style

220
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,670
to make a new Chinese restaurant

221
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,320
that commingles tradition with innovation.

222
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,840
One more thing.

223
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:58,960
What's that?

224
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,270
I need to screen customers for Chuncheng.

225
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,390
Just like Zhao Jingjing,

226
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:05,630
by transforming Zhaoyeqing
in an Internet-celebrity style,

227
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,360
she gave a new life to the restaurant.

228
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Putting other factors aside,

229
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,720
given the business turnover and popularity,

230
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,440
it has got better than before.

231
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,270
So, Chuncheng only serves a limited number
of customers.

232
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,550
Only the lunch is offered
simply to screen customers.

233
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,150
Like, the clerks who can only rest at noon,

234
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,240
the old people
who can't make a reservation online,

235
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,870
and the students
who haven't started working,

236
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,120
aren't in the cards.

237
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,120
Those who are rich and free

238
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,080
are my target customers.

239
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,550
It's because only those
who have money and time

240
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,840
can help Chuncheng gain popularity quickly.

241
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,360
What's wrong?

242
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,080
I've got trypophobia.

243
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,870
I can't stay close to those who have
too many schemes.

244
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,440
It's late.

245
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,270
I should get going.

246
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,390
Wait. Wait.

247
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,960
Chef,

248
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,910
I was kidding.

249
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,000
Please teach me more.

250
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,510
Fine. Go on.

251
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,400
Are you awake?

252
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,400
The day has broken.

253
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,790
Class is over.

254
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,110
Get up.

255
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,680
Where are you going?

256
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,440
Your class is over,

257
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,160
but your task isn't.

258
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,680
Wake up.

259
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,720
Follow me.

260
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,110
Chef,

261
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,160
have I done anything wrong to offend you?

262
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,510
No worries, I won't sell you.

263
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't you have to work today?

264
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,720
Don't you need to rest?

265
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,160
Where are we going?
When will we go back?

266
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,270
Go back?

267
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, of course we must go back.

268
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
I forgot to tell you.

269
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,550
Call Ms. Wang

270
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,550
and tell her we won't go back tonight.

271
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,000
Not going back?

272
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,000
What?

273
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,240
Is there any other urgent thing
you need to do?

274
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,310
Are you feeling any better?

275
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,920
It's been over one week.
Of course I'm well now.

276
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,640
I'm showing my concern for you.

277
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,680
Don't you like the new helmet

278
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,880
I bought for you?

279
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,110
None of your business.

280
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,110
It happens that I have time today.

281
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,070
Shall we go for a ride?

282
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,510
Let's go.

283
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,720
No way.

284
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,720
No way.

285
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,830
I have something to do today.

286
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,590
Any other day than today is fine.

287
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,830
Not today. Any time is fine. Just...

288
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,350
I'm available anytime, but today...

289
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,680
Call me anytime, Xiu!

290
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,550
I'm not available only today.

291
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,880
Li Nai.

292
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Li Nai, let me tell you.

293
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,790
It's really a big loss for me.

294
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,960
Unbelievable.

295
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,920
Chef and Li Nai are both on leave today.

296
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,000
Can you tell me what you're doing now?

297
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,240
I'm gonna challenge Ge Qunshan next.

298
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,640
Isn't he living as recluse?

299
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,960
He's living as recluse, not retired.

300
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,030
Ge Qunshan is good at bringing out
the natural flavor of food.

301
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,350
So, today, we'll go camping.

302
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,750
Camping?

303
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,350
You'll go camping for your challenge.
Why did you bring me here?

304
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,680
Getting overtime pay
or having your pay docked? Choose.

305
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,240
What can I do for you?

306
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,960
The tent and the stove are in the trunk.

307
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,070
Now, I'm expecting customers and

308
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,110
also afraid that customers are coming.

309
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,590
What should I do?

310
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,550
What's going on?

311
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,440
Eating at Dusk?

312
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
What kind of place is this?

313
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,160
All the showy stuff.

314
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,550
Aren't you close to Li Nai?

315
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,160
Why don't you get a better job

316
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,240
just like her?

317
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,510
Xiu.

318
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,240
How did you find me?

319
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,400
Isn't it easy for me to find a man?

320
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,550
You're deliberately

321
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,640
here for me?

322
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,550
Is there any alcohol?

323
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,830
I won't go to the bar today.
I'll hang out in your place.

324
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,880
Yes, there's a lot.

325
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,270
Where are the food ingredients?

326
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,880
I said, where are the food ingredients?

327
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,200
I went out so hastily
that I left them behind.

328
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,270
I'm going back home.

329
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,160
I'll dock your pay.

330
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,160
Fire me.

331
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,720
By the way, getting close to nature

332
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,400
may be able to acquire a deeper
understanding of natural flavors.

333
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,110
We'll have fish tonight.

334
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,880
Follow me.

335
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,250
Hurry.

336
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,621
Left.

337
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,240
Left.

338
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,200
Left, not right.

339
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,160
Spear it.

340
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,550
You can't tell left from right.

341
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,720
Li Nai.

342
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,070
Forget it. I'll go home.

343
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,310
What's wrong?

344
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,960
What's wrong? Let me take a look.

345
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:06,880
What's wrong?

346
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,110
You wanna set me up?

347
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,750
Do you admit defeat?

348
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,030
Do you admit it?

349
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,350
Do you?

350
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:17,883
Li Nai!

351
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,830
I'll go and pick mushrooms.

352
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,310
Take care.

353
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,720
You've really speared a fish?

354
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,000
The fish doesn't look like being speared.

355
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,400
I noticed a tent over there.

356
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,510
It wasn't there just now.

357
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,440
You'll sleep there tonight.

358
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,350
Was it put up by you?

359
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,720
You're so nice.

360
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,110
How to cook the fish?

361
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,680
We don't have other food ingredients.

362
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,070
I've got some mushrooms
and wild herbs only.

363
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:18,829
Li Nai.

364
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,200
Be quiet.

365
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,440
Let's eat.

366
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,720
No wonder you specially came here
for camping and cooking.

367
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,400
Without complicated cooking steps,

368
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,680
only the mixture
of the food's original flavors

369
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
can bring out the food's authentic taste.

370
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,790
Is it going to rain?

371
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,640
It's bad enough
that you have no customers here.

372
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,070
Why don't you even have a chef?

373
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,440
I'm here to take care of the restaurant.

374
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,200
I don't know that either.

375
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,440
You're so useless.

376
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,160
Why don't you

377
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,000
come to work at Xijiangyue?

378
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,750
There has been decoration nearby lately.

379
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,240
Put on this

380
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,880
and you'll feel a lot better.

381
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,030
I'll go talk to them.

382
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,830
Hang on and they'll finish right away.

383
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,830
Is the cloud seeding so punctual?

384
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,110
It rained at 8 o'clock as reported.

385
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,240
Are you alright?

386
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,920
It should be cloud seeding.
It'll be over soon.

387
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,270
Here. I'll add more water to your cup.

388
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,880
Cheers.

389
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,750
My tent!

390
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,070
Well, the freebie
is of poor quality indeed.

391
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I'll file a complaint when I go back.

392
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,790
Well,

393
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,350
now that the tent is broken,
where can I sleep?

394
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,270
Oh right.

395
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,350
How about spending the night in the car?

396
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,160
With the air conditioner on
and the window a bit open.

397
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,550
Then I'll clean the mess in the car now.

398
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,720
Be careful not to slip.

399
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,830
It's gonna rain.

400
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,400
My leg is starting to ache again.

401
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,160
News said there would be cloud seeding
at 8 o'clock tomorrow night.

402
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,750
Does the cloud seeding affect rheumatism?

403
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,510
The car has run out of gas.

404
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,240
I was too hasty to go out

405
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,640
to notice that today.

406
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:25,880
Here.

407
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,240
Don't get a cold.

408
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,510
It's my fault.

409
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,160
Well, you'll sleep in the tent tonight

411
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,680
and I'll sleep in the car.

412
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,070
Hold on.

413
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,790
What's wrong?

414
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,000
How about

415
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,880
we both sleep in the tent for the night?

416
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,830
You're vulnerable to illness.

417
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,880
If you catch a cold, you'll blame me again.

418
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:23,880
Well,

419
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,350
let's make do with it then.

420
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,283
What...

421
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,110
What's wrong?

422
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,790
I... I'm looking for my phone.

423
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,510
It's right here.

424
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,070
Thank you.

425
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,400
Daddy,

426
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,590
is this prepared for Mommy?

427
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,830
Of course.

428
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,070
Jiang Jie,

429
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,350
you must keep it a secret for me.

430
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,750
How did you and Mommy become a couple?

431
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,790
Of course it's me who made the first move.

432
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,960
Jiang Jie.

433
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,920
If you've fallen for any girl,

434
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,400
don't let her go.

435
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,640
Be patient

436
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,920
and win her over.

437
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,350
This way, you can hold onto her forever.

438
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,160
Jiang Jie.
