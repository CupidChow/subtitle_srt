20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,316
Jiang Jie,

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,680
this is for you.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,290
What is it?

23
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,510
I thought you might want to know
its current condition,

24
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,070
so I especially took this photo of it.

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,640
Why are you in the photo, too?

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,150
I thought a fish doesn't look good alone.

27
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,120
Did you turn on
the light of the fish tank?

28
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,950
I said if you didn't turn on the light...

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,590
Sorry. I intended to warn you.

30
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,070
It really hurts a lot.

31
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,950
Did you twist your ankle?

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
Isn't this Jiang Jie?

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,870
What happened to him?

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,800
Take this.

35
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,750
I am injured.

36
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,360
You can cover your face with it.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,680
What happened?

38
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,710
What exactly is her purpose?

39
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,430
What did you hide?

40
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,910
Nothing.

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,470
Stop looking.

42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,520
She is helping do your work
in the canteen.

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,240
I will pay her wages.

44
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,080
Come on, let's play a game.

45
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,520
Checkmate.

46
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,870
I lost.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,920
Come on.

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,150
You acted calmly in the game today.

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
Is it because Li Nai is here?

50
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,400
Her?

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,120
Right.

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,910
Her presence makes me more eager to win.

53
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,120
As you know,

54
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,630
she seized my knife in the contest.

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,400
I can see that

56
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,470
you don't dislike her.

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,870
She traveled far to come to see you.

58
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,680
What does this suggest?

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,310
It suggests she fancies you.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,080
I am not sure.

61
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,750
I am not sure.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,000
How could that be possible?

63
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,630
Sir.

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Sir!

65
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,680
Don't talk nonsense.

66
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,400
She only thinks she can use me.

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,800
Nonsense.

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,910
Use you for what?

69
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,080
I don't understand you young people.

70
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:57,950
Well,

71
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,190
she asked me to give you this.

72
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,560
Go to bed early.

73
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
(Li Jidong said)

74
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,750
(that if a sick man knocked his head
against an egg,)

75
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,080
(he would get well soon.)

76
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:59,287
(Jiang Yuanshan impersonates his brother
to challenge the Ge family recklessly?)

77
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,830
(Ge Qunshan live as a hermit
in this mountain village)

78
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,160
(because of the Jiang family.)

79
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,240
The lunch service is over.

80
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,190
It's said Cao's Fish is undergoing
a five-star review these days.

81
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,750
It just changed its Chef

82
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,310
a month ago.

83
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,630
I thought the seven families
can be exempt from that.

84
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,870
Our restaurant
hasn't undergone a review, right?

85
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
Did you forget
what happened to Zhaoyeqing?

86
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,040
Xijiangyue is different from
other restaurants.

87
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,160
Considering Mr. Jiang's status
in the alliance,

88
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,740
who dares to subject his granddaughter
to a review?

89
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,390
The reviewers of the alliance can't cook.

90
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,160
How can they
be qualified to appraise me?

91
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,460
(Cui Can)

92
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,270
(Sorry,
the number you dialed is powered off.)

93
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,800
Cui Can,

94
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,480
you will be screwed if I find you.

95
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,430
Miss.

96
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,070
Sorry, you can't park here.

97
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,000
Why can't I park here?

98
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
I am really sorry.

99
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,310
For special reasons,

100
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,190
nobody can park here
throughout this week.

101
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,000
Please understand.

102
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,750
Special reasons?

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Cao's Fish.

104
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,160
To cope with the review,

105
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,938
your shop's image management
extends across the road.

106
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,510
Aren't your people too obsequious?

107
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,600
Miss, please show respect.

108
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,510
All right.

109
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,630
I am in a good mood today,

110
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,870
so I won't cause trouble to Cao Liang.

111
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,949
Shall we hold hands or link arms?

112
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,830
We just need to link arms.

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,560
Cui Can! I dare you touch her!

114
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,950
Who is she?

115
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,920
A friend.

116
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,920
A friend?

117
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,000
Excuse me,

118
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
we have booked a table for lunch.

119
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,190
We are running late.

120
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:06,950
Have lunch?

121
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,390
Since you like lunch so much,

122
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,870
- you also like punches, right?
- Jiang Xiu.

123
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,160
Crazy woman!

124
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,430
Let go of me!

125
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,800
Miss,

126
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,070
- you can't fight here.
- Bugger off!

127
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,120
As you wish.

128
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,000
Give me an explanation.

129
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,270
She is only the extra I hired.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,390
She will join me for a meal
with Cao's Fish.

131
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,510
Cui Can,

132
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,430
have we broken up?

133
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,750
You want to break up with me?

134
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,750
Since we didn't break up,

135
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,270
you should turn to me
instead of hiring an extra.

136
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,030
I have my reasons.

137
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,080
Reasons?

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,240
What reasons?

139
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,030
What are the reasons for
your French leave

140
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,240
and two months' disappearance?

141
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,870
Let me sort out my thoughts.

142
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,030
You hired an extra to play your lover

143
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,120
to dine in Cao's Fish.

144
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,080
It is undergoing the five-star review
given by the alliance these days.

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,120
So, you have become
an alliance reviewer?

146
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,960
You can't become a reviewer
unless your elder sister

147
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,480
gives her place in the Cui family to you.

148
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,910
What is it?

149
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,080
Did you go back to your elder sister?

150
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,870
Do you know she and Jiang Xuyang
are in close contact these days?

151
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,270
I am a member of the Cui family.

152
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,050
Now our Cui family is in difficulties.

153
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,870
Cooperating with him can help bring back
money to enable our family to survive.

154
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,200
There are lots of ways
to save your Cui family.

155
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,600
You should have told me.

156
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,150
- I can also help you.
- How can you help me?

157
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,630
How much clout do your words carry
with the Jiang family?

158
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,670
Right.

159
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,960
I am a nobody.

160
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,320
Xiu,

161
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
I didn't mean that. Sorry.

162
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,030
Cui Can,

163
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,080
continue being the young master
of the Cui family.

164
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,480
It's over between us.

165
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,200
Jiang Jie,

166
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,670
why did you go downstairs?

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,150
Your foot is still in bad condition.

168
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,080
It is fine.

169
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,440
How can it be fine?

170
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,150
- What are you doing?
- Your foot is swollen.

171
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Leave me alone.

172
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,840
- I am gonna work in a while.
- Will you go to the canteen?

173
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,550
Mr. Ge has gone there with my father.

174
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,960
He said your help wasn't needed today.

175
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,630
You have nothing to do today?

176
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,643
How is your investigation
into the ingredients?

177
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,960
Don't worry. I have signed
the supply contract this morning.

178
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,270
I am free for the rest of the day today.

179
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,750
Congratulations!

180
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,030
Then you can have a good rest at home.

181
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,200
I have a lot of things to do.

182
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,480
You'll have to apply ice first
wherever you go.

183
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,790
I don't need ice compress.

184
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,150
Li Nai!

185
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,440
All right. I will apply ice.

186
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,080
You must apply ice within 24 hours
after spraining your ankle.

187
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,270
Come on, lift your foot.

188
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,120
- I, I will do it myself.
- Let me do it.

189
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,080
The freezer of Mr. Ge's refrigerator
doesn't work.

190
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,440
Thus, I fetched the ice
from the canteen.

191
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,720
Let me do this by myself.

192
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,980
I am afraid that
you can't do this to yourself.

193
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,240
Do you feel numb?

194
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,510
- It hurts.
- It's reasonable to feel numb.

195
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,150
You see, when we were together,

196
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,270
either I fell and got injured
or you took a fever.

197
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,080
And we were even locked up in a cellar.

198
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,910
What does this suggest?

199
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,101
It suggests our horoscopes
are not a good match

200
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
and we shouldn't stay together.

201
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,030
But we have always
turned ill luck into good.

202
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,000
This means you are my lucky star
and I am yours.

203
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,960
How could my lucky star seize my knife?

204
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,200
Thank you for the cold compress today,
Chef Li.

205
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,750
I will go play chess. You can rest at home.

206
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,320
- What is it?
- It's dirty here.

207
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,120
No need.

208
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Jiang Jie, I am free today.
Let me play chess with you.

209
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,720
The ice compress made my hands cold.

210
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,200
Let me warm my hands in your pocket.

211
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,960
Take them out.

212
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,030
You are trouble.

213
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:02,930
You need not help me.

214
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,790
Sorry.

215
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,550
If you really want to do something,
pour me a cup of water.

216
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,630
With pleasure.

217
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,440
It's good to have someone around you.

218
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,790
You are playing chess
in a much calmer manner.

219
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,960
Why does everyone think
this is attributed to her?

220
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,720
No matter what relation there is,

221
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
isn't it good to see things change?

222
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
So what?

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,200
I lost all the games.

224
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,200
Actually, Ge doesn't care
whether he loses or wins.

225
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,000
You will win if he lets you.

226
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,270
Checkmate.

227
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,030
Guess what I brought you.

228
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,910
Oranges.

229
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,870
How come you know?

230
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,750
Though I am not as sharp-nosed as you,

231
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,870
I can smell the orange.

232
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,760
Here you are.

233
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,480
The oranges produced here are very sweet.

234
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,390
I have been here for two months.

235
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,670
Where are you going?

236
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,910
I am going to the bathroom.
Will you come with me?

237
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,480
Lass,

238
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,960
let's play a game of chess.

239
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,240
- As you wish.
- Come on.

240
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,670
Jiang Jie!

241
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,150
Why are you here?

242
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,910
You're gonna help Mrs. Li chop firewood,
right?

243
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,790
Instead of paying Ge Qunshan
to know things about me,

244
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,080
you can transfer the money to me.

245
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,320
I can help you chop firewood.

246
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,150
Jiang Jie,

247
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,630
are you thirsty?

248
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,670
Jiang Jie,

249
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,720
are you tired?

250
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,670
Jiang Jie,

251
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,390
have you had your meal?

252
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,840
Seeing you two like this,

253
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
I thought of the days when I was young.

254
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,840
Back then,

255
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,550
I wanted to spend every moment
with my husband.

256
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,760
Li Nai,

257
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,510
didn't you say you wanted to help me?

258
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,080
- Come on, chop all the rest for me.
- OK.

259
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,270
Go on.

260
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,320
Won't you wait for me?

261
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,550
You always know my whereabouts, right?

262
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,270
After you finish the work here,

263
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,550
you can come to see me.

264
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,030
That's right.

265
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,120
I may catch up with you
while you're still on the way.

266
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll wait for you.

267
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,150
You lost him?

268
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,270
Li Jidong,

269
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,510
will you take a nap after lunch?

270
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,480
No, I won't.

271
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,270
- Are you tired? Need you have a rest?
- No.

272
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,960
You take after your father.

273
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,750
You are both stubborn.

274
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,150
He lives in a much simpler world.

275
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,550
You should know

276
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,510
in this world,

277
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,390
there are short cuts you can take.

278
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,630
(Two hundred yuan got wired into
your Alipay account.)

279
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,030
This is more than enough, silly girl.

280
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,550
Never mind.

281
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,000
East of the village.

282
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,110
In the bamboo forest on the mountain.

283
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,160
Bamboo forest?

284
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,400
How can he go up the mountain
with foot injury?

285
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,350
You quarreled with Jiang Xiu?

286
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,790
Jing,

287
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,030
how come you know it?

288
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,070
Jiang Xuyang told it to me.

289
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,750
He said Jiang Xiu
was smashing things in her room

290
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,240
for reasons he didn't know.

291
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,960
I am not blaming you,

292
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,030
but I think as a man,
you should humor her.

293
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,480
Moreover, she is the Head Chef
of the Jiang family now.

294
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,960
You will benefit a lot if you please her.

295
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,030
I don't want to do that.

296
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,400
I broke up with her.

297
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,960
Shall I introduce you to
some other girl?

298
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,640
Jing, give me a break, please.

299
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,680
My head aches every day
when I think of work.

300
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,240
I won't be in a relationship
anytime soon.

301
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,640
The job of a practice reviewer
tires you so much?

302
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,070
I need to get used to it gradually.

303
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,920
But time waits for no one.

304
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,160
Let's do it this way.

305
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,960
From now on, you'll take over
my job of a reviewer in the alliance.

306
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,640
- Your probationary period is over.
- Jing.

307
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,830
No bargain.

308
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,550
Got it.

309
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,680
You are back?

310
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,400
I have been back for a while.

311
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,070
Well, where is Li Nai?

312
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,000
Her dad wants to see her.

313
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,750
How come I know where she is?

314
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,200
Didn't she stay with you guys?

315
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,640
She went up the mountain in the afternoon.

316
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
To help you dig bamboo shoots.

317
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,110
I didn't go dig bamboo shoots today?

318
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,030
You didn't?

319
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,270
This is not good.

320
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,880
The bamboo forest is strewn with pits.
I hope she won't fall into the pit.

321
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,720
- Your foot!
- Don't worry.

322
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,400
- Watch over Mr. Li.
- You...

323
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,030
Li Nai!

324
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,640
Li Nai!

325
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,680
(Sorry, the subscriber you dialed
can't be connected for the moment.)

326
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,880
Where did she go?

327
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,480
Li Nai!

328
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,350
Li Nai!

329
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,880
Li Nai!

330
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,680
(It's me. Haven't you found her?)

331
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,550
(Do you need my help?)

332
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,790
Li Nai may not be on the mountain.

333
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,960
By the way,
isn't there a radio station in the village?

334
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,790
- Go broadcast her disappearance.
- OK, I will. Be careful.

335
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,550
Li Nai!

336
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,720
Li Nai!

337
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,160
Li Nai!

338
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,400
Li Nai!

339
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,200
Li Nai!

340
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,310
Li Nai!

341
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,440
Li Nai!

342
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,240
Li Nai!

343
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,750
Jiang Jie.

344
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,550
I knew you could find me.

345
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,350
Are you all right?

346
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,200
I am fine.
The pit is so deep that I can't climb up.

347
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
I have no tools with me.

348
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,400
You go and get people.

349
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,640
I can wait for you.

350
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,920
(Hello. I just arrived
and didn't start broadcasting.)

351
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,310
Ge Qunshan, there's no need.

352
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,240
I found her and she fell into a pit.

353
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,640
(Oh, got it. Is she all right?)

354
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,341
She is fine.

355
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,440
It's 50 meters above the site

356
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,070
where we usually dig bamboo shoots.

357
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,636
- Hurry up.
- (OK.)

358
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,480
Step aside.

359
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,340
Jiang Jie!

360
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Your foot.

361
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,350
It's all right.

362
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,680
You can wait for me up there.

363
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,750
Why did you jump down?

364
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,030
You should say this earlier.

365
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,960
One sleeve for each.

366
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,400
Just like yesterday.

367
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Do you know

368
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,920
why all the stories say

369
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,030
humans will turn into stars after death?

370
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,160
The reason might be

371
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,030
that the stars are commonly seen
but unreachable.

372
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,550
They are the most deceptive.

373
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,160
Jiang Jie,

374
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,000
I came to see you this time because...

375
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,640
Li Nai,

376
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,200
I don't want to know the reason.

377
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,400
I think
I have made it quite clear to you.

378
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,680
We are even.

379
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,790
I know.

380
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,030
I am staying in the same house with you

381
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,440
because I still have things
to talk with Ge Qunshan.

382
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,240
I came to find you
because your disappearance involved me.

383
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
I jumped down

384
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,310
to avoid being held responsible for
anyone's injury.

385
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,070
I know.

386
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,350
You don't have to put it so bluntly.
I know that...

387
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,920
We will never be on the same side.

388
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,640
So, please leave me alone from now on.

389
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,720
I don't want to see you again.

390
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,640
Sorry.

391
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,680
Anybody there?

392
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,110
I didn't see them.

393
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,350
Let's go over there.

394
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,000

Yes. It wasn't seriously injured.

419
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,880
Well, stop looking around.
Li Nai and her dad have left.

420
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,720
They are gone.

421
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,270
I am looking for the hoe.

422
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,110
You know
I didn't dig bamboo shoots yesterday.

423
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,680
You just won't admit it.

424
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,640
You young people don't know
how to cherish things.

425
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,200
Did you play chess today?

426
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,750
I don't want to. It's boring.

427
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,790
Why do you think that?

428
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,720
Over the past days,
I've been thinking about

429
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,240
why you made me play chess
which I know nothing about

430
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,270
instead of letting me learn cooking.

431
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,510
Did you figure it out?

432
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,920
You want to see me lose.

433
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,680
Or putting it exactly,

434
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,640
you want me to get used to losing.

435
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,750
- Have you got used to it?
- No.

436
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,920
But I have learned to accept it.

437
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,160
In the past,
I only thought about winning,

438
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
so I ignored the things and people
around me.

439
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,350
However, actually,

440
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,510
sometimes, a pawn

441
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,790
can decide whether one can win.

442
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,830
You think you are strong.

443
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,640
I ever told you

444
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,000
you wanted to win
after you made the first move.

445
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,510
Therefore, no doubt you'll lose.

446
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,660
Come on, play a game with me.
I am in the mood today.

447
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,110
Checkmate.

448
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,070
I won.

449
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,070
Shouldn't you fulfill your promise?

450
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,640
What if I get back on my word?

451
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,960
You made up the rule.

452
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,110
Yes, I did. But I can change it.

453
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,480
You can obey it as you like.

454
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,270
What can you do to me
if I don't obey it?

455
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,270
What can you do? What?

456
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,000
I got it.

457
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,000
This is the reason

458
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,200
why you still closed your shop
and retired to the village

459
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,200
after you defeated
the defending Jiang family back then.

460
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,000
You are quick-witted.

461
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,790
Playing chess is not important.

462
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,440
The things you want to teach me

463
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,880
are partly manifested
in the chess game.

464
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,960
However, you want more of me

465
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,830
to flip the chessboard over.

466
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,680
Good!

467
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,680
Jiang Jie,

468
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:03,374
let's go somewhere together.

469
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,350
Drink less.

470
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,880
You are not young. You may get ill.

471
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,830
Focus on driving.

472
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,110
I am only enjoying the wine while I can.

473
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,350
It might cause you a cerebral stroke.

474
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,680
Your life may be miserable
with no care from anyone.

475
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,200
I have no children.

476
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,070
If what you said really happens,

477
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,070
I will drown myself
in the water reservoir.

478
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,960
What if
someone is willing to look after you?

479
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,830
Mr. Wang.

480
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,920
Professor Ge.

481
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,563
Nice to meet you.

482
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,640
- I'll leave you two talking.
- OK.

483
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,750
You knew each other.

484
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,000
So, you playacted
in front of me on that day.

485
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,750
I have waited

486
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,680
till you leaped at the bait.

487
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,000
You have kept me here
for two months.

488
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,640
I ever thought
you wanted to put me to the test,

489
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,920
but I didn't expect you
to plan it so early.

490
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,640
Luckily, you didn't lose patience

491
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,200
and stood the test.

492
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,640
Otherwise, I won't bother to talk to you.

493
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,920
What is it about today?

494
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,510
Did you take me here today

495
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,240
to show me the new things you planned?

496
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,680
Twenty years ago,

497
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,200
this shop belonged to me.

498
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,920
Back then,

499
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,680
the shingle of my shop Qingfengnian
was hanging up there.

500
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,200
I began to notice you

501
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,680
after you seized the knife
from Chef Xue.

502
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,790
Back then, I thought you were sent by
the Jiang family to get rid of dissidents.

503
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,920
I cursed you every day.

504
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,480
The people of your Jiang family
have always been hypocritical.

505
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,480
I am not connected with them
in any way.

506
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,310
But you are right about one thing.

507
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,880
They are indeed hypocritical.

508
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
When you were defeated,

509
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,790
I changed my mind about you.

510
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,030
Because the Jiang family won't allow
any defeat and won't take defeat easily.

511
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,160
After that happened,

512
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,310
I began to wonder

513
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,110
why you did all those things.

514
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,160
Then I found out that

515
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,310
your father

516
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,070
is Jiang Yuanshan.

517
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,400
The person defeated by you
is Jiang Yuanfeng.

518
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,720
The Jiang family is phonier
than I expected.

519
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,030
Though they are both biological sons,

520
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,160
your father was abandoned
because he was untalented.

521
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,030
Talent?

522
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,510
Talent means everything to Jiang Ziqing.

523
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,480
He abandoned my dad
because my dad is untalented

524
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,640
and took control of my younger sister

525
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,160
because she is talented
and made her a puppet.

526
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,640
However, he forgot

527
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,550
a puppet has no feelings,

528
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,400
but a human does.

529
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,750
(Our Ge school believes
all beings are distinctive in nature.)

530
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,510
(You asked me
why I didn't teach you cooking.)

531
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,000
(It is because
you are in a league of your own)

532
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,310
and have your style.

533
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,350
What can I teach you?

534
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,920
(You thought too much
when you cooked.)

535
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,510
(You thought about
how others would plot against you)

536
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,350
(and how they would set traps
for you insidiously.)

537
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,310
(But you never thought about)

538
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,880
(cooking a dish single-mindedly.)

539
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:17,918
(My darling Wang Ailin's Tomb)
My wife is buried here.

540
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,790
While she was alive, her favorite dish

541
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,920
was Salted Park Soup,
the signature dish of our Ge family.

542
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,880
I asked her

543
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,960
why she thought the dish was delicious.

544
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,350
She told me

545
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,920
she couldn't get enough of it

546
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
because I cooked it.

547
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,920
When I was young,

548
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,310
I was as arrogant as you.

549
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,510
I always thought effortlessly,

550
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,030
I could make a splash in Baichuan.

551
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,510
The seven families

552
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,510
and the alliance

553
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,510
were nothing.

554
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,550
Why should

555
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,880
the seven families be allowed to

556
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,000
enjoy a high status

557
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,400
throughout a century?

558
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,960
So, this is why

559
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,110
you challenged the title defender.

560
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:40,865
Yes.

561
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,750
Back then, I thought

562
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,350
by defeating the defender,

563
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,310
I would be able to uproot
this old tree growing in Baichuan.

564
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,960
That Jiang Yuanfeng

565
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,480
was really poor at cooking.

566
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,750
Competing against him

567
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,070
was an insult to me.

568
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,880
I defeated him hands down.

569
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,270
What was the use of that?

570
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,310
In the end, it was you who vanished

571
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,400
from Baichuan, right?

572
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,230
Because the Jiang family
didn't accept defeat,

573
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,920
didn't allow the alliance
and the seven families to lose

574
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,880
and didn't allow the 200-year-old rule
to be broken.

575
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,150
You could have returned
after they drove you away.

576
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,760
Judging from your temperament,

577
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,510
I don't think
you would obey their rules willingly.

578
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,670
Of course I wouldn't.

579
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,510
But unluckily, just then,

580
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,630
my wife fell ill.

581
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,280
She was seriously ill.

582
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,840
Treating her illness
would cost much money.

583
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,230
Even selling Qingfengnian
and the knife of victory

584
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,360
couldn't get me enough money.

585
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,230
I thought,

586
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,630
I thought I would never be able to

587
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,070
accomplish the mission of my youth.

588
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,550
But I didn't expect

589
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
you showed up.

590
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,060
(Ge)

591
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,280
You want me to defeat
the defender for you, right?

592
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
As long as the alliance
and seven families exist,

593
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,670
the catering market of Baichuan
is bound to

594
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,000
be stuck in a foul atmosphere.

595
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,100
Just think about it. Over the years,

596
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,880
small restaurants that survived
in Baichuan have been scarce.

597
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,760
They are not powerful or well-connected

598
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,670
and all live at the alliance's mercy.

599
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,110
How can the alliance do that

600
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,000
and why can it do that?

601
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,630
As long as the alliance exists,
the Jiang family will remain powerful.

602
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,730
With the Jiang family being powerful,
all efforts will be futile.

603
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,550
This is what you tried to tell me, right?

604
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,070
Will you take

605
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,670
this knife or not?

606
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,480
Master, my homage to you.

607
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,280
Good disciple.

608
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,070
Help me overthrow

609
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,840
the chessboard.
