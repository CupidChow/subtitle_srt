=Episode 14=

20
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,350
Did you supply the ingredients

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
to Eating at Dusk on behalf of Xijiangyue?

22
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,840
Yes.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,280
How much do you know about the contest
between the Li family and Chuncheng?

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,640
Grandpa,

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,070
I had no idea that Li Nai is
the successor of the Li family.

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,790
I dealt with Xijiangyue's almost expired
ingredients as I normally would.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,200
The declining Li family
now holds Jiang Jie's final knife.

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,790
This isn't bad.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,400
Firewood Rice and Cao's Fish
have been asking me lately

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,510
about the Jiang family's plans.

31
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,960
Jiang Jie has seized two five-star knives.

32
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,680
Obviously, his next target
would be either one of them.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,120
I believe
they must have misunderstood you.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,520
They misunderstood that Jiang Jie
is doing this because you instructed him.

35
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,470
Misunderstood?

36
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,310
Then, let them continue to misunderstand.

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,590
I may not fully understand this matter,

38
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,910
but it is a fact that Jiang Jie is capable

39
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,520
of oppressing Firewood Rice
and Cao's Fish.

40
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,960
After Jiang Jie
seized the Li family's knife,

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I will pay him a visit.

42
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,870
Grandpa,

43
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,080
are you planning on accepting Jiang Jie
into the family again?

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,400
Jiang Jie's ultimate goal
in his pursuit of seizing knives

45
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,400
is the Jiang family.

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I know.

47
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,120
After what happened to their family,

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Jiang Jie remained stubborn

49
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,590
and refused to go back
to the Jiang family.

50
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,240
After so many years,

51
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,870
he hasn't disappointed me.

52
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,840
Besides, if he wants
the Jiang family's knife,

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,280
seizing it isn't the only way available.

54
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,310
We are still family, after all.

55
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,750
Yes, Grandpa.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,430
I'll stop supplying ingredients

57
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,630
to Eating at Dusk immediately.

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,800
No need.

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,910
The more brilliantly
Jiang Jie seizes knives,

60
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,400
the more brilliantly

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,910
our Jiang family will shine
when he comes home.

62
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,750
Weak opponents

63
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,630
are no use to us.

64
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,520
Li Nai,

65
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,630
these are just some ingredients.

66
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,310
Aren't we being too sensitive?

67
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,710
Jiang Jie is ruthless
and will use any means necessary.

68
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,750
We're his opponents right now.

69
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,000
It's better to be safe than sorry.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,310
Do you think
Jiang Jie might have sent these?

71
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,080
Hello.

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,960
My deepest apologies, Chef Li.

73
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,190
I've troubled you.

74
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,750
Okay.

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,360
Bye-bye.

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,630
Who was it?

77
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,400
Jiang Xuyang.

78
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,240
He said Xijiangyue made a mistake
in delivery.

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,630
They'll take them back later.

80
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,630
Xijiangyue?

81
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,310
Somehow,
I think Jiang Xuyang isn't reliable.

82
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,560
Because I heard

83
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,630
he messes around with women.

84
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,430
You didn't hear that
from Jiang Xiu, right?

85
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,000
Of course, not.

86
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,680
I... Let's prepare high-quality ingredients
for the contest.

87
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,390
Why don't I compete in farming instead?

88
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,360
The contest is about skills.

89
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,680
Chuncheng will also prepare
similar ingredients for the contest.

90
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,920
We'll be prepared if we do this.

91
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,680
No need.

92
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,720
These expensive ingredients
aren't suitable for us.

93
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,630
My goal remains the same as Master.

94
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,480
Plain

95
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,190
but tasty.

96
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,870
Ingredients such as shark fin
and fish maw are good,

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,270
but they are not suitable for us.

98
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,160
Ms. Cui,

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,240
would you be interested

100
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,950
in serving as a judge
in the knife-seizure contest?

101
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,830
It's all beef.

102
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,920
Li Nai,

103
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,870
your cooking skills
made rapid improvement.

104
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,040
It's not done yet.
Bake for a while longer.

105
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,560
What are you doing?

106
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,720
Don't come to work if you're going
to be in that state all the time.

107
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,560
Go take a drink.

108
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,440
Li Nai.

109
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,040
Mr. Zheng.

110
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,160
Don't you think the Chef is
being too strict with you?

111
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,190
You've actually
made a lot of improvements

112
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,430
since you started here.

113
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,120
But I'm still incomparable to him.

114
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,480
So, I hope he will be
as strict as possible with me.

115
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,950
Mr. Zheng.

116
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,870
Coming.

117
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,630
I feel kinda sad
that you two aren't together.

118
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:18,167
What?

119
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm going over there in a while.

120
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,390
- I'm leaving the rest to you.
- Sure.

121
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,270
What's wrong?

122
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
That's important.

123
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,870
Aren't you taking her along?

124
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,240
Although there's no chance for love,

125
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,830
she is still a good worker.

126
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,000
No.

127
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,300
(Eating at Dusk)

128
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,040
Table for two?

129
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,120
This way, please.

130
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,120
Our business is getting better recently.

131
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,270
Li Nai,

132
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,040
it's all thanks to you.

133
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,560
I really learned a lot from Jiang Jie.

134
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,950
What's wrong?

135
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,160
Why is he here?

136
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,550
Jiang Jie?

137
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,270
Sir, the queue starts over there.

138
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,250
Thank you.

139
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,910
This way, please.

140
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
- Please wait over here.
- Okay.

141
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,200
He wouldn't know

142
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,150
that we opened Eating at Dusk, would he?

143
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,910
Probably not.

144
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,840
Otherwise, he wouldn't be queuing outside.

145
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,854
Then, I'll close the store.

146
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,030
You're just gonna make it look obvious.

147
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,150
He's gonna be suspicious.

148
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,123
You're right.

149
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,790
I'll block the service window.

150
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,670
There's no way
he can't tell it's my cooking.

151
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,240
What do we do now?

152
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,250
Let's do this.

153
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,240
I'll get out through the backdoor
and delay him.

154
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
Then, you try to get another chef.

155
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,550
Me?

156
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,150
Chef.

157
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,480
What are you doing here?

158
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,150
I'm gonna try the food with you.

159
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,080
I said I don't need you to.

160
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,550
You said you recruited me
because of my skills,

161
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,270
so I must show off my skills.

162
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,510
I can't give up halfway.

163
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,240
There are

164
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,270
quite a lot of people today.

165
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,000
Li Nai,

166
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,790
you can go first if you can't wait.

167
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,120
No, no.

168
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,150
Welcome, this way please.

169
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,750
This is our menu.

170
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,720
You can have a look first.

171
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,550
(Help, I can't handle this. Hurry.)

172
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,390
Waitress, where is your toilet?

173
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,120
I have a stomachache. I need the toilet.

174
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,320
Why are you here?

175
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,630
Cui Can lured me here
to help out with a high salary.

176
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,150
You wanted me to get a chef, right?

177
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,630
My sister is having a banquet at home.

178
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,320
I couldn't get a single chef from her.

179
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,150
I can only get her.

180
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,000
But I can't do this.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,240
Jiang Jie knows my cooking.

182
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,120
Let's do this.

183
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,630
Our diner's dishes are simple.

184
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,670
Jingjing, you'll instruct.

185
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,630
Cui Can, you'll cook.

186
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,080
Him?

187
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,630
I cook?

188
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,030
You are the best person for this job.

189
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,720
Enjoy your meal.

190
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,480
Waitress.

191
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,390
Yes?

192
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,870
Is your Chef not in today?

193
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,030
Our Chef is cooking in the kitchen.

194
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,390
Okay. You can go now.

195
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,000
Is something wrong?

196
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,320
Try it yourself.

197
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,870
Add oil, add some oil.

198
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey, that's too much.

199
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,150
I'm not used to passion fruit.

200
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,200
Waitress.

201
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,270
How long do we have to wait
for the last dish?

202
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,790
I'll take a look for you.

203
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,790
There is something on your lips.

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,840
Mind your manners.

205
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,200
I'll go wash my hands.

207
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,670
You gotta hold on.

208
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,600
Li Nai, I'm not cut out for this.

209
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,910
You know that I only do odd jobs
at our master's restaurant.

210
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm not fit for cooking.

211
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,000
You are.

212
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
You are.

213
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,910
You are the senior to the only successor
of the Li family.

214
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,630
At this moment,

215
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,390
you are the God of Cooking.

216
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,910
They are the ones who were wrong.

217
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,750
Why won't they feel sorry for me?

218
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,740
(Checking in at Eating At Dusk, and bumped
into Chef Jiang. What kinda fate is this?)

219
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
It seem like the Head Chef
of Eating at Dusk

220
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,120
doesn't want me to know their true skill.

221
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,440
Right?

222
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,910
Zheng Fangxing said the person

223
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,790
behind Eating at Dusk is

224
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,030
probably someone familiar with me
or someone close to me.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,080
He even guessed

226
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,630
that it's you.

227
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,790
Really?

228
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,960
I didn't think so at first.

229
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,480
But now, it seems...

230
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,000
Seems what?

231
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,720
The person behind
Eating at Dusk is probably

232
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,150
Jiang Xuyang.

233
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,080
Jiang Xuyang?

234
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,240
Why did you shout?

235
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,600
I mean,

236
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,630
isn't Jiang Xuyang your relative?

237
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,360
Sometimes, the people who hurt you

238
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,030
are the ones closest to you.

239
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,670
I've looked into it.

240
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,720
Jiang Xuyang arranged
for the ingredients

241
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,790
to be sent to Eating at Dusk
from Xijiangyue.

242
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,030
So, you're here today to...

243
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,390
Just to take a look

244
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,840
if the Li family and Jiang Xuyang are

245
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,440
using each other

246
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,120
or merely being controlled.

247
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,080
It seems there is a reason

248
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,790
the Li family hasn't had a successor

249
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,630
for two generations
given their sneaky attitude.

250
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,750
Let's go. It's getting late.

251
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,390
You need to go home
to take care of Uncle Li.

252
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,240
Are they leaving?

253
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,550
Seems so.

254
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,120
Oh, no.

255
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,320
What's happening?

256
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,480
I have a bad feeling.

257
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,440
What a coincidence, Jie.

258
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,110
Sit.

259
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,920
Why are you here?

260
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,110
I'm here to learn.

261
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,350
The Li family has vanished for so long.

262
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,510
Who wouldn't wanna
try their long lost flavor?

263
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,590
There is nothing to learn from them.

264
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,220
Regardless of the food,
the quality control,

265
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,640
renovations, or the workers,

266
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,920
none of them can be rated five-star.

267
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,750
Is it that bad?

268
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
It is her.

269
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,590
What do we do?

270
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,160
What do we do?

271
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,400
You weren't this anxious

272
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,550
when the kitchen was on fire.

273
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,550
You don't get it. Jiang Xiu is super scary.

274
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,030
Scarier than Jiang Jie?

275
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,480
Jiang Jie is steadily scary

276
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,590
but Jiang Xiu is

277
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,070
mysteriously scary.

278
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,480
If she stays here any longer,

279
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,830
she will drag both of us
out of the kitchen.

280
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,310
What do we do?

281
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,160
Is she scared of anything?

282
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,480
No. We don't have mice

283
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,270
or cockroaches in the kitchen.

284
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,070
Isn't your standard too high?

285
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,590
Li Nai, what do you think?

286
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,350
It's really bad.

287
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,270
Don't you wanna know

288
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,270
who it is that wants
to challenge Jie

289
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,750
with such terrible cooking skills?

290
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,790
There is no need for that.

291
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,030
But I'm really curious.

292
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,310
They disappeared for so long

293
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,680
and suddenly popped out again.

294
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,240
We don't even know if it's a man or woman.

295
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,160
This person is quite interesting.

296
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,160
It's a woman.

297
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,790
I can tell from the taste.

298
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,960
As for everything else,

299
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,310
we will know on the day of the contest.

300
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,590
Jie,

301
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,680
you don't wanna be the bad guy,

302
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,200
but I don't mind being one.

303
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,160
I'll go and grab

304
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,680
this sneaky little chef for you two.

305
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,880
Jiang Xiu.

306
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,830
The power got cut.

307
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,480
Jiang Xiu, stop it.

308
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,160
I'm so sorry.

309
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
The circuit breaker
in the diner malfunctioned.

310
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,070
We got someone to fix it.

311
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,400
I'll go check it out right away.

312
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,110
Boring.

313
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,110
Jie,

314
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,070
I'm hanging out with my friend later.

315
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,030
Do you wanna come along?

316
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,270
No.

317
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,790
Don't go home too late.

318
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,590
Then, I'll go home too.

319
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,550
You come with me.

320
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,790
I have questions for you.

321
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,590
I'll be waiting

322
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,110
for the Li family's knife at Chuncheng.

323
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,110
You can come out now.

324
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,270
I told my brother
that I'm gonna hang out with my friend.

325
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,830
Did you hear that, friend?

326
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,160
I have something to do.

327
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,030
I'm not asking for your opinion.

328
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,480
I really have something to do.
I'm not kidding.

329
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,440
Is it more important than me?

330
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,160
They finally left.

331
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,440
So, you have something to do
with this old lady?

332
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,000
You can shut up if you have no manners.

333
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,440
Don't argue.

334
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,070
Jingjing,

335
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,590
I'm sorry. I'll handle this.

336
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,510
Jiang Xiu,

337
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,830
stop leading me on, okay?

338
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,920
We can be friends
if you wanna be just friends.

339
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,550
Everything can end here.

340
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,480
I can learn to restrain myself

341
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,830
but what exactly do you want?

342
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,680
Do we have to date?

343
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,790
Can't we hang out just like we used to?

344
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,960
I like you, Jiang Xiu.

345
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,480
I like you,
so I can't be just friends with you.

346
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,480
It's late.

347
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:56,720
You should go home.

348
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,720
So, if we're not friends,

349
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,590
will you stay with me all the time?

350
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,240
Li Nai.

351
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,750
What do you think is

352
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,030
the reason the Li family
wants to challenge us?

353
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,240
Must they have a reason to do so?

354
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,160
No one would do something so risky
without a good reason.

355
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,350
Moreover, it's the Li family
that has almost disappeared.

356
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,640
Maybe the seven families got together

357
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,550
to stop you from challenging anyone else.

358
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,550
What was that for?

359
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,820
Why did you lie for me
when I was explaining the timeline

360
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,920
during the mystery drama game?

361
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,110
That was just a game.

362
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,270
What about at the mountain?

363
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,030
You said you're on my side.

364
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,480
Was that also a game?

365
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,880
That was because someone gave me a note

366
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,590
that said to protect you.

367
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
We were never on the same side.

368
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,110
Don't you already know that?

369
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,030
I know.

370
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,750
It's just a game, right?

371
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,880
I knew it already.

372
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,240
I have something to do. I'm going now.

(Eating at Dusk)

383
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,680
Ms. Cui, have you considered

384
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,920
the proposal I mentioned before?

385
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,750
Mr. Jiang, you should know

386
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,270
that as the manufacturer
of chef knives in Baichuan,

387
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,200
every successor of the Cui family
will volunteer as a judge for the Alliance.

388
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,510
Yes. That's the reason
I'm asking you for this favor.

389
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,030
If my guess is correct,

390
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,830
you want me
to be a judge at the contest

391
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,480
between the Li family
and Chuncheng in two days.

392
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,270
Who do you want to win?

393
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,030
I sincerely wish to partner with you.

394
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,070
I hope

395
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,680
Jiang Jie's journey in seizing knives

396
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,350
ends here.

397
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:23,030
Is that your elder's desire or yours?

398
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,920
The Cui family started off

399
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,270
as a knife factory, right?

400
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,790
Over the years, it gradually
expanded into overseas trading.

401
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,000
But in the last few years,
the Cui family seems to have stagnated

402
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,030
under your management.

403
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,070
I even heard rumors about you

404
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,960
that you are not as good as

405
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,880
your father and grandfather.

406
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,110
But I disagree.

407
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,920
I believe

408
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,830
the reason you hesitate

409
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,550
is because you're waiting
for an opportunity.

410
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,240
And this opportunity

411
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,880
is also

412
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,160
what I've been looking for.

413
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,790
What are your plans?

414
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,830
Within one year, Jiang Jie rose up

415
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,350
from being a nobody to a Chef
who seized two five-star knives.

416
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,400
Apart from his own skills,

417
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,960
he had my help

418
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,110
behind him.

419
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,880
The seven families may have a long history

420
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
and a prominent position in Baichuan
but at the same time,

421
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,350
they're very old.

422
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,070
Their privileges froze their mindset

423
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,750
and prevented them
from taking another step forward.

424
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,000
Jiang Jie's existence

425
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,270
can shake the seven families.

426
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,000
Xijiangyue is
one of the seven families' restaurants.

427
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,730
Yes.

428
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,640
That's the reason
Jiang Jie won't get the Li family's knife

429
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,000
or have the qualification

430
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,750
to challenge Xijiangyue.

431
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,270
Ms. Cui,

432
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,720
as I mentioned before,

433
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,400
this market is too large

434
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,350
for the Jiang family alone
to make a profit from.

435
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,960
I wonder if you would be willing

436
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,640
to take this step forward with me.

437
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,790
- It's here?
- It's here.

438
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,270
Be gentle.

439
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,480
Okay.

440
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,750
I feel like splitting myself into two
won't be enough.

441
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,880
You worked hard.

442
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,480
You worked harder.

443
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,880
Fortunately, there are
only two families left.

444
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,960
After we get the Li family's knife,

445
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,590
we can take on the Jiang family.

446
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,960
Have you ever thought about

447
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,830
what you wanna do after you get

448
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
the Jiang family's knife?

449
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,720
I did

450
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,030
but now, I'm not sure.

451
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,270
You don't have to be like that
for the Li family, do you?

452
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,920
After you get
the Jiang family's knife,

453
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,000
you can explain everything to Li Nai.

454
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,510
Then, return the knife to Xue Congming.

455
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,070
That way,

456
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,830
you and Li Nai still have a chance.

457
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,790
And another thing.

458
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Xiu is dating someone.

459
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,480
Do you know that?

460
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,200
Looks like you don't.

461
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Why hasn't she come out yet?

462
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,440
Cui Can,

463
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,920
we're already dating now.

464
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,480
Do you wanna tell me

465
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,590
what dishes Li Nai is gonna make?

466
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,270
I don't know.

467
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,640
Between me and Li Nai,

468
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,030
you still choose her.

469
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,680
No way.

470
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,440
I choose you.

471
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,960
Then, tell me.

472
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,160
I won't tell my brother.

473
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,350
Think about this.
If I had wanted to tell him,

474
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,400
I would have exposed you back there.

475
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,000
I really don't know.

476
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,880
Not just that I don't know,

477
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,680
even Li Nai herself

478
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,440
doesn't know.

479
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,510
Then, tell me.

480
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,880
Why do you want to join the contest?

481
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,880
Li Nai's current skill is
far from adequate.

482
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Xiu.

483
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,680
Let's talk tomorrow. My head hurts.

484
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,750
What a dummy.

485
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,460
(Inpatient Department)

486
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,720
Have you been busy lately?

487
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,350
It's fine.

488
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,440
If you're busy,

489
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,720
go do your thing.

490
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,350
You don't have to visit me everyday.

491
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,680
A lot of people are
taking care of me here.

492
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,960
Come on.

493
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The senior has complained to me

494
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,590
that you wouldn't eat anything
the hospital made.

495
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,070
The food made by the hospital

496
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,000
is not as good as yours.

497
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,160
Don't sigh all the time.

498
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,880
You will chase away your good luck.

499
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,270
Master,

500
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,920
how does my cooking skill
compare to Jiang Jie's?

501
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,400
What else?

502
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,400
You will definitely fail
to seize his knife.

503
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,400
Master.

504
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,400
Are you still thinking about it?

505
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,920
It just an idea.

506
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,440
I'm telling you

507
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,750
not to think about it.

508
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,200
Why not?

509
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,070
Don't I have anything
that is comparable to Jiang Jie?

510
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,440
In comparison,

511
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,240
you have more talent

512
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,920
than him

513
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,750
but

514
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,830
the two of you have a problem.

515
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,960
This problem prevents you two
from making delicious food.

516
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,720
What problem is that?

517
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,860
(Inpatient Department)

518
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,160
Why hasn't she come down yet?

519
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,750
She can't be in a rush to seize the knife
because she is sick, can she?

520
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,270
Neither you nor he

521
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,480
truly loves cooking.

522
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,030
I can understand

523
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,880
the reason Jiang Jie is seizing knives.

524
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,110
The reason you stayed in this industry

525
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,400
is because of me.

526
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,270
Or maybe

527
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,030
you're ready to seize knives.

528
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Master,

529
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,510
why is your mind just like a mirror?

530
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,000
I can't hide anything from you.

531
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
Last time,

532
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,070
I didn't know what I liked.

533
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,070
My family left a legacy behind,

534
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,920
so I automatically took over.

535
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,590
The business went on and on,

536
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,400
until I could remember
all my customers' names.

537
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,270
It was at this time

538
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,160
that I realized I love cooking for others.

539
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,830
Why?

540
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
That's because

541
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,960
I can sense

542
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,750
my customers' emotions

543
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,160
whether they're here

544
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,270
to eat happily

545
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,030
or sadly.

546
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,830
And that was how

547
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,440
I was able to cook meals with emotions.

548
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,510
Cook meals with emotions?

549
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,640
Yes.

550
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,270
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

551
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,920
Cui Can is asking me for help.

552
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,790
Okay.

553
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,270
