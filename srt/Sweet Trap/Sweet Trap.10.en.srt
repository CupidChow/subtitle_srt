(Haifu Hospital)

21
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,520
I can see your eyeballs moving.

22
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,240
What?

23
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,310
Should I ring the call bell for you?

24
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,960
I just had a bad dream
where the Banana Princess

25
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,840
was battling with the three-legged monster.

26
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,120
Banana Princess?

27
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,950
Was your brain burnt with fever?

28
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,190
Are the hospitals so crowded
that men and women share the same room?

29
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,630
Pomelo.

30
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,723
Uncle Li.

31
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,920
Sorry.

32
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,950
Uncle Li.

33
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,630
I'll buy you a box of them if you want.

34
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Let's go.

35
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,920
Uncle Li.

36
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,310
Ma'am,

37
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,240
how about

38
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,680
I buying it from you?

39
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,120
Chef, I was just kidding.

40
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,909
Li Nai,

41
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,120
when we were in the cellar...

42
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,830
Li Nai...

43
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,070
Sorry.

44
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,190
I'm leaving.

45
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,630
Where are you going?

46
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,040
Why are you leaving?

47
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,950
Why?

48
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,560
- Watch you back!
- What?

49
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,950
Someone is behind your back!

50
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,480
Bad luck, go away!

51
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,270
Li Jidong,

52
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm being in hospital not in jail.

53
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,920
Told you.

54
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,360
Do you swear it wasn't you
who bought this pomelo?

55
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
Bad luck,

56
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,390
go away.

57
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,510
It's all your fault.

58
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,600
It was just an instinct.

59
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,830
If I lose my job, you'll be dead.

60
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,120
It's alright.

61
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,310
We have the five-star chef's knife.

62
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,630
Excuse me.

63
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,310
Did he hear it?

64
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,390
Whatever!

65
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,630
We're going home.

66
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,750
We're going home.

67
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,190
Qiang Xie!

68
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,160
Qiang Xie!

69
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,240
We're not on the same route,

70
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,040
and the Chef must have his own plan.

71
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,070
What?

72
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,360
How is the fish I gave Uncle Li before?

73
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,360
Fish?

74
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,830
It's pretty good.

75
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,800
Li Jidong loves it so much.

76
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,720
Fair enough.
I'm gonna check on it.

77
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,000
No worries.

78
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,830
Not today.

79
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,390
Your hand.

80
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,160
Bye, Chef.

81
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,270
Have some sleep back home.

82
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,870
He is weird today.

83
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,870
I think he should
have his head checked again.

84
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,360
But I think you should check your eyes.

85
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,630
What do you mean?

86
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,360
What he just did

87
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,950
was like a peacock fanning out its tail.

88
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,310
I was just wondering

89
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,800
what happened in the cellar.

90
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,160
You can't even get Jiang Xiu,
now are you even

91
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,560
trying to see though Jiang Jie?

92
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,630
Now that you were declined by Xijiangyue,

93
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,480
then you'd better think about what to do
when Eating at Dusk opens.

94
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,360
You're right.

95
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,680
- What if I invite some lion dancers?
- Sir, to Yile Compound.

96
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,030
What?

97
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,720
Congratulations on your discharge!

98
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,600
When did you get into this?

99
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,440
It's all for my poor little brother,

100
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,790
who had fever and got set up.

101
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,270
When organizing a team building activity,

102
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,790
he ended up being in hospital.

103
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,120
Maybe it's because he is an eyesore.

104
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,600
I gotta make it clear that

105
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,510
I have nothing to do with this.

106
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:05,600
I guess it was that
Jiang Xiu would be the Head Chef

107
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,080
that vexed Jiang Yuanfeng.

108
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,870
I believe it.

109
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,360
It's always direct and simple
to talk to you.

110
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,270
But it's always tiring to work with you.

111
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,670
Jiang Yuanfeng is time bomb for you.

112
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,960
For the sake of me,

113
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,670
can you cut Jiang Yuanfeng some slack?

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,790
How was Jiang Jie?

115
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,440
Fortunately he is fine.

116
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,600
Chuncheng's activity was kinda planned
on the spur of the moment.

117
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,510
How did Jiang Yuanfeng know that?

118
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,150
He came to me.

119
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,790
Jiang Jie got so popular recently.

120
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,550
I thought
maybe you wanna cut him down to size.

121
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,270
Who allowed you to do that?

122
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,120
You were right.

123
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm not happy about him.

124
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,720
But he got hurt in his hands for this,

125
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,030
how would I take advantage of him?

126
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,750
Sorry.

127
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,960
Now Cao's Fish and Firewood Rice

128
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,200
are the biggest threat to Jiang family.

129
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,390
I need Jiang Jie's hands to defeat them.

130
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,000
So don't do anything unnecessary.

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,870
I see.

132
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,270
Zhu Hao,

133
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,480
except me, don't listen to anyone,

134
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,670
even my father.

135
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,480
Because you're mine.

136
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,200
Keep an eye on Jiang Jie.

137
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,390
He needs you now.

138
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,200
Even he knows you are on my side,

139
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,120
there's nothing he can do.

140
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,600
Got it.

141
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,270
Let's go home.

142
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm done.

143
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:49,910
Jiang Xiu,

144
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,120
eat more.

145
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,240
The porridge is hot. Be careful.

146
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,240
Jiang Xiu,

147
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,910
I heard

148
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,670
you've always been late for work
and left early recently.

149
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
If you behave like this,

150
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,440
how can you manage the whole company?

151
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,480
The company doesn't need me.

152
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,840
Then make yourself a must for them.

153
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,750
Father,

154
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,910
Xiu is still young,
so it's normal to be fond of having fun.

155
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,200
I'm still there. It's fine.

156
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,910
Speaking of having fun,

157
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,960
I heard you are best at this.

158
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,790
Will you teach me

159
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,910
how to balance work and entertainment?

160
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,270
Stop making fun of me.

161
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,750
Lately I learnd from my friend that

162
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,120
they just had a team building activity
where they played an interesting game.

163
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,910
Would you like to give it a try?

164
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,960
Xiu,

165
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,870
just tell me what you wanna play,

166
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,630
and I can play with you when I'm free.

167
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,440
But now you are the Head Chef
of Xijiangyue,

168
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,030
and that's not a game.

169
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,360
Aren't you being in a relationship
right now?

170
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,870
If you go hanging aroud with me,

171
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,240
won't she get upset?

172
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:08,870
Xuyang,

173
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,630
you're dating someone?

174
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,790
Who is she?

175
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,600
She seems to share a surname
with Tang Bohu, or Zhu Zhishan.

176
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,270
Why don't you say Wen Zhengming?

177
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,360
Grandpa, it's a rumor.

178
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,270
Indeed.

179
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,670
I've always heard some rumors recently.

180
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,240
Then stop spreading the rumors.

181
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,480
And you, Xuyang,

182
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,440
you should behave yourself.

183
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,200
If you behave well,

184
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,870
nobody can find faults with you.

185
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,030
Right?

186
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,080
Yes.

187
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,120
Your are right, Grandpa.

188
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,630
Okay.

189
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm off to work.

190
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,630
I gotta work harder.

191
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,510
It's the 10th Wedding Anniversary
of the guest on table 3 today,

192
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,030
and the guest wants our assistance
to present a surprise.

193
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,270
Do as you are told.

194
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,270
Yes.

195
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,630
How is the nostoc in the warehouse?

196
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,550
Li Nai.

197
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Nostoc.

198
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,600
Here is the receipt of nostoc.

199
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,174
Noodles with Snakehead Meat,
Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs,

200
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:50,200
Quick-fried Pork Intestines in Vinegar,
and Crab-Flavor Fish.

201
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,790
I got my father's order by mistake!

202
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,270
Chuncheng's working time is
from 9:30 am to 2:30 pm,

203
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,600
and the average working time is 5 hours,

204
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,030
which is much less than other restaurants.

205
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,510
I just can't think of any reason that

206
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,270
can justify what you did just now.

207
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,390
Sorry, Chef. Just this once.

208
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,270
Handle it according to regulations.
Next I'm gonna seize knife,

209
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,200
but Chuncheng is not closing business
this time.

210
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,440
So from tomorrow,

211
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,360
I'll only handle one order.

212
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,670
Mr. Zheng,

213
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,440
you'll handle the four orders
with Li Nai.

214
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,080
Okay.

215
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,960
Go prepare the lunch!

216
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,150
Yes, Chef!

217
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,870
Hey, Li Jidong.

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,630
Okay. I'll be right there.

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,720
Let's go.

220
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:19,095
(Eating at Dusk)

221
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,360
Cui Can.

222
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,870
Why are you coming back?

223
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,750
Don't mention it.

224
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,720
Hardly had I just distributed a few pieces

225
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,200
when the entrance to a lane was blocked
by a group of old men.

226
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,390
Then I moved to the an open gorund nearby,

227
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,440
where a group of aunties
were having fun with square dance.

228
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,000
No wonder
I heard a burst of thumping sound.

229
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,080
What were the old men doing?

230
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,000
It's about the chess and card room.

231
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,480
But I've nailed it.

232
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,270
How naughy you are.

233
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,000
By the way,
your phone's been ringing just now.

234
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,360
Who is that?

235
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,600
No idea.

236
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,910
Here it comes again.

237
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,270
(Within one hour,)

238
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,310
(send the pilose antler to my home
in person.)

239
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,000
You're late.

240
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,240
Sorry. I've just clicked "delivery"
downstairs.

241
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,400
Please don't file a complaint.

242
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,240
This is the note from Miss. Li.

243
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,920
Thank you.

244
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,920
It's nothing.

245
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,260
(Uncle Lu's matsutake mushroom
is absolutely guaranteed.)

246
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,200
Chef,

247
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,830
the supper starts in a hour.

248
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,270
You can have some more rest.

249
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,590
Somebody ordered a chef set,

250
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,310
but it's okay.

251
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,920
Xijiangyue's chef set doesn't
have to be cooked by the Head Chef.

252
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,440
Then why is it called chef set?

253
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,510
Because it's recommended by
the Head Chef, your grandpa.

254
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm leaving.

255
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,400
Sous Chef Zhao,

256
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,310
good for you!

257
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,310
The Chef seems to be totally
under your control.

258
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,960
Just a spring chicken.

259
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,750
You just need to please her.

260
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,920
Jill!

261
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,880
Awesome!

262
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,550
Sir.

263
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,790
I want the biggest one.

264
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,030
That is for the grand prize.

265
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
You have to top up 200 Yuan

266
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,400
or hit all the ballons.

267
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,070
You didn't say that.

268
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,400
You didn't ask either.

269
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,750
Let me.

270
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,310
I'm really good at this.

271
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,400
Give me this.

272
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,640
Won't you stop following me?

273
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,790
Xiu,

274
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,440
are you not happy?

275
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,400
No.

276
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,160
Are you really into sheep dolls?

277
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,830
No.

278
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,240
Then what else you wanna play?
I'm with you.

279
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,270
Do you wanna turn into this doll?

280
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,270
No.

281
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,440
Then stop following me.

282
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,440
You mean you would do anything with me?

283
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,350

I'm making you breakfast.

309
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,160
Have a taste.

310
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
You look joyful.

311
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,640
Because I spent a whole night

312
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,200
having fun with an idiot.

313
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,236
You're not allowed to stay out all night.

00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,480
Got it.

315
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,310
What?

316
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,310
Jie,

317
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
are you preparing for another challenge?

318
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,510
I saw many ingredients in your kitchen.

319
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,160
Firewood Rice or Cao's Fish?

320
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,440
If you only challenge either of them,
let me challenge the other for practice.

321
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,110
Xiu.

322
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Do you like cuisine?

323
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,830
Sure.

324
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,400
My next target is Ge family.

325
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,510
Ge Qunshan?

326
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,400
Hasn't he got out of the game?

327
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,400
Among the seven families,

328
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,200
I chose Xue, Ge and Zhao.

329
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,261
I think you should understand it.

330
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,550
They owe us.

331
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,270
Jiang Xiu,

332
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,590
I'm not challenging for fun,

333
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,640
but for the qualification
to challenge Jiang family.

334
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,880
If you are really into cuisine,

335
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,720
when everything is settled,

336
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,550
Chuncheng will be yours.

337
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,270
So

338
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,160
can you give up the Head Chef position
in Xijiangyue?

339
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,640
Just because your final target
is Jiang family,

340
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,750
I won't leave the position.

341
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,680
Your biggest opponent can only be me.

342
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,550
Take your time.

343
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,270
I gotta go to Xijiangyue

344
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,440
to train the old foxes.

345
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,350
Bye, Jie.

346
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,480
Only if I am the Head Chef of Xijiangyue

347
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,880
can nobody bypass me to hurt my brother.

348
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,900
(Xijiangyue,
Certified by Chefs' Alliance in Baichuan)

349
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,400
I was busy in the kitchen.
You can't even handle a customer.

350
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,750
What?

351
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,310
The customer ordered a chef set,

352
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,070
but it has to be cooked by the Head Chef?

353
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,510
What does that mean?

354
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,880
To find faults?

355
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,030
You might as well come over.

356
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm going to see who dares
to make trouble in Xijiangyue.

357
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,640
Alas!

358
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,480
Chef?

359
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,310
Why are you sitting here?

360
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,790
Is the Head Chef forbidden
to have dinner here?

361
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,830
Not at all. You can do whatever you want.

362
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,920
But the chef set...

363
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,960
I know.

364
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,960
My grandpa made the rule

365
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,830
that the chef set must be the dishes
recommended by the Head Chef.

366
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,030
But

367
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,160
now the Head Chef of Xijiangyue

368
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,350
is me.

369
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,510
But

370
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,510
it has been always the rule of Xijiangyue.

371
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,920
If you wanna change it,

372
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I think it's better to ask your grandpa.

373
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,000
No necessary.

374
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,920
If you have disagreements,
come to challenge me.

375
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,750
If anyone can defeat me in cuisine,

376
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,880
I'll continue to be the nominal Head Chef,

377
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,621
and you guys decide everything
in kitchen.

378
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,030
If no one can defeat me,

379
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,200
I'll take full charge of the the kitchen.

380
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:11,596
Li Nai.

381
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,070
Chef,

382
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,070
what's up?

383
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,400
Let's talk.

384
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,640
I-I'm quite busy right now. Maybe...

385
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,830
You're always busy.

386
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,270
Let's talk right now.

387
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,830
About what?

388
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,200
Lately, I...

389
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,480
When we were in the cellar.

390
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,030
Don't answer it if it's Cui Can.

391
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,590
It's my dad.

392
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,680
Hey, Li Jidong.

393
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,510
Nai, Nai...

394
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,960
What's happening?

395
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,880
It seems like an attack of disease.

396
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,160
I'll take you there.

397
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,310
You've got an order to prepare.

398
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,070
Li Nai!

399
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,790
How is it going?

400
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,400
Okay. I gotta go.

401
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,790
Here you are.

402
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,440
Thank you.

403
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,160
Li Nai, could you get off work a little
earlier to help me distribute flyers?

404
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,350
I...

405
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,070
Certainly I have something important.

406
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,830
I gotta go. Bye.

407
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,640
What?

408
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,960
Chef.

409
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,720
Chef.

410
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,480
What?

411
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,590
Somebody's outside for you.

412
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm not available.

413
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
I said a million times

414
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,240
that our Chef is busy now.

415
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,790
It's okay.

416
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,960
Let her do her job.

417
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,920
I'll wait for her.

418
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,720
Supper is over.

419
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,070
Supper is over.

420
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,310
Yes, Chef.

421
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,350
Collect them all.

422
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,880
Did you wipe the tables clean?

423
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,790
- Collect that.
- Okay.

424
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,590
Put that into the fridge.

425
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,310
Xiu.

426
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,030
Why are you still here?

427
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,350
Where is Xiu?

428
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,720
She has probably gone.

429
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,400
But her motor is still here.

430
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,640
I just need ten minutes.

431
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,750
Xiu, are you alright?

432
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,350
What's wrong?

433
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,000
I hope you won't mind this.

434
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,160
I'm taking you home.

435
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,030
Ge Qunshan.

436
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,920
This man is weird.

437
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,350
When he left,

438
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,750
he said nothing.

439
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,070
Now if he knows you're gonna challenge him,

440
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,200
will he escape from Yu Village?

441
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,920
What?

442
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,110
Ask yourself.

443
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,400
I was talking to you.

444
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:51,000
You were talking about Ge Qunshan.
Then what?

445
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:52,334
What happened between you and Li Nai?

446
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,830
Since we came back from the activity,
it's been kinda weird between you two.

447
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,750
So what happened exactly?

448
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,030
Nothing. I'll take care of that.

449
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,880
I don't care if there's something
between you guys,

450
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,240
but don't you ever forget

451
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,830
what is the most important thing for us
right now.

452
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,790
I didn't forget that.

453
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,550
I can handle it.

454
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,920
Moreover,

455
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,350
there's nothing between us.

456
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,270
Just put it at the door.

457
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,550
What are you doing here?

458
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,790
I said I would come to check on the fish,
didn't I?

459
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,510
But it's past 11:00 pm now.

460
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,240
Li Jidong has fallen asleep.

461
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,000
But you're always busy.

462
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,070
But...

463
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,030
I was kinda worried about its living space.

464
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,030
So I brought a fish tank.

465
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,030
Come in, Chef.

466
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,640
The living space is really kinda narrow.

467
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,750
Living such a narrow space,
it's still alive.

468
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,550
You're really lucky.

469
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,750
The space is narrow indeed.

470
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,240
So why don't you take it back?

471
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,550
Come and help.

472
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,440
Three, two, one, down.

473
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,750
It's so heavy. How did you carry it here?

474
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,440
I had it delivered to the door.

475
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,480
Then why don't you let them install it?

476
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,720
Hush. Uncle Li is sleeping.

477
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,750
Come on. Help me move it to left a little.

478
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,350
Left.

479
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,596
Left.

480
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,400
Never mind. I'll handle it.

481
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,000
Get me the landscape stone.

482
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,750
Left.

483
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,680
Left.

484
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,350
What is this light for?

485
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,880
Making the fish look prettier.

486
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,880
I don't think there's anything
that can make it any prettier.

487
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,350
Because it's born pretty.

488
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,160
Okay.

489
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,200
Let me help you.

490
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,320
Li Nai.

491
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,960
Back then in the cellar,

492
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,070
