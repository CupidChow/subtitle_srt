=Episode 2=

20
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,680
Chef,

21
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,150
three tables have been reserved
for the lunch hours.

22
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,480
Table one was booked by two women

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,640
who are about 30 years old.

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,480
Their dining here
is old friends' routine gathering.

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
The guests booking the table three
are all locals.

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,950
They prefer a light diet.

27
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,200
One of the guests is allergic to gluten.

28
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,040
Besides, the menu
has been double-checked.

29
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,070
The guests of table one
wants another dish added to the menu.

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,280
- What dish?
- The Lotus Bloom Crossing.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,120
What month is it now?

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,960
November.

33
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,020
Our Chuncheng Restaurant
only uses seasonal ingredients.

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,470
You still keep it on the menu.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,680
Do you want to be fired?

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,190
Sorry, Chef.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
We should recruit new employees.

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,000
I will send you the vacancy list later.

39
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,150
Got it, Chef.

40
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,520
Prepare for the lunch hours.

41
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,360
Chef.

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,150
What is it?

43
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,630
The Xue's Noodles

44
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,840
reopened today.

45
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,590
Huh?

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,310
Our restaurant is opening!

47
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,910
Everybody, our restaurant is opening.

48
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,800
Hurry up, come to have a look.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,190
Xue's Noodles.

50
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,590
Hasn't your restaurant shut down?

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,430
Our old Xue's Noodles
was shut down,

52
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,840
but this is our new shop.

53
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,560
Moreover, today's first guest

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
can get a free meal.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,080
New shop?

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
It still uses the old name.

57
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,430
Fella,

58
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,560
look carefully.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,960
Noodle Shop of Xue's Apprentice.

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,000
Right.

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840
Come on, get in to try our noodles.

62
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,000
The taste of our noodles
won't let you down.

63
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,960
I will do it next time.

64
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,080
Some time later.

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,480
Don't mind.
People will come sooner or later.

66
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,780
(Time-honored brand;
Noodle Shop of Xue's Apprentice)

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,480
Can the first guest get a free meal?

68
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,680
Can the first guest get a free meal?

69
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,000
Before opening this shop, our master
didn't check the geomantic omen, right?

70
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,610
Don't believe in superstition.

71
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,160
Besides, speaking of geomancy,
the originator of cooking is to blame.

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,190
Li Nai.

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,510
Sorry.

74
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,920
Li Nai,

75
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,240
actually, we need not be afraid of him.

76
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,390
Even if he wants to seize our knife,
he won't do it now.

77
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,920
Now he is a five-star chef.

78
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,680
He need not take our new shop from us.

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,830
Your words make sense.

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Why need we be afraid of him?

81
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,630
Since he came as a guest,
we will serve him.

82
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,830
We will use our opening auspiciousness

83
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,360
to offset the bad luck he brought.

84
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,920
Right.

85
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,160
Let's do it.

86
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,800
Are my noodles ready?

87
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,600
Wait.

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,160
How could you get in?

89
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,260
The sign on the door says,
"You are welcome to supervise us."

90
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,040
Isn't that so?

91
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,800
Our master posted it.

92
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,920
I forgot to remove it.

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,120
Sorry.

94
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,920
You can watch as long as you like.

95
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,920
Li Nai.

96
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,270
Li Nai,
I will go wait upon the guests.

97
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,120
Enjoy it.

98
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,870
Xue Congming said I should
taste the noodles you cook.

99
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,430
That's why I came.

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't you want to hear
the guest's comments?

101
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,360
You are indeed kind of talented,

102
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,320
but a noodle restaurant
is not suitable for you

103
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,240
and you are not suitable for
opening a new shop.

104
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,510
Whether I am suitable or not,
it's my own business.

105
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Why are you meddling in my business?
Do you have any friends?

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Even if you own Xue Congming's shop now

107
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,830
and need not spend money
on site selection,

108
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,750
decoration design, style positioning and
other preliminary preparations,

109
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,310
you have to deal with
the upcoming promotion,

110
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,390
review and rise in rank,

111
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,830
dish innovation,

112
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,680
the relation
between cost control and profits

113
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
and all other things by yourself.

114
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,000
There is always a solution for
the problem.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,190
The advertising and promo,

116
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,270
the supervision and rise in rank,

117
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,430
the dish innovation

118
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,480
and

119
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,270
cost and profit control.

120
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,830
It is the relation
between cost control and profits.

121
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,680
You are Li Nai, right?

122
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,480
What do you want?

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
It is not easy to open a restaurant
in Baichuan.

124
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,270
If you are determined to engage in
this line of business, you can go...

125
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,790
No matter how many difficulties
come our way,

126
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,310
I will face all together with her.

127
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,560
Must you run this shop?

128
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,310
Yes.

129
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,680
All right.

130
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,720
I get it.

131
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,600
Li Nai,

132
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,600
there is really no point in
being angry with him.

133
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,360
Maybe our master was right.

134
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,150
I am not capable enough to make our shop
a five-star restaurant

135
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,120
and to get back his knife.

136
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,000
All right.

137
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,440
I will go close the shop.

138
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,080
Don't do that.

139
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,510
I just know you won't give up halfway.

140
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,150
Li Nai,

141
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
we still have our master's shop.

142
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,440
We should have the courage
to prosper where we fall.

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,550
What's more,

144
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,670
your pawn is here.

145
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,480
Li Nai,

146
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,750
just do what you want to do bravely.

147
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,240
Dear Cui Can,

148
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,960
you are reliable.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,360
However, now we must think about
how to attract guests.

150
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,510
Hello. I'd like a bowl of
Noodles with Snakehead Meat.

151
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,270
Me too.

152
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,120
Take a seat, please.

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,130
Excuse me, I'd like a bowl of noodles.

154
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,790
Take a seat, please.

155
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,080
Read the menu, please.

156
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,790
Cui Can,
the snake-head fish ran out.

157
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,550
There happens to be no guests now.

158
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,480
Today, shall we put up the shutters early?

159
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,030
OK.

160
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,910
You go close the door.
Then let's clean up the shop.

161
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
OK.

162
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,320
Why are people eating less nowadays?

163
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,600
Li Nai,

164
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,940
the people of the alliance are here.

165
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,720
Shut up the shop?

166
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,960
Why should we shut up the shop?

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,360
You want our shop closed
after sending people here

168
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,670
to carry out a random inspection.

169
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,440
Here is the thing.

170
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,870
According to the rules of the alliance,

171
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,000
all individual businesses
operating in Baichuan

172
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,360
must pass the alliance review
within a week after opening.

173
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,150
Only when a shop meets the standards,

174
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,550
will we report its information to

175
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,630
the local market regulator.

176
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
Did you make a mistake?

177
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,360
How could it be possible
that we failed the review?

178
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,910
Our business is good
and we have lots of customers.

179
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,300
In terms of the volume of customers,

180
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,150
your shop does meet the standards
for one-star restaurants.

181
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,750
However, the alliance found
through the review

182
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,390
that most of the customers
were bought here

183
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,550
by a post on the alliance's forum.

184
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,740
The account's comments on the shop
deviates seriously from the facts.

185
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,200
Thus, our alliance has reason to suspect
you've paid the Internet ghostwriter.

186
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
You are suspected of false propaganda.

187
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,750
How could you say that?

188
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,120
You can't say this without proof.

189
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,320
We didn't do those things.

190
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,720
If you suspect us,

191
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,000
you can make investigations,

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,150
but you can't wrongfully accuse us

193
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,480
and ask us to close down our shop.

194
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,580
See for yourself.

195
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,500
(Xue's apprentice's shop disappointed me.)

196
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,520
(I know why Chef Xue lost to Jiang Jie.)

197
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,900
(Good reviews
might come from paid posters.)

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,910
Based on the negative comments rising
together with the volume of customers,

199
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,150
our alliance decided that your shop
didn't meet the review criteria.

200
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,670
Closing down the shop is a notice,
not a negotiation.

201
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,670
Is this the end?

202
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,960
The obnoxious Jiang Jie
is to blame for this.

203
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,790
Your fall has nothing to do with me.

204
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,630
Why are you here?

205
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,510
Whose knife do you want to seize?

206
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,030
Aren't you aware of where we are?

207
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,360
Can I seize your knife here?

208
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,390
Which building do you live in?

209
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,910
Building 13.

210
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,670
I live in the same building as you.
No wonder I am out of luck.

211
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,630
Nonsense.

212
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,910
(Did he buy the fish?)

213
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,150
(Is he planning to cook
the Noodles with Snakehead Meat?)

214
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,440
Jiang Jie.

215
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,030
What?

216
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,080
Can I go to your home to have a meal?

217
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,270
Didn't you say I was a jinx?

218
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,970
I am already out of luck.

219
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,030
Follow me.

220
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,960
His looks changed a lot as he grew.

221
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,270
Jiang Jie.

222
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,600
Jiang Jie.

223
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,150
Li Nai.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,510
Holy cow!

225
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,120
You scared me.

226
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,630
Your cell phone rang.

227
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,480
The meal is ready.

228
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,000
In such a short time?

229
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,150
A bowl of Noodles with Snakehead Meat
won't take long.

230
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,630
You cooked the Noodles
with Snakehead Meat?

231
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,840
Don't pretend you don't know.

232
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,550
Come out.

233
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,940
(Zhu Hao: Chef,
the recruitment information has...)

234
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,080
My shop closed down because it received
too many negative reviews.

235
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,870
I used to think I am a good cook,

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but I am dwarfed by you.

237
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,120
It's very delicious.

238
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,740
You need not compare yourself with me.

239
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,240
I admitted
the noodles you cooked is tasty,

240
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,360
but it doesn't mean
you are better than my master.

241
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,240
It's far from the end.

242
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,270
Sooner or later,

243
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,120
I will take back my master's knife
from you.

244
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,390
OK. I will wait for that.

245
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
I will go home.

246
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,000
Thank you for the noodles.

247
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,720
Master,

248
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,390
why the noodles cooked by Jiang Jie
is so delicious?

249
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,910
Li Nai, what happened to you?

250
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,960
Hello, say something.

251
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,000
You'd rather open the door with
your cell phone than come out to meet me.

252
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,200
Slippers in the shoe cabinet,
second shelf on the left.

253
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,550
Jiang Jie,

254
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,030
you are not taking me seriously.

255
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,390
I am your elder brother after all.

256
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,480
Didn't you visit the alliance forum?

257
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,440
The Head Chef of Chuncheng

258
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,880
was adopted in an orphan home

259
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,000
and went abroad later.

260
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,030
Don't drink it.

261
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,400
You even don't allow me to drink water?

262
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,350
You are so mean to me.

263
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,400
Someone else has drunk it.

264
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,720
A girl?

265
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,480
You are a grown man.

266
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,030
Don't you have things to say?

267
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,830
It's your next rival.

268
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,700
Zhaoyeqing Restaurant
has changed its Head Chef.

269
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,830
The Head Chef of Zhaoyeqing Zhong Haiyang

270
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,440
had a contest with
his daughter Zhao Jingjing privately.

271
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,200
Zhong Haiyang lost.

272
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,590
Zhao Jingjing has coveted his position
for many years

273
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,400
and he has been avoiding
the contest with her.

274
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,480
He had the contest at such a time.

275
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,680
Am I really so intimidating to him?

276
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,200
What is your plan now?

277
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,490
I will wait and see.

278
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:04,960
Well,

279
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,680
previously, in a hurry,
you seized the knife from Xue Congming.

280
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,480
However, you are not in a hurry now.

281
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,680
Are you going to

282
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,790
devote yourself to
the operation of Chuncheng?

283
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,510
I am busy recruiting
new staff these days.

284
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,960
Li Jidong, what are you doing?

285
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:58,260
(RMB 500 was deducted from your credit card
with the balance being RMB 1,451 now)

286
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,790
Your package is delivered.

287
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,980
(Well-paid job offer)

288
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,160
Before 12:00, cook a bowl of
Noodles with Snakehead Meat,

289
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,200
or I will kill the hostage.

290
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,510
Kill it as you like.

291
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,590
Cui Can, stop scaring me.
Get down quickly.

292
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,640
What did they do to you?

293
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,030
I came late.

294
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,590
I brought you delicious food.
Get down quickly.

295
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,070
Stop scaring me.

296
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,640
What is wrong with you?

297
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,550
Wait a moment!

298
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,440
You are not Cui Can.

299
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,440
So sorry.

300
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,880
Cui Can!

301
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,440
Cui Can!

302
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,110
Stop playacting. I am tired.

303
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,480
You work in such a crappy place?

304
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,160
What is it?

305
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,310
A note.

306
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,720
You are telling me.

307
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,030
Have a look at it.

308
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,920
It's a list of the four-star restaurants
across Baichuan City.

309
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,350
What?

310
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,110
You not only found a new job yourself,

311
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,440
but also tried to find me a job.

312
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,440
Li Nai,

313
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,510
I didn't find a new job for work's sake.

314
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,240
I am experiencing life

315
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,550
to find my worth.

316
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,550
Moreover,

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,720
I am helping you find a new way out.

318
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,480
Check it out.

319
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,270
What do you mean?

320
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,680
- Did you give up the knife-seizure contest?
- Of course not.

321
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,510
That will do it.

322
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,920
I found we adopted the wrong strategy.

323
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,960
If we open a new shop,

324
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,350
even if we pass the one-star review,

325
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,400
we still have to get five stars
before competing with Jiang Jie.

326
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,900
Besides, I have read the posts
on the alliance forum

327
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,790
and found we have a chance to win.

328
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,590
Nevertheless,

329
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,240
we need some time.

330
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,270
How much time do we need?

331
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,590
Fifteen days?

332
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,240
It's 150 years.

333
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,640
Cui Can!

334
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,830
But we can take a short cut.

335
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,200
Do you mean that

336
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,750
we can apply for jobs
in a four-star restaurant

337
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,790
so that I can become a Head Chef

338
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,720
and wait for it to become
a five-star restaurant

339
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,960
before I challenge Jiang Jie?

340
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,440
No.

341
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,920
I mean we will buy a restaurant and
become Head Chefs ourselves.

342
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Won't that be faster?

343
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,640
Do you have money to burn?

344
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,640
I do have more money than I need.

345
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Therefore, I am sure this card
will give us enough money

346
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,440
to buy any four-star restaurant.

347
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,640
This is not going to work.

348
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,160
Didn't you say that

349
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,590
even the impressive four-star chef
Liu Ping

350
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,880
failed to get five stars
after over ten years of efforts,

351
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,200
and lost to Jiang Jie?

352
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,100
The other four-star restaurants
are inferior to Liu Ping's.

353
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,980
(Zhu Hao: Chef,
the recruitment information has...)

354
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,680
There is a better way

355
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,830
than finding jobs
in a four-star restaurant.

356
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,720
How do you do?

357
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,200
How do you do?

358
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,830
I am Song Duo.

359
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,350
How about you?

360
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,510
I am Li Nai.

361
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,200
What school did you graduate from?

362
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
Jinghai University
of Finance and Economics.

363
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,270
You didn't take catering courses?

364
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,000
I entered this profession
after graduation.

365
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,480
I started my own business.

366
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,680
Started a business?
What is your business model?

367
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,590
It mainly integrates space elements
with zero-distance experience,

368
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,070
and advocates the minimalist style

369
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,790
including but not limited to pop-up
and customized forms.

370
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,160
That is impressive.

371
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,000
It is actually the food stall.

372
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,110
Everybody,

373
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,510
applicants for different posts
will be interviewed in different zones.

374
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
Please proceed following the signs.

375
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,310
Zhu Hao, what post did she apply for?

376
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,270
Chef,

377
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,480
she applied for all the posts we offer
except the post of a warehouse keeper.

378
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
(Waiter and waitress; Failed)

379
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,220
(Kitchen waiter; Failed)

380
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,480
(Dishwashing area)

381
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,700
(Dishwasher; Failed)

382
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,140
(Pastry Chef; Failed)

383
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,110
Do you want to get hired or not?

384
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,160
We met again.

385
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,310
Is this the last interview?

386
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,070
Yes.

387
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,270
How do you feel?

388
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,790
I think it is very possible
that I'll be hired.

389
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,640
But I want to be a Sous Chef the most.
It's a pity that they are not recruiting one.

390
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,160
It's said that Chuncheng's Sous Chef
is Chef Jiang's buddy

391
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,350
who enjoys a solid position
and is irreplaceable.

392
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,640
I wish that
I could get the job of a kitchen hand.

393
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,440
Then I can stay
in the same kitchen with Chef Jiang.

394
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,830
Why do you admire him so much?

395
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,880
He put 23 restaurants out of business.

396
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
Though it is kind of cruel,

397
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,510
but the rule of the jungle prevails.

398
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,340
The knife-seizure contest is only about
cooking skills. It's actually the fairest match.

399
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,270
The kitchen hand can come now.

400
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,960
It's our turn.

401
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,960
Let's go together.

402
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,750
The last test is about carving skills
and the ingredient is not specified.

403
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,550
Your 10 minutes

404
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,350
start now.

405
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,750
Blue Bird Delivering Messages.

406
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,070
My work has to be unveiled by you,
Ms. Zhu.

407
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,120
Have all the interviews come to an end?

408
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,160
The last carving work
is still to be unveiled.

409
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,400
Since you are here, Chef,

410
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,270
how about you checking it?

411
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,030
The trick of an opportunist.

412
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,510
If I can win your favor, Chef Jiang,

413
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,830
my efforts won't be wasted.

414
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,480
Since the interview is over,
go back to wait for our notification.

415
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,110
Thank you, Chef Jiang.

416
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,440
I will wait for your decision patiently.

417
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,790
Choose Song Duo.

418
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:31,750
What?

419
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,380
You applied for
the job of Jiang Jie's restaurant?

420
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,240
Are you out of your mind?

421
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,960
Why?

422
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,200
Give me five.

423
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,350
There are five reasons.

424
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,400
First, God knows
how many knives Jiang Jie will seize.

425
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,200
In case I painstakingly get hired
by a four-star restaurant,

426
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,960
but it is put out of business
by Jiang Jie,

427
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,550
I'd better go work in his restaurant
at the start.

428
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
That's right.

429
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,640
The most dangerous place is the safest.

430
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,680
Second,

431
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,480
as you can see,
I have to pay Li Jidong's expenses

432
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,830
and my house rent.

433
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,440
If I don't hurry to find
a well-paid job in my field of study,

434
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,590
I will sleep on the street soon.

435
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:22,880
I have money.

436
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,160
Third,

437
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,240
Jiang Jie's cooking skills
are really stunning.

438
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,480
Being around him, I will be able to

439
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,350
improve myself.

440
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,720
Fourth,

441
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,640
you can only win the battle
by knowing your enemy.

442
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,200
Being around him,
I can learn of many of his weaknesses.

443
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,750
Fifth,

444
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,350
most importantly,

445
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,830
Chuncheng only opens
during the lunch hours.

446
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
Such opening hours

447
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,790
can be said to be the best for me.

448
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,680
It's not like that.

449
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,440
He can think of everything
you thought of.

450
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,400
Why will he still hire you?

451
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,440
Hello.

452
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,790
Chuncheng.

453
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,590
Yes, I am Li Nai.

454
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,830
Oh, thank you.

455
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,750
How did it go?

456
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,100
(Zhaoyeqing Restaurant
Certified by Baichuan Chefs' Alliance)

457
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Lu Ke,

458
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,240
how is the business of the noodle shop
of Xue Congming's disciple?

459
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,750
It closed down because it failed
the one-star review.

460
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,190
(Zhao Jingjing; Five-star chef)
It didn't pass the one-star review?

461
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,880
How can Xue Congming's disciple
be so weak?

462
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,830
Chef, shall we stick with
our original plan?

463
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,480
Of course.

464
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,400
I planned to take advantage of
her identity as Xue Congming's disciple.

465
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,290
But I didn't expect her to end up
so useless.

466
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,720
Then let's take the opportunity
to approach her.

467
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,640
Let's wait a little longer.

468
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,920
Now except us, there should be
no restaurants willing to accept her.

469
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,440
Since we decided to help her
when she needs it.

470
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,200
Let's wait
till she has the most difficult time.

471
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
The receptionist is Xia Ji.

472
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,270
The kitchen hand is Song Duo.
The warehouse keeper is Li Nai.

473
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,030
They di-didn't hire you?

474
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,400
Yes, they did.

475
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,440
Then why are you unhappy?

476
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,030
I was hired as a warehouse keeper.

477
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
It is the only job I didn't apply for.

478
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,920
Warehouse keeper?

479
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,210
Prepare for the lunch hours.

480
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,510
Jiang Jie.

481
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,960
Jiang Jie.

482
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,350
Since you don't want to hire me,
why was I hired as the warehouse keeper?

483
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,240
Zhu Hao, go do your work.

484
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,960
Then why did you
take the interview of our Chuncheng?

485
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,550
Then could you tell me, Chef Jiang,

486
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,030
what need I do
to be allowed to prepare the meal?

487
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,720
It depends on my mood.

488
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,640
Got it, Chef Jiang!

489
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,480
Previously, you told me
your entrepreneurial model,

490
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,030
integrated space management and other things.
I really want you to tell me more.

491
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,680
It is just a food stall.

492
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,550
So it is a food stall?

493
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,620
(Chuncheng Warehouse Registration Form)

494
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,480
Lei Shiyu.

495
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,790
Chef.

496
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,960
Are you in a concert hall?

497
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,720
No.

498
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,550
Then don't make unnecessary sounds.

499
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,960
Sorry, Chef.

500
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,310
A tyrant.

501
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,030
Chef,

502
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,830
the guests of table three arrived earlier.

503
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,270
What is their first course?

504
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,440
Braised Fish with Lotus Trimmings.

505
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,110
Serve the dessert to them as a starter.

506
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,830
Chef, here is the fish you need.

507
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,350
Shall I kill it for you?

508
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,310
Zhu Hao,

509
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,270
haven't you told her about
her job responsibilities?

510
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,300
Shouldn't a warehouse keeper
take charge of all the ingredients?

511
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,830
A warehouse keeper is responsible for
classifying and sorting out all items,

512
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,160
and keeping records of the purchase dates,

513
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,400
expiration dates, qualities, quantities
and so on of each item

514
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,680
as well as the physical shapes and
properties of the raw materials, etc.

515
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,640
There are other people responsible for
fetching the needed items.

516
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,000
You are only responsible for supervision
and can't overstep your authority.

517
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,000
Do you get it?

518
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,110
The kitchen hand,

519
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,240
must I order you to do things?

520
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
Sorry, Chef.

521
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,720
Let me do it.

522
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,000
I hope
you will do your work at hand well

523
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,720
and stay out of other people's affairs.

524
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,550
Did I make myself clear?

525
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,510
Yes, Chef!

526
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,720
Go on.

527
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,920
This is such a feast!

528
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,030
Ms. Zhu,

529
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,640
can we eat the staff meal cooked
by the Chef today and every other day?

530
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,480
Sous Chef Zheng is usually the one
cooking the staff meal.

531
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,680
Our Chef seldom cooks the staff meal.

532
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,400
You are lucky that you are here
while Sous Chef Zheng is on leave.

533
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Won't our Chef eat with us?

534
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,440
He never eats in our dining hall.

535
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,990
Don't blame me for not reminding you.
Slow hands will get you nothing to eat.

536
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,310
A moment, please.

537
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,270
Li Nai is still in the warehouse.

538
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,400
I will go ask her to come.

540
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,960
Be seated.

541
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,400

542
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,510
From tomorrow onward,

00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,320
all staff working in the kitchen
will take turns to cook the staff meal.

544
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,550
I will eat it, too.

545
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,920
Do you understand?

546
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,320
Yes, Chef!

547
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,070
Our Chef is allowing us to cook
the staff meal.

548
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,920
Am I in a dream?

549
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,960
Does this mean that we can help prepare
the main meal in the days to come?

550
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,760
Maybe.

551
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,150
You are lucky.

552
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,630
You'll be screwed if you vomit.
