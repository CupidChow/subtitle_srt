20
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,280
Chef Jiang,

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,230
why did you

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,870
look for me?

23
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,400
Are you dating Xiu?

24
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,840
Yes.

25
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,276
How long have you two known each other?

26
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,560
About more than twenty days.

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,030
But I'm serious about Xiu.

28
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,800
I... I really like her.

29
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,190
She might not like you.

30
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,190
I know.

31
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,150
I understand why

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
Xiu dates me.

33
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,120
She feels lonely

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,310
and wants company.

35
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,080
Then, I appeared.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,240
Chef Jiang,

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,590
I should thank you when it comes to this.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,560
If Xiu had to choose
the most important person to her,

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,630
that person would undoubtedly

40
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,310
be you.

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
I owed her too much.

42
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,430
Do you have something to tell me?

43
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,190
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,710
You kids

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
should apologize to me

46
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,240
for always looking miserable.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,310
Did you follow Li Nai here?

48
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,150
I guessed it.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,800
You usually care
about your brother the most.

50
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,680
Now, Li Nai wants
to seize your brother's knife.

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,000
You must be...

52
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,710
But I didn't know you are sick.

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,430
I can tell my brother
to return your knife.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,910
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,120
Jiang Xiu,

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,910
you are not a kid anymore.

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,120
Similarly,

58
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,910
your brother is no longer a kid, too.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
But

60
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,240
my brother seized your knife
because of me.

61
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,840
He wanted you to take care of me.

62
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,030
If I hadn't begged you,

63
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,190
you would have agreed.

64
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,960
So, you should know by now

65
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,240
that many things in this world

66
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,470
don't work out the way we want them to.

67
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,150
I agreed to your request,

68
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,590
but you didn't stay
by your brother's side.

69
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,120
It's the same now.

70
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,430
Even if you made him return the knife,

71
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,800
it would

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,950
change nothing at all.

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
There must be something I should do.

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,560
Then, promise me this.

75
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,160
No matter the outcome of the contest,

76
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,310
you will keep our secret

77
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,560
from Li Nai.

78
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,160
Why?

79
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,160
Through this contest,

80
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,000
I want Li Nai to let go of her obsession

81
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,190
and do whatever she wants from now on.

82
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,040
I promise.

83
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,480
Good.

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,510
And you, too.

85
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,190
Forget about this.

86
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,680
Once a person makes a choice,

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,270
they cannot be influenced
by anything else.

88
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,920
Back then,

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,720
I couldn't help you two,

90
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,920
including your father.

91
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,310
That's why I must thank you
for giving me this chance

92
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,920
to stay by Xiu's side.

93
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,190
I will cherish this chance.

94
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,310
I will do my very best

95
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,830
and leave no regrets.

96
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,160
Actually, Chef Jiang,

97
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,830
I have a question

98
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
I wanna ask.

99
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,720
- May I?
- Then, don't.

100
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,270
But I'm extremely curious.

101
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,830
So,

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,830
is there a small issue
between you and Li Nai?

103
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,240
Why do you ask?

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,120
She seems to be acting really weird lately.

105
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,160
When it comes to you,
she acts even weirder.

106
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,190
I like her, but she doesn't like me.

107
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
You like her, but she doesn't like you?

108
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,480
Based on what I know of her,

109
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,920
I don't know

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,310
if she likes you or not,

111
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,070
but there is no way for her to do so.

112
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
That's how she is.

113
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,680
She puts others' feelings first.

114
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,480
So, she often ignores her own feelings.

115
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,190
Is it because I seized your master's knife?

116
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,190
Not just that.

117
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,000
The truth is, my master,

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,920
- Jiang Jie.
- he...

119
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,480
Jiang Jie, if you have beef with me,

120
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,000
don't take it out on Cui Can.

121
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,560
Jiang Jie.

122
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,800
Cui Can.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If Li Nai had to choose

124
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,040
someone important to her,

125
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,040
you're probably on her side.

126
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,270
- Jiang Jie.
- I...

127
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,920
- Don't take it out on Cui Can.
- I'll go get her.

128
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,510
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

129
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
It was a misunderstanding.

130
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,240
Misunderstanding?

131
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,430
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,920
I was worried for him.

133
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,040
You can leave.

134
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
I'll change the password.

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,480
He was only asking you about Jiang Xiu.

136
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,160
Why did you send me an SOS?

137
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,270
How would I know?

138
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,000
I thought he knew your identity

139
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,270
and wants to force it out of me.

140
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,560
Li Nai,

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,510
how do you know Jiang Jie's home password?

142
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,240
He told me himself.

143
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,190
0113.

144
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,000
The account that wrote us
a good review had this number in it too.

145
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,560
Does he use this number often?

146
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,800
Could it be his birthday?

147
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,000
Today is the 13th.

148
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
When we were young,

149
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,160
my dad would make beef soup with radish

150
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,510
whenever someone had a birthday at home.

151
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,190
Li Nai,

152
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,680
have you ever liked him?

153
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,190
I don't know.

154
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,060
(Eating at Dusk)

155
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,200
Li Nai,

156
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,600
I've got to say

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,000
you're a mad-dog growth talent.

158
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,200
So, compared to Jiang Jie...

159
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,000
You'll lose.

160
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,670
Don't we have any chance of winning?

161
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,390
Not completely.

162
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,840
On the day of the contest,
Jiang Jie's hand might go...

163
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,120
I might as well buy
some high-quality ingredients.

164
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,510
Those ingredients
could at least elevate the dish.

165
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,150
It doesn't mean we'll win.

166
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,510
Li Nai,

167
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,030
you gotta act effectively.

168
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,030
You've been working
at Chuncheng for so long.

169
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,030
Don't you have the slightest idea
about Jiang Jie's weakness?

170
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,270
That's because Jiang Jie is
just too strong.

171
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,910
He's so strong, it's infuriating.

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,960
Li Nai,

173
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,720
didn't you visit Master today?

174
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,910
Didn't he teach you any tricks

175
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,390
or something like that?

176
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,480
Master said,

177
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,270
Jiang Jie and I cannot make the best dish

178
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,550
because neither of us cooks
with our heart.

179
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,480
Heart?

180
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,630
What does that mean?

181
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,200
There's some left, don't waste it.

182
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,960
I still have something to do,
so I'm gonna go now.

183
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,670
Jingjing, thanks for today.

184
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,360
- Bye-bye.
- You're welcome.

185
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,000
(Come, try my cooking.)

186
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,870
(Where is the cake?)

187
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,600
(Doesn't my son always
have longevity noodles for his birthday?)

188
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,550
(Beef brisket longevity noodles with radish.)

189
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,150
(It replenishes blood and energy,)

190
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,840
(and keeps the body and stomach warm.)

191
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,870
(This is neither Chinese or Western-style.)

192
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,030
(Happy birthday to you.)

193
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,600
(Happy birthday to you.)

194
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,440
(Happy birthday to you.)

195
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,550
(Happy birthday to you.)

196
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,870
(Son, tell me what you wished for.)

197
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
(- Then, eat it while it's hot.
- Wait, wait.)

198
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,480
(You haven't opened your birthday present.)

199
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,670
(Here you go.)

200
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,870
(You're unbelievable.)

201
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,750
(Why are you giving a child a kitchen knife?)

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,510
(This knife isn't sharpened yet.)

203
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,380
(Son, look. Do you like it?)

204
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,440
(I like it.)

205
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,320
(Good.)

206
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
What is this?

207
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,200
It's too heavy. Help me hold it.

208
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,480
I thought it's for me.

209
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,150
Jiang Jie?

210
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,510
Why did you drink so much?

211
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,550
I caught you.

212
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
How did you get so drunk?

213
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,720
Come on.

214
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,120
Hang on.

215
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,480
I'm fine. Let me go.

216
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,030
Put me down.

217
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,120
Easy now.

218
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,790
Are you okay?

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,480
Are you sober?

220
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,150
If you're sober, get up.

221
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,960
Why did you send me food?

222
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,960
What food?

223
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,790
I just happen to pass by.

224
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,390
That soup thermos is

225
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,480
the one I gave you recently.

226
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,120
I'm here to apologize.

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,960
I barged into your house
without permission

228
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,000
and misunderstood you.

229
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,030
So, what if...

230
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,270
What if it was as you thought?

231
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,120
At that time,

232
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,550
if I was hurting Cui Can,

233
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,270
what are you gonna do?

234
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,440
Don't ask anymore. I'm going now.

235
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,440
What's wrong?

236
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,120
Are you okay?

237
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,030
Why are you sweating so much?

238
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,320
Do you often have stomachaches?

239
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,550
How about some stomach medicine?

240
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,440
Give me your password.
I'll call an ambulance.

241
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,030
Just go.

242
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,480
I'm fine.

243
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,000
How can I go now?

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,840
You drank so much
and wouldn't eat anything.

245
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,120
Do you want me to watch you die?

246
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,000
Give me my phone.

247
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,150
I'm going now.

248
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,030
Can you stay until I finish this?

249
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,510
Eat up.

250
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,840
Is it overcooked?

251
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,750
It's delicious.

252
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,360
What's wrong?

253
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,960
Nothing.

254
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,680
I just find it hard to believe

255
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,160
that you praised my cooking.

256
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,830
Aren't you gonna seize my knife?

257
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,640
Why do you have so little confidence?

258
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,000
Anyone would lose confidence
when competing against you.

259
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,030
You're this good.

260
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,720
I was just here when I started.

261
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,640
After learning from you for some time,
I'm now over here.

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
But your knowledge
about ingredients is here,

263
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,110
or maybe

264
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,000
even higher.

265
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,110
It's getting late.

266
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,440
Go to bed early.

267
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,830
Li Nai.

268
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,270
What is it?

269
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,550
If...

270
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,400
If...

271
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,030
If I didn't seize your master's knife,

272
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,400
if I had found you
before Xue Congming did,

273
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,880
if we had met earlier,

274
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,480
would you have stood by my side instead?

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,960
There are no ifs.

276
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,830
True.

277
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,830
Everyone will leave eventually.

278
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,350
After so many years,

279
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,030
I'm the only one who stayed where I am.

280
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,960
Go home.

281
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,030
I'm sorry.

282
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,640
Do you know why I didn't go upstairs?

283
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,030
Because my brother

284
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,790
never celebrated another birthday
after he turned eight.

285
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,110
On the day he turned eight,

286
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,110
our dad lost both his hands
in an accident.

287
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,640
After that,

288
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,000
0113 is no longer

289
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,400
a birthday for my brother.

290
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,090
Hello.

291
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,400
I'm coming right away.

292
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,100
Hurry.

293
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,080
Hurry up.

294
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,510
It's best for the family members
to prepare for the worst.

295
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,960
The patient's condition doesn't look good.

296
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,960
If he has any last wishes,

297
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,960
it's best to fulfill them soon.

298
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,720
(Xue's Noodles)

299
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,920
Master was holding onto this
when he fell into a coma.

300
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,014
In the battle between
Eating at Dusk and Chuncheng,

301
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,065
will the successor of the Li family
who emerges out of nowhere,

302
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,830
put a stop to Jiang Jie's journey
in seizing knives?

303
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,350
Or will the famous Chef Jiang Jie
win the third five-star knife

304
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,750
and officially qualify

305
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,830
to challenge the Chef's Alliance champion,
Xijiangyue?

306
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's look forward to it.

307
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
He's here.

308
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
He's here.

309
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,070
Mr. Jiang Jie, how about an interview?

310
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,960
Mr. Jiang Jie, can you answer a question?

311
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,480
Chef Jiang, can you answer it?

312
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,480
Hello, Chef of Eating at Dusk.

313
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,480
I'm Cui Jing, Cui Can's sister.

314
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,240
Aren't you going inside?

315
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,116
I look forward to your performance.

316
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,310
Ms. Cui Jing, may I ask you a question?

317
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,830
Who do you think has better odds
at winning this time?

318
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,220
(Xue)

319
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,200
We have two more minutes
until the contest begins.

320
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,270
If the Head Chef of Eating at Dusk
fails to show up in time,

321
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,880
she will be disqualified from the contest.

322
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,620
(Emergency Room)

323
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,550
That's because

324
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
I can sense my customers' emotions

325
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
whether they're here

326
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,720
to eat happily or sadly.

327
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,510
And that was how

328
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,590
I was able to cook meals with emotions.

329
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,440
Miss, your cooking
is the best I've ever had.

330
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,680
I think the Head Chef
of Eating at Dusk is here.

331
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,380
(Eating at Dusk)

332
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,650
(Li)

333
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,030
Eating at Dusk, Li Nai,

334
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,350
hereby confirms her entry.

335
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,270
I'm only here for my master's knife.

336
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,680
(According to the Alliance's rules,
the dish to be judged upon is)

337
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,510
(the signature dish of the chef
who is being challenged.)

338
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,750
In this contest,

339
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,920
the two chefs will make a dish with beef.

340
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
The contest begins now.

341
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,830
(The two of you have a problem.)

342
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,830
This problem prevents you two
from making delicious food.

343
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,510
What problem is that?

344
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,680
Neither you nor he

345
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,880

388
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,550
We will now enter
the taste-testing segment.

389
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,160
We will begin the tasting with
Jiang Jie's Crispy Beef Brisket.

390
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,540
Next, we will taste
Li Nai's Beef Soup with Radish.

391
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,680
This tastes very simple.

392
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,030
It reminds me of the beef soup with radish

393
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,200
that my grandmother used to make for me

394
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,350
when I fell ill during the winter.

395
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,000
(Chef Jiang is)

396
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,000
currently the only chef
in a five-star restaurant

397
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,440
that serves beef

398
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,000
as his signature dish.

399
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,720
(Perhaps it's because of
his studies abroad,)

400
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,790
Chuncheng's dishes are a blend of
Chinese food with Western cooking styles.

401
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,240
Chef Jiang

402
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,750

a unique taste experience every time.

405
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,960
I have no comment.

406
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,590
I will speak with my vote.

407
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,830
Okay. I know this must be extremely hard

408
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,310
for the judges to decide,

409
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,880
