1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,099
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,684
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:06,817
Saeroyi.

4
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,918
You

5
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,797
brought me to my knees.

6
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,023
Why are you being like this?

7
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,860
Your beliefs and ambition.
Where did they all go?

8
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,700
This was enough
to bring you to your knees?

9
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,999
After all, you're surrendering
because I have more power.

10
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,341
Where is Jang Geun-won?

11
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,226
I thought this would be my last chance
to enjoy some entertainment.

12
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,274
How disappointing.

13
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,488
You're truly pathetic.

14
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,161
But because you got down
on those pathetic knees of yours,

15
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,833
I have no choice
but to desert my son once again.

16
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,415
You're kneeling before me, your enemy.

17
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,834
Tell me.

18
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,837
How does it feel?

19
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,678
I feel pathetic.

20
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,556
You do?

21
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,687
-You may leave.
-How do you feel now, sir?

22
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,611
You brought me to my knees.

23
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,822
Are you happy?

24
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,417
Is this gratifying for you?

25
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,379
-Are you--
-Wanting

26
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,300
to get back at you
kept me going until now.

27
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,474
Jang Dae-hee, the chairman of Jangga Co.

28
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,684
My enemy.

29
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,230
You made my life hell.
But at the same time,

30
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,233
you were an inspiring man.

31
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,199
I had to admit that
despite our different values.

32
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,202
I devoted

33
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,040
my whole life

34
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,542
to follow in your footsteps.

35
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,298
I thought

36
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,844
this fight was worth it.

37
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,389
-Hold on.
-But that man

38
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,392
threatened me

39
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,021
to kneel before him
by holding my close ones hostage.

40
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,445
I wasted over a decade of my life
following in the footsteps

41
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,863
of such a disgusting old grouch?

42
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,285
I deeply regret

43
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,415
wasting my life.

44
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,379
But look at the outcome.

45
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,131
You got down on your knees before me.

46
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,634
Sometimes, to get what you want--

47
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,305
Let's go, Seung-kwon.

48
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,015
Okay.

49
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,416
After over a decade,

50
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,835
I got to know you.

51
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,273
THE FINAL EPISODE

52
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,482
All right.

53
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,985
Forget about Park Saeroyi.

54
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,280
I want you to die, Jo Yi-seo.

55
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,762
Don't waste your energy and stay still.

56
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,475
Pick it up.

57
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,779
Gosh, I'm terrified.

58
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,738
Why?

59
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,866
Do you want to fight against us?

60
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,911
You guys are funny.

61
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,373
Attack them as I count to three.

62
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:39,876
Come on.

63
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,086
One.

64
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,421
Two, three.

65
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,633
Good luck, Jang Geun-soo! Hang in there!

66
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,643
What are you doing? Catch him.

67
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,603
Damn it!

68
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,605
Don't you dare come close to me.

69
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,112
What are you doing?

70
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,739
She told me

71
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,617
to hang on.

72
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,677
You know it will be dangerous.

73
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,390
I will

74
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,268
save Yi-seo.

75
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,813
I know. That's why we're going there.

76
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,734
You should also choose your priority.

77
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,319
What?

78
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,321
Things will go haywire

79
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,699
if you fail to make a decision.

80
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,868
Even if

81
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,329
we both get hurt

82
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,292
or die, my priority is to save Yi-seo.

83
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,379
Is that so?

84
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,800
But I can't force you to do the same.

85
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,638
My gosh, then why did you
ask me to come with you?

86
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,060
Yi-seo

87
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,771
may be a rude brat.

88
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,565
But she's family now.

89
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,109
I also care about her.

90
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,570
We should work toward the same goal

91
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,073
for better teamwork.

92
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,660
Thank you.

93
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,245
No problem.

94
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,333
By the way,
I'm going to save Yi-seo even if you die.

95
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,148
Are you okay?

96
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,235
I bet you've never been stabbed before.

97
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,615
It's useless to act brave
like those guys you see in movies.

98
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,408
This is the reality.

99
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,795
You really are tough.

100
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,839
Hold on tight.

101
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,472
That's enough.

102
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,143
What about Yi-seo?

103
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,019
You'll lose her.

104
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,358
You're right.

105
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,028
Start the car.

106
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,003
You got everything you want
including Jangga Co.

107
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,589
Just stay out of this.

108
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:17,969
Everything I want?

109
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,560
Throughout my entire life, I never got

110
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,855
what I wanted.

111
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,821
But I have to say,

112
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,576
I guess we really are brothers.

113
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,748
What?

114
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,709
We always used

115
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,171
the wrong method.

116
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,762
What is he doing? Aren't you coming?

117
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,350
Keep him here.

118
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,387
Hey!

119
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,472
Give up already!

120
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,557
You can't run away!

121
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,769
You give up, you fucking loser!

122
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,525
-Go get her.
-Yes, sir.

123
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,242
My gosh.

124
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,577
She's unbelievable.

125
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,235
My gosh.

126
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:58,796
Run into it.

127
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,918
The airbags work nicely.

128
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,336
This car is amazing.

129
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,382
My gosh.

130
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,467
Gosh, what is all this?

131
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,594
My gosh.

132
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:51,766
Boss?

133
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,686
Yi-seo.

134
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:00,817
Boss...

135
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,111
Boss!

136
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,294
Are you okay?

137
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,965
I heard you got hurt.

138
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,345
What in the world are you doing here?
Have you lost your mind?

139
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,390
Saeroyi!

140
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,274
You saved me some time.

141
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,278
You came here to die, right?

142
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,489
Saeroyi.

143
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,118
Hee-hoon.

144
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,204
You should've stayed at the hospital.

145
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,625
I called the cops before I came here.

146
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,297
Can you please just leave?

147
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,883
You fucking coward.

148
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,134
Gosh, it hurts.

149
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,138
You asshole.

150
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,641
Seung-kwon, are you okay?

151
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,188
Ms. Jo, it's nice to hear you
call me by my name.

152
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,398
Seung-kwon.

153
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,775
Yes, I know my priorities.

154
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,657
Hurry up and get out of here.
I'll take care of this.

155
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,288
Let's go.

156
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,835
That darn little...

157
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,049
Choi Seung-kwon.

158
00:16:58,893 --> 00:16:59,727
Finish him.

159
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,780
My gosh, you used to be one of us.

160
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,782
But you're ruthless.

161
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,326
"Don't hesitate."

162
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,037
That's what you always used to say.

163
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,123
I have to say,

164
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,377
-you're better off with us.
-No.

165
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,090
I'm better at serving tables.

166
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,832
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

167
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,251
Why did you come here?

168
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,836
Come here.

169
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,050
This reminds me of that day

170
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,511
when we both ran like crazy in Itaewon.

171
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,848
Why are you suddenly talking about that?

172
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,643
I missed you so much.

173
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,781
You always

174
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,410
worked so hard for me.

175
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,788
And you always got hurt.

176
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,793
What's going on?

177
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,631
Are you sure you're okay?

178
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,595
I can't believe this.

179
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,313
My mind

180
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,734
and heart

181
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:20,868
are both filled with you.

182
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,920
Is this how you felt?

183
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,630
This is very

184
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,715
heart beating.

185
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,552
Boss.

186
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,595
I love you.

187
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,269
I love you, Yi-seo.

188
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,778
I love you so much.

189
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,344
Those crazy psychos.

190
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,079
Go. Run.

191
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,290
I can't leave without you.

192
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,083
Are you trying to die alone?

193
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,337
The cops will call you.

194
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,757
Answer the phone
and tell them where we are.

195
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,848
You guys are having fun, aren't you?

196
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,643
Trust me and just go.

197
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:12,772
Yi-seo.

198
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,777
What a fucking joke.

199
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,862
If you die,

200
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,114
I'll die too.

201
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,617
Go on. Hurry.

202
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,203
Hey!

203
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,173
Damn it.

204
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,013
You want to die, right?

205
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,350
Both Seung-kwon and I
put our lives on the line.

206
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,979
Your life means nothing to me.

207
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:56,857
Crazy bastard.

208
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,490
Boss!

209
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,825
You fucking asshole!

210
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,664
What now, you bastard?

211
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,890
Today,

212
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,144
it all ends.

213
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,282
You fucking bastard.

214
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,496
Die!

215
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,958
Die just like your father!

216
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,758
How can you still call yourself human?

217
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,985
Yi-seo, Geun-soo, Ho-jin,

218
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,029
and my dad.

219
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,117
Do you feel no guilt at all?

220
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,122
Do you feel guilty

221
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,082
when you eat livestock?

222
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,001
What?

223
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,211
Because of you livestock,

224
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,922
I lost everything.

225
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,883
"Guilt"?

226
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,926
Cut the bullshit.

227
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,929
-You fucking asshole!
-Shut up, you jerk!

228
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,691
Die, you piece of shit!

229
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:04,652
Die! Just die already!

230
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:05,694
Stop. Wait.

231
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,824
I can't beat you.

232
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,868
I lost.

233
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,249
Saeroyi offered me a way out,

234
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,335
so let me just leave quietly.

235
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,885
What about your guys?

236
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,055
What about them?

237
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,474
Look at me.

238
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,060
I can't even take care of myself.

239
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,188
I'll leave them here for now--

240
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,231
Stop.

241
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,111
Stop talking.

242
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,493
You're starting to make me regret

243
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,913
having worked for you.

244
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,085
A true boss

245
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,255
is someone who takes responsibility.

246
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,721
Die!

247
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,472
Go to hell!

248
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,133
Wait. Over there. Please pull over.

249
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,216
Just die, you zombie.

250
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,973
I'm no longer the man I used to be.

251
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,270
Just remember one thing.

252
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,398
If you die,

253
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,567
I'll die too.

254
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,322
I can't let it happen.

255
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,075
I can feel it.

256
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,370
What crap are you talking about?

257
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,790
I think

258
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,835
I will be happy.

259
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,380
That's not going to happen.

260
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,095
Damn it!

261
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,891
Damn, what was that?

262
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,061
It's okay.

263
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,012
I sometimes wonder

264
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,806
if there's really any point in living.

265
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,184
Life is just so pointless

266
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,561
and obvious.

267
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,022
What are you talking about?

268
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,861
We all grow old and die one day
before we even turn 100.

269
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,781
But we all try so hard
to live a decent life.

270
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,828
It would've been nice
if was never born in the first place.

271
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,748
It feels like such a chore.

272
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,168
If it feels that much like a chore,

273
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,421
just die.

274
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,090
What?

275
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,634
I guess you're not that clever.

276
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,887
You talk as if you're some kind of a god.

277
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:48,143
Every night after work,
I go for a run in the neighborhood.

278
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,022
And when I wake up tomorrow,
I'll open the restaurant

279
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,942
and spend the day working there again.

280
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,820
Your life might seem repetitive.

281
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,575
But no one really knows
what could happen tomorrow.

282
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,622
Seung-kwon once tried
to start a fight with me,

283
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,166
but now he's a waiter at DanBam.

284
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,962
You made my pub get suspended,
but now you're the manager.

285
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,507
Not a single day was predictable for me.

286
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:24,638
Some days were tough,
and some days were sad.

287
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,394
But something fun always came along
every once in a while.

288
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,066
It's been happening a lot more often
ever since you came.

289
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,904
Every day is full of excitement.

290
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,828
Who knows?

291
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,621
One day,

292
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:53,917
your boring life might
turn into an exciting one.

293
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,465
It's cold. Let's go.

294
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,553
Me too.

295
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,852
When I'm with you,

296
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,604
my heart beats

297
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,857
and it's fun.

298
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,661
I did it.

299
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,749
It's all done now.

300
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,229
Boss!

301
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,737
You are okay...

302
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,200
Let's be

303
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,627
let's be happy.

304
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,608
PROSECUTION

305
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,829
The prosecution carried out
a thorough search of Jangga Co.

306
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,998
for bribery, embezzlement,
and slush fund creation.

307
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,544
Chairman Jang Dae-hee is forbidden
from leaving the country.

308
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,964
And he will be summoned
for investigation within this week.

309
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:51,303
Based on the seized data
from the offices of Jangga Co.,

310
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,181
the prosecution will focus
on grasping the size and flow

311
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,058
of the embezzlement and slush fund.

312
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,479
A connection with gangsters.

313
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,773
Incitement to commit murder. Kidnapping.

314
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,735
Also, Ms. Oh blew the whistle

315
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:54,241
and disclosed the embezzlement,
bribery, and other irregularities.

316
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,369
There's going to be a search and seizure.

317
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,496
There's no way out of this.

318
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,209
I think

319
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,295
you'll also have to attend.

320
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,050
I'll take the blame for everything.

321
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,846
Anything else?

322
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,560
Mr. Kim.

323
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,440
The pub owners

324
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,612
wish to cancel the contract
and receive compensation.

325
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,947
The Olympics will be held soon.

326
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,243
We just need to wait until then--

327
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,120
The company is on the brink of bankruptcy.

328
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:46,042
And the board is considering the option
of selling the company.

329
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,628
What?

330
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:50,880
What are you talking about?

331
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,007
If we sell now,

332
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,096
we'll gain absolutely nothing.

333
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,015
Have they lost their minds?

334
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,185
There's one firm that offered to take over

335
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,063
at a pretty reasonable price.

336
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,281
CHUNGCHEONG PRISON

337
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,664
LET'S BUILD MORALITY
AND LIVE HEALTHY LIVES

338
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,505
You seem familiar.

339
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,799
I'm Lee Ho-jin.

340
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,552
"Lee Ho-jin"?

341
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,473
I'm a financial manager for IC Co.

342
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,600
Before that, I used to be

343
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,478
the financial manager
for Director Kang Min-jung.

344
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,480
And before that,

345
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,776
I was a Senior in class one
at Gwangjin Highschool.

346
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,320
You bullied me.

347
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,369
What...

348
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,788
That nerd?

349
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,457
How could you forget me?

350
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,835
The whole thing between Saeroyi and you
started with me.

351
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,463
You...

352
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,506
Did you...

353
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,549
And I get to wrap things up too.

354
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,302
What are you talking about?

355
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,348
There will be a takeover bid
for Jangga Co.

356
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,936
Takeover?

357
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,731
Those days you don't even remember...

358
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,776
"Jang Geun-won is the law."

359
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,697
You could say that
as Jangga Co. had your back.

360
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,617
I wanted to see you
without your background.

361
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,495
All the corruption of Chairman Jang
has been revealed.

362
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,955
He will soon be arrested.

363
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,667
How dare you...

364
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,763
Stop whining.

365
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:06,933
You...

366
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,059
It's done.

367
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,481
I forgive you.

368
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,486
Hey, Lee Ho-jin.

369
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,905
You moron.

370
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,699
Lee Ho-jin!

371
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,325
You idiot!

372
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,618
Damn it!

373
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,245
Hey!

374
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,039
Let go of me. Lee Ho-jin!

375
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,586
Min-jung.

376
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,505
Hey.

377
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,135
Where are you going?

378
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,261
Seoul.

379
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,263
I have something to take care of.

380
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,724
I'm going back to the head office.

381
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,643
I see. That's a bummer.

382
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,811
Right?

383
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,482
I won't

384
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,233
get to see you often then.

385
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,445
It depends on you.

386
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,822
You can visit me when you come to Seoul.

387
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,122
How could I do that?

388
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:14,793
You can't?

389
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,128
Then you won't get to see me.

390
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,048
You are so lame.

391
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,010
I'll see you later, Hye-won. Bye.

392
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,178
Bye!

393
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,389
Well...

394
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,183
Director Kang.

395
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,103
You're not my employee.
Why do you call me like that?

396
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,064
You can call me by my name.

397
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,066
Okay.

398
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:39,567
Ms. Min-jung.

399
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,944
My goodness.

400
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,949
What was that? It's funny, isn't it?

401
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,952
Can I

402
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,746
give you a ride?

403
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,873
She'll be a lot more
comfortable in that car.

404
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,166
Stay quiet.

405
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,377
The truck is too small for three people.

406
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,295
Well...

407
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,347
I will just squeeze in.

408
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,227
You go on ahead.
I'll be there in that truck.

409
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,645
Yes, ma'am.

410
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,231
Let's go.

411
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,148
Please get in.

412
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,831
JANGGA PUB, JANGGA NOODLES,
JANGGA RESTAURANT

413
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,291
A whistle blower.

414
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,919
No one would want to hire you.

415
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,256
Why did you do that?

416
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,343
What about you?

417
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,513
Why do you try so hard

418
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,057
for Jangga Co. and Chairman Jang?

419
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,685
Do you not know why?

420
00:39:58,855 --> 00:39:59,689
I'm

421
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,734
a salaryman.

422
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,575
I've learned a lot from you.

423
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,219
There's no way

424
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,639
that little brat can run Jangga Co.

425
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,100
Please help me this once.

426
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:38,728
Mr. Hwang.

427
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,068
What about the Mayor?

428
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,695
I can't reach him.

429
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,865
These old bats.

430
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,036
Only six months ago,
they were intimidated by me.

431
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,496
Damn it.

432
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:58,873
There is

433
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,501
nothing we can do now.

434
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,171
-Are you saying--
-Chairman Jang.

435
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,756
I mean,

436
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,218
Dad.

437
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,265
You know your favorite saying.

438
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,061
"The strong prey on the weak."

439
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,231
It's just like that.

440
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,942
We got weak,

441
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,153
so they are preying.

442
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,123
Get out.

443
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,108
That's ridiculous.

444
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,278
I'm Jang Dae-hee.

445
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,321
This is Jangga Co.

446
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,240
No.

447
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,367
It can never happen.

448
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,953
Does this make sense to you?

449
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,205
An ex-convict
who barely finished middle school?

450
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,041
I tried to put up with all that.

451
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,417
Mom, please.

452
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,004
And now what? Kidnap? She got kidnapped?

453
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,549
I'm really sorry.

454
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:33,926
I can't take this anymore.

455
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,388
I knew it all along when he stopped you
from going to college.

456
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,516
How would I trust you with my daughter
when you're like this?

457
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:45,980
I'm really sorry. I'll make sure
it will never happen again.

458
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,565
You have to.

459
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,693
I will watch you closely.

460
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,361
Make sure to take good care of her.

461
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,197
Sure. I will take...

462
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,368
Yes, ma'am.

463
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,792
Mom. We have to go. You should go.

464
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,461
Okay.

465
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,422
All right then. I hope you'll get better.

466
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,632
See you.

467
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,343
Thank you, Mother. Take care.

468
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,682
"Mother?"

469
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,104
Yes.

470
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,111
It's nice to hear.

471
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,987
Go, Mom.

472
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,031
Bye.

473
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,664
Wait, my legs.

474
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,044
I clearly heard you say
you'd take care of me.

475
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,212
What?

476
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,554
You know I'm not just a talker.

477
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,349
What?

478
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,771
Do you like me?

479
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,860
No, I love you.

480
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,119
Let's go.

481
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,456
What? I didn't hear you. Say that again.

482
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,666
Say what?

483
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,918
What you just said.

484
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,798
I love you. Let's go.

485
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,717
I love you too.

486
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,809
Didn't I tell you I'm upset with you?

487
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:47,727
I know.

488
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:52,231
I did get on your nerves

489
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,276
because of Park Saeroyi.

490
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,738
Like you asked, I promise

491
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,949
I won't mess with him again.

492
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,162
Let me get this straight.

493
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,123
It's not that you won't mess with him.

494
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,751
You just can't do it anymore.

495
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,298
We've known each other

496
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,216
for over 40 years.

497
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,760
Why did you call me?

498
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,555
I don't know if you're aware of it,

499
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,308
but I don't

500
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,894
have long to live.

501
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:40,196
I could build Jangga Co.
into a major company thanks to you.

502
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,406
I can't ruin it just like this.

503
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,533
If you give me one more chance--

504
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,327
Is it because of me?

505
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,121
You told me this before.

506
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:53,125
You started your business
to feed your family.

507
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,463
Do you still feel the same way?

508
00:45:58,965 --> 00:45:59,924
Sure.

509
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,384
I really do.

510
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,927
Then let me ask you one thing.

511
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,721
If Park Saeroyi leads Jangga Co.,

512
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,307
will your family starve to death?

513
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:11,936
Why do you

514
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,230
run your business now?

515
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,197
I've never made you suffer a loss.

516
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,409
If you help me this once--

517
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,368
For you,

518
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,081
we've been together for mutual advantages.

519
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,459
It just goes away

520
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,837
once you lose your value.

521
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,633
Please don't be like this.

522
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,052
What should I do now?

523
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,346
It can't be helped.

524
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,391
You shouldn't be

525
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,309
clinging onto me.

526
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,021
-Ms. Kim.
-There's someone else

527
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,314
who can take care of things.

528
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:10,161
DANBAM

529
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,268
Welcome to Danbam.

530
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,492
Who is he? Why did Mr. Park come
all the way here to serve him food?

531
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,660
I know. Ms. Jo is here too.

532
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,746
He looks familiar though.

533
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,618
Soft tofu stew?

534
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:35,538
Please try it.

535
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,060
I'm pursuing the takeover of Jangga Co.

536
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:52,448
I'm planning to let
Director Kang run the company.

537
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,618
Since the company reputation is tarnished,

538
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,747
and I have hard feelings
toward the company name,

539
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,750
I'm going to change it.

540
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,718
This stew.

541
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,846
Where did you learn it from?

542
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:20,768
From my father.

543
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,896
Mr. Park?

544
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,488
I thought it tasted similar.

545
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,741
But this one has a unique aftertaste.

546
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,328
We have our own recipe for the sauce.

547
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,537
I give

548
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,250
a lot of care to fermented soybean powder.

549
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,126
A lot of care?

550
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:49,505
On a cold day,

551
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,675
the warmth spreads throughout the body.

552
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:54,677
Isn't it good?

553
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,484
I agree.

554
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,080
I got treated with a nice meal like this.

555
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,541
But I'm sorry

556
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,003
I didn't bring any money.

557
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,136
This is embarrassing.

558
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,100
Can I pay in another way?

559
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,060
What are you doing?

560
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,068
Jangga Co. is collapsing already.

561
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,279
There would be no advantage

562
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,032
in taking over the company.

563
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,829
This is all my fault.

564
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,208
This isn't just about resentment.

565
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,212
Jangga Co. is a good company.

566
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,389
I don't have many days to live.

567
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,725
I'm not doing this for my own good.

568
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,646
I apologize

569
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:54,523
with all my heart.

570
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,362
I've done terrible things

571
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,075
to Mr. Park and you.

572
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:07,327
I'm deeply sorry.

573
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,848
Please forgive me.

574
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,326
I've always wanted this to happen,

575
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,329
but it doesn't feel great.

576
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:49,763
I feel bad for Geun-soo.

577
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,183
Please get up.

578
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:02,526
Saeroyi.

579
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,829
Do you think

580
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,212
I'm a pushover?

581
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:27,259
What?

582
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:31,847
I'm

583
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,600
a businessman.

584
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,481
This is about a business takeover.

585
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,358
You just apologized
after losing everything.

586
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,236
What good would it do me?

587
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,625
Let's do business,

588
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,336
Chairman Jang.

589
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,986
The IC Co. will take over

590
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,571
Jangga Co.

591
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,449
Then, Mr. Park Saeroyi,
please say something for us.

592
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:25,669
THE 32ND SHAREHOLDERS MEETING
OF JANGGA CO.

593
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:45,564
Hello, I'm Park Saeroyi,
IC Co. representative.

594
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,611
Jangga Co. is a restaurant company
representing Korea.

595
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,365
There is also a menu
that represents this Jangga Co.

596
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:59,911
Gochujang seasoned pork bulgogi
and its seasoning.

597
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,583
The crisis in the country,
the days when everyone was in trouble,

598
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,462
It comforted the people
with its low price and delicious taste.

599
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,175
The recent events
have cracked the corporate image,

600
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,635
but it's just an individual's fault.

601
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:19,347
Jangga Co. is still a good restaurant.

602
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,851
At that time,
it was not only money and gain

603
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,396
that Jangga Co. sought.

604
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,399
The most important things in business.

605
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,151
People.

606
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,861
Trust.

607
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,073
I will value people and not money.

608
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,534
I will value trust then gains.

609
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,913
With all of you,

610
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,040
we will renew

611
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,542
and prosper again.

612
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:48,752
Thank you.

613
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,786
Congratulations on your wish fulfillment.

614
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:23,995
Thank you.

615
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,247
Congratulations.

616
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,456
Congratulations.

617
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,418
Geun-soo.

618
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,596
I heard you resigned.

619
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,559
A defeated soldier must retreat.

620
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,480
It might have been uncomfortable today
but you voted for me.

621
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,066
Why did you do that?

622
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,278
Is my vote meaningful?

623
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,780
I just...

624
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,366
I wanted to see it.

625
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,912
You achieved your goal.

626
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,376
I will not harm you
for your father's deeds.

627
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,046
-One day with your abilities--
-It was me.

628
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,427
I told the reporters

629
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:24,723
about Hyun-yi.

630
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,444
In addition to that,

631
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,073
I approached Seung-kwon

632
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,492
to figure out the IC's movements.

633
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,789
It wasn't the right clothes.

634
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,003
I did everything I could

635
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,172
to win.

636
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,593
I knew from the beginning

637
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,764
that I wouldn't be able to get Yi-seo

638
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,767
even if I took over Jangga Co.

639
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,982
I knew everything but I couldn't stop.

640
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:21,112
I didn't know how to stop..

641
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:31,456
My heart...

642
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,583
It's okay.

643
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:39,881
Because you are just a kiddie.

644
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,719
Come and eat from time to time.

645
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,663
OH SOO-AH

646
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,333
Hello.

647
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,796
I heard. I wanted to congratulate you.

648
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,133
A whistleblower.

649
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:25,343
Why did you do that?

650
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,388
It's not because of you.

651
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,349
What?

652
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,102
When I borrowed money

653
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,480
for college from your dad,

654
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,817
I told him I would pay him three times.

655
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,363
Is this

656
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,408
enough?

657
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,496
Yes.

658
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:55,665
Thank you.

659
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:03,882
Now I can comfortably

660
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,760
live my life.

661
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,016
As a friend,

662
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,143
can you cheer for me?

663
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,360
I will always cheer for you.

664
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,205
Now that your revenge is over,

665
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,750
can I ask you a favor?

666
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:41,836
What is it?

667
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,051
Live

668
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:50,553
happily.

669
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:58,853
I will.

670
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:45,358
DANBAM

671
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:54,701
Do you want me to come with you?

672
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,038
What?

673
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,416
What are you doing here?

674
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,042
Geun-soo called me here.

675
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:04,210
-He called you too?
-Yes.

676
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:05,837
Hello.

677
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:08,423
Why is he so depressed?

678
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,926
He got dumped by his girlfriend.

679
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,597
Hey, it's no big deal.

680
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,724
Do you know how I feel?

681
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,225
You don't even have a girlfriend.

682
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,188
He's right. You don't.

683
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,400
What is this?

684
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,693
Movie tickets?

685
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,155
You can take it.

686
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,865
I don't need it anymore.

687
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,950
Gosh, Toni.

688
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,412
What?

689
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:58,598
Hey.

690
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,808
Did he just speak English?

691
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:02,227
Yes, he learned it.

692
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,145
That was his homework from our boss.

693
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,523
What? It's Geun-soo.

694
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,744
Please forgive me.

695
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,415
Raise your head.

696
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,636
You stabbed us in the back,
so we're paying it back.

697
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,141
Did you hit him hard?

698
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,394
Did I?

699
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,437
Hey, are you...

700
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,778
I guess you didn't hit him right.

701
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:56,197
Why did you do such a thing

702
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,074
when you would feel bad about it?

703
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:01,536
I'm sorry.

704
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:06,332
Yi-seo is coming today.
Make sure to see her before you leave.

705
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:11,713
Maybe next time.

706
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,132
I'll see her later.

707
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,134
Why don't you stay here and see her?

708
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:19,387
I'm

709
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:21,848
still a kiddie.

710
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,338
What are you doing here?

711
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,423
Well...

712
01:08:58,259 --> 01:08:59,719
I'm going to the States.

713
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:05,183
I wanted to apologize
to Seung-kwon and Hyun-yi before I leave.

714
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,939
Do you feel better this way?

715
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:16,069
Saying sorry won't just cut it.

716
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:21,824
I know.

717
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:24,369
Bye.

718
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,204
Take care.

719
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,834
Yi-seo.

720
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,344
What about

721
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,012
a handshake?

722
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:48,851
Is it something like an ending

723
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:50,812
of your long crush?

724
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:53,481
Well...

725
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:57,694
I know.

726
01:09:58,695 --> 01:09:59,987
I don't deserve it.

727
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,246
Of course,

728
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:10,206
you do.

729
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,254
You didn't even care
about right and wrong.

730
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,298
You were just faithful to me.

731
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,468
I couldn't accept it,

732
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,430
but I could feel it all.

733
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,351
I'm sorry I took advantage of it.

734
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,063
And thank you.

735
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,332
Take care.

736
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,091
-Is this it?
-Yes.

737
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:47,178
This place is popular these days.
I'm here to spy on it.

738
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,892
You don't have to spy on me.
Just ask me if you have questions.

739
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,480
-The owner is pretty.
-Oh...

740
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,148
Is this yours?

741
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,110
I recently opened it
with Seok-cheon's investment.

742
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,446
Go ahead and spy.

743
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,781
Come on in.

744
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:07,824
I'll buy you some tea.

745
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,285
You know what?

746
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,707
Boss and I are dating.

747
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,012
I'm just relieved if it's you.

748
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,226
Take good care of Saeroyi.

749
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,731
What? How nosy.

750
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,233
Why do you even care?

751
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,360
-Let's just go, Hyun-yi.
-Hey.

752
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,241
I'll come again next time.

753
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,493
Hey, wait for me...

754
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:58,583
I mean it.

755
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:01,752
Take good care of him.

756
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,842
-That's so...
-Seok-cheon.

757
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,677
Soo-ah.

758
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:12,346
A chef is here for an interview.

759
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,223
Oh, right. Where is he?

760
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,474
He's there.

761
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,070
Hello.

762
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:37,747
Amazing.

763
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,082
Sorry?

764
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,250
You have to hire him.

765
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,544
He's stunning.

766
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,006
Wow.

767
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,008
How could a chef look like that?

768
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,801
He should be serving in the hall.

769
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:52,511
You'll hire him, right?

770
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,098
I'll hire him only when he cooks well.

771
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:10,613
Please say you like it.
You have to hire him.

772
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,161
Do you like it?

773
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:26,712
Can you

774
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,006
start tomorrow?

775
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,723
Yes, Boss.

776
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:41,852
I'll come here starting from tomorrow.

777
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,147
I love it.

778
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:46,482
It's delicious.

779
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,193
Wow, this is amazing.

780
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:57,284
What was that?

781
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,495
You startled me.

782
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,789
Why did you call me? I'm busy.

783
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:03,624
No reason.

784
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,127
I got free tickets.

785
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:08,337
But I didn't want to watch it alone.

786
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:13,968
I guess Director Choi has
a lot of free time these days.

787
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:16,929
It's not like I can sell these tickets.

788
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,685
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

789
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:25,813
I'm coming.

790
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:27,314
Gosh.

791
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,278
Gosh.

792
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:33,404
Hello.

793
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,716
YI-SEO AND SAEROYI

794
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,100
What are you doing here?

795
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:09,774
Are you busy?

796
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,610
Why? Is something wrong?

797
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,741
Not really.

798
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,951
A cool breeze is blowing outside.

799
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,829
It's a nice day for a walk.

800
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,581
If you're not busy,

801
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:26,916
can we go out?

802
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:32,213
I'm not busy.

803
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:36,092
MR. PARK'S SCHEDULE

804
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,304
I haven't been to Itaewon with you
in such a long time.

805
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,848
I know. We've been busy.

806
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:48,813
-Boss.
-Yes?

807
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:50,106
Come here.

808
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:51,857
-Okay.
-This place is nice.

809
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,359
YI-SEO AND SAEROYI

810
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:01,242
One, two, three.

811
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,251
-Do you want me to take it?
-No.

812
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,168
No?

813
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,753
Take a picture of me.

814
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:20,344
-You said you love me, right?
-What? Yes.

815
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,223
I did.

816
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,519
But

817
01:17:29,436 --> 01:17:31,063
why do you not hold my hand?

818
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:36,735
Oh, well...

819
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:39,572
It's just...

820
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:43,576
It feels a little awkward.

821
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:48,747
I feel the same way.

822
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,656
I'll try my best

823
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,456
You and I are

824
01:18:31,498 --> 01:18:33,500
different from A to Z.

825
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:36,212
But we have one thing in common.

826
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,174
One thing in common?

827
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,635
Yes.

828
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,182
We don't know the warmth of people.

829
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,190
When I heard

830
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,693
about your past the other day,

831
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,908
I wanted to embrace

832
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,662
all your painful past.

833
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:14,708
I didn't want you to suffer.

834
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:18,921
I didn't want you to be lonely.

835
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,471
I wanted to make

836
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,475
your bitter night sweet.

837
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,487
When I think of you,

838
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,866
my empty life

839
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:53,163
fills up with you.

840
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:02,381
Thank you.

841
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,681
I love you.

842
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,312
I will make you happy.

843
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:43,797
I wanted to be happy.

844
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,344
Without losing myself,

845
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,181
I wanted to achieve everything I want.

846
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,645
There were difficult days.

847
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:04,735
Sometimes,

848
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:08,947
I was nervous and afraid.

849
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:19,750
How did I get through all that?

850
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:21,877
We can...

851
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,295
-Do it!
-Do it!

852
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,255
With my loved ones,

853
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,218
I've led a hectic life
doing what I want to do.

854
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,261
-We got this!
-We got this!

855
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:33,722
Staying with them.

856
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,058
Sharing my life

857
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:38,727
with them.

858
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,608
In search of happiness.

859
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:01,917
I love you,

860
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:05,462
Yi-seo.

861
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,662
Happiness.

862
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:52,384
The warmth I share with you.

863
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:27,836
I'm already

864
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:41,767
happier than I ever imagined

865
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:47,397
I could be.

866
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:15,551
Boss

867
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:17,928
I love you

868
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:22,516
Let's drink.

869
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,310
Cheers!

870
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,030
Who wants to go to a club?

871
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:20,198
How does it taste?

872
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:35,922
AN END-CREDIT SCENE WILL FOLLOW

873
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,709
I work as usual.

874
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:16,088
SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK BO-GUM
AND HONG SEOK-CHEON

875
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,381
And I date

876
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:20,258
as usual.

877
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:28,850
What was that?

878
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,313
I just like you.

879
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,234
I guess you like me just a little.

880
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,688
That's not true.

881
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,295
A usual day.

882
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:44,593
DANBAM

883
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,186
