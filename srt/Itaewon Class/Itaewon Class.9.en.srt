1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,599
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,935
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,488
Is this working?

4
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,908
Hi, everyone. Let me introduce DanBam
on Gyeongridan-gil road.

5
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,953
Ta-da. Hyun-yi, say hi.

6
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,289
-Are we on live again? Hi!
-Hi!

7
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,499
SHE ALREADY LOOKS SO PRETTY

8
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,793
YI-SEO, WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR JACKET?

9
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,296
Let me introduce my boss. Boss!

10
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,550
-Hi! Say hi. I'm live-streaming.
-Oh!

11
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,926
YOU TWO SHOULD DATE

12
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,761
Yes, hello.

13
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,181
Boss, how do you feel now
that DanBam is on Gyeongridan-gil road?

14
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,349
DON'T YOU NEED A PART-TIMER?

15
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,059
How do I feel? What do I say?

16
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,227
Just say anything.

17
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,729
YOU'RE CUTE

18
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,440
-We'll work hard.
-Gosh. "We'll work hard."

19
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,817
My boss is so boring.

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,068
THAT WAS CUTE

21
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,904
Then what are your goals as the boss?
Share with us.

22
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,489
-My goals?
-Yes.

23
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,325
GOSH, HE'S NO FUN

24
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,577
I GUESS HE'S NEVER DONE
LIVE STREAMING BEFORE

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,370
WE'LL FORGIVE HIM BECAUSE HE'S HANDSOME

26
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,538
-Come on.
-Okay.

27
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,707
DANBAM? DO THEY HAVE GOOD FOOD?

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,208
My staff and I...

29
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,835
THEY REOPENED ON GYEONGRIDAN-GIL ROAD

30
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,587
...will work hard

31
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,257
to make DanBam
the number one pub in the country.

32
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,175
Wow.

33
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,218
-Number one.
-Number one.

34
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,970
-Shall we shout together?
-Okay.

35
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,805
One, two, three.

36
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,390
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,605
EPISODE 9

38
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,606
Last but not least...

39
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,985
There are more than five million
business owners in the country.

40
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,446
And out of those five million,

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,949
a million businesses shut down every year.

42
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:39,951
Why do they go out of business?

43
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,120
Because the economy is bad?

44
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,455
No.

45
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:48,210
It's because customers don't have a reason
to choose it over the other ones.

46
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,088
Your foods, decor, and system
must set you apart.

47
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,631
If you open something without a plan

48
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,467
or putting much thought into it,
you'll go out of business.

49
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,345
Outdo your neighboring businesses.

50
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,098
Have something unique that sets you apart.

51
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,974
Figure out

52
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,977
how you can win the competition
and keep trying things.

53
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,980
I was able to grow Jangga
from the tiny pub under the bridge

54
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,316
forty years ago to what it is today

55
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,986
because I ceaselessly pondered solutions,
and I will never stop.

56
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,532
All these concerns and attempts

57
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,410
are what got me to where I am today.

58
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,496
You can

59
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,040
do it too.

60
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,837
Thank you for listening to
this businessman,

61
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,964
Jang Dae-hee.

62
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,341
SEMINAR BY CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

63
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,730
I'm sorry.
We're not accepting any questions--

64
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,358
BUSINESS

65
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,443
Give her a microphone.

66
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,161
Hello, sir. I enjoyed the seminar.

67
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,330
We've met before.
It's good to see you again.

68
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,917
I'm curious to hear your question.

69
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,045
Well, my boss always says

70
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,797
that business is all about people.

71
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:20,010
This has nothing to do with the seminar.
I'm purely asking as a fan of yours.

72
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:25,474
Do you also have such a motto
about running a business?

73
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,769
"Business is all about people"?

74
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,521
Your boss sounds like a romantic.

75
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,068
Let me think.
What does running a business means to me?

76
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,740
No matter what word you use
to sugarcoat it,

77
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,658
you can't change its definition.

78
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,496
The ultimate goal of a business
is to obtain profits.

79
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:54,753
You said you grew a tiny pub
under a bridge into what Jangga is today.

80
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,881
I truly admire you.

81
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,926
And I loved that you used the word,
"competition."

82
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,762
Then I want to ask you
about the competition.

83
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,014
Do you think it's possible

84
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,227
for a small pub
to beat what Jangga is today?

85
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,285
I love seeing ambitious young people
like yourself,

86
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,122
but I'm still full of ambition as well,

87
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,294
so such a thing

88
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,089
will never happen until the day I die.

89
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,596
With that bold statement,
I'd like to end this seminar.

90
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,852
Thank you for attending our seminar
hosted by Chairman Jang Dae-hee.

91
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,252
I didn't think
I'd see you at this seminar.

92
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,546
Was it helpful?

93
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,841
Yes. I learned a lot, sir.

94
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,551
I heard you moved to Gyeongridan-gil road.

95
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,511
How's business?

96
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,390
We're working hard, but it's not easy.

97
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,727
I see. Keep up the good work.

98
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,605
Goodbye, sir.

99
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,949
In my opinion, power comes from people.

100
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,537
Because their trust gives me strength.

101
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,205
If your business fails,

102
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,791
you'll lose your people.

103
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,961
They're the reason why
I can continue to run my business.

104
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,965
Right.

105
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,427
Mr. Kim.

106
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,846
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,519
Ms. Jo.

108
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,487
Chairman Jang would like to see you.

109
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,081
Chairman Jang,
the guest you're expecting is here.

110
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,749
Okay, let her in.

111
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,043
You were expecting someone?

112
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,316
You're...

113
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,778
Thanks for coming.

114
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,364
Have you eaten yet?

115
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,075
No, not yet.

116
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,410
Shall we have some food first?

117
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,554
This was so good.

118
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,681
Thank you, sir.

119
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,016
My pleasure.

120
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,274
I'm not good at beating around the bush.

121
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,069
Why don't you join Jangga?

122
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,989
I'll treat you well.

123
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,831
Thank you for the offer,

124
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,417
but I'm afraid I must decline.

125
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,712
May I ask why?

126
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,590
Because of my boss.

127
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,349
I know young people these days
value friendship a great deal,

128
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,894
but it hasn't even been a year.

129
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,229
It's only a shallow friendship.

130
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,649
Like you said,

131
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,819
I shouldn't decline your offer
merely because of friendship.

132
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,698
But aren't you making this offer
because of my boss?

133
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,205
You're immensely interested
in my boss as well as in DanBam.

134
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,207
So?

135
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,588
I'm confident that I can grow DanBam.

136
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,385
If you come to notice me, not my boss,
in that process,

137
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,348
you can give me
this offer again then, sir.

138
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,666
Jo Yi-seo.

139
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,128
The manager of Park Saeroyi's pub.

140
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,881
Park Saeroyi, that prick.

141
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,716
Because of Mr. Park.

142
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,594
He was like a father to me.

143
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,577
Damn it.

144
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:07,000
Jeez, you need to look ahead
when you're driving.

145
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,756
Hey, you can't drive at full speed here.

146
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,346
God damn it.

147
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,769
Shall I call my insurer
or just give you money?

148
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,481
-What?
-Just answer my question. I'm busy.

149
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,066
Jeez, what the...

150
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,652
First, you need to apologize to me
for hitting my car.

151
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,404
Are you that rich?

152
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,326
Will you say no to money
if I apologize to you?

153
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,412
I am rich.

154
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,372
I'm offering you money!

155
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,332
What the hell.

156
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,422
Here.

157
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,303
How's the business going?

158
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,474
Not bad. Yi-seo has done some marketing.

159
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,143
"Not bad" is an understatement.

160
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,562
We should get ready for the tax season.

161
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,441
How much will I be taxed?

162
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,695
Well, I can't really figure out
the exact amount yet.

163
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,781
But at this rate, a lot.

164
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,909
What should I do, then?

165
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,829
You don't need to worry.
It's my specialty, you know.

166
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,958
Let's do this.

167
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,541
I'M GOING TO INCORPORATE DANBAM

168
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,584
I'm going to incorporate DanBam.

169
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,919
PARK SAEROYI

170
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,672
You'll incorporate the business?
So DanBam will become a company?

171
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,174
Wow, that means you'll be a CEO.

172
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,261
CEO? What does it mean
to incorporate the business?

173
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,679
Incorporate DanBam...

174
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,473
What all the money we're pulling in,
we should. For tax purposes.

175
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,309
So we need to come up with a name.

176
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,396
A company name. Throw some ideas.

177
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,772
DANBAM PUB

178
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,190
"Parkga."

179
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,692
What do you think?

180
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,528
PARK SAEROYI

181
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,196
No, it sounds like Jangga's copycat.

182
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,198
What about "ILL"?

183
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,035
I think it sounds cool.

184
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,412
Yi-seo, Royi, love.

185
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,539
PARK SAEROYI

186
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,708
Not sure. I don't love it.

187
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,294
What about you, Seung-kwon? Got any ideas?

188
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:57,879
Well...

189
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,048
"Itaewon...

190
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,133
Class"?

191
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,343
Gosh, what is that?

192
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,678
It sounds so lame.

193
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,388
It sounds so uncool, just like him.

194
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,807
I actually like it.

195
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,018
Right? I like it too.

196
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,895
"Itaewon Class."

197
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,105
It's catchy. It's a good name.

198
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,107
You guys don't like it?

199
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,234
No, I don't.

200
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,446
"Class," seriously? It sounds so childish.

201
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,907
It sounds like something
a teenage bluffer would say.

202
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,034
DANBAM PUB GROUP CHAT

203
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,338
SEOMSEOM PUB

204
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,051
ITAEWON

205
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,278
The first word that came to my mind
when I heard "Itaewon Class"

206
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,864
was "freedom."

207
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,536
A place where
different cultures can mingle freely.

208
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,663
Being free from restraints.

209
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,125
Itaewon symbolizes freedom.

210
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,628
That's what you were going for, right?

211
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,134
-Yes.
-Bullshit.

212
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,136
It sounds a little forced,

213
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,304
but it's not bad.

214
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,390
It's got that old-school vibe.

215
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,311
What can we do? You already love the name.

216
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,397
You'll go with it anyway.

217
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,607
No.

218
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,901
I won't if you don't like it.

219
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,824
Well...

220
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,660
I'm fine with it if you like it.

221
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,495
It's fine,

222
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,331
but limiting ourselves to Itaewon only
won't help us

223
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,251
when dealing with other businesses.
It makes us look small.

224
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,548
Then "Itaewon Class" can be a name
that we use amongst ourselves.

225
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,675
How about we just use the initials?

226
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,223
"IC"?

227
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,058
"IC"?

228
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,270
-"IC."
-What?

229
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,733
Wow, using English.

230
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,777
Nice. It's a memorable name.

231
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,113
"IC."

232
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,409
I like it.

233
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,787
Then since the manager likes it too,

234
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,249
we're now the founding members of IC Inc.,

235
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,588
Itaewon Class.

236
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,467
DANBAM

237
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,305

OUR TIME BEGINS AFTER MIDNIGHT

239
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,852
Saeroyi!

240
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,647
Hey, Hye-won.

241
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,607
Hello.

242
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,776
It's her school's anniversary,
so I brought her.

243
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,319
It's good to see you.

244
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,197
Guys, help him with his stuff.

245
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,573
-Sure.
-Sure.

246
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,535
-It's your first time here, right?
-Yes.

247
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,371
Hi, Yi-seo.

248
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,625
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

249
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,709
You're hungry?

250
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,921
-Hyun-yi, can you make some food for her?
-Oh, sure.

251
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,465
-Hey, take this.
-You bring it.

252
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,591
That little...

253
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,678
Have a seat here.
The food will be ready soon.

254
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,929
Okay.

255
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,973
Boss, I'm going to go check the order.

256
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,975
All right.

257
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,895
Saeroyi, spare me a moment.

258
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,982
Wait here.

259
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,280
DANBAM

260
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,448
How's business?

261
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,534
It's going pretty well.

262
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,704
But not as well as when we were
in Itaewon.

263
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,289
It's hard to run a pub in an alley.

264
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,125
I was very surprised.

265
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,003
You were able to relocate
and buy this building.

266
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,714
How did you manage to save so much money?

267
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,883
Thanks to my friend,
who's a competent fund manager.

268
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,803
-I'll introduce you to him next time.
-All right.

269
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,974
Well, you see...

270
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,979
What's the matter?

271
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,734
Well, about the thing we talked about
last time...

272
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,155
Hold on.

273
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,282
Where did Hye-won go?

274
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,201
Hye-won.

275
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,287
Hye-won.

276
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,663
Hye-won?

277
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:47,835
Hye-won!

278
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,422
Hye-won!

279
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,007
Did you guys see Hye-won?

280
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,343
No, we were busy checking this.
Did she leave?

281
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,180
-Geun-soo, go this way with Toni.
-Okay. Hey, Toni.

282
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,807
Yi-seo, you stay here. Let's go this way.

283
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,518
Hye-won!

284
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,896
Hye-won!

285
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,110
Why isn't Saeroyi picking up?

286
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,528
Ma'am.

287
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,408
Me?

288
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,036
I got lost while following a cat.

289
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,288
I didn't bring my phone.

290
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,374
May I please borrow your phone?

291
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,419
Don't call me "Ma'am."

292
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,130
You seem to be around
the same age as my dad.

293
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,383
But I'm not married.

294
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,967
Really?

295
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,096
But you're pretty.

296
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:41,931
Why aren't you married?

297
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,642
Just make your phone call.

298
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,313
Dad, I'm sorry.

299
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,149
I got lost,
so I'm using someone else's phone now.

300
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,193
Here?

301
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,529
I don't agree with that.

302
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,243
Come on. Tell me their names.

303
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,245
-Kim Ji-eun and--
-Hye-won!

304
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,044
-My gosh.
-Dad, I can't breathe.

305
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,714
-Ms. Kang.
-Hey.

306
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,882
Why did you leave without even telling me?

307
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,427
Sorry, Dad. You must've been worried.

308
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,386
Yes, of course!

309
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,097
This lady here helped me.

310
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,519
-Thank you.
-No problem.

311
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,312
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

312
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,732
She's adorable.
I had fun chatting with her.

313
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,860
He's our supplier,
and this is his daughter.

314
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,194
I see.

315
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,072
Were you on your way to meet me?

316
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,575
-Yes, I'd love to check out your pub.
-Okay.

317
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,702
Let's talk there.

318
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,955
Sorry again, Dad.

319
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,086
-Hye-won.
-Yes?

320
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,629
Go with Saeroyi.

321
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,966
I have to make an important phone call.
I'll meet you at the pub.

322
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,764
ITAEWON CHILDREN'S PARK

323
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,057
Who are you?

324
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,980
-Let go, you bastard!
-You punk!

325
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,939
Hey!

326
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,332
Is your dad trained in martial arts?

327
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,627
My dad used to be a cop. He's very strong.

328
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,464
He's so dependable.

329
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,385
He's single too.

330
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,013
What?

331
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,438
What happened?

332
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,781
I only see photos from today.

333
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,868
He probably deletes all the photos daily.

334
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,874
He's keeping track of where you go,
who you meet, and what you do.

335
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,626
Everything you do...

336
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,049
What's wrong? Did you find anything?

337
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,176
No, it's not that.

338
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,097
Anyway, I wonder
who ordered him to do this.

339
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,266
Chairman Jang.

340
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,560
Yes.

341
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,770
He's the only one
who'd do something like this.

342
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,356
This means that
he may know about our partnership.

343
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,284
Right, I should thank you
for all your help earlier.

344
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,703
Gosh, no problem at all.

345
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,247
Your daughter is so smart and brave.
You raised her well.

346
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,751
Thankfully, she doesn't take after me.

347
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,462
But you raised her.

348
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,260
Children follow their parents' footsteps.

349
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,179
She kept bragging about you.

350
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,849
It sounded like you're a great dad.

351
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,776
Hye-won, we should go home.
Say bye to everyone.

352
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,615
See you soon, Ms. Kang and Saeroyi.

353
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,284
-Be a good girl.
-I will.

354
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,745
-Well, take care.
-You too.

355
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,663
Detective Oh.

356
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,460
Weren't you going
to say something earlier?

357
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:41,795
Oh, that...

358
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,925
I'll tell you later. Another time.

359
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,179
I'll be waiting.

360
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,321
It's doing pretty well.

361
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,657
There are a few interesting things.

362
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,492
They took care of the renovation
and inspected

363
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,410
the entire process themselves.

364
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,080
The space is over 40 pyeong,

365
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,500
yet they only spent 25 million won,
including the demolition cost.

366
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,711
It sounds like you've seen the space.

367
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,255
Yes, I have.

368
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,759
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

369
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,428
They opened a live channel
and posted the entire process,

370
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,180
from looking for a store space

371
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,808
to the renovations and the inspections.

372
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,268
It's very popular
among small business owners

373
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,647
and young customers who are foodies.

374
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,818
Let me introduce
the part-timers at DanBam.

375
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,362
The face of DanBam.

376
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,697
Jang Geun-soo!

377
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,532
HANDSOME

378
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,909
I'm Jang Geun-soo, a server.

379
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,829
Hi, Geun-soo. What's your hobby?

380
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,871
-My hobby?
-Yes.

381
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,291
I'm good at spinning soju bottles.

382
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,129
-I see. That's his hobby.
-I'll show you.

383
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:06,964
-Like this.
-Gosh.

384
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,551
Do that first.

385
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,638
Mr. Kim is waiting, sir.

386
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,181
Let him in.

387
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,441
I'll come back another time.

388
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,568
It's okay. What is it?

389
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,490
I make awesome soju bombs.

390
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,618
Then do you make soju bombs for customers?

391
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,413
Yes, of course. That's a given.

392
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:43,375
Everyone, visit DanBam
for the awesome soju bombs.

393
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,918
VISIT DANBAM PUB

394
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,425
Ms. Kang found out
that we've been tailing her.

395
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,932
-I'll be off, then.
-No, stay.

396
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,689
-But she doesn't know that you--
-I'm sure she knows.

397
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,485
Who else would be that interested
in Min-jung?

398
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,944
It doesn't matter.

399
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,656
More importantly, that girl, Jo Yi-seo...

400
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,910
We're trying to figure out
the position and pay scale.

401
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,412
I'll approach her with an offer
when it's finalized.

402
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,456
Good. You must bring her on board.

403
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,710
-Sir.
-She must've won him over.

404
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,803
VISIT DANBAM PUB

405
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,264
If you come to notice me, not my boss,
in that process,

406
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,892
you can give me
this offer again then, sir.

407
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,689
She's interesting.

408
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,692
Pardon me?

409
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,487
She doesn't suit that punk, Park Saeroyi.

410
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,989
She's like me.

411
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,830
-Have you looked into the other stuff?
-Yes, sir.

412
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:07,125
All their ingredients
are supplied by Hyewon Foods.

413
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,337
They use good ingredients.
I've never heard of that company though.

414
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,881
The owner is an ex-cop. Maybe that's why.

415
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,508
Everyone says that he's very thorough.

416
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,134
He's an ex-cop?

417
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,595
He left the police about ten years ago

418
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,889
and started a produce supply business.

419
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,183
The thing is though,
his company is based in Pajin

420
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,143
and mostly deals with businesses
in the area.

421
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,729
But he supplies produce to DanBam,
which is an hour away,

422
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,857
so I think they might have
a personal relationship.

423
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,277
Pajin?

424
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,615
Maybe he knew Mr. Park.

425
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,122
Set up a meeting with him.
I'd like to meet him myself.

426
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,085
What on earth is going on?

427
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,380
Tailing Ms. Kang? And what's
with Jo Yi-seo and the supplier?

428
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,464
You heard everything.

429
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,426
Why would Jangga go to such lengths
to take down that small pub--

430
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,552
Ms. Oh.

431
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,681
Is your opinion necessary?

432
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,726
-Sorry?
-We're mere employees,

433
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,977
so we just need to do

434
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,313
as the chairman says.

435
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,653
What's going on?

436
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,657
Are you two fighting?

437
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,035
I'm off.

438
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,332
What's with her?

439
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,792
It's nothing, sir.

440
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,588
How's Dad? Is he doing all right?

441
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,881
Yes, sir.

442
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,593
Take good care of him.
He's been a little sensitive lately.

443
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,347
If my dad needs something,

444
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,432
you should also let me know.

445
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,105
Sir.

446
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,992
He seems to like Jo Yi-seo,
the young lady who works at DanBam.

447
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,079
This could be your chance
to win the chairman's trust.

448
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,958
Why don't you take charge
and convince her to work at our company?

449
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,550
What did I tell you?

450
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,344
It's hard to do business in the alley.

451
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,388
It's even harder when it's a pub.

452
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,807
The borough office parking lot
closes at 11:00 p.m.

453
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,269
You have no idea how many times
I asked them to always keep it open.

454
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,437
It sounds like a good idea.
Why didn't they do it?

455
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:33,855
That's not it.

456
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,650
You know that footbridge at Noksapyeong
where you can see Namsan?

457
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,819
As you already know,
it has an amazing view.

458
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,404
I suggested that we should

459
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,240
turn it into a tourist spot
and decorate it nicely with an artist,

460
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,325
but they never listened to me.

461
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,538
That sounds nice too.
Why didn't they do it?

462
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,998
Apparently,

463
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,959
no one's ever done
anything like that before.

464
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:58,588
I can give them all sorts of ideas,
but they always just ignore me.

465
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,798
It's useless.

466
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:09,057
DANBAM

467
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,269
It's important to have regulars
when your business is in the alley.

468
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,897
I'm sure it'll get better,
so just hang in there.

469
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,774
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

470
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,528
Baldy.

471
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,114
I guess you've matured enough
to give advice now.

472
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,074
Long time no see.

473
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:27,701
Do you know her?

474
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,121
Yes. Did you borrow money from her?

475
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,373
No, she's our regular.

476
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,584
I'm relieved to hear that.

477
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,587
Always borrow money from the bank.
Otherwise, you'll get in trouble.

478
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,297
What are you saying?

479
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,382
Have you forgotten the past?

480
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,218
My gosh, you still have a temper.

481
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,304
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

482
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,223
-Stay healthy, ma'am.
-Okay, bye.

483
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,185
I'm here to eat.

484
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,731
What's going on? Have you closed already?

485
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,400
No. Toni, please take her to a table.

486
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,070
-Hello.
-My gosh, you startled me.

487
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,031
I guess there aren't any customers.

488
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,491
No.

489
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,160
What did I tell you?
It's a bad place to do business.

490
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,455
You're practically cursing us.

491
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,123
Yi-seo.

492
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,501
What's wrong with this neighborhood?

493
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,256
That rude little brat.

494
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,510
Do you think I'm wrong?

495
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:31,473
Look around you.
All the other places are closed already.

496
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,267
I'll try to revive it.

497
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,604
That's absurd.
How are you going to do that?

498
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,648
The entire neighborhood is dead.

499
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,443
Ma'am, I'll get you some food.

500
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,446
Just sell the place and get out of here.
It's the best you can do.

501
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,990
PARK SAEROYI

502
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,184
MARUDANG RESTAURANT

503
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,815
Thank you.

504
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,234
-Have some juice.
-Thank you.

505
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,535
JOJO'S PLACE

506
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,375
What is he doing?

507
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,586
How would I know?

508
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,590
Why are you here?

509
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:52,220
As you can see, our boss is really busy
doing a bunch of useless stuff.

510
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,805
I'm here to see you.

511
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,807
What?

512
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,643
I heard you met the chairman.

513
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,481
He thinks you're just like him.

514
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,401
He thinks I'm just like him?
What a horrible thing to say.

515
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,446
But I'm not that offended.

516
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,868
Did you say you're working here
because of Saeroyi?

517
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,413
-Yes.
-You say he's the only reason.

518
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,875
But what if he rejects you?

519
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,628
-Because of you?
-Yes.

520
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,380
Then what would happen?

521
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,007
Would that make you quit?

522
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,385
That won't happen.

523
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,765
I've never lost before.

524
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:44,856
Soo-ah.

525
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,405
What are you doing?

526
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,408
What?

527
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,831
Oh, the Vietnamese restaurant
seems to have

528
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,877
an inefficient menu and table arrangement,
so I'm going to help.

529
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,921
Why do you want to help?

530
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,216
-What?
-What's with the sudden charity work?

531
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,926
Hey, what's your problem this time?

532
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,262
I just don't get it.

533
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,264
I want an explanation so I can understand.

534
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,483
I'm doing it survive.

535
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,444
What are you talking about?

536
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,697
Our pub isn't even doing that well.

537
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,532
You should focus on our pub rather than--

538
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,950
What more do we need?

539
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,621
What more can we do to improve DanBam?

540
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,710
Thanks to you,
our marketing strategy is doing well.

541
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,753
And the interior came out great.

542
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,840
What more do we need to improve? The food?

543
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,385
You said everything tastes great.

544
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,596
So what?

545
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,890
Are you trying to befriend the neighbors
and make them become our regulars?

546
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,851
All the businesses
in this alley are dying.

547
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,186
Nothing will improve
just by focusing on our pub.

548
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,815
We need to revitalize the alley.

549
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,367
I really can't believe this.

550
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:21,995
What?

551
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,081
You're a dreamer, an idealist...

552
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,545
We really aren't a great match.

553
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,306
Don't mind her.

554
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,475
She's supposed to do what she's told.

555
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,936
Didn't you tell us we're a team

556
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,481
when you incorporated the business?

557
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,944
What?

558
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,321
It's easy to do as we're told.

559
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,156
But...

560
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,576
is that the kind of team you wanted?

561
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,250
We're mere employees,
so we just need to do

562
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,586
as the chairman says.

563
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,090
Well...

564
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,176
We might be nothing
but ordinary employees.

565
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,512
-Geun-soo...
-But

566
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,349
Yi-seo is different.

567
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,726
She's the manager.

568
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,688
This may be a small corporation,
but she's still a stockholder.

569
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,939
On top of that,

570
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,111
she bet her life on you.

571
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,824
The least you can do
is try to convince her.

572
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,536
Geun-soo, what's with you today?

573
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:49,040
Yi-seo just seems
a little different these days.

574
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,087
She's different with Saeroyi.

575
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,480
Everything Geun-soo said was right.

576
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,400
I didn't know what to say.

577
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,069
By the way,

578
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:19,863
about Geun-soo--

579
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,030
I know.

580
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,450
He's Chairman Jang's second son.

581
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,332
I understand that you don't really care.

582
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,626
But what about him?

583
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,297
I wonder why he's working at DanBam.

584
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,674
I'm not sure.

585
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,138
Maybe he wants to make money.

586
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,143
Then what about Yi-seo?

587
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,647
Why do you think Yi-seo is working there?

588
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,691
What?

589
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,989
I'm sure you need her to succeed.

590
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,619
Why? What are you curious about?

591
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,582
Now, I feel like there are so many reasons

592
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,044
why we can't be together.

593
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,050
What's the matter? Did something happen?

594
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,804
What kind of relationship
do you think this is?

595
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,806
What?

596
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,477
What do you think would've happened to us

597
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,896
if I didn't work at Jangga Co.?

598
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,945
Whether or not you work there,

599
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,865
you're the one who gets to decide
what our relationship is.

600
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,913
You always make me the responsible one.

601
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,665
But you never once confessed how you feel.

602
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,210
I like you.

603
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,385
I told you that when I was in prison.

604
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,306
That was ten years ago.

605
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,183
And the bus stop?

606
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,228
That was pretty recent.

607
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,022
Are you kidding me?

608
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,442
You told me you're going to make me quit.

609
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,652
You call that a confession?

610
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,866
What more do I need to say
to get my point across?

611
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,161
My gosh.

612
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,040
I bet my life on it when I told you that.

613
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,838
Don't feel pressured,
but just keep that in mind.

614
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,173
You can define our relationship

615
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,594
whenever you want.

616
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,806
Because that's who Saeroyi is.

617
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,309
He won't change.

618
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,607
I once said that myself.

619
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,483
What?

620
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,076
You're the biggest fool on earth.

621
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:15,955
Remember what I told you?

622
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,416
I like rich people.

623
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,174
I own a building.

624
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,849
That's not easy, you know.

625
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,104
My gosh.

626
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,824
My gosh, you startled me.

627
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:52,909
What?

628
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,577
What do you want?

629
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,788
I heard you left last night
with that girl.

630
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,581
-Soo-ah?
-Yes.

631
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,125
-Yes.
-What did you guys do?

632
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,295
-We drank.
-Did something happen?

633
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,674
-Like what?
-Are you guys dating?

634
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:12,804
Stop talking nonsense
and just get ready for business.

635
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,056
I'm not talking nonsense.

636
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,018
Don't go out with her.

637
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,604
What?

638
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,773
Why do you care?

639
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,941
I just do.

640
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,360
If you go out with her,

641
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,155
I'm going to quit.

642
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,826
What are you talking about?

643
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,370
Why do you hate her so much?

644
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,538
Do you really not know?

645
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,666
Do you really not know why?

646
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,751
No, I don't.

647
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,172
Just keep it in mind.

648
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,514
What's wrong with her?

649
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:10,194
One, two three, four, and five.

650
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,612
That's ten...

651
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,114
Let's see.

652
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,157
It's the right amount.

653
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,325
Thank you.

654
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,411
Next month,
I'll make sure I pay you on time.

655
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,623
What's going on?

656
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,417
You have customers.

657
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,252
Of course.

658
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,296
The young man who runs DanBam

659
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,174
helped us with our marketing strategy
and a bunch of other stuff.

660
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,176
-That chestnut?
-Yes.

661
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,636
He also helped us fix our menu
and table arrangement.

662
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,180
It's not just us.

663
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:41,100
He's been helping
a lot of people these days.

664
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,732
The restaurant seems to be
doing better than before.

665
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,818
That young man is very polite,
and he knows a lot of things.

666
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,320
He's very admirable.

667
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,907
How interesting.

668
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,327
He reminds me of someone.

669
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,123
Welcome, Mr. Oh.

670
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,171
I came across a dish
that was made with your ingredients.

671
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,382
The ingredients were
high in quality and fresh.

672
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,135
It made me want to buy from you as well.

673
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,471
Thank you for the compliment.

674
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,476
You signed an exclusive distribution deal
with a pub in Itaewon

675
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,687
named DanBam, right?

676
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,689
Yes, that's right.

677
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,693
How would you like

678
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,655
to sign a deal with us?

679
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,705
I'm very grateful to receive
a business offer

680
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,625
from the number one food company in Korea.

681
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,962
But is there going to be a condition?

682
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,422
A condition?

683
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,762
I like that you're straightforward.

684
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,808
As you already know,
our company is very large in size.

685
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:07,687
If you sign a deal with us, you'll be
too busy to work with anyone else.

686
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,650
How about break all the other deals
you've made

687
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:16,696
and sign an exclusive contract
with Jangga Co.?

688
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,867
You mean to break my contract with DanBam?

689
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,911
Yes, that's what you'll have to do.

690
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,330
But I assure you
that it won't be a bad deal.

691
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,018
Are you heading to Itaewon?

692
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,562
I'm on my way there as well.

693
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,564
Do you want a ride?

694
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,316
Why are you going to Itaewon?

695
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,735
Jo Yi-seo, was it?

696
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,237
The manager at DanBam.

697
00:44:58,821 --> 00:44:59,906
I'm going to talk to her.

698
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,575
Anyway, get in.
It's on the way, so I'll drop you off.

699
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,912
Didn't you get my message?

700
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,582
I clearly told you that I don't like you.

701
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,254
My gosh.

702
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,766
Do you know what my dream is?

703
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,646
It's to have you sit
on the passenger seat of my car.

704
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,981
Isn't it such a simple dream?

705
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,403
Where does your confidence come from?

706
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,614
The fact that you're the heir?

707
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,074
Or is it because you're rich?

708
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,410
Am I supposed to thank you
for your attention?

709
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,413
I never...

710
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,085
I never treated you like that.

711
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,461
I clearly told you

712
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,755
why I don't like you.

713
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,008
Yes, you did.

714
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,177
Because of the accident.

715
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,097
But it was literally an accident.

716
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,641
Do you think I hit him with my car
on purpose?

717
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,602
It's true that I hate Saeroyi,
but I would never--

718
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,853
Then what about after that?

719
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,442
What about after the accident?

720
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,573
You didn't call an ambulance.

721
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:27,451
And you let someone else take the blame.

722
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,287
Was that all an accident as well?

723
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,793
You have no idea

724
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,798
how much I hate you.

725
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,802
Soo-ah.

726
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,471
Oh, right.

727
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,061
Remember when you asked me
if I like Saeroyi?

728
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,772
What?

729
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,275
I like him.

730
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,362
So let me tell you once again.

731
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,489
Please do me a favor

732
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,993
and stop hitting on me.

733
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,708
Well then, Mr. Jang. I'll be off now.

734
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,595
Fuck!

735
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,807
PRODUCT SUPPLY AGREEMENT

736
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,565
This is a contract with good terms.

737
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,570
But

738
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,531
I'm afraid I have to turn it down.

739
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,746
Oh, gosh.

740
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,085
I heard you have a connection
with Saeroyi.

741
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,089
Are you being like this because of him?

742
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,884
Yes. I owe him something.

743
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,302
How much is it?

744
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,930
It's not something
I can pay back with money.

745
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:15,392
Let me give you a piece of advice.

746
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:20,064
Business isn't something
you should do emotionally.

747
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,441
You just said that yourself.

748
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,861
Jangga is the biggest
restaurant business in Korea.

749
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,321
I think it is for now.

750
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,949
-Then you should take it.
-But in ten years,

751
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,202
how much do you think

752
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,663
Saeroyi and DanBam

753
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,625
will be growing?

754
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,712
This isn't about loyalty.

755
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,591
It's an investment for the future

756
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,094
to make a profit.

757
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,182
You're young.

758
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,811
Do you have children?

759
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,274
Yes. I have a daughter.

760
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:12,449
You sound like a reckless man
who has nothing to lose.

761
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,829
No good can come from going
against me in this industry.

762
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,833
You should think about your child.

763
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,046
You may leave now.

764
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,299
Call me if you change your mind.

765
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,559
I will get going then.

766
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,405
Children follow their parents' footsteps.

767
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,157
She kept bragging about you.

768
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,492
It sounded like you're a great dad.

769
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,497
Think about my child?

770
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,884
You know what, Chairman Jang?

771
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,681
Children follow their parents' footsteps.

772
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,059
Looking at you,

773
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,395
I can tell why Jang Geun-won
turned out like that.

774
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,983
You better not to provoke me.

775
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,363
I said I owe Saeroyi something.

776
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,365
The debt

777
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,076
has something to do with you too.

778
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,245
What?

779
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:42,206
The hit-and-run accident
of Jang Geun-won from ten years ago.

780
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,626
Unfortunately,

781
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,587
I was the cop in charge of the case.

782
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,801
He left the police about ten years ago

783
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,136
and started a produce supply business.

784
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,193
Is it that you--

785
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:14,822
Back then,
I conducted a shameful investigation.

786
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,617
My daughter will grow up
looking at my pathetic footstep.

787
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,621
One pathetic footstep is enough.

788
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,377
Because of my daughter,

789
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,922
I can't be any more pathetic than this.

790
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,375
Gosh.

791
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,132
You look like an old lady sometimes.

792
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,635
I want to be alone.

793
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,722
What are you thinking about?

794
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:26,352
I'm not sure what I'm doing now.

795
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,563
I know how you feel.

796
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,982
But what Saeroyi said.

797
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,568
Don't you think it's all correct?

798
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,365
Did you catch idealism from him?

799
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,245
I didn't do enough research.

800
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,081
I'm sorry, sir.

801
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,042
What about Jo Yi-seo?

802
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,461
How long do I have to wait?

803
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:57,216
Mr. Jang is going to give her
a job offer today.

804
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:01,970
Geun-won?

805
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,055
Yes.

806
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,561
I'm back.

807
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,313
Geun-soo.

808
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,192
Hey.

809
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:18,487
You're here right on time.

810
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:20,989
Hi.

811
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,287
What are you doing here?

812
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,249
I'm not here to see you.

813
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,419
You know me, right?

814
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,172
I'm Jang Geun-won.

815
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,966
JANGGA CO. JANG GEUN-WON

816
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,510
Can I talk to you for a moment?

817
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,765
Boss.

818
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,393
I'll go talk to him for a bit.

819
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,771
Sure.

820
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,984
There's a cafe down the hill.
Let's go there.

821
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:01,321
Look at her. She's so cool.

822
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,241
I like that.

823
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:05,701
Wait.

824
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,456
Why do you want to talk to Yi-seo?

825
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,460
I guess you've lost your touch.

826
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,922
Whatever it is,

827
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,508
don't mess with Yi-seo.

828
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,554
Have you lost your mind?

829
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:30,809
Look at you.

830
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,270
Let go of it.

831
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,441
Hey.

832
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:43,155
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

833
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:48,160
you should take over Jangga Co.

834
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,961
You better not provoke me.

835
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,467
I might

836
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,887
take over your position.

837
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:13,769
You rascal.

838
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,648
Oh, right.

839
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,859
Was her name Jo Yi-seo?

840
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,612
I'm not messing with her.

841
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,781
I'm here to give her a job offer.

842
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,661
Between this tiny pub and Jangga Co.?

843
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,871
She has no reason to hesitate.

844
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,752
Damn it.

845
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,754
What the hell is he talking about?

846
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,172
A job offer?

847
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,675
Does that mean he will take Yi-seo?

848
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,717
Boss.

849
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,594
Don't make a fuss.

850
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,514
What are you going to do?

851
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,182
It's Yi-seo's life.

852
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,850
It's her decision.

853
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,894
We should just wait and see.

854
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,531
MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL

855
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,743
You are just a 20-year-old kid
who didn't even go to college.

856
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:14,538
You can't get an exceptional offer
like this elsewhere

857
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,082
There's nothing to think about.

858
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,001
When will you join us?

859
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,718
JANGGA CO. JANG GEUN-WON

860
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,556
I'm sure.

861
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,766
If he offers a better salary,

862
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,643
she will definitely go there.

863
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,020
I don't know.

864
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,147
If it was about money,
she wouldn't have joined DanBam

865
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,898
in the first place.

866
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:45,193
Exactly. Koreans are loyal and faithful.

867
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,364
She hasn't even worked here for long.

868
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,742
Loyal and faithful, my foot.

869
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,122
I'm going to quit.

870
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,875
Are you nervous?

871
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,921
We really aren't a great match.

872
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,053
Yes.

873
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:13,472
Do you need Yi-seo

874
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,099
because she's competent?

875
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,272
I'm just wondering how you feel.

876
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,654
What Yi-seo means to you.

877
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,573
Is she just an employee?

878
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,742
Or

879
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,037
do you have feelings for her?

880
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,164
What is he talking about?

881
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,041
What?

882
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,480
That is quite an offer.

883
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,273
Gosh.

884
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,026
It's not just good.

885
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,530
You may be too young to see it.

886
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,990
But this is a great opportunity.

887
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,324
Director Jang.

888
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,536
I invested some money in the pub,

889
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,080
so I'm making quite a lot for my age.

890
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,543
I guess I make more
than the salary you just offered.

891
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,503
It's Jangga Co. we're talking about.

892
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:29,089
If you can't offer me more money
than a tiny pub like that,

893
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,217
I will have to think about it.

894
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,181
I see. How much do you make?

895
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,185
Considering the sales,
I guess I make about 100 million won.

896
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,271
Is it 100 million won?

897
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,107
It's just based on current sales.

898
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,652
I'm confident I can make DanBam bigger.

899
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,989
I might be tempted

900
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,782
-if you offer 200 million won.
-200 million?

901
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,910
Oh, right. I guess

902
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:03,749
it's not something you can decide.

903
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,168
Is it 200 million won?

904
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,965
Let's add 50 million won.

905
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,760
I'll make it 250 million won.

906
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,264
What? 250 million...

907
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,934
Jangga Co. is unbelievable.

908
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:27,230
Saeroyi's pub will go down after all.

909
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,440
Hey.

910
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:33,195
Your life's path may change
according to the connection you choose.

911
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,654
There's no reason to hesitate.

912
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:38,825
Actually I was fed up with Saeroyi
being so stubborn and inflexible.

913
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,746
Without my shares in the pub,
I would've quit already.

914
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,539
Now we are talking.

915
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:45,999
He's just an immature kid.

916
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,501
I know.

917
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:51,171
He just tries to mess with Chairman Jang
and you forgetting himself.

918
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,424
You must have your authority.

919
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:59,346
You're planning to smash DanBam, right?

920
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,183
You're quite quick-witted.

921
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,018
You're worth the money.

922
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,353
Thank you.

923
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,231
Let me save your number.

924
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,320
So when should I start working?

925
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,948
You can do it tomorrow or a week later.

926
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,741
Whatever works for you.

927
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,038
Oh, right.

928
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,040
I have a question.

929
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:31,753
About Park Saeroyi.
Why is that punk trying to mess with you?

930
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,589
What?

931
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,009
Something happened before.

932
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,720
What happened?

933
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,641
It's no big deal. You don't have to know.

934
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,186
Oh, right.

935
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,606
I guess it's because of the thing
you said in front of a police station.

936
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,484
I heard Park Saeroyi's dad

937
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,903
died because of you.

938
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,998
If that's true,

939
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,544
you are unbelievable.

940
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,715
What?

941
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,843
It means you're above the law.

942
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,807
That's amazing.

943
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,352
Oh, well...

944
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:33,607
Gosh, I'm sorry.

945
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:37,235
I can't really discern right from wrong.

946
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,655
Did I offend you?

947
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:46,912
No. That's just how people live.

948
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:51,499
The law is
all about disciplining the poor.

949
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:54,544
The law doesn't apply to those who rule.

950
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:59,382
So? Would you please
tell me about it in detail?

951
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:04,846
It's nothing. It was an accident.

952
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:08,058
I hit his dad with a car,

953
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,644
and he died instantly.

954
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,855
But someone else ended up in jail.
End of the story.

955
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:20,737
I wonder how Saeroyi found it out though.

956
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,491
I guess he hasn't learned his lesson.
He's still trying to get back at me.

957
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:28,828
But what can livestock do?
Don't you think so?

958
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,038
There's nothing.

959
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,416
What can he do?

960
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,257
What is this scar?

961
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:44,719
I got hurt when I worked
on the deep-sea fishing vessel.

962
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,974
And what about this one?

963
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,268
When I did manual labor.

964
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:02,404
You must've had a hard time all alone.

965
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,246
I decided to kill

966
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,082
those who mess with this guy.

967
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,377
This is so sweet.

968
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:24,968
Enough.

969
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,141
I want you to stop now.

970
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:33,393
What?

971
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,353
Stop what?

972
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:41,401
RECORDING

973
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,111
Let me see.

974
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,072
Was it around here?

975
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,372
The law is
all about disciplining the poor.

976
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:57,459
The law doesn't apply to those who rule.

977
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:01,546
So? Would you please
tell me about it in detail?

978
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,423
It's nothing.

979
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:04,883
It was an accident.

980
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:08,303
I hit his dad with a car,

981
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,638
and he died instantly.

982
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:14,059
But someone else ended up in jail.
End of the story.

983
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,897
What are you doing?

984
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,068
I've never seen

985
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,279
a dumbhead like you my whole life.

986
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,781
Damn it.

987
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,207
I...

988
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,002
love my boss like crazy.

989
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:44,672
But the problem is

990
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:51,721
that his head is full of the bastards
from that damn Jangga Co.

991
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,352
I'm so jealous.

992
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:05,902
You damn sons of bitches.

993
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,291
So

994
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,587
I'm going to crush you all.

995
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,810
SPECIAL THANKS TO HONG SEOK-CHEON

996
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:56,911
Your dad is my enemy.

997
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,288
To make him pay for his sins...

998
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,123
And in order to do that, I'll do anything.

999
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,958
I'm Jo Yi-seo, the manager of DanBam.

1000
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,168
This is important.

1001
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,794
I'm afraid we should give up.

1002
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:07,797
That's ridiculous. This fight will be ours
to win. So why would we give up?

1003
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,132
You can prove his innocence?

1004
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,425
I think we have a chance here.

1005
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,802
But I think
you need to have your son dismissed.

1006
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:16,639
Don't you dare tell me
to abandon my family ever again.

1007
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,808
Now is the right time
to dismiss the chairman.

1008
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,810
A proposal to dismiss the chairman?
Are you crazy?

1009
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,479
I will make you regret this.

1010
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,814
I will offer my life

1011
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,649
to make the same promise.

1012
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:28,818
It's still...

1013
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,070
bitter.

1014
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,037
