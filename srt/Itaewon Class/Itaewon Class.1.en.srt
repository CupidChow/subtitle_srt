ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

PATIENT CHART

4
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,193
What do you usually think about
before you sleep?

5
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,530
It's going to sound a little weird.

6
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,448
EPISODE 1

7
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,950
You might think I'm crazy.

8
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,373
I hope the world

9
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,377
comes to an end.

10
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,380
Are you going through something bad?

11
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,302
Well, not really.

12
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,888
Shall I say life feels like such a chore?

13
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,143
I actually sound crazy.

14
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,147
You probably think it's ridiculous
that such a young girl is saying this.

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,816
Everyone feels that way about life
from time to time.

16
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,986
When do you feel that way the most?

17
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,658
I always feel that way.

18
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,827
Life is repetitive, you know.

19
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,329
And it's predictable.

20
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,457
You study hard
to get into a good university.

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,502
Then when you're older, you must work hard
to meet a nice guy and get married.

22
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,089
All the efforts that you have to make...

23
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:17,721
Frankly, everyone knows
how to become successful.

24
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,806
"How to become successful"?

25
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,934
-How do you do it?
-You just need to

26
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,229
work hard, like crazy.

27
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,399
But it feels like such a chore.

28
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:34,196
Is there anything that gives you joy?
Something you like, for example.

29
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,782
I've actually told my boss

30
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,618
what I just told you.

31
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,287
Oh, your boss who you always talk about.

32
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,955
What did your boss say?

33
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,124
If it feels that much like a chore,

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,380
just die.

35
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,435
That made me realize
that I'm acting like a moody teenager.

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,689
Your boss sounds a little irresponsible.

37
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,401
That's what you thought
when he told you to just die?

38
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,239
Well...
That's how counseling should be done.

39
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:18,782
Sorry?

40
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,036
An open, candid conversation over a drink.

41
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,413
You're leaving already?

42
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,123
I have to work.

43
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,667
You work so hard. I'll come by sometime.

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,628
Yes, you have to.
I'll give you lots of freebies.

45
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,713
DISCOUNT COUPON

46
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,972
The capital of Korea, Seoul.

47
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,559
In the center of it,
there's a district called Yongsan.

48
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,979
And the hottest buzzword,

49
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,439
Itaewon.

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,191
The average rent premium,
over 200 million won.

51
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,609
The third highest in Seoul.

52
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,945
On this small street,

53
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,699
you can see the world.

54
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,994
The story about those of us

55
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,829
on this street,

56
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,373
living our lives with our own values.

57
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,177
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,304
One day,
at the beginning of the semester...

59
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,056
JANGSEUNG HIGH SCHOOL

60
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,392
Hey, hold it up. Hold it properly!

61
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,020
I'll smack you guys
for each drop that spills.

62
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,148
You guys always skip
the after-school study hours!

63
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,650
I heard it's not obligatory.

64
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,569
PARK SAEROYI

65
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,987
Give me a break.

66
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,405
You don't have such freedom!

67
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,575
You'd all better step up your game.

68
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,161
Our class GPA is the lowest!

69
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,245
What?

70
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,916
You can't focus because of these punks?
Let these guys teach you a lesson.

71
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,168
Do you know how they will turn out?

72
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,254
They'll just mooch off their parents
like leeches.

73
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,131
They'll become useless scumbags, okay?

74
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,261
This boy says that he sometimes hears
a bleep inside his head.

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,851
Gosh!

76
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,270
What the heck?

77
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,027
Hey, is this your way
of rebelling against me?

78
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,113
-What a lunatic.
-I'm sorry.

79
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,490
-What's he doing?
-What?

80
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,203
-Shall I go fill it up again?
-What?

81
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,083
What are you looking at? You punks.

82
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,919
Hey, you'd better watch out.

83
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,796
Gosh, this nutjob...

84
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,881
He got scolded every single day

85
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,551
but never attended
any of the after-school study hours.

86
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,304
He acted like a lunatic from time to time,

87
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,223
but he was a disciplined student.

88
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,934
He never had a friend
throughout high school.

89
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,228
But for some reason,
he never seemed lonely.

90
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,485
What are you doing? Go.

91
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,952
Without even realizing it,
I had developed a crush on him.

92
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,163
Hey, I'm hungry.

93
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,710
"The boy is transferring to another school
next week.

94
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,337
I'm sad.

95
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,592
Shall I tell him how I feel or not?
I'm torn."

96
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,470
It was a cute story from a girl
who has a crush on her classmate.

97
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,141
I'm not sure
what would be the right choice to make,

98
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,769
but your inner compass usually tells you
what it is that you want to do.

99
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,525
Just like the boy you like,

100
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,987
try to focus on what your heart wants.

101
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,037
She's giving it to him.

102
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,874
She's had a crush on him for three years.
Will her love come true today?

103
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,833
Let's see!

104
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:00,962
Saeroyi.

105
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,300
I heard you're transferring
to another school.

106
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,761
Yes.

107
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,732
The exam for the Police University
is tomorrow, right?

108
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,319
Good luck.

109
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,950
TO SAEROYI

110
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,707
Let's go.

111
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,714
What happened? Why did he just walk away?

112
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,549
Why didn't he take the chocolate?

113
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,471
He said he doesn't like sweets.

114
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,348
LEE JIN-HUI, CHOI GA-YEONG

115
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,393
I've always known it,
but he's actually crazy.

116
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,437
I know. I mean, can't he just accept it?
He's leaving anyway.

117
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,273
He always does whatever the hell he wants.

118
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,651
That's why

119
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,486
I fell for him.

120
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,911
PAJIN CITY

121
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,428
PAJIN STATION

122
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,655
Hey.

123
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,490
Wait.

124
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,701
Spare some change?

125
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,038
Gosh!

126
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,540
Are you all right?

127
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,959
I'll help you up.

128
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,130
Excuse me.

129
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,048
Hey!

130
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,426
Wait.

131
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,805
You're nuts. Walking away
after pushing someone.

132
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,640
He grabbed me, so I shook him off.

133
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,394
Go apologize to him.

134
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,937
He could've gotten hurt.

135
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,356
OH SOO-AH

136
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,276
Are you proud to do a good deed?

137
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,153
What?

138
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,530
Does it make you feel like
you're a good person?

139
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,492
So annoying.

140
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,086
-Seventeen.
-One.

141
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,088
NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY
PHYSICAL TEST

142
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,644
What? Didn't he get a perfect score
on the strength training?

143
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,146
He can't really run though.

144
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,108
Yes, I see that.
It looks like he has an injury.

145
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,903
Do you know this?

146
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,571
Do you?

147
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,115
Know what?

148
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,576
You won't pass if you get one point
in anything in the physical evaluation.

149
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,620
You hurt your leg.

150
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,582
It doesn't look like either of us
will pass, so just give up.

151
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,335
I'll be fine.

152
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,297
Hey, wait! Jeez!

153
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,009
Look at him.

154
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,179
Gosh, he's fierce.

155
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,570
Mr. Park, congratulations
on transferring to the HQ.

156
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,780
My gosh, Ms. Kang.

157
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,701
-It's been a while.
-Gosh, you're at it again.

158
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,203
You're hurting my feelings here.

159
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,205
Just treat me like you used to.

160
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,457
All right. It's good to see you.

161
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,128
I heard you're transferring to Pajin City.
Did the move go well?

162
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,672
I haven't moved.
I'll do it on the weekend.

163
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,340
What about Saeroyi?

164
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,759
He'll transfer to Gwangjin High.

165
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,305
Gwangjin High? Geun-won goes there, too.

166
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,391
-The chairman's son?
-Yes.

167
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,311
-What year is Saeroyi in?
-He's a senior.

168
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,564
-Then they're the same age.
-Really?

169
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,359
That little boy is already
a high school senior?

170
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,572
He's taking the physical test
for the National Police University today.

171
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,782
Even I'm nervous.

172
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,705
You know, the orphanage.
The one that the company sponsors.

173
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,917
Gaenari Orphanage? What about it?
I'm in charge of it.

174
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,795
We've decided
to pull sponsorship altogether.

175
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,340
What do you mean?

176
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,718
Jangga is the only one
that provides them with meals.

177
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,262
Who's going to feed the kids
if we pull sponsorship?

178
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,265
Remember the documentary
about the elderly that aired recently?

179
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,267
Nursing homes are the thing now.

180
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,186
Are we just after media attention?

181
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,355
I told you. Business is all about people.

182
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,026
Who is it?
Who made such a foolish decision?

183
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,196
The chairman.

184
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,036
But what he's thinking is obvious,
you know.

185
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,546
Shall I rebel against him
if it bothers you that much?

186
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,257
Forget it, Ms. Kang.

187
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,302
We have no choice.
It's unnecessary to get on his wrong side.

188
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,180
Like you said, it's a business after all.

189
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,073
TEST IDENTIFICATION SLIP
PARK SAEROYI

190
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,367
TEN POINTS, TEN POINTS
TEN POINTS, TEN POINTS

191
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,997
Is your leg okay?

192
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,000
I passed the test, you know.
It's totally fine.

193
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,295
Aren't you sad about leaving your friends?

194
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,588
No, it's okay. I have no friends.

195
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,218
Right, I heard the chairman's son
goes to the school you're transferring to.

196
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,469
He's the same age as you.

197
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,514
I hope you guys are in the same class.

198
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,433
What's his name?

199
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,184
Jang Geun-won.

200
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,856
-Do I have to get along with him?
-If you guys click.

201
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,402
He's the chairman's son.
I guess I have to get along with him.

202
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,323
Goodness.
As if you care about things like that.

203
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,992
Get along with your classmates.

204
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,495
Reading over your school records
hurt my feelings a little.

205
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,001
Because I'm "socially inept"?

206
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,169
That's right.

207
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,213
Even to me,
you seem a little socially awkward.

208
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,510
Don't be so hardheaded.
It'll only make your life more difficult.

209
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,598
What? You said our family motto is,
"Never compromise your principles."

210
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,974
What do you want me to do?

211
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,894
I'm not sure.

212
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,442
By the way, where are we going?

213
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,862
PAJIN GAENARI ORPHANAGE

214
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,119
I'll give you yummy snacks.

215
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,247
-Here.
-Thank you.

216
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,166
-You should share it.
-Thank you.

217
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,752
This is so random.

218
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,545
Why bring me here out of the blue?

219
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,506
Why not?

220
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,634
You said we were going
to finish packing.

221
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,469
Come on, seriously.

222
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,721
We can pack anytime.

223
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,473
Hey, go hang those.

224
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,517
-Okay.
-Mr. Park!

225
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,228
Mr. Park.

226
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,773
Hi, Soo-ah.
You're getting prettier by the day.

227
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,694
What?

228
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,906
Mr. Park, is he your son?

229
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,990
Yes.

230
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,410
He is. Say hi.

231
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,869
I'll go hang clean laundry.

232
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,080
Her name is--
What's with him?

233
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,142
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,313
I heard from the director.

235
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,524
It's not your fault though.

236
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,860
You have to listen to your boss.

237
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,113
But now that I live close by,

238
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,365
I'll visit often to cook for you.

239
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,450
Really?

240
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,830
I was worried about not being able to eat
your food again, not the sponsorship.

241
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,791
Thank you.

242
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,293
You don't need to thank me.

243
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,045
I'm grateful
you've grown into a good girl.

244
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,262
By the way,
your son is very different from you.

245
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,766
He's kind of cold and shy, isn't he?

246
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm not talking about that.
He's pretty good-looking.

247
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,773
Really? I think he got that from me.

248
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,162
Hey.

249
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,291
You're transferring to Gwangjin High?

250
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,335
I go there, too.

251
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,212
Which class?

252
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,805
I'm trying to befriend you.
Can't you cooperate?

253
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,516
Why do you want to befriend me?

254
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,684
Because you're his son.

255
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,480
-Are you and my dad close?
-Yes.

256
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,690
Has it been about five years?

257
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,609
He works at Jangga Co., you know?

258
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,946
The company sponsors our orphanage,
and he's in charge of it.

259
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,704
Why is this still so wet?

260
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,541
Gosh, you really are socially inept.

261
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,878
Is it because of that incident?

262
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,880
You were so annoying.

263
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,718
Is it annoying to help those
in need of help?

264
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,555
How is it different
from my dad helping you?

265
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,768
Right, I take back what I said.

266
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,646
I guess we can't be friends.

267
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,029
Hey, you brought this.

268
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,323
You like doing good deeds.

269
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,784
Hang them all by yourself.

270
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,952
That little...

271
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,878
Take good care of yourself.

272
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,047
-You, too.
-Will do.

273
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,633
Hey!

274
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,885
Hey! Come out and say bye.

275
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,350
Try to understand. He's not that social.

276
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,312
I can see that.
Maybe you coddled him too much.

277
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,691
Bye. Drive safely.

278
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,193
Call me if anything happens.
I'll be off, then.

279
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,639
Food is ready.

280
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:02,975
This looks so good.

281
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,186
Thanks, son.

282
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,104
Enjoy.

283
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,983
Hey, this is your first day
at your new school.

284
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,569
I'm worried because you haven't bought
your uniform yet.

285
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,740
Shall I make some time in the morning
and pick it up?

286
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,034
No, it's your first day at the HQ.

287
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,827
I'll just wear this today.

288
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,955
-Sure, if you're okay with that.
-Yes.

289
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:33,547
Your cooking skills are getting better
by the day. This is delicious.

290
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,508
I guess I got that from you.

291
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,056
You need to season this again.
It's not edible.

292
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,643
I made it bland on purpose.

293
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,353
It's too bland.

294
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,799
-Geun-won.
-Get in. I'll give you a ride.

295
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,801
The bus will be here soon.

296
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,553
What for?
Enjoy the comfortable ride.

297
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,597
I'll be uncomfortable.

298
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,687
Let's go.

299
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,435
GWANGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

300
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,316
Be quiet.

301
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,237
Attention, everyone.

302
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,989
We have a new student.

303
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,658
You won't have time to make friends
since you're seniors.

304
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,368
But don't be mean to him.

305
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,454
Get along together
until you graduate, okay?

306
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,039
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

307
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,916
You should introduce yourself.

308
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,251
Oh, okay.

309
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,135
Hello, my name is Park Saeroyi.
Nice to meet you.

310
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,386
-Gosh.
-Come on.

311
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,306
Tell us what you want to become
and what your hobby is.

312
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,683
Oh, right.

313
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,064
I want to become

314
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,857
a police officer.

315
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,736
And I enjoy listening to music

316
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,697
and running.

317
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,200
Okay, that's it.
Give him a round of applause.

318
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,079
You can sit...

319
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,706
There's an empty seat.

320
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,378
You can sit there.

321
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,465
You guys can study while I go
to the teachers' room. Don't chat.

322
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,092
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

323
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,210
Come on, you loser.

324
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,882
Are you crazy? My gosh, seriously.

325
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:05,968
-My gosh.
-I'm sorry.

326
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:10,097
Don't you know that I hate plain milk?

327
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,308
Tell me.

328
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,271
The snack bar was out of strawberry milk.
I'm sorry.

329
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,568
My gosh, you little loser.
Let me look at you.

330
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,279
Hey.

331
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,449
If the snack bar was
out of strawberry milk,

332
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:31,243
you could've bought one
at the supermarket.

333
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,912
Hey, look.

334
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,705
Look at me.

335
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,375
Look at how handsome you look.
Let me take a photo.

336
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,336
-Forget it.
-Stand straight.

337
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,837
What are you going to do?

338
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,175
-It's making me feel uncomfortable.
-Smile.

339
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,177
You should know when not to interfere.

340
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,180
Don't you know who he is?
He's Jang Geun-won.

341
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,682
He's your dad's boss' son.

342
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,476
My gosh, turn left.

343
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,311
Don't you know which way is left?

344
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,272
One, two, three.

345
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,732
-So?
-Say, "cheese."

346
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,109
What do you mean?

347
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,445
He's the successor of Jangga Co.

348
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,823
If you get on his bad side,
it won't do your dad any good.

349
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,408
Let me take a photo.

350
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,452
That's your reason?

351
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,413
What?

352
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,708
-Will you smile already?
-Hey.

353
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,836
Open your eyes, you punk. Open--

354
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,422
That's enough.

355
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,430
Just because you're rich
doesn't mean you can be an asshole.

356
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,399
"Asshole"?

357
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,822
He must be crazy.

358
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:52,783
My gosh.

359
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,744
He's a real hero, isn't he?

360
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,163
Don't you agree?

361
00:24:58,539 --> 00:24:59,415
Hey.

362
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,086
Yes?

363
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,338
What?

364
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,348
You look like you have a temper.
You must be a pretty good fighter.

365
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,726
-Am I correct?
-Stop it.

366
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,356
Do you want to know the school rule?

367
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,948
-What's going on?
-My gosh.

368
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:34,992
The teacher's here.

369
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,411
Hey, loser.

370
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,290
Let's carry on a bit later.

371
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,334
LEE HO-JIN

372
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,005
Sir, don't you see this?

373
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,507
What? Well...

374
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,803
That's enough messing around.
Get ready for class.

375
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,221
Yes, sir.

376
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,481
Do what the teacher says.

377
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,149
Do you get it now?

378
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,613
The school rule.

379
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,075
Jang Geun-won

380
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,659
is the law around here.

381
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,768
You're crazy.

382
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,394
Geun-won!

383
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,063
Geun-won.

384
00:26:55,781 --> 00:27:00,327
Most of the stew made by Jangga Co.
are seasoned

385
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,122
with this special sauce.
Have a taste of it.

386
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:07,709
How does it taste?

387
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:11,338
The spiciness is just the right amount,
and it's very savory, right?

388
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:15,175
-Yes, it's delicious.
-It's very savory.

389
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,763
This sauce played a great role
in the development of our company.

390
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,725
The chairman came up
with the recipe himself.

391
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,228
-He made it himself?
-Impressive, right?

392
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,647
I like the color.

393
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,025
My goodness. Long time no see, Mr. Kim.

394
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,736
You need to come outside for a bit.

395
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,738
What?

396
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,869
My gosh. This is what you do
on your first day of school?

397
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:47,207
How dare you beat up a friend
in front of a teacher?

398
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,085
Are you a gangster?

399
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,215
Geun-won, are you okay?

400
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,177
Do I look okay to you?

401
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,055
-He broke my nose.
-I'm really sorry about what happened.

402
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,142
I shouldn't have accepted that punk.

403
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,993
-Sir, you're here.
-Dad.

404
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,997
I'm sorry about all this.

405
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,082
Get up, you punk.

406
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,069
Mr. Park.

407
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,821
I heard he's your son.

408
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,866
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.

409
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,369
What?

410
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,496
He's your son?

411
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,999
My dad's employee's son
had the guts to hit me?

412
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,876
Behave yourself in front of the adults.

413
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,129
I'm...

414
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,256
I'm sorry.

415
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,676
I'm sorry.
My son was very rude.

416
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,012
No, it's okay, sir.

417
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,852
Your name is Saeroyi?

418
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,817
-Principal.
-Yes, sir?

419
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,362
What's going to happen to him?

420
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,950
We'll follow the school rules
and have him expelled.

421
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:49,538
And the police will help you
come to a settlement.

422
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,082
The police doesn't need
to get involved in this.

423
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,042
Mr. Park and I

424
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,255
have known each other for a long time,
so settling won't be an issue.

425
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,302
But

426
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,055
school rules are different.

427
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,892
What do you say?

428
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,229
-Pardon?
-Will he be able to stay in school

429
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,316
if we decide to forgive him?

430
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,696
Yes, of course. If you forgive him,

431
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,700
we'll give him a good scolding
and make sure this never happens again.

432
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,578
Okay.

433
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,205
Let's not cause a fuss.

434
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,710
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

435
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,464
That's enough.
You're an important member of the company.

436
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,591
Thank you, sir.

437
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,802
I'll make sure this never happens again.

438
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,060
But...

439
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,563
Saeroyi.

440
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:02,569
It's important that you know
how to apologize for your mistakes.

441
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,616
I want you to kneel before my son
and apologize for what you did.

442
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,452
That's how we'll settle this.

443
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,752
But sir, that's...

444
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,045
Mr. Park.

445
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,465
My eldest son got beaten up.

446
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,968
It makes me feel very uneasy
to be in this situation.

447
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,764
So I'm offering a solution
that will enable me to tolerate this.

448
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,475
We need to wrap this up anyway.

449
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,939
What do you think,

450
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:40,857
Saeroyi?

451
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,665
If you do something wrong,

452
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,293
it's only right that you get punished.

453
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,963
That's what my dad taught me.

454
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,882
That's right.

455
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,553
Mr. Park, you're a great father.
You taught him well.

456
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,433
But my dad

457
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,477
also taught me

458
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,897
that one must stick to their beliefs.

459
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,699
I saw one of my classmates get bullied.

460
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,869
And the teacher condoned that.

461
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,621
I never bullied anyone, you jerk.

462
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,832
It made me feel uneasy,
so I tried to stop him.

463
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,255
But he didn't listen, so I hit him.

464
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,137
I shouldn't have hit him
in front of the teacher no matte r what.

465
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,103
I deserve to get punished
for what I did wrong.

466
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,813
Saeroyi...

467
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,523
But...

468
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,069
I can't apologize to Geun-won.

469
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,116
Because

470
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,869
I don't feel sorry at all.

471
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:28,340
So you refuse to get on your knees
even if you could get expelled?

472
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,925
I'm doing what I think is right.

473
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,053
That's what my dad taught me.

474
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,974
And I wish to continue living like that.

475
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,657
How unfortunate.

476
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,539
You leave me with no choice.

477
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,919
Mr. Park, what do you think?

478
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,297
Why are you so quiet?

479
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,056
He's still just a child
who doesn't know the ways of the world.

480
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,852
It's hard to believe that he's my son.

481
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,572
I'm amazed by him.

482
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,127
He's doing what he thinks is right

483
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,337
and is willing to be responsible.

484
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,549
So...

485
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:55,969
So I have

486
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,889
nothing more to say to you, sir.

487
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,188
You're being a fool.

488
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,525
How are you going to keep
working at the company

489
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,778
now that things are awkward between us?

490
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,532
-Wait. This is my--
-I'll resign, sir.

491
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,409
Dad.

492
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,047
Okay then.

493
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,673
You do that.

494
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,220
Thank you so much

495
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,307
for everything, sir.

496
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,413
Enjoy.

497
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,127
Whatever the reason,

498
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,755
violence can never be justified.

499
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:19,302
You did something you shouldn't have done,
and you got punished for that.

500
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,889
What about you, Dad?

501
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,853
You did nothing wrong,
so why are you resigning?

502
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:32,982
Just like your beliefs,

503
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,195
I also have my own beliefs as a father.

504
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,117
Can you drink?

505
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,247
I'm a student. I shouldn't drink.

506
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,708
Not anymore.

507
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,051
Pour me a glass.

508
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,433
Hold the bottle with your right hand,
and cover the label.

509
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,103
Lightly support it with your left hand.
Good.

510
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,235
Don't fill up the entire glass.
Just a little more than half.

511
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,820
Okay, that's good.

512
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,116
Okay then. Let's have a drink.

513
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,749
Turn your head slightly to the side
when you drink.

514
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:32,751
Yes, that's right.

515
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,178
How does it taste?

516
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,641
It's sweet.

517
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,269
My goodness.

518
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,317
That means you had
a very impressive day today.

519
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,293
I know I'm not a student anymore.

520
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,129
But I'm still a minor.
Are you allowed to teach me this?

521
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,174
Dads are supposed to teach their sons
how to drink.

522
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,933
It's sweet for me too.

523
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,917
I'm really sorry.

524
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,801
This will all just be a memory
once time passes by.

525
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,345
You can take the GED

526
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,722
to replace your diploma.

527
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,100
And I have enough money

528
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,728
to start a small restaurant of my own.

529
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,817
But that's not what's important.

530
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,822
I know I always told you
to stick to your beliefs.

531
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,867
But I failed to do that myself.

532
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,163
Unlike myself,

533
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,041
I wanted you to be confident.

534
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,171
And today, I could see

535
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,594
you were already living like that.

536
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,602
You have no idea how proud I was.

537
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,776
I want you to keep
living like that, my son.

538
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,867
-Hey, look!
-What is it?

539
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,538
Geun-won got a car
after he got his driver's license.

540
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,668
I can't believe he drove it here.
But I bet the teacher won't scold him.

541
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,842
2006 GWANGJIN UNIVERSITY
ROLLING ADMISSION FOR FRESHMAN STUDENTS

542
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,804
The rolling admission exam
for Gwangjin University is next week.

543
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:15,932
Did you study hard?

544
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,601
Yes, I guess.

545
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,654
ANNOUNCEMENT

546
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:30,655
Aren't you coming?

547
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,408
Right. Let's go.

548
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,164
PARK SAEROYI, CLASS 3-1, EXPELLED

549
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,256
Isn't it beautiful?

550
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,011
Yes, it's pretty.

551
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,723
You have good taste.
This is a limited edition.

552
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,268
The license plate is also amazing.
It's 7777.

553
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,313
It's really hard to get this number,
but the dealer helped me get it.

554
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,359
-That's great.
-Are you on your way home?

555
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,861
Hop in. I'll give you a ride.

556
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,989
-Maybe next time.
-What's with the cold shoulder?

557
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,372
Is something bothering you?

558
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:23,583
You think?

559
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:25,376
Oh, right.

560
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,880
I heard my dad's company stopped
sponsoring the orphanage.

561
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,258
Don't worry about it.
I'll ask my dad to change his mind.

562
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,307
That's not what this is about.
The kids won't starve because of that.

563
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,908
That will be 3,000 won.
Do you have a discount or point card?

564
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,950
No.

565
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,412
Thank you. Goodbye.

566
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,543
Mr. Park.

567
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,630
What do you plan to do?

568
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,049
What? What do you mean?

569
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,468
I heard you got fired.

570
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,804
I didn't get fired. I quit.

571
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:20,973
What's the difference?

572
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,434
My gosh, stop worrying

573
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,478
and just focus on
getting into a university.

574
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,065
-By the way, did you pay for my tuition?
-What?

575
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,401
The orphanage director told me
that you paid for my tuition.

576
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,238
You're starting to nag again.

577
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:36,823
Let me eat.

578
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:40,076
My gosh, I finally get
where he got that nosiness from.

579
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,786
What? Who are you talking about?

580
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,330
Who do you think?
I'm talking about your son.

581
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,207
He's just like you.

582
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,459
Why are you in such a bad mood today?

583
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,836
Did something bad happen?

584
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,673
Yes, you got fired.

585
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,092
You and your son are unbelievable.

586
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,636
I'm never going to live like you guys.

587
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,097
You call yourself a cook,

588
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,683
but you're eating instant noodles.

589
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:08,604
Well, I do hope you end up
living a better life.

590
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,692
I haven't taken
my rolling admission exam yet.

591
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,943
What if I flunk the exam?

592
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,697
You're a smart girl.

593
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,199
If you fail,
you'll get in next year.

594
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,243
Says the guy who got fired.

595
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,036
You're broke now that you're jobless.

596
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:29,208
You have no idea how proud I am.

597
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:34,046
That wild little girl grew up to be
such a magnificent person.

598
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,344
Go to college.

599
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,513
You can succeed

600
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,974
and pay me back twofold.

601
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,064
Then...

602
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,650
Let's say I borrowed that money.

603
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:59,197
I'll succeed and pay you back
three times the amount.

604
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,282
Okay, deal.

605
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,203
Do you have any leftover gimbap?

606
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,955
Do you have any that passed
the expiry date?

607
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,500
The ones that expired yesterday?

608
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,009
I heard what happened to Mr. Park.

609
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:23,930
Yes, he was your mentor, wasn't he?

610
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,225
I know you guys were very close.

611
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,771
Yes, he was also very close
with my late father.

612
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,651
And from what I know,
he was very close with you, too.

613
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:41,030
That doesn't matter
when it comes to the company.

614
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:45,284
You of all people know
that Mr. Park is very smart and competent.

615
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,535
He played a big role--

616
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,133
He disobeyed me.

617
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,638
He was a very loyal dog.

618
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,808
But what do I do
when an old and useless dog

619
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,644
fails to recognize its owner?

620
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,646
Sir.

621
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,025
Personally speaking,

622
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,570
I'm a very authoritative person.

623
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:22,863
Do you know why?

624
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,743
Your father and I started out
from a small pub

625
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,037
and built Jangga Co. to where it is now.

626
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,249
And all the decisions I made

627
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,627
were correct.

628
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,345
I think of you like my own daughter.

629
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,348
But please don't provoke me too much.

630
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,536
Just a second, sir.

631
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,873
-Where's my wallet?
-It's okay. Just get in.

632
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,501
My test ID.

633
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,599
Hey.

634
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,225
Hey!

635
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,231
I thought today was your interview
for the rolling admission.

636
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,233
Where are you going?

637
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,319
You already know where.

638
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,654
Why aren't you taking the bus?

639
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,158
I forgot to bring my test ID and ID card.

640
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,576
I'm so stupid.

641
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:54,038
-What are you going to do?
-Will you stop asking me?

642
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,207
I told you that I messed up.

643
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,044
But why are you running
instead of taking a bus?

644
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,507
I'll be late for the interview
if I wait for the next bus.

645
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:09,678
It's fine. I just need to get
to Gwangjin University in 20 minutes.

646
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,097
Twenty minutes?

647
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:14,725
That's at least three kilometers away
from here.

648
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,103
Mind your own business.

649
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,732
Wait.

650
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,277
You won't be able to make it at this pace.

651
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,322
-Just mind your own business.
-Try to keep up with me.

652
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,490
Can you do that?

653
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,492
I can do it.

654
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,251
Hang in there. We're almost there.

655
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,796
Why are you helping me?

656
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,340
I thought you hated me.

657
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,760
Don't be absurd.

658
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,345
Now, breathe. Slowly.

659
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,765
Come on.

660
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,659
I told you I can make it on my own.

661
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,702
Okay, whatever.

662
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,915
We're almost there.

663
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,980
Soo-ah.

664
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,903
Good luck on your interview.

665
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,406
Gosh, you don't need to worry.

666
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,200
I'll do well.

667
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,585
LIST OF APPLICANTS

668
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,464
Numbers 21 to 25, please come inside.

669
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,185
Soo-ah.

670
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,730
Good luck on your interview.

671
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,947
GWANGJIN UNIVERSITY

672
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,592
What are you doing here?

673
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:37,720
Were you waiting for me?

674
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,141
Well...

675
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,603
How was it? Did you do well?

676
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:48,397
Yes, thanks to you.

677
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,567
Why did you wait?

678
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,703
Do you still

679
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,291
want to be friends because of my dad?
Because I do.

680
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:15,549
Can't we be friends?

681
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,179
We can be friends.

682
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,819
Why do you want to be friends
all of a sudden?

683
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,238
You don't like me.

684
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,284
No reason.

685
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,872
I used to think you were a girl
with no heart.

686
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,125
But I think I know
why you were being like that.

687
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:54,880
Why am I like this?

688
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,840
Because you're twisted.

689
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,761
Are you sure you want to be my friend?

690
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,182
You don't like to receive help, do you?

691
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,893
And you don't like people who ask for it.

692
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,938
"I'm in a better place than that person.

693
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,731
There are people going through worse.

694
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:15,025
I should rather be grateful."

695
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,737
Do you know what sympathy is?

696
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,824
It's a distasteful emotion
where you look down on someone

697
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,826
and get comfort from it.

698
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,710
What about my dad?

699
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,629
Was it also a sympathy
that's just distasteful?

700
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,717
He's different.

701
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:42,386
How is he different?

702
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,555
You don't have to know.

703
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,780
By the way, the fact
that you hit Jang Geun-won the other day.

704
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,198
Do you not regret it?

705
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,200
What?

706
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,124
Even when Geun-won did something wrong,
no one could stop him.

707
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,501
Even teachers were no different.

708
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,839
But you made a huge scene
as soon as you transferred.

709
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,011
That was cool.

710
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,851
But you ended up
getting expelled from school.

711
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,980
I can't live like you or your dad.

712
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,232
And that's not what I want.

713
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,405
Why did you bring that up?

714
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:44,364
No reason.

715
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:45,908
I'm just saying.

716
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,453
It's getting cold. Let's go.

717
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,040
Wait.

718
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,422
What was that? Do you have a cell phone?

719
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,050
What's going on?

720
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,678
I told you. I want to be your friend.

721
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,935
Give me your phone.
I'll give you my number.

722
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:23,320
I'm doing this because we're friends.

723
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,114
You shouldn't have a crush on me.

724
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,699
What?

725
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,493
Here. This is my number.

726
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,294
So this is it.
Why can't I have a crush on you?

727
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,758
A stubborn guy like you
gives a girl a hard time.

728
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,720
Okay?

729
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,723
You shouldn't fall for me.

730
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,020
Why aren't you answering me?

731
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,275
You never know...

732
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,612
what will happen in life.

733
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,531
Give me. I can't do this.

734
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,658
You can't take it back from me.

735
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,368
I'll get going. I'll call you.

736
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,120
-Hey, Saeroyi.
-Oh, right.

737
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:16,748
You...

738
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:24,339
You're cool enough.

739
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,512
And you're very pretty.

740
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,934
I should get going. See you.

741
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:39,313
Hey! Delete my number!

742
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,964
-You seem to be in a good mood.
-What? Of course I am.

743
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:09,426
I've always dreamed
of running my own business.

744
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,887
My heart is pounding with anticipation.

745
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,060
By the way, what's the name of the pub?

746
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:19,645
Well...

747
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,731
What about Saeroyi Pub?

748
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,567
I don't like it. It sounds silly.

749
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,821
We still have some time
until we open the place.

750
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,824
You should come up with a decent name.

751
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,084
I got expelled.

752
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,964
My dad got fired.

753
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,802
It was no big deal.

754
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,723
There was no change in my daily life.

755
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,227
-I did it.
-It worked.

756
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,311
-I did it.
-Right.

757
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,314
Having many different feelings,

758
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,901
I just live from day to day.

759
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,863
Hey, come here.

760
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,452
Go ahead and do it now.

761
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,538
All right. Let's drink.

762
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,580
I'm still young,

763
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,832
You should drink water.

764
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,209
but I'm learning more about life.

765
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,044
Bottoms up!

766
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,588
I have these silly thoughts

767
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,008
that my dad might laugh at.

768
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,718
How does the water taste?

769
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,094
It's great.

770
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,534
Sure. I bought everything we need.

771
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,412
Yes. I bought meat, too.

772
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,706
The color looks amazing.

773
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,875
I'll be right there.

774
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,169
Okay, son.

775
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,624
As long as we're alive,

776
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,087
nothing is a big deal.

777
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,883
As long as we are alive.

778
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,979
I have to survive.

779
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,739
My son...

780
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,651
That night,

781
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,988
Dad didn't come back.

782
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,812
I'm sorry.

783
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,676
What are you thinking about?

784
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,850
You got expelled

785
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,103
on the first day at a new school.

786
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,318
I don't have to buy the uniform.

787
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,320
The uniform.

788
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,467
You might end up passing out.

789
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,929
You should force yourself to eat.

790
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,604
It's strange,

791
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:59,526
but all I can remember is
what I've received.

792
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,700
I just took it for granted.

793
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:13,123
Why did I take it for granted?

794
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,460
I must've been crazy.

795
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,346
Mr. Park Saeroyi.

796
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:35,562
I know this isn't a good time.

797
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,649
I'm Detective Oh Byung-heon
in charge of your father's case.

798
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:44,029
The suspect turned himself in
this morning.

799
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:50,618
I think you should know
the circumstances of the case.

800
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,080
These are the photos of the scene.

801
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,875
The suspect wants to reach a settlement.

802
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,587
A settlement?

803
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,547
In a case like this...

804
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,757
So you mean

805
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,011
he wants

806
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,056
to measure the value

807
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:14,642
of my dad's life?

808
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,316
So this guy

809
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,362
wants to pay me for that?

810
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,907
I'm sorry for your loss, but...

811
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,206
Saeroyi, are you all right?

812
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:45,632
Sir, he hasn't slept or eaten
for the past two days.

813
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:50,845
Do you mind visiting him sometime later?

814
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,599
I'm really sorry for what happened.

815
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,602
Please get some rest and give us a call.

816
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:00,522
Let's go.

817
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,492
You should get some rest.

818
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:17,247
Otherwise, you might collapse soon.

819
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,500
I'm sorry.

820
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,804
What...

821
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,014
This...

822
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,143
Why is this here?

823
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,190
This car.

824
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,903
-Why?
-Why is it here?

825
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:53,074
You have good taste.
This is a limited edition.

826
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,369
The license plate is also amazing.
It's 7777.

827
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,997
It's really hard to get this number.

828
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,003
This is Jang Geun-won's car.

829
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,134
Are you sure?

830
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,395
Are you sure it's his car?

831
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,401
Yes.

832
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,612
He said it's a limited edition.

833
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,781
And I'm sure this is his number.

834
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,921
Saeroyi.

835
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,507
I'm sorry. Can you stay here for me?

836
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,511
Saeroyi.

837
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,262
Saeroyi!

838
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:02,060
Saeroyi, wait.

839
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,270
What are you going to do?

840
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,398
Calm down
and call the police--

841
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,639
What is he doing here?

842
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,224
He's Saeroyi.

843
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,728
-What's going on?
-Why is he here?

844
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:50,733
Family.

845
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:54,487
Dad.

846
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,866
Even before I realized his favor
that I can't return,

847
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,371
I lost the only one I had.

848
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:04,539
GWANGJIN HOSPITAL

849
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,385
The one was like my everything.

850
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,557
It broke my heart
because he only cared about me.

851
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,227
And that's why I could try hard.

852
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,065
To me, you were

853
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,694
the reason for my existence, Dad.

854
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:19,864
Saeroyi.

855
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,702
It's important that you know
how to apologize for your mistakes.

856
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,748
That's what I heard.

857
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,920
But he took my everything.

858
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,215
What are you doing?

859
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:40,802
How did you...

860
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,098
Now that you seem startled,
it's just obvious.

861
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,226
Wait. Hang on a second.

862
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:53,439
It's you, right?

863
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:58,945
Wait.

864
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,573
Let's talk it out. Calm down.

865
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:07,453
-Why did you not call the hospital?
-No.

866
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,997
It's not like that. Let's talk it out.
Let go.

867
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,796
Why is someone else being punished?

868
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,631
Help!

869
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,009
Help me!

870
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:29,976
Hang on. Wait and just listen to me.

871
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,271
You jerk.

872
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,816
Why did you kill my dad?

873
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,363
Why?

874
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:47,952
I'm sorry.

875
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:50,872
I'm really sorry.

876
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,718
Please stop. I'm so sorry.

877
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:09,932
It's too late.

878
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:15,980
The one you should apologize to

879
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:18,983
is dead.

880
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,781
Wait. Please don't do this.

881
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:28,493
You killed him.

882
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:33,372
You have to go apologize to him.

883
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,461
You have to die!

884
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,588
Die!

885
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,174
Go ahead and die!

886
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:47,678
Die! Die, you jerk!

887
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:49,931
Damn it.

888
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,601
You son of a bitch.

889
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,679
Die, you jerk!

890
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,862
