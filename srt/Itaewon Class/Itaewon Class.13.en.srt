1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,057
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,642
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,185
What should we do?

4
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,937
-About what?
-Ma Hyun-yi.

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,273
People are responding negatively
to the article.

6
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,276
Hyun-yi should've at least
given us a heads-up.

7
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,279
Well, I think it'd be better for us
to eliminate Hyun-yi.

8
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,863
And reduce Hyun-yi's airtime as well.

9
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,451
The judges will decide
whether or not Hyun-yi'll be eliminated.

10
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,703
Let's get started.

11
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,913
Let's go.

12
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,291
The survival match among the finest pubs.

13
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,127
We're here to find
the best pub in the country.

14
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,546
Among the 16 pubs
from all over the country,

15
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,424
only four are remaining.

16
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,426
This is the long-awaited final round.

17
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:37,597
Who will be named the best chef?

18
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,726
The Best Pub begins now.

19
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,190
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,653
I know it's cruel of me
to pressure you like this,

21
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:52,904
-but I--
-No.

22
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,450
The diamond.

23
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,457
You thought of me when you read that poem?

24
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,756
For Saeroyi,

25
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,550
you,

26
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,679
and the DanBam family,

27
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,058
I will toughen up.

28
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,523
I'll stay strong.

29
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,027
You see,

30
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,988
I'm so proud of you.

31
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,456
We've been using the blind testing method
since the third round.

32
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,376
The judges have no way of knowing
who made what.

33
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,503
All they care about is how good it tastes.

34
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,671
Just now,

35
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,591
the judges have completed
tasting all the foods.

36
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,345
First, let me interview Mr. Park Jun-gi,
Jangga Pub's head cook.

37
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,931
You've always received high scores.

38
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,141
Are you feeling confident
about today as well?

39
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,768
I've been doing this--

40
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,478
Look at... Oh, right.

41
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,814
I've been a cook all my life.

42
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,400
I did my best, as always.

43
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,986
You're a true pro.

44
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,073
Then let's speak with Ms. Ma Hyun-yi,

45
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,076
the head chef of DanBam
who's been on a winning streak.

46
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,662
You were named number one
for two weeks in a row.

47
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,539
How do you feel now?

48
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,841
DANBAM PUB

49
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,597
Today,

50
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,852
something personal about me

51
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,233
was made public,
irrespective of my wishes.

52
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,991
Frankly, I'm not in the greatest mood.

53
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,204
Right, I see.
When you're in the showbiz...

54
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,123
-And you're awfully popular, so--
-I am

55
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,629
a transgender.

56
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,632
YOU GOT THIS! WE MUST WIN!

57
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,602
-For real?
-No way.

58
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,816
Yes, right.

59
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,235
A personal matter

60
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,863
was made public earlier today,
irrespective of her wishes.

61
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,533
Hyun-yi's probably quite upset about it.

62
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,120
But you're standing here now,
looking confident and strong.

63
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,831
I believe that this round

64
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,918
will be an opportunity for you
to prove yourself.

65
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,545
Prove myself?

66
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,186
I'm just me,

67
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,106
and I don't need anyone's approval
or validation.

68
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,859
I see.

69
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:23,365
Then could you tell us why you're here?

70
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,251
There are people who keep me strong.

71
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,423
I wanted to repay them
by making delicious food.

72
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,219
That's why I'm here.

73
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,931
That's very inspiring.

74
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,392
Your co-workers must be so proud of you.

75
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,105
How well do you think you'll do today?

76
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,024
They say,
birds of a feather flock together.

77
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,237
I work at the best pub in Korea

78
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,992
with the most wonderful people.

79
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,037
I, too,

80
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,749
will be the best.

81
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,753
In the previous rounds,
we all saw what Hyun-yi can do.

82
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:22,090
So I don't think Hyun-yi's just bluffing.

83
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,303
Let's find out
if the judges feel the same way.

84
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,015
The long-awaited final round.
The winner is...

85
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,921
We'll be back in 60 seconds!

86
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,889
You're watching The Best Pub live.

87
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,810
It's time to announce the final winner.

88
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,692
The winner is...

89
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,320
DANBAM PUB

90
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,825
THE BEST PUB

91
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,628
DanBam Pub's Ma Hyun-yi!

92
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,090
Congratulations!

93
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,348
FINAL WINNER
MA HYUN-YI, DANBAM PUB

94
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,772
Congratulations, Hyun-yi.

95
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,065
How do you feel--

96
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,863
Well done. Hyun-yi. Great job.

97
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:12,117
-Go, Hyun-yi!
-Seriously, great job.

98
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,498
-My gosh.
-We won!

99
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,003
-Gosh, this is so cool.
-Hyun-yi!

100
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,091
What did I say? Hyun-yi is so amazing!

101
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,552
Come here, guys.

102
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,893
MA HYUN-YI IS THE FINAL WINNER

103
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,064
Hyun-yi.

104
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,817
You're the best.

105
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,706
TRANSGENDER CHEF MA HYUN-YI
WINS THE COMPETITION

106
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,750
You assured me we'd win
when you took this on.

107
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,753
I'm sure you remember what you said to me.

108
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,297
What should we do?

109
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,675
What do you want me to do?

110
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,095
Ms. Oh.

111
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,681
What did he do to make sure we could win?

112
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,855
He made them do blind tests instead
when Ma Hyun-yi started becoming popular

113
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,067
and pressured Mr. Park,
who wasn't nervous at all.

114
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,361
Nevertheless, he ended up
ruining Jangga Co.'s reputation.

115
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,321
Is that all he did?

116
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,825
He also

117
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,412
leaked Ma Hyun-yi's private matter
to the media

118
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,457
to deliberately distract her.

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,213
For that, he deserves some points.

120
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,968
Geun-soo, you may leave.

121
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,393
I thought he left for good,
but he came back

122
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,773
and said he wants to run Jangga Co.

123
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,444
He wants to take over this role.

124
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,496
What's your thought on that?

125
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,127
Do you think he can be my successor?

126
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,136
He is

127
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,807
a lot like you, sir.

128
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,499
So is this the high card you talked about?

129
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,084
I did this to win.

130
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,670
Why do you have to--

131
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,026
Hold tight.

132
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:35,778
Let's go.

133
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,953
Move to the rhythm,

134
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,415
and make it seem like your body
accidentally brushed against hers.

135
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,794
There's nothing going on between us.
We're not dating.

136
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,756
We really are just friends.

137
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,719
But I like her.

138
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,599
Yes.

139
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,018
I don't care what anyone says.

140
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,774
I just need you.

141
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,152
Hey, what are you doing here?

142
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,655
You said you were in Jeju.
You're back already?

143
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,120
That story about Hyun-yi.

144
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,456
It was you, wasn't it?

145
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,256
I worked as a model for three years,
so I know dozens of reporters.

146
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,968
You didn't think I'd find out?

147
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,848
That's right. It was me.

148
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,226
What about it?

149
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,437
I was simply trying to win. That's all.

150
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,232
Was I supposed to keep it a secret

151
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,484
just because Hyun-yi and I
used to be close friends?

152
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,987
Would you have done that?

153
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,033
Just be yourself.

154
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,245
Being a pushover suits you better.

155
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,374
But you told me

156
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,961
"If you desperately want me

157
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,963
you should take over Jangga Co."

158
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,928
Later on, I said
that I was just talking nonsense.

159
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,641
-If that's why you're being like this--
-Bullshit.

160
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,527
I was so used to giving up,

161
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,655
but I made a choice for myself
for a change.

162
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,451
I ditched everything and chose this
because of what you said.

163
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,208
You can't do this to me.

164
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,172
You know,

165
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,633
I don't want to destroy you.

166
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,845
What?

167
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,724
A while ago,

168
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,852
Boss told me this.

169
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,396
When it comes to your feelings--

170
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,690
Again! I'm so sick of hearing you
talking about him!

171
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,028
I don't care what your amazing boss said.

172
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,946
It's already too late.

173
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,910
I can't stop now, Yi-seo.

174
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,745
I can't

175
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,420
hold back my feelings for you.

176
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,222
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,602
I can't accept your feelings.

178
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,774
Sorry.

179
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,235
I really am.

180
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,791
Hey, well...

181
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,335
I told you to get more rest.

182
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,088
We won The Best Pub,

183
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,966
and the investment has been confirmed
as well.

184
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,178
-Thanks for your hard work.
-That's it?

185
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:12,972
What?

186
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,224
You always pet my hair.

187
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,612
Oh, that...

188
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,161
I have to go draft the contract
for Ms. Kim. Let's go.

189
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,128
Aren't you coming?

190
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,174
I am.

191
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,471
Watch the steps.

192
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,150
DANBAM

193
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,655
You won't regret
this investment decision, ma'am.

194
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm a woman of her word.

195
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,163
Thank you.

196
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,832
You've made some promises too.

197
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,793
Keep your end of the bargain.

198
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:29,966
Your goal.

199
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,427
Becoming number one in Korea!

200
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,432
Of course. I'm a man of my word as well.

201
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,018
Good. I have faith in you.

202
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,984
INVESTMENT CONTRACT

203
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,781
KIM SOON-RYE

204
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,680
IC'S MOTTO HELPS THE COMPANY
SECURE 10 BILLION WON

205
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,724
Ten billion won?

206
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,685
Her boss is pretty impressive.

207
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,064
So your goal
is to help that owner with his business?

208
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,065
Then what?

209
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,026
Will you become a pub owner's wife?

210
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,611
That's not how I was raised.

211
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,071
Right.

212
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,826
That is not how I raised her.

213
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,787
I'm a lot more competent than you think.

214
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,378
That girl...

215
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,607
SEUNG-KWON

216
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,319
JANG GEUN-SOO

217
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,155
You won't answer it?

218
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,658
Yi-seo has found out

219
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,160
that I leaked it to the media.

220
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,289
I bet you're regretting what you did
while feeling bad about it.

221
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,958
Am I regretting it?

222
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,880
What do you think Saeroyi will say
if he finds out?

223
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,843
"Whatever you do,

224
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,137
I'll be just fine."

225
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:42,640
He'll probably say that.

226
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,645
Make sure you turn off the lights.

227
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,731
I know about what happened

228
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,275
between you and Saeroyi.

229
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,824
And I think I know you are working
in Jangga Co. with mixed feelings.

230
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,621
You think nothing I do can affect him?

231
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,091
Do you know what I thought of
when I heard you say that?

232
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:19,844
What?

233
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,721
"What can I do

234
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,641
to take him down for good?"

235
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,897
You see,

236
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,317
I'm not like you.

237
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,114
Hey.

238
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,576
What are you thinking?

239
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,837
Jeez, why isn't this prick picking up?

240
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,840
Hey, let me pour you one.

241
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,468
There.

242
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,014
The sliding technique.
This is how beer should be poured.

243
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,185
-All right.
-Jeez.

244
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,936
Attention, everyone.

245
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,732
A while ago, Saeroyi said--

246
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,109
Gosh! Enough.

247
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,986
You talk about Boss all the time.

248
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,200
-Enough is enough, okay?
-Why? It sounds interesting. Tell us.

249
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,409
Right?

250
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,914
That's what I'm saying!
Hey, why are you so mean to me?

251
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,374
You're pretty, but so what?

252
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,380
Jeez, what the heck is he saying?

253
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,257
Whatever, forget it.

254
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,302
A while ago, Saeroyi said...

255
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,470
"I'll do

256
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,392
everything I want to do."

257
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,269
He probably said that.

258
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,607
Yes. How did you know?

259
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,527
And he also said,

260
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:03,572
"I'll turn DanBam into a franchise!"

261
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,159
-Franchise? What?
-Goodness.

262
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,452
And what happened?

263
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,996
What happened, dude?

264
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:15,709
It became a reality today.

265
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,422
He fell asleep.

266
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,800
Hey, Saeroyi.

267
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,134
-Yes.
-All right.

268
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,220
Say a few words.

269
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,055
Okay.

270
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,518
Raise your glasses.

271
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,895
Thank you.

272
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:41,902
Thank you all

273
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,655
for your hard work.

274
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,241
What did I say?

275
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,827
When we work together,

276
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,913
can we succeed or not?

277
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,999
-We sure can!
-We sure can!

278
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,086
Who are we?

279
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,629
-IC!
-IC!

280
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,506
Yes, IC!

281
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,762
Jeez.

282
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,765
Do you guys know that?

283
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,271
Because I have you guys,

284
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,774
I...

285
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,445
I will

286
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,239
win.

287
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,551
And who's son am I?

288
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,557
My dad...

289
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,393
He said

290
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,525
he was proud of me.

291
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,071
Gosh, that's enough.

292
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,323
Guys, fill up your glasses.
This will be our last drink.

293
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,287
He's so proud of me.

294
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,418
Chairman Jang?

295
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,091
Jangga Co.? They can all come at me.

296
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,344
I'll beat them.

297
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,558
Gosh...

298
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,020
He drank too much.

299
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,527
I have no doubt that you'll beat them

300
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,279
because you're our boss.

301
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,200
Right?

302
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,913
I'll win this fight, right?

303
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,082
Yes.

304
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,084
Without a doubt.

305
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,304
Saeroyi.

306
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,181
-Gosh.
-Boss.

307
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,642
-Saeroyi!
-Oh, no. He's out.

308
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,894
He passed out. Gosh, don't do this to me.

309
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,521
Please, Saeroyi...

310
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,190
Wake up.

311
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,738
DANBAM

312
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,400
You're still

313
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,154
hurt, right?

314
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:40,682
You assured me that we'd win The Best Pub,

315
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,560
but Park Saeroyi's pub did.

316
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,063
And thanks to that,

317
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,234
he has secured an investment.

318
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,905
Chef Park Jun-gi has been let go.

319
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,213
The meeting will begin
in ten minutes, sir.

320
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,051
We'll stop here.

321
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,595
It was a good game.

322
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,764
Follow me.

323
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,893
You'll join the meeting.

324
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,206
As some of you may know,

325
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,709
he's my younger son.

326
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,047
He's tall and handsome just like you, sir.

327
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:58,844
I'm thinking of

328
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,971
passing down the company to him.

329
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,436
Introduce yourself.

330
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,068
Hello, I'm Jang Geun-soo
in the planning team.

331
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,987
I'll do my best.

332
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,673
Hello, boss!

333
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,344
Hello, boss!

334
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,525
Well, don't cause trouble.

335
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,903
I'll be out soon anyway.

336
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,947
Don't you worry.

337
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,620
-Hello, boss.
-Hello, boss.

338
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,788
Hi, guys.

339
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,712
Who's that?

340
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,720
Hey, shouldn't you at least

341
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,847
greet your new cellmate?

342
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,559
YOUNGER SON JANG GEUN-SOO BECOMES
MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER OF JANGGA CO.

343
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,163
We've already received
hundreds of franchise inquiries.

344
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,667
After organizing the company structure
and taking care of all the locations,

345
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,252
we'll still have seven billion.

346
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,254
We should expand nationwide.

347
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,673
Nationwide...

348
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,842
Gosh, things are finally becoming stable.

349
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,011
We'll do things step by step.

350
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,930
Congratulations.
Your dream has become a reality.

351
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,185
Working on a fishing boat,
doing construction work...

352
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,940
It was so hard to make
100 million won from nothing.

353
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,359
Why are you suddenly being so sentimental?

354
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,612
He deserves to be sentimental.
It's a great achievement.

355
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,906
Boss, you did great.

356
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,035
No, wait. That's not right.
Should I call you President Park now?

357
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,292
But once I had 100 million won,
I easily made that into billions.

358
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,671
The Korean capital market
is very interesting.

359
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,510
The more money you have,
the more that makes sense.

360
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,264
Are you saying we should do stocks?

361
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,270
Now that we have big money,

362
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,440
we should play big.

363
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,152
What's this?

364
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,654
SHANGHAI FRANCHISE EXPO
GATHERING PARTICIPANTS

365
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,948
They're going to hold
a franchise expo in China.

366
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,700
"China"?

367
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,702
No way.

368
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,667
Let's not just go national.
Let's start from China and go global.

369
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,881
Let's turn ten billion
into hundreds of billions.

370
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,592
What?

371
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,928
Like I told Toni's grandmother,

372
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,763
this is not the end of my dream.

373
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,933
My dream is to beat Jangga Co.
and become the best in the country.

374
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,353
So I should act accordingly.

375
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,648
This is just the beginning.

376
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,739
You never disappoint me, boss.

377
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:18,770
4 YEARS LATER, THE YEAR 2020

378
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,716
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

379
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,346
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

380
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,555
Hello, sir.

381
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,390
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

382
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,242
You want to spend three billion won

383
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,118
on another partner company?

384
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,206
Masa Distribution isn't
doing very well right now.

385
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,458
We are not philanthropists.

386
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,252
I'm saying it'll be more efficient

387
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,671
to build guanxi with a new company
than to help a dying one.

388
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,216
What do you think, Director Choi?

389
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,385
What? Oh, right.

390
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,011
Well...

391
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,723
I understand what you mean, Mr. Gwon.

392
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:22,352
But Masa Distribution
helped us enter the Chinese market.

393
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,063
Wouldn't this be an act of betrayal?

394
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,148
That's nonsense.

395
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,859
We can't do business based on attachment.

396
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:34,155
Then is investing three billion won
on a new company to build guanxi

397
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,949
the right way to do business?

398
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,994
I don't think you understand.

399
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,788
In China, business
is all about building guanxi.

400
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,124
Three billion won will bring us
a huge benefit.

401
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,459
Reading documents in the office

402
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,670
and actually seeing things in person

403
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,589
bring very different results.

404
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,716
Seeing things in person?

405
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,053
You keep talking about guanxi.

406
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,598
But are you sure you know what that means?

407
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,224
Pardon?

408
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,518
It means "relationship."

409
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,647
The eldest son of Masa Distribution
is apparently getting married.

410
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,233
Do you know who he's marrying?

411
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,198
The second daughter of Tancent's chairman.
It's a huge online platform company.

412
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,371
It looks like neither of you knew.

413
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,416
How could you not know when you're
always experiencing things in person?

414
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,710
Almost everyone
has heard the news already.

415
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,920
-Well...
-Then

416
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,091
which company will benefit us
in the long run?

417
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,100
Okay then. It's time to decide.

418
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,353
What's the philosophy of our company?

419
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,022
The importance of relationship and trust.

420
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,609
It looks that our philosophy
is going to help us gain profit.

421
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,944
We'll invest in Masa Distribution
as planned.

422
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:56,613
Okay, sir.

423
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,379
I can't stand this.
This really doesn't suit me.

424
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,423
Boss, can I go back to working at a pub?

425
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,300
You're doing great.

426
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,427
"Boss"?

427
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,265
Will you please call him by his rank
when you're at work, Director Choi?

428
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,643
Yes, ma'am.

429
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,273
Hyun-yi, we're treating a Chinese buyer
at the end of this month.

430
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,734
-Can you cook for us that day?
-Sure.

431
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,903
Why are you calling her by her name
when we're at work?

432
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,196
We're different.

433
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,074
Hey, call me Director Choi.
We're at work right now.

434
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,287
What's this?

435
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,790
You have a meeting with the director
of Maparam in 30 minutes.

436
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,292
There might be an argument,
so use this as reference.

437
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,671
And in two hours, you have dinner
scheduled with the CEO of Gojoseon Hotel.

438
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,425
Isn't he meeting the store owners
at our franchise seminar in the evening?

439
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,427
I don't think it'll take long.

440
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,137
He can go right after dinner.

441
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,139
-This is your schedule for tomorrow.
-Okay.

442
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,934
What's with the crazy schedule?

443
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,102
He'll lose it.

444
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,273
-Is it exhausting?
-No.

445
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,650
Boss, don't be like that.

446
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,487
-We've settled down--
-You think we've settled down?

447
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,449
We're the second most-liked brand.

448
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,076
We're ninth in annual sales
and sixteenth in market capitalization.

449
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,120
That's our position in the food industry.

450
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,830
Jangga Co. is number one for everything.

451
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,291
I want to be number one.

452
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,710
And Yi-seo is planning things out
so I can achieve that.

453
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,422
This is what made me fall for him.

454
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,758
I told you to stop.

455
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,720
You're so persistent.

456
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,556
I was going to gather everyone
and go for a drink.

457
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,433
We had a company dinner two days ago.

458
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,143
Geun-soo is back.

459
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,104
Jang Geun-soo?

460
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,856
Where was he?

461
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,580
He was at an overseas branch.
I think it was the US branch.

462
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,707
You guys keep in touch?

463
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,084
Yes, of course. He's a nice guy.

464
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,920
I think he was lonely working overseas.

465
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,880
Haven't you heard from him, boss?

466
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:21,716
No, I haven't seen him in ages.

467
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,176
I wonder if he's doing well.

468
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,304
Director Jang.

469
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,109
Do I really need to be your driver
at this age?

470
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,363
You're my mentor.

471
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,742
My gosh,
I'm starting to hate you even more.

472
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,249
RECORDING

473
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,293
Saeroyi goes to Pajin
very often these days.

474
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,004
Pajin? Does he go there to meet Ms. Kang?

475
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,966
I think so. They're really close.

476
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,510
Hye-won surprises me.

477
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,136
She's taller every time I see her.

478
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,222
She always surprises me, too.

479
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,100
It feels like yesterday
when she was only a little kid.

480
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,352
She's going through a growth spurt.

481
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,439
"A growth spurt"?

482
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,360
I totally agree.
She's going through a growth spurt.

483
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,571
Which part of what I said was so funny?

484
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,533
Well, I just liked...

485
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,953
You like me?

486
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:34,497
No.

487
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,833
That's absurd.

488
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,587
You didn't have to pull a straight face.

489
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,924
I mean... Well...

490
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,261
Do you want to see photos of Hye-won
when she was little?

491
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,345
Sure.

492
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,514
Isn't she pretty?

493
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,932
OH HYE-WON

494
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,475
She never looked like you.

495
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,145
This is Jangmun Market Street.

496
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,024
It almost got redeveloped ten years ago,
but it got canceled.

497
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,694
And right now, lots of places are empty
regardless of the cheap rent.

498
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,863
Why do you think so?

499
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:11,409
Most of the landlords
even put their buildings up for sale.

500
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,954
Apart from a few buildings,

501
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,831
we can purchase most of the buildings

502
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:21,294
from here to here
with only 40 billion won.

503
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,047
You want to spend 40 billion won
on a place that's dead?

504
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,633
Isn't that too much money?

505
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,930
We're going to fill all those buildings

506
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,724
with Jangga Co.'s brands
and affiliated companies.

507
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,727
We’ll redecorate the filthy buildings

508
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,187
with bright

509
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,773
and unified murals

510
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,691
and turn it into a popular street

511
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,151
like Gyeongridan-gil Road

512
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,195
and Songridan-gil Road.

513
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,325
We’re Jangga Co., so we could call it

514
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,243
Jangridan Street.

515
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,621
We’re investing billions of won,

516
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,872
but how long will that last?

517
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,415
Streets like that

518
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,710
tend to lose popularity very quickly.

519
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,003
Yes.

520
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,713
But when those streets

521
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,384
were at their very peak,
the rent in those areas

522
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,177
almost quadrupled.

523
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,390
The 40-billion-won investment
will turn into 120 billion,

524
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,268
and our brand value
will eventually increase.

525
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,150
What will we do when the street

526
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,777
loses its value?

527
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,780
We’re going to increase the value

528
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,367
and sell the buildings at their peak.

529
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,037
Wouldn’t that hurt our brand image?

530
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,205
No.

531
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,916
That’s when the marketing team steps in.

532
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,462
“The area was high in value
when Jangga Co. was here,

533
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,008
but now that they’re gone,
it has lost its popularity again.”

534
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,468
Then people will think once again

535
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,595
that Jangga Co.

536
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,224
is truly incredible.

537
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,105
Okay.

538
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,107
You can proceed with it.

539
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,567
Thank you, sir.

540
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,831
This is a street renovation project,

541
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,958
so we need to be on good terms
with the borough chief.

542
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,460
You should meet him next month

543
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,295
when he comes
to our groundbreaking ceremony.

544
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,589
Okay, sure.

545
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,508
Let's talk about the rest over dinner.

546
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,845
I need to go to Jangmun Market with Ms. Oh
and meet the merchants there.

547
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:36,804
I see.

548
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:38,598
Okay.

549
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,648
Park Saeroyi and IC Co.

550
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,362
His business has grown so big.

551
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,908
Does he still bother you?

552
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,495
He'll come at us one day.

553
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,497
Don't let your guard down.

554
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,292
You don't look well.

555
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:07,877
You should get some rest.

556
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,641
Jangga Co. is going to revive
a market street?

557
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,810
They're trying to promote
their gentrification plan.

558
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,981
Director Jang Geun-soo seems to have
a good reputation in the company.

559
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,983
He's nothing like Geun-won.

560
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,986
He's practically the successor.

561
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:39,909
Are you sure it's a good idea
for you to stay here in Pajin?

562
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,579
I'm powerless now.

563
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,581
What else can I do?

564
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,501
What about Saeroyi?
What is he up to these days?

565
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,686
Yi-seo.

566
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,651
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Why do you think?

567
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,613
Why are you shopping online in my office?

568
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,740
Sir, take a look at this necklace.

569
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,285
Isn't it so pretty? It looks like a smile.

570
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:26,289
Yes, it's pretty.
And it does look like a smile.

571
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,040
Buy it in your own office.

572
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,087
Can you buy it for me tomorrow?

573
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,844
Don't I have a busy schedule tomorrow?

574
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,181
Right. Then I guess tomorrow won't work.

575
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,850
When do you think you'll be free?
When should we go to buy it?

576
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,853
-Yi-seo.
-Stop.

577
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:50,980
I told you

578
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,066
that it's my right to keep liking you.

579
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,112
Yes, I get that's how you feel.
But what about me?

580
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,702
You're right.

581
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,581
You don't like me yet.

582
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,416
So you must feel uneasy about it.

583
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,586
-If you get that--
-But unfortunately,

584
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:18,424
I like you so much
that it drives me crazy.

585
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,136
-Hey--
-Wait.

586
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,471
Like I said,

587
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,972
you can fire me for this.

588
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,599
If it makes you uneasy, then go ahead.

589
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,601
But I'm so good at what I do,

590
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,937
so you probably can't fire me,
so that's a real pity.

591
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,526
What's the trouble?

592
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,322
It's not like you don't have a choice.

593
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,662
You just need to accept
my feelings for you.

594
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,835
What is wrong with you?

595
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:58,965
What?

596
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,717
Should I come back a little later?

597
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:02,885
No.

598
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,179
I'll go check some buildings in Itaewon.

599
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,430
Okay, go ahead.

600
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:14,689
I love you.

601
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,315
Hey, what...

602
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,156
Gosh, it's way past working hours.

603
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,117
I came to ask for your signature.

604
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,536
Yes, of course. I should sign this.

605
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,998
BAEGA DANDAN
FIRST QUARTER SETTLEMENT

606
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,250
That's a nice pen.

607
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,670
Oh, this? Yi-seo got it for me
for my last year's birthday.

608
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,796
I see.

609
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,048
What about you?

610
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:44,176
What?

611
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,721
What did you get for Yi-seo last year

612
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,265
on her birthday?

613
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,077
Jang Geun-won.

614
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,446
Who are you?

615
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,596
Is porridge enough, sir?

616
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,435
I don't have

617
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,272
an appetite these days.

618
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,109
You don't look very well.

619
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,486
I'll schedule an appointment with Dr. Kim.

620
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,864
Okay, go ahead.

621
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,494
I didn't know you were eating.

622
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,288
Why are you here?

623
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,665
I'm planning to eat
with the borough chief tomorrow.

624
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,250
I was wondering if you could make it.

625
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:22,710
Well...

626
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,170
Director Jang.

627
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,132
The chairman isn't
in his best condition right now.

628
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,681
Don't you feel well?

629
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,729
The borough chief is very particular.

630
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,191
On top of that,

631
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,526
You are the figurehead of Jangga Co.

632
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:51,197
Once you meet him,
things will go a lot easier.

633
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,823
Director Jang.

634
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,868
-Tomorrow, Chairman Jang will...
-It's okay.

635
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,329
He says I can make things easier.

636
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,834
I should go then.

637
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,754
Thank you. I'll come back tomorrow
to pick you up...

638
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,195
Chairman Jang.

639
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,446
Chairman Jang.

640
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,282
Chairman Jang.

641
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,159
Chairman Jang.

642
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,994
Chairman Jang.

643
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,501
HANGUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

644
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,919
Pancreatic cancer?

645
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,088
What about surgery?

646
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,340
Will he get better after surgery?

647
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,426
Cancer spread to the lymphatic gland
and blood vessels.

648
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:58,514
And it might metastasize
to the liver and lungs.

649
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,182
Considering Chairman Jang's age,

650
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:03,185
it is best to treat it
with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

651
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,271
But practically...

652
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,815
How much time does he have left?

653
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:12,236
I can't tell you how long it will be.

654
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,154
It varies from person to person.

655
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,864
I just need your opinion.

656
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,454
It may be for about six months.

657
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,834
Half a year?

658
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,801
You should've called me
as soon as you got out.

659
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,512
What took you so long?

660
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,931
I know.

661
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,434
I hesitated.

662
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:46,687
You didn't come to see me even once.

663
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,482
I wasn't sure if it was okay to call you
when I'm abandoned.

664
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,862
I see.

665
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,741
You must've resented me.

666
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,077
Do you want me to apologize or something?

667
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,038
It's been four years.

668
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,211
How could you say that to your son
you just met in four years?

669
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:23,891
When did you come?

670
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,314
Are you feeling better?

671
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,985
Mr. Kim told me.

672
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,739
I have half a year left.

673
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,327
But it depends on the person.

674
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,537
When I was with him,

675
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,581
I had him get a checkup every year.

676
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,252
Is that my job as the director?

677
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,921
Stop it.

678
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,512
I stopped this from getting reported,

679
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,472
but it will be important
to control the press.

680
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,432
Okay.

681
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,559
The doctor says

682
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,606
there's no point in getting treatment.

683
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,698
Can't you go to work?

684
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,077
What?

685
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:28,080
-Succession due to ill health will--
-Jang Geun-soo.

686
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,959
...lead to a fall in stock prices.

687
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,880
You should name the next chairman

688
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,551
when you are in good condition.

689
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,306
You've become interesting.

690
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,808
Stop it.

691
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,811
And you haven't changed.

692
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,273
-You think?
-I said stop.

693
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,619
I will meet with the borough chief
by myself.

694
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,539
Get some rest, Chairman Jang.

695
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,186
You made him become

696
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,730
just like you.

697
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,569
That's why

698
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,575
he deserves to take my seat.

699
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,997
I'm telling you

700
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,167
I don't regret what I did that day.

701
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,922
I did it

702
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,967
for Jangga Co.'s sake.

703
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,431
You haven't changed.

704
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,684
It's all about Jangga Co.

705
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,525
I wonder what it is for.

706
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,487
Get some rest.

707
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,289
Actually,

708
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,878
I know the reason

709
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,382
why my life turned out this way.

710
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,101
I will protect Jangga Co.

711
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,272
that you cherish.

712
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:31,847
Soo-ah.

713
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:34,683
Saeroyi.

714
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,354
What are you doing here?

715
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,273
Were you waiting for me?

716
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,108
I was just passing by.

717
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,276
It's close.

718
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,820
You should've called me.
It's cold outside.

719
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:04,421
Hey, where are you now?

720
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,714
I'm in Itaewon.

721
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,300
I ran into Soo-ah.

722
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,093
Now?

723
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:13,972
Hang on.

724
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,312
Can we go to Seok-cheon's
restaurant next time?

725
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,731
-Well...
-I see.

726
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,400
It's okay. It seems urgent.

727
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:31,156
Okay. I'll be right there.

728
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,324
Okay.

729
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,288
I'm sorry it's been a long time.

730
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,082
It's really okay.

731
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,542
The whole world knows that you are busy.

732
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,753
I should get going then. See you.

733
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,254
Bye.

734
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,574
It's been a long time.

735
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:17,828
I know.

736
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:20,914
I was on a date with Saeroyi.

737
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,626
I saw the whole thing.

738
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,923
You got stood up.

739
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,594
When are you going to let go of him?

740
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,849
Let go of him?

741
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,060
You should say that to Saeroyi.

742
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,772
I said I didn't want a poor guy.

743
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,066
So he said he'd become rich.

744
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:50,569
He said he will destroy Jangga Co.

745
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,779
and support me.

746
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,032
So I won't have a hard time anymore.

747
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,786
What's wrong with you?

748
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:05,250
You were always like,
"Saeroyi likes me anyway."

749
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,378
I've never seen you
feel so nervous like that.

750
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,636
You are afraid

751
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,141
that Boss might fall in love with me.

752
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,104
It's

753
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,816
so disgusting.

754
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:34,821
-What?
-"Come to me after you become rich."

755
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,948
"Destroy Jangga Co.
so I won't have a hard time."

756
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,909
You only care about yourself.

757
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,537
You just keep asking for things

758
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,706
while you aren't doing anything.

759
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,126
What...

760
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,879
What do you know?

761
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,047
I know

762
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,634
at least one thing.

763
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,971
Who loves Boss more.

764
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,390
Do you know

765
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,060
how I felt when I talked to him?

766
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,229
"Rich?"

767
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,648
"I will make you rich."

768
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,901
"Jangga Co. gives you a hard time?"

769
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,196
"I will destroy them for you."

770
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:21,785
You...

771
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,748
If you

772
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:33,004
care about him at least a little,

773
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:34,923
you should

774
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,509
keep

775
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:41,221
staying still like that

776
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,223
doing nothing.

777
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,490
What's the matter?

778
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:04,286
Good for you. You were on a date
with a manager from Jangga Co.

779
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,623
Why are you being so sensitive?

780
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,668
About your dad

781
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,546
and your grudges against Jangga Co.

782
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,631
You didn't forget them, did you?

783
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,057
I saw Jang Geun-won.

784
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,481
I didn't know he was released.

785
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,108
I was off guard.

786
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,239
So?

787
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,201
Did something happen?

788
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,414
He doesn't even remember me.

789
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,959
I've never forgotten him
even for an instant.

790
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,338
Do you know what's funny?

791
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:00,258
I'm different from back then,
and Jang Geun-won lost his everything.

792
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,305
But I'm still afraid of him.

793
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,409
I talked to Director Kang Min-jung.
We will have a new plan.

794
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,246
I bet Jang Geun-soo will be the successor.

795
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,040
Successor?

796
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:34,918
Chairman Jang

797
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,256
has only a few months to live.

798
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,094
Was it pancreatic cancer? Late-stage.

799
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,138
He's being punished by Heaven.

800
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,060
What?

801
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,871
JANGGA RICE SOUP

802
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:12,998
Sang-sun.

803
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,458
Have a bite.

804
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,793
It's good.

805
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,587
I'm hungry,

806
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,007
but I don't want to eat.

807
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,050
You should eat though.

808
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,762
You said you want to be a doctor
when you grow up.

809
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,974
So you should eat this and become healthy.

810
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,350
Open your mouth.

811
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,063
All right. Good girl.

812
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,152
-What about you?
-What?

813
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:47,365
What do you want to be when you grow up?

814
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,493
I want to

815
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,791
own a ten-story building.

816
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,960
-A ten-story building?
-Yes.

817
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:02,255
That's really tall.

818
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,590
I know. It's tall.

819
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,802
You fool. There's no such thing
as a ten-story building.

820
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,429
Of course, there is.

821
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,805
There isn't?

822
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:15,393
Gosh. Hey, if there's none,
I should build one.

823
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:18,229
If you're nice to me,
I'll let you live in the building.

824
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,565
That's not going to happen.

825
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,485
You're not supposed to lie to her.

826
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,445
Bo-hyeon.

827
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,406
See? I told you.

828
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,123
I begged for food,

829
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,336
lowered my head,

830
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,005
and betrayed people.

831
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,886
I abandoned,

832
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:54,766
extorted, and trampled.

833
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,147
I've put my whole life

834
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:04,025
into Jangga Co.

835
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,779
I did!

836
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,745
I achieved it.

837
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,415
I did.

838
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,484
Hello?

839
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,279
Who is this?

840
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,698
It's me.

841
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,744
Park Saeroyi.

842
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,290
Have you been doing well?

843
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,544
What do you want?

844
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,964
I heard about you.

845
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,134
You have cancer.

846
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,475
Are you going to die?

847
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:22,687
Are you trying to--

848
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,938
I don't

849
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,322
want you to leave so easily like that.

850
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:40,580
Punished by Heaven?

851
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,252
Who said you can do that?

852
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,967
You should be punished by me.

853
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,481
Don't die just yet.

854
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:20,620
I can't believe you are the only person

855
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,250
who wants me to stay alive.

856
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,753
This is interesting.

857
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:31,881
Fine.

858
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:37,554
You will be my last grand show.

859
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,936
I will see you soon.

860
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,736
I can't wait too long.

861
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:57,448
Hurry and come.

862
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,674
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE JUN-HYEOK
AND KIM IL-JUNG

863
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:39,907
Do you still like me?

864
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,451
Tell me you like me.

865
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,703
Why do I have to feel sorry for you?

866
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,789
I guess you are starting
to have feelings for me.

867
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,666
I know you better than anyone.

868
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,002
Please go on a date with me. It's my wish.

869
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,670
Enough is enough.

870
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:53,671
-Gosh.
-Yi-seo!

871
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:55,173
Whatever I say,

872
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:56,841
he needs to have me around him.

873
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,843
I have to be someone he needs.

874
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,054
When are you going to stop
using Yi-seo like that?

875
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,555
If IC Co. disappears,

876
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,015
will you let go of Yi-seo?

877
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,099
Yi-seo.

878
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,478
Yi-seo.

879
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:15,109
