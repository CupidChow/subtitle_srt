PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:27,504
Saeroyi!

4
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,135
Saeroyi!

5
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,362
Is this 911? Someone got hit by a car.

6
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,324
Can you track the location? Hurry.
Come as soon as possible!

7
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,576
Saeroyi.

SEUNG-KWON

10
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,345
Hey, Geun-soo.

11
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,890
Come on, guys. Get him.

12
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,142
Hello?

13
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,313
Seung-kwon! Yi-seo has been kidnapped.

14
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,857
And Saeroyi is hurt. Can you--

15
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,817
Shut up, you little shit.

16
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,531
Geun-soo.

17
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,876
Take him.

18
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,994
I feel like I've seen this before.

19
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,797
Try to understand, brother.

20
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,009
Business is business.

21
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,470
Go check.

22
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:41,888
-Yes, boss.
-Yes, boss.

23
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,145
Damn it. Let's go.

24
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,414
-Give us the rundown.
-Age 34.

25
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,417
He's a TA victim. His vitals are good,
but he's unconscious.

26
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,210
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

27
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,754
Be careful.

28
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,381
Let's go.

29
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,225
-You must wait here.
-What's going on?

30
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,352
-You cannot come in.
-Let go. I said, let go!

31
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,397
-You cannot enter.
-Saeroyi!

32
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,488
Sir, can you talk?

33
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,490
Sir.

34
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,709
Last night, Park Saeroyi,
the CEO of IC Co.

35
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,295
was injured in a hit-and-run accident

36
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,340
that took place near a reservoir in Pajin.

37
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,890
MS. KANG, IT'S AN EMERGENCY!

38
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,974
PARK SAEROYI HOSPITALIZED

39
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,145
What's wrong?

40
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,068
Mr. Oh.

41
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,612
Did something happen?

42
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,284
EPISODE 15

43
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,748
Where's Yi-seo?

44
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,125
Not sure. I can't reach her.

45
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,545
I don't know where she is.

46
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,134
-Where have you been?
-I had to take care of something.

47
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,514
-Mr. Oh, can I talk to you for a minute?
-What?

48
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,808
-Me?
-Yes.

49
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,655
What? She was kidnapped?

50
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,826
I checked the CCTV footage.

51
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,246
-I'm sure of it.
-Who are these bastards--

52
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,831
They kidnapped her from this hospital.

53
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,251
Anyway, this is Saeroyi's phone.

54
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,920
DON'T CALL ANYONE AND COME ALONE

55
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,422
Does this mean

56
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,133
the hit-and-run was also...

57
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,011
We'll find out.

58
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,722
I have to go somewhere.

59
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,016
Please stay by Saeroyi's side.

60
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,686
Hey, where are you going?
We should report this to the police first.

61
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,522
You read the text. "Come alone."

62
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,944
I bet they took Yi-seo and Geun-soo
and threatened Saeroyi.

63
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,863
-We can't involve the cops.
-Then what?

64
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,823
What will you do all by yourself?

65
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,423
I want to check something.

66
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,508
I think I know who did this.

67
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,596
A hit-and-run?

68
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,940
-Park Saeroyi?
-Yes, sir.

69
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,609
He was taken to the hospital last night.

70
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,320
He's unconscious at the moment.

71
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,282
Bring Geun-soo to me.

72
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,410
Mr. Jang Geun-soo

73
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,664
didn't come to work today.

74
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,125
We can't even get a hold of him
at the moment, sir.

75
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,128
What?

76
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,598
"Park Saeroyi,
the CEO of restaurant company IC Co.

77
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,935
was injured in a hit-and-run accident,

78
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,354
which took place
near a reservoir in Pajin City.

79
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,357
He was transported
to the hospital right away,

80
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,484
but he..."

81
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,031
He died!

82
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,416
That's my wishful thinking. Unfortunately,

83
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,211
he's just in critical condition.

84
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,838
Jang Geun-won.

85
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,383
I'm your brother.

86
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,469
I'm your big brother, you prick.

87
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,934
You got what you wanted,

88
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,646
-so let Yi-seo go.
-What are you talking about?

89
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,485
Do you know what my last mission was
when I was at Jangga Co.?

90
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,989
"Bring Jo Yi-seo to Jangga Co."

91
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,745
I had to waste four years behind bars

92
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,331
because of that damn recording.

93
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:04,669
No.

94
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,673
You ended up in that mess because of Dad.

95
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,801
Because Dad deserted you.

96
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,224
He chose Jangga Co.

97
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,852
over his son.

98
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,481
-Shut up.
-You crazy bastard.

99
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,112
You can't make Jangga Co. yours
by doing this.

100
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,412
Do you think I did all this just to make
the company mine? I'm not a moron.

101
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,166
Park Saeroyi.

102
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,130
Park Saeroyi is still alive.

103
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,358
This little bitch here is the key.

104
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,526
Jang Geun-won!

105
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,532
Both Saeroyi and you

106
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,244
ran here to save this bitch,

107
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,079
so I'm obviously on the right track here,

108
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,123
aren't I?

109
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,255
What did she say?

110
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,177
"I love Park Saeroyi like crazy"?

111
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,229
He's on the brink of death
because he came to save you.

112
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,356
How do you feel?

113
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,191
Jang Geun-won.

114
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,403
You bastard.

115
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,542
Gosh, I feel better
now that I've seen that face.

116
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,345
This isn't something you can cover up.

117
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,514
How will you deal with the consequences?

118
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,233
If I had worried about the consequences,

119
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,485
you two would already be dead.

120
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,450
You crazy freaks.

121
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,091
That psycho.

122
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,520
Hey.

123
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,774
Are you all right?

124
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,194
His goal is to torment me,
so I just have to act like I'm suffering.

125
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,863
He tied you up so well,

126
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,824
but not me. It's so obvious.

127
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,508
I need to stop by the office.

128
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,177
When will you pay me the rest?

129
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,179
"The rest"?

130
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,015
Come on. The job's not done yet.

131
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,603
Enough is enough, okay?

132
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,941
Saeroyi and I are on bad terms now,
but I've known him for ten years.

133
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,861
I did everything you asked me to do,
so don't give me that bullshit.

134
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,364
Ten years?

135
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,423
Hey.

136
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,550
What's so funny?

137
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,305
Then why did you hit him with the van?

138
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,895
Obviously because a billion won
matters more to you than those ten years.

139
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,274
Then just work like a dog.

140
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,402
Don't even try to act like you're human.

141
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,493
Watch your words.

142
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,748
What are you going to do if I lose it?

143
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,794
If you don't need the money,
you can do whatever you want.

144
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,303
You said you have to go.

145
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,708
You need to see this, sir.
Things are getting out of hand.

146
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,545
Jang Geun-won, that psycho,
is being reckless.

147
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,714
It worries me, sir.

148
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,050
Why don't we just call it quits now?

149
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,762
Boss!

150
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,265
Hee-hoon, are you there?

151
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,393
Hee-hoon!

152
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,938
Gosh, how long has it been?

153
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,399
Hey, how have you been?

154
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,901
Where's Big Boss? Is he inside?

155
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,112
He's not here at the moment.
Come back another time.

156
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,738
Really?

157
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,951
I want to see him because
it's been a while. Can I wait inside?

158
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,953
Sorry, but you can't.

159
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,958
I told you that he's not here now.

160
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,420
-What?
-Just leave.

161
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,255
Don't cause trouble, please.

162
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,426
Okay, I should leave if he's not here.

163
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,303
But you.

164
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,141
What's with that tone?

165
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,375
Why do you look all dazed and confused?

166
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,625
Come on. You're all grown up now.
Don't be such a baby.

167
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,961
Why are you being like this?

168
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,685
I missed you.

169
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,399
You saw me in the morning.

170
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,361
Did something happen at school?

171
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,701
Well...

172
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,540
Maybe I'm just a little tired.

173
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,220
Boss, I know you're in there.
It's me, Seung-kwon.

174
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,304
Hey!

175
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:40,601
Let me in, boss.
Your little brother is here to see you!

176
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,979
-Jeez.
-Hey.

177
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,231
We told you that he's not here.

178
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,775
What the hell are you doing
in front of our office?

179
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,822
Boss, I have something to ask you.
Let me in!

180
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,990
You little fucker.

181
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,535
Just leave, okay?

182
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,626
Did you just kick me?

183
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,171
The situation has changed, you know.

184
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,259
Right.

185
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,845
And I've changed quite a bit too.

186
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,971
What will you do?

187
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,516
-Do you want to fight?
-Hello? This is the police, right?

188
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,436
I'm at Minkang Building
in Donggyo-dong now.

189
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,565
Some gangsters are trying to beat me up.
I'm so scared. Please hurry.

190
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,450
That hurt. Easy, okay?

191
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,953
-My gosh.
-What a freak.

192
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,123
Right? Hey, what are you going to do?

193
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,250
What do you think?

194
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,587
I guess the cops will be here soon.

195
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,672
I think...

196
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,970
the fucker that hurt Saeroyi is here.

197
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,932
That's why I came here,
but you guys assaulted me!

198
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,068
What do you think will happen
if I say that to the cops?

199
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,363
Who'd believe

200
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,657
an ex-con?

201
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,076
So?

202
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,036
Is your life over?

203
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,332
-What?
-You think your life is worth nothing.

204
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,751
Moron.

205
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,049
You guys think
your lives are worth nothing.

206
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,051
You morons.

207
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,390
Like you said, the situation has changed.

208
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,767
The cops will totally believe me

209
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,313
because I'm now...

210
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,985
CHOI SEUNG-KWON, DIRECTOR

211
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,406
...the director of IC Co.

212
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't you dare think
that you can determine my worth.

213
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,383
Wake up.

214
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,301
Please?

215
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,263
Why are you sleeping for so long?

216
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,270
Hey, where are you?

217
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,314
-I'm at the police station.
-What? Why?

218
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,859
Hey, is Soo-ah there by any chance?

219
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,278
Yes. She's here, but...

220
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,422
Have you made many new friends?

221
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,259
Yes.

222
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,097
You remember Soo-ah, right?
We're still good friends.

223
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,059
I met a guy named Ho-jin,
and we get along very well.

224
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,896
And I've gotten close
to my younger friends too.

225
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,859
I'm surprised. It sounds like
you have a lot of friends now.

226
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,321
Right?

227
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,783
Who are the younger friends?

228
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,454
Seung-kwon and Hyun-yi.

229
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,165
There's a guy named Toni as well.

230
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,416
And...

231
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:52,812
And?

232
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,944
Anyway, I have many friends now.
Let's drink.

233
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,571
Can you drink pretty well now?

234
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,615
You said I should learn drinking from you.

235
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,916
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TEAM 1

236
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,132
Seung-kwon.

237
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,678
I can go now, right?

238
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,138
Yes, we'll be in touch.

239
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,557
Take care, Officer.

240
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,225
Hey, wait.

241
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,478
What happened to your face?

242
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:36,855
What the heck happened?

243
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,108
Nothing serious.

244
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,904
Officer, what happened?

245
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:47,449
Well...

246
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,459
You got assaulted? Unilaterally?

247
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,669
Are you an idiot?

248
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,006
What do you want me to do, then?
You told me to quit the bad habit.

249
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,508
I never told you to just get beaten up.

250
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,260
Jeez.

251
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,597
I told you to just send Soo-ah.
Why did you tag along?

252
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,941
Wait here.

253
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,069
Where are you going?

254
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,708
Where are they?

255
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,794
What the hell are you talking about?

256
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,466
This country is such a safe place.
There are CCTV cameras everywhere.

257
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,011
I checked the CCTV footage
from the hospital.

258
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,971
Those bastards that took Yi-seo...

259
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,807
They're in there now.

260
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,728
Why didn't you tell the cops all about it?

261
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,860
I guess you're worried something bad
might happen to those kids.

262
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,321
But you know what?

263
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,950
You've got the wrong person.

264
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,247
From what I remember,

265
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,251
we were never bullies.

266
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,096
I'm mad about what happened to Saeroyi,
but I'm trying my best to hold my anger.

267
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,474
Just remember this one thing.

268
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,018
Yi-seo and Geun-soo.

269
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,313
If they get hurt or don't come back,

270
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,358
you'll be totally screwed.

271
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,529
I, Choi Seung-kwon,

272
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,865
will give up on living a decent life.

273
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,431
Let's go.

274
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,725
We need to finish the job.

275
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,560
Yes, sir.

276
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,074
What's going on? Who is he?

277
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,743
What was that about?

278
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:40,998
Soo-ah.

279
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,680
How is he?

280
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,682
I heard

281
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,435
he's still unconscious.

282
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,692
It was all Geun-won's doing.

283
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,867
Geun-soo and Jo Yi-seo of IC Co.
have gone missing.

284
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,702
And Saeroyi's hit-and-run accident.

285
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,580
Can all of it be a coincidence?

286
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,752
Even if Geun-won is a complete idiot...

287
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,838
Kidnapping and attempted murder?

288
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:32,966
No way.

289
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,137
He doesn't have the guts
to do such a thing.

290
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,226
The hit-and-run accident

291
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,394
fifteen years ago

292
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,564
and the press conference

293
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,526
you held four years ago

294
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,823
turned him into someone
who's capable of doing such things.

295
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,409
Are you saying

296
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,416
I got this from the director of IC Co.

297
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,181
The people who kidnapped
Jo Yi-seo and Geun-soo.

298
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,516
HOON HOLDINGS

299
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,060
Those images are from the CCTV footage
from their office.

300
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,776
You turned

301
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,072
Geun-won into such a monster.

302
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,532
-Ms. Oh.
-Sir.

303
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,783
Enough!

304
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,388
Yes.

305
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,934
You may be right.

306
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,108
We should be ready.

307
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,612
"Be ready"?

308
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,574
I can't let the company's reputation
get any worse than this.

309
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,827
I should do what I can
to deal with the situation

310
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,663
and cover it up.

311
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,668
"Deal with the situation"?

312
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,797
I guess this is how

313
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,468
you dealt with the accident

314
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,721
that occurred 15 years ago.

315
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,794
You're really something.

316
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,387
What do you plan to do?

317
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,057
Even if you untie me,
we won't be able to escape.

318
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,142
So what?

319
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,812
Should we just give up

320
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,439
and die here?

321
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,987
You idiot.

322
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,699
This is why you can't ever beat our boss.

323
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:50,289
You went to Jangga Co. acting like
you were determined to do something great.

324
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,083
But whenever things got difficult,
you played dirty.

325
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,586
And look where you are now.

326
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,464
I really hate you.

327
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,595
I didn't go to Jangga Co.
because I wanted to.

328
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,724
You don't know what I've been through--

329
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,891
You just

330
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,520
ended up

331
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,731
losing yourself.

332
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,275
No.

333
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,197
Not everyone can be like Saeroyi.

334
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,579
You're wrong.

335
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,336
RESIGNATION LETTER

336
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,924
You told me

337
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,761
that you despise people
who have no backbone

338
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,305
and are easy to control.

339
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,770
For the first time in my life,

340
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,106
I'm choosing what I want to do.

341
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,245
I accept your resignation.

342
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,164
You may leave.

343
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,131
And this has

344
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,259
all the irregularities of Jangga Co.

345
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,178
which I've gathered
for the past ten years.

346
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:36,895
Borrowed-name stocks,
slush funds, illegal requests, bribery--

347
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,773
-How dare you--
-There's a limit

348
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,609
to what you can do to people

349
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,071
with power and fear.

350
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,741
-Ms. Oh.
-You should not

351
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,454
try to cover this up.

352
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,129
You'll have to make sure

353
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,423
the situation doesn't get worse.

354
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,349
Get out

355
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,602
right now.

356
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,767
You should go to university.

357
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,020
You can succeed

358
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,355
and pay me back twofold.

359
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,241
I'll succeed

360
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,078
and pay you back three times the amount.

361
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,707
RESIGNATION LETTER

362
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,539
You think it’s hard
to stick to your principles

363
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:05,001
and be honest about
what you like and dislike,

364
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,045
don’t you?

365
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,716
You're just giving excuses

366
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,678
so you can feel comfortable with yourself.

367
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,478
That doesn't sound very convincing
coming from you.

368
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,606
I know.

369
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,069
Our boss

370
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,446
really is amazing.

371
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,160
Saeroyi

372
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,206
got hit by a car while trying to save me.

373
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,292
If...

374
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,086
If something bad happens to him--

375
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,170
Shut up.

376
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,592
He'll overcome it.

377
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,389
He has never once

378
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,226
disappointed me.

379
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,328
Where are we going?

380
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,929
A place

381
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,225
where you'll no longer have
painful nights.

382
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,155
We're almost there.

383
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,493
We just need to cross this bridge.

384
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,670
THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA

385
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,009
This is nice.

386
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,720
What's nice?

387
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,808
Before, I didn't want to be born again

388
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,978
even if reincarnation really existed.

389
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,777
What do you mean?

390
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,533
Living is a difficult thing to do.

391
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:53,753
I bet

392
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,673
you had a tough time.

393
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,016
Yes.

394
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,145
It was tough.

395
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,650
"I can do this.

396
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,404
Everything will be fine."

397
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,950
I kept telling myself that
and tried really hard.

398
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,622
But the truth is,

399
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,338
my life

400
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,013
always felt so burdensome.

401
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,940
I missed you...

402
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,945
And living my life

403
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,532
based on hatred

404
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,621
was really difficult.

405
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,800
Can I hug you?

406
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,262
What?

407
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,822
If I get the chance to be born again,

408
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,617
I want to be born as your son.

409
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,579
My goodness.

410
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,417
You keep acting like a little kid.

411
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,297
I love you

412
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,635
so much.

413
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:10,974
Yes.

414
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:13,935
I love you, too.

415
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,027
Life is so tough.

416
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,989
But now that I met you,

417
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,867
I finally understand

418
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,202
what this part really means.

419
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:35,498
"WAS THAT LIFE? WELL THEN! ONCE MORE!"

420
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,477
Dad.

421
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,358
Have a peaceful trip.

422
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,029
What?

423
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,117
I'm not going with you.

424
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,165
Saeroyi.

425
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,418
"Was that life?

426
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,422
Well then!

427
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:26,633
Once more!"

428
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,264
I have a date.

429
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,688
Son.

430
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,985
I'm sorry.

431
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:52,867
I don't mind

432
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,955
having to spend
all those endless nights again.

433
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:01,876
Actually,

434
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,420
my nights

435
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,342
aren't that painful anymore.

436
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,352
I have friends who need me.

437
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,360
And I'm curious about what kind of future
we'll be spending together.

438
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,572
I look forward to it.

439
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,786
They give me joy.

440
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,684
I know

441
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,229
you're no longer with me.

442
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,819
But I'm going to

443
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,738
embrace

444
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:14,991
my yearning heart.

445
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,954
And I'll continue to live my life.

446
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,136
You finally got it, Saeroyi.

447
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,099
That's what life is.

448
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,731
You can overcome anything

449
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,859
as long as you're alive.

450
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,403
I really mean it.

451
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,188
I am

452
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,194
so proud of you, my son.

453
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,334
Keep on

454
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,419
living

455
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:56,968
this way,

456
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,888
my son.

457
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,147
Saeroyi.

458
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,319
Are you okay?

459
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,364
Can you hear me?

460
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:42,990
Hey.

461
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,828
Are you okay?

462
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,166
And just like that,
Saeroyi continued to cry

463
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,544
for a pretty long time.

464
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,840
It was my first time seeing him cry.

465
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,051
And I

466
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,387
had no idea what those tears

467
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,306
really meant.

468
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,561
I had no clue.

469
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,606
But for some reason,

470
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:05,031
I felt relieved.

471
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:33,893
Dad.

472
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,691
It's me, Geun-won.

473
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,944
Don't tell me you are now--

474
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:44,945
That's right.

475
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,199
Jo Yi-seo and Geun-soo.

476
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,659
I'm holding them hostage.

477
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:54,830
How dare you--

478
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,624
Don't worry about Geun-soo though.

479
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,171
You value Jangga Co.
over even your own life.

480
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,800
And he's your successor.

481
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,011
I won't hurt him.

482
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,225
Are you in your right mind?

483
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,518
Not really.

484
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,562
How would I be in my right mind?

485
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,940
Where are you now?

486
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,527
I can't take care of things
without knowing where you are.

487
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,283
You know what, Dad?

488
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,036
I wanted

489
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,501
to be a proud son to you.

490
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,426
When do you think
things started to go wrong?

491
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,516
The day I first met Park Saeroyi?

492
00:48:57,226 --> 00:49:00,354
Or the day I caused
the hit-and-run accident?

493
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,108
That day...

494
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,027
Saeroyi

495
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,822
is just livestock.

496
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,457
Do you remember the day
when I twisted that chicken's neck?

497
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,257
I managed to put up with the whole thing
thanks to that day.

498
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,387
"Park Saeroyi is a livestock.

499
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,226
I don't have to feel guilty
when I eat chicken or pork."

500
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:42,938
Only then

501
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,483
I could hold out.

502
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,738
But the thing is

503
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,955
I've always been scared.

504
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,709
-Geun-won--
-But...

505
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,554
But I'm not like that anymore.

506
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,936
Now I understand what you've said.

507
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,313
I owe it all to you.

508
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:27,816
What?

509
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,944
I'm sick and tired of everything.

510
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,657
He's just a brute.

511
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,993
But he made you abandon your own son.

512
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,371
Park Saeroyi.

513
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,751
I will put an end to everything.

514
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,296
To him and even to myself.

515
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,175
Geun-won. You--

516
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,719
I'm in the deserted warehouse
in Pajin now.

517
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:57,763
I told you.

518
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,891
I owe it all to you.

519
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,686
So...

520
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,693
you are the only person who can stop me.

521
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,030
It's up to you.

522
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,785
If you want to stop me,

523
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:21,912
like you did before,

524
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,126
you can just abandon me again.

525
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,629
I'm hanging up.

526
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,090
Geun-won. Geun-won!

527
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,872
You don't have much time left here, Dad.

528
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,793
So I'd like to get you a little present.

529
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,320
Done. Let's go.

530
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,202
What are you doing? We have to go.

531
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,412
If I do this now,

532
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,998
I will be able to plead self-defense.

533
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,458
What?

534
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,836
If Geun-won stays alive,

535
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,922
he will...

536
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,843
-He will harm Boss again.
-Damn it!

537
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,766
What if you kill someone just to help him?

538
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,102
Do you think he will be happy?

539
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,646
Please. Let's just go.

540
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,157
Stop.

541
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,742
Stop right there.

542
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,411
Stop.

543
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,121
Stay there!

544
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,082
Damn it!

545
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:35,838
Wait, Saeroyi.

546
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,136
You almost got killed.

547
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,390
-Calm yourself down and--
-I have to go.

548
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,768
Where?

549
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,938
What can you do in this condition?

550
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,607
You should call the police instead.

551
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,568
It will put Yi-seo in danger.

552
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,865
What Geun-won wants is me.

553
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,828
If you go there,
what difference does it make?

554
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,873
You're just going there to die.

555
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,543
Soo-ah.

556
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,380
Please.

557
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,133
I'm begging you.

558
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:30,309
What if something happens to you?
Then I'll just--

559
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,810
You asked me before.

560
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,609
If I like Yi-seo.

561
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,159
I do.

562
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,673
You're such a fool.

563
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,218
Everyone knew it

564
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,304
except you.

565
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,150
Still, you can't go.

566
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:24,947
-You can't.
-Am I going there to die?

567
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:27,658
No.

568
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,744
I'm going there to survive.

569
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,252
I'm afraid.

570
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:43,423
If something happens to Yi-seo,

571
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,885
Then I will really be destroyed.

572
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,147
Saeroyi, please.

573
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,775
I should go.

574
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:23,922
Are you all right?

575
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,092
This way.

576
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,265
Can you run?

577
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,814
Stop right there, you idiots!

578
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,190
You go first.

579
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,287
You're really about to die.

580
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,998
Let me take care of it and stay in bed.

581
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,250
You know,

582
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,545
going to Jang Geun-won now

583
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,297
will be very dangerous.

584
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:07,716
What?

585
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:11,219
Still, I need you to come with me.

586
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,723
My gosh.

587
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,732
MY FATHER KNOWS WHERE I AM
JANG GEUN-WON

588
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:26,860
We should hurry.

589
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,030
Where?

590
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,881
Damn it.

591
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,596
Damn it.

592
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,848
I've been waiting for you.

593
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,309
I'm not a fraud.

594
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,520
Like you said, I get paid for my job.

595
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,438
I should wrap things up.

596
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,243
Forget about Park Saeroyi.

597
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,538
I want you to die, Jo Yi-seo.

598
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,069
Park Saeroyi.

599
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,117
Where's Jang Geun-won?

600
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,913
How dare you barge in at this late hour.

601
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,833
What crap are you talking about?

602
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:06,877
Geun-won

603
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,339
kidnapped Yi-seo.

604
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:16,845
Did you know that?

605
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,349
Who said my son

606
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,685
did such a thing?

607
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,062
I talked to him on the phone.

608
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,692
And he texted me
that you know where he is now.

609
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,202
If you pretend not to know about it,

610
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,163
it will go to the police.

611
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,337
You'd want to keep Jangga Co. safe.

612
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:58,887
Where's Geun-won?

613
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,185
I set up Jangga Co.

614
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,106
so my whole family can live in clover

615
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,902
without starving like I did.

616
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,655
It's all about Jangga Co.

617
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,741
I wonder what it is for.

618
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,578
What's the point

619
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,624
of my life?

620
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,003
When do you think
things started to go wrong?

621
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:35,924
Come to think of it...

622
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,141
This is all

623
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,518
because of you.

624
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,398
Where is he?

625
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,778
It's been over a decade.

626
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,950
Ten years is an epoch.

627
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,412
But you jerk

628
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,498
haven't changed.

629
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,186
I made up my mind some time ago.

630
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,730
But it turned out

631
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:36,568
to be the hardest thing to do.

632
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,197
Chairman Jang.

633
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:46,995
Will you

634
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,457
kneel before me?

635
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,220
What is that old bastard talking about?

636
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,306
Your son is holding someone hostage.

637
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:09,017
Damn it.

638
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,655
There are things that are impossible.

639
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,701
Something above death.

640
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,996
I want you to kneel before my son
and apologize

641
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,581
for what you did.

642
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,669
I can't apologize to Geun-won.

643
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,255
Because

644
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,132
I don't feel sorry at all.

645
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,342
If you self-reflect

646
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,011
and apologize to my son on your knees...

647
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,107
Your son is the one

648
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,069
who should get on his knees.

649
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:10,120
Kneeling before Chairman Jang Dae-hee

650
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,248
is one.

651
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,216
But...

652
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,328
Right

653
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,669
at this moment

654
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,529
I'm willing to do it thousands of times.

655
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,118
Saeroyi.

656
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,094
There's nothing

657
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,275
easier than this.

658
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,367
SPECIAL THANKS TO SON HYUN-JOO

659
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:18,248
"WAS THAT LIFE? WELL THEN! ONCE MORE!"

660
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,109
