1
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,140
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,767
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,128
Are you crying?

4
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,215
How did you know I'd be here?

5
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,634
You're

6
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,929
quite predictable, you know.

7
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,224
Hyun-yi, I...

8
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,144
I want to be alone now.

9
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,775
I think this is my first time
seeing you cry.

10
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,902
You can actually cry.

11
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,656
I said I want to be alone.

12
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,324
You got rejected, right?

13
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,702
I guess it was expected.

14
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,915
He probably said work keeps him too busy

15
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,334
or use Geun-soo or his age as an excuse.

16
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,003
He has many excuses.

17
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,547
What?

18
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,508
You heard?

19
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,136
It's just obvious.

20
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,097
Just try to understand him.
He's old-fashioned, you know.

21
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,187
So what will you do now?

22
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,150
About what?

23
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,402
About Saeroyi.

24
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,612
Are you going to give up?

25
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,452
EPISODE 12

26
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,662
We came in second once again.

27
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,873
I gave you two chances,

28
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,250
and you failed both times.

29
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,129
What's your excuse?

30
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,632
I apologize, sir.
I don't have any excuses.

31
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,055
I can't fire you over this.

32
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,059
But what am I going to do about my anger?

33
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,189
So it's the final round, right?

34
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,693
If we don't win this time,

35
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,571
Mr. Park Jun-gi will get fired.

36
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,614
I know

37
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,325
you talked about
becoming the heir of the company,

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,453
but that won't happen if he gets fired.

39
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,835
Then,

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,087
give me the authority.

41
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,799
-"Authority"?
-Yes.

42
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,221
I'd like full authority
over all the matters related to the show.

43
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,098
What?

44
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,601
I have a bottom-level position
in the planning team.

45
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,479
What do you think I can do now?

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,275
So you're saying you can do

47
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,361
what Ms. Oh can't?

48
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,490
If I was in charge, I'd at least

49
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,701
have no regrets.

50
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,182
Okay, you are in charge.

51
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,269
Ms. Oh, give him all the support he needs.

52
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,521
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:33,940
You may leave.

54
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,579
I'm sorry for not consulting you first.

55
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,581
About what?

56
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,208
The show.

57
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,336
I didn't consult you first
and put you in an awkward position.

58
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,928
You're volunteering
to take responsibility,

59
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,180
so I don't mind.

60
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,184
Thank you for understanding.

61
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,021
But I feel bad for you.

62
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,941
-Pardon?
-That conversation.

63
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,570
It wasn't a conversation
between a father and son.

64
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,990
Shouldn't you be there for each other
in difficult times?

65
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,743
That's what family is for.

66
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,456
The incident with Mr. Park... And today...

67
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,502
You now seem quite different
from when you were at DanBam.

68
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,190
-Enjoy.
-Here's your stir-fried pork belly.

69
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,067
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

70
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,153
-We'd like one soft tofu stew.
-One soft tofu stew?

71
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,119
This is the last bottle.
Why isn't the fridge stocked?

72
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,205
Sorry, we didn't order enough soju.

73
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,831
-Go next-door and borrow some.
-Okay.

74
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,584
-Coming!
-I got this.

75
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,423
You want a break?

76
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,925
You mean, you want to leave DanBam?

77
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,595
Because of yesterday?

78
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,305
Of course not.

79
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,974
I've invested so much in DanBam.

80
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,938
I can keep my emotions separate.

81
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,733
It's just that I've been working nonstop
without a day off.

82
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,652
I want to clear my head.

83
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,613
After The Best Pub is over
and we get our franchise--

84
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,823
No, that's okay.

85
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,117
You should do it when you need a break.

86
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,620
You've been working very hard.

87
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,789
Go rest up.

88
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,377
Yes, coming.

89
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,513
Don't like me.

90
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,810
I'm such a loser.

91
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,563
I miss him already.

92
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,898
Why don't you take some time off?

93
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,068
They say familiarity can confuse you.

94
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,532
I think you both need to take
some time apart and think things through.

95
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,789
I should just go back to work soon.

96
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,929
RESTRICTED

97
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,353
Hello?

98
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,689
Dad.

99
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,945
I wasn't really sure

100
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,491
if I should call you or not.

101
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,786
Even though
it's just a son calling a father.

102
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,374
Well...

103
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,169
Ms. Oh told me how you're doing.

104
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,633
Even when you decided to desert me,

105
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,970
I thought, "He had no choice.

106
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,099
I'm sure there was no other way.

107
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,521
His own son is locked up in this hellhole.

108
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,692
He must be heartbroken."

109
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,906
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

110
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,493
What is it that you want to say?

111
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,121
Why...

112
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,087
Why must you do this to me?

113
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,132
It's all

114
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,930
for Jangga Co.'s sake.

115
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,204
Did you ask for me?

116
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,878
KOREA'S MANAGEMENT PRIZE
JANGGA PUB

117
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,715
I heard DanBam has managed
to secure an investment

118
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,633
of nearly ten billion won.

119
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,470
What about it?

120
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,266
They'll use that money
to franchise DanBam.

121
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,477
They got wings now,

122
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,607
yet you seem unconcerned.

123
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,242
Wings...

124
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,757
-How much time do we have?
-About an hour?

125
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,091
-Shall we take a break?
-Sure.

126
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,308
Why did Yi-seo have to take today off
of all days?

127
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,186
She's been working nonstop, you know.
She deserves some rest.

128
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,563
I'm fine with her taking some time off.

129
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,273
But did she really have to go now?

130
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,274
Saeroyi.

131
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,287
FOR LEASE

132
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,873
"For lease"? What's going on?

133
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,467
-The receiver cannot be reached...
-He won't pick up.

134
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,140
It's okay. We don't need that jerk.
We still have other investors...

135
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,627
WE ARE CANCELING OUR INVESTMENT
WE CAN'T INVEST IN YOU

136
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,338
An investment withdrawal?

137
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,258
WE CANNOT INVEST IN DANBAM

138
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,426
Why?

139
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,594
Why are they withdrawing their investment?

140
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,430
It's natural for them to do this.

141
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,434
The lead investor withdrew the investment,
so the others are doing the same.

142
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,019
What's that supposed to mean?

143
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,271
To put it simply,

144
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:14,108
the others only invested in your brand
because they saw the article

145
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,653
saying JM Holdings decided to invest
five billion won.

146
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,865
But JM Holdings announced
that they're going to withdraw...

147
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,993
-So the other investors...
-Withdrew their investment as well.

148
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,703
Then what are we going to do?

149
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,789
We leased out an office, hired new staff,
and gathered store owners.

150
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,042
We already spent 500 million won,
but we haven't even started yet.

151
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,879
You could've waited
until you got the investment.

152
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,714
Why were you in such a rush?

153
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,634
-Well, Yi-seo--
-It was my decision.

154
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,517
Why did that investor
suddenly decide to withdraw?

155
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,645
I'm not sure, but this is very malicious.

156
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,065
But there is one person
that comes up on my mind...

157
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,905
Tell him to come in.

158
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,784
Mr. Do, you're here.

159
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,247
Hello, sir.

160
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,333
It's been a long time.

161
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,769
Hello, sir.
This is Jo Yi-seo, DanBam's manager.

162
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,270
Have you been...

163
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,022
Hello?

164
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,744
All I'm saying is,
it's safer to open locations one by one

165
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:52,164
than to open multiple franchise locations
at once.

166
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,377
There's this thing
I asked Ho-jin to look into it,

167
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,421
-and I want to think about it.
-Then what?

168
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,132
It's not like we can stop the bus
once it leaves.

169
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:06,971
Are you confident?

170
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,974
-Yes.
-Okay then.

171
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,561
Let's do it. Because I trust you the most.

172
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,523
-What are you going to do now?
-How is this possible?

173
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,275
-What is this nonsense?
-This is absurd!

174
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,194
-This is driving me crazy!
-How could you?

175
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,156
-I can't believe this!
-This is totally crazy!

176
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,074
-Where is that bitch?
-Sir, please.

177
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,701
-Please stop.
-She said I could trust you

178
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,620
because your brand came out on TV.

179
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,914
I trusted her
and borrowed 300 million won!

180
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,624
It was my husband's severance pay!

181
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,708
What are you going to do?

182
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,793
They all withdrew their investment!
Now what?

183
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,213
You said you're confident
and asked us to trust you.

184
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,382
Look how we ended up after trusting her.

185
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,301
What are we going to do?

186
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,886
Can you take responsibility?

187
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,804
I'm sorry, but please calm down.

188
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,973
-So what if you're sorry?
-Our lives are at stake!

189
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,184
An apology won't cut it!

190
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,240
FROM CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

191
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,873
KNOW YOUR PLACE AND BE SATISFIED
WITH WHAT YOU HAVE

192
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,512
Did you

193
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,556
plan all this?

194
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,394
Yes.

195
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,771
Since when?

196
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,192
Since the beginning.

197
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,948
Who would invest five billion won
in that tiny pub?

198
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,742
They've lost people's trust,

199
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,662
so not many people will want
to invest in them anymore.

200
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,748
And the harder he tries,

201
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,711
the harder he'll fall and collapse.

202
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,299
You did all this just to crush Saeroyi?

203
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,892
JM Holdings has
an interior design company.

204
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,229
We recently signed a partnership,
and that's when I asked him to do this.

205
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,692
You think I did this
just to crush Saeroyi?

206
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,782
That would've been
a good enough reason for me to do this.

207
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,452
But that's not why.

208
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,205
It's hard to have control over JM Holdings

209
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,749
because they have a solid footing.

210
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,710
So I needed to show them

211
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,755
that I could be

212
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,425
a petty old man

213
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,510
at times.

214
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,559
You really are

215
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,728
unbelievable.

216
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,357
You asked if I'm sure
DanBam is a small fish tank

217
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,613
and that Saeroyi is a strong person.

218
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,201
How do you feel seeing him from here?

219
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,461
It's true that I'm impressed by you.

220
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,298
But I don't understand.

221
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,010
If this is all it takes to bring him down,

222
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,597
why would you be bothered by him?

223
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,852
He must be something more.

224
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,819
-What are you going to do?
-This is absurd!

225
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,945
Enough!

226
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,573
My gosh.

227
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,494
You have no right to yell at us.

228
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,954
What did I do wrong?

229
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,997
Are you kidding me?

230
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,126
-They all withdrew their investments!
-So what?

231
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,671
Did you all go bankrupt?

232
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,468
You have no right
to mistreat my employees this way!

233
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,470
-Boss.
-You think we're mistreating them?

234
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,472
Why do you think
we signed up for this franchise?

235
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,559
We trusted that the business will succeed
and gathered every single penny

236
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,103
-so we could start our own DanBam pub--
-What did you trust?

237
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,648
The investment? JM Holdings?

238
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,608
What gained your trust?

239
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,528
Did you all sign a deal
only after you read an article?

240
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,071
Is that all we're worth?

241
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,239
No!

242
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,409
You all signed a deal after you came here.

243
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,119
You decided after you tasted our food!

244
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,080
You all signed a contract
because you liked the taste of the food

245
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,999
that beat all the other
famous restaurants!

246
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,336
What changed?

247
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,173
Did the taste of our food change?

248
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,677
If you don't want to do it, then don't.

249
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,346
Just cancel the deal
instead of causing trouble like this!

250
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,976
Then what?
The investors withdrew their investments.

251
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,562
How are you going to take care
of all these store-owners?

252
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,980
Can you afford to do that?

253
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,193
-See?
-Yes, I can.

254
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:04,119
There needs to be trust
when it comes to business.

255
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,917
And our company will not take
your money and trust

256
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,628
for granted.

257
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,380
Regardless of the investment withdrawal,

258
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,134
we will keep the promise we made
regarding the schedule and support.

259
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,100
CONGRATULATORY MEETING

260
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,750
KNOW YOUR PLACE AND BE SATISFIED
WITH WHAT YOU HAVE

261
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,086
Saeroyi!

262
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,631
Wait.

263
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,009
You don't have any money.

264
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,345
-What do you plan to do?
-What do you think?

265
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,013
I'll take out a mortgage loan.

266
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,100
But you worked so hard
to buy that building.

267
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,560
-I have no other--
-How about...

268
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,148
How about you just stop?

269
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,695
-What?
-You keep getting scarred

270
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,989
and hurt.

271
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,868
-I'm fine.
-Then what about me?

272
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,834
Do you know how I felt
when I had to bring that plant over here

273
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,546
for Chairman Jang?

274
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,550
Until when...

275
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,554
Until when do I need to be so harsh?

276
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,308
-Soo-ah--
-Remember what you said?

277
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,728
You let me choose

278
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,441
what we mean to each other.

279
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,572
Your revenge on Jangga Co.

280
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,783
Your resentment.

281
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,037
Forget the whole thing

282
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,124
and come to me.

283
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,006
Stop everything.

284
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,259
Let's be happy.

285
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,595
Please?

286
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,236
JO YI-SEO

287
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,532
Hello?

288
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,159
Boss.

289
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,412
I'm really sorry.

290
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,248
I shouldn't have pushed it.

291
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,585
I made the final decision.

292
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,922
-But--
-I'm the president of the company.

293
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,010
Don't be too hard on yourself.

294
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,554
You told me that I'm worth
betting your life on.

295
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,389
So I want you

296
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,684
to trust me.

297
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,271
This isn't enough

298
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,866
to destroy me.

299
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,957
This doesn't bother me at all.
What bothered me was

300
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,585
when my dad got fired

301
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,381
just because I stuck to my principles.

302
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,176
Saeroyi.

303
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,847
It was when my dad passed away
due to a hit-and-run

304
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,682
and the truth behind his death
got covered up.

305
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,977
I already collapsed once.

306
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,313
The reason I was able
to get back on my feet

307
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,942
was because I wanted to get revenge.
And before I achieve that,

308
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,614
I will never be happy.

309
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,330
Boss.

310
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,707
My goal

311
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,669
is to destroy Jangga Co.

312
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,089
And before that, I will never give up

313
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,426
or stop.

314
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,438
I'm going to hang up now.

315
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,565
Let's talk later.

316
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,804
I'm sorry.

317
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,314
I'm sorry.

318
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,780
HANGUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY ROOM

319
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,573
JM HOLDINGS WITHDRAWS INVESTMENT ON DANBAM

320
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,993
Chestnut is in trouble.

321
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,496
The investment withdrawal?

322
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,414
Don't you need to go?

323
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,375
He told me everything is fine.

324
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,253
If our boss says everything is okay,

325
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,421
it means everything is okay.

326
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,055
LIST OF INVESTORS

327
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,642
It's a list of investors
who are interested in the food business.

328
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,310
The list is too long.

329
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,145
I'll have to meet...

330
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,612
I told you to rest.

331
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,700
How can I rest in this situation?

332
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,624
What did I say?

333
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,293
-I told you that--
-Yes, I know.

334
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,714
You're the president,
and you made the final choice.

335
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,425
But what about me?

336
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,635
I'm still a manger, you know.

337
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,393
I feel so ashamed of what happened.

338
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,523
And it wasn't easy for me
to brazenly come back here.

339
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,193
But if you still think of me
as your manager,

340
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,488
please give me one more chance.

341
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,826
She's right.

342
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,787
Why are you struggling
when you have a smart manager?

343
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,622
Here.

344
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,544
Take a look at the names I've underlined.

345
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,504
They'll be interested in your business.

346
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,766
What? Is it someone you know?

347
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,021
KIM SOON-RYE, EARLY 70S, YONGSAN RESIDENT

348
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,409
She owns tons of real estate.

349
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,078
She's retired.

350
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,288
But she sometimes surprises people.

351
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,248
How exactly?

352
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,752
She sometimes invests a lot of money
on start-up companies.

353
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,463
I see.

354
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,674
-I wonder why.
-Well...

355
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,386
Maybe it's a hobby of hers.

356
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,140
Thank you for coming here.

357
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,728
What brings you all the way here, Ms. Kim?

358
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,609
You've aged a lot.

359
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,696
That's how much time has passed.

360
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,657
I know, right?

361
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,452
No one can beat time.

362
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,791
I still remember the days
when you used to work hard

363
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,585
during the beginning years
of your business.

364
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,006
Yes, I remember.

365
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,800
Back then,

366
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,429
I was impressed by you.

367
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:50,186
May I ask you why you sound so upset?

368
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:56,818
There's a kid who reminds me of you
back when you were young.

369
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,862
His name is Park Saeroyi.

370
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:05,201
Why would you bully this kid at your age?

371
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,965
He made my son

372
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,343
go to jail.

373
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,804
I know the story.

374
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,892
Your son is only getting punished
for what he did.

375
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,143
Ma'am.

376
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,065
I'm no longer the poor little kid
you used to know.

377
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,442
My goodness.

378
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,986
You're starting to scare me.

379
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,116
Why do you care about that kid anyway?

380
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,664
I'm indebted to him.

381
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,381
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
mess with him anymore.

382
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,300
That depends on how he behaves.

383
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,010
Even if it upsets me?

384
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,261
There's nothing I can do.

385
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,353
Like you said, he's just a little kid.

386
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,105
Why are you so bothered by him?

387
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,483
I don't know.

388
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,237
At first,

389
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:27,033
I just wanted to teach him a lesson.

390
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,619
But now,

391
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,791
my goal is to get him on his knees.

392
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,795
It's become the last purpose of my life.

393
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,798
My goodness.

394
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,467
You've lost your mind.

395
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,481
RESIGNATION LETTER

396
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,942
OH SOO-AH

397
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,952
Is there something wrong?

398
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,291
No.

399
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,548
I guess it's because
of the investment withdrawal.

400
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,884
I was also shocked.

401
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,261
The more I get to know my dad,

402
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,055
the more I'm amazed by what he can do.

403
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,102
What do you mean?

404
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,146
What?

405
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,899
He planted a lead investor as a mole

406
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,568
and made all the investors
turn their backs on DanBam.

407
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,694
You think that's amazing?

408
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,281
To destroy other people's lives?

409
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,207
When there's an opportunity,

410
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,254
Saeroyi will do the same.

411
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,635
-What?
-My dad and Saeroyi

412
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:10,929
are both the same.

413
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,556
They don't care about how others feel.

414
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,600
They only care about their goals.

415
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,270
To be honest,

416
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,231
I thought you'd be the same.

417
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:33,534
WE ARE CLOSED FOR A WEEK
WE WILL RETURN WITH BETTER SERVICE

418
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,995
We can't run the pub
in this kind of situation.

419
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,666
This week, let's focus on The Best Pub
and finding new investors.

420
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,085
Hyun-yi, focus on The Best Pub.

421
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,670
Seung-kwon will help you.

422
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,754
-Okay.
-Okay.

423
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,382
We will try to find new investors.

424
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,301
-Okay.
-Do Jung-myeong, that asshole.

425
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,846
-It's all my fault.
-What?

426
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,808
-What...
-Stop saying that.

427
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:58,476
I know

428
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,938
this may sound a little brazen.

429
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,317
But I know very well that the four of us

430
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,739
won't give up
because of something like this.

431
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,368
Of course. Who says we'll give up?

432
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,249
Like always, we'll find the right answer.

433
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,583
Let's do our best

434
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,836
to overcome this.

435
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,005
Of course.

436
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,725
Thank you.

437
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,271
For what?

438
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,690
Just...

439
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,859
Everything.

440
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,412
Do you feel better now?

441
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,292
What do you mean?

442
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,464
Have you straightened out everything?

443
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,426
About what?

444
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,012
About how I like you?

445
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,519
I like you so much

446
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,689
that it's hard to even explain.

447
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,154
I liked you so much

448
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,491
that I decided to work here
instead of going to college.

449
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,828
You're the only reason

450
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,956
why I chose to work here.

451
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,129
-Yi-seo.
-I don't mind that you don't feel

452
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,006
the same way.

453
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,594
Like you said last time,

454
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,889
this isn't something
that you give and take.

455
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,646
But I still like you.

456
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:14,695
So don't tell me
not to like you or to give up.

457
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,825
I'll just do what I want.
You have no right to tell me what to do.

458
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,539
If you want to fire me
for feeling this way,

459
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,666
go ahead.

460
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,751
I can accept that.

461
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,596
-Are you going to fire me?
-No.

462
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:45,935
I can't do that.

463
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,648
I can't even imagine DanBam

464
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,068
without you.

465
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,948
-You're so selfish.
-Hey.

466
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,706
I'll be satisfied with this for now.

467
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,939
-Hey, Yi-seo.
-Boss, where are you?

468
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,859
-Why aren't you at the pub?
-I'm at the office.

469
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,612
You need to come to the pub.
Come as fast as possible.

470
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,654
Right now?

471
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,418
I can't believe
you're using me as a driver.

472
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,503
My gosh, I would never do that.

473
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,260
Hello, have you been well?

474
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,432
You can sit here, Ms. Kim.

475
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,601
Where is Chestnut?

476
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:11,020
He'll be right here.
Just wait a little bit.

477
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,313
Ms. Kang, you can sit here.

478
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,357
How did you know Ms. Kim and I were close?

479
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,069
Ho-jin told me that she was the first one
to invest in Jangga Co.

480
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,788
-There he is.
-Ms. Kang.

481
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,957
Hey, Ms. Kim.

482
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,751
Say hello. She's been my mentor
ever since I was young.

483
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:37,213
Yes, I already know her.
I heard you're a real estate mogul.

484
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,967
Did you call them?

485
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,052
Boss, hurry up and sit down.

486
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:50,518
I heard all the investors
withdrew their investment.

487
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,479
Yes.

488
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,525
Don't even get me started.
We're in a complete mess.

489
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,819
Toni even took some time off,

490
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,946
so we're really struggling right now.

491
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,991
My goodness,
you must've had everything ready.

492
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,120
Did you find a new investor?

493
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,082
We're trying our best,
but it's really hard.

494
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,172
My goodness, how strange.

495
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,300
You know that I'm rich.

496
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,885
Now that I'm indebted to you,

497
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,139
it's worth asking me for a favor.

498
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,189
My goodness, why is he being so stubborn?

499
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,866
I don't want to use Toni as leverage.

500
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,995
My gosh, he tends to be like this.

501
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,623
I hope you understand, Ms. Kim.
He can be very hardheaded.

502
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,502
Wildcat, he must give you
a really hard time.

503
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,963
My gosh, why are you calling me a wildcat?

504
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,715
Did my behavior upset you?

505
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:06,635
I only acted that way
because you felt like my real grandma.

506
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,681
You don't need to invest in us, ma'am.

507
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,350
Saeroyi.

508
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,731
You're too ahead of yourself.

509
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,901
I don't invest in things that are useless.

510
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,571
You have no money,
and you're not even competent.

511
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,490
But you have a huge dream.

512
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,409
My goodness.

513
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,370
All the staff are struggling,

514
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,373
but the president
only cares about his pride.

515
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,875
The only thing that matters
is your integrity.

516
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,588
Who would invest in a fool like you?

517
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,256
They'll lose their money for sure.

518
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,966
Forget it.

519
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,885
Ms. Kim.

520
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,721
Ms. Kim.

521
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,521
I agree with her.

522
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,022
Ms. Kang.

523
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,233
Remember what you said to me once?

524
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,821
You told me that you'll never let anyone
mistreat you or your staff.

525
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,740
You think you can keep your pride
and also have freedom?

526
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,244
That's nonsense.

527
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,205
Do you know something?

528
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,127
Freedom comes at a price.

529
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,859
JO YI-SEO
PRIVATE ACCOUNT

530
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,235
Since the first episode,

531
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,195
Hyun-yi has become quite popular.

532
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,742
I mean, she's a lot more attractive
than a fat middle-aged man.

533
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,120
She's pretty and cooks well.

534
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,498
The show is definitely focused on her.

535
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,208
I don't think it's about taste.

536
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,003
It looks more like a popularity vote.

537
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,842
I have a high card
that I don't want to use.

538
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,261
A high card you don't want to use?

539
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,054
What do you mean?

540
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,475
COMPELLING WINNING STREAK

JANGGA PUB, JANG CAFE
JANGGA RAMYEON

542
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,712
Did you get off work?

543
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,257
Yes.

544
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,803
What are you doing
in front of Jangga Co.'s building?

545
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,517
I came to the neighborhood
for investment issues.

546
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,144
Oh,

547
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,104
I see.

548
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,567
Were you avoiding me?

549
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,238
Do you really not know?

550
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,035
I'm sorry about the other day.

551
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,913
I know you said those things for me.

552
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,335
Look at you.

553
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,754
You really not know.

554
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,635
You dumped me.

555
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:36,929
Did I?

556
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,140
Forget it.

557
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,850
What about dinner?

558
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,228
Did you eat?

559
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,896
What?

560
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,315
Well...

561
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,286
What's that face?

562
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,620
Is something wrong?

563
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,498
No. Nothing.

564
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,085
I don't remember the last time I bought
barbeque to my employees.

565
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,713
I've put them through a lot.

566
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,382
They met the wrong boss.

567
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,176
You can't say that in this day and age.

568
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,471
-What?
-It's not like they can't

569
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,098
work somewhere else.

570
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,891
Eat.

571
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,560
Okay.

572
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,483
What did you mean by that?

573
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,277
What?

574
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,155
Did I dump you?

575
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,200
The reason I was able
to get back on my feet

576
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,204
was because I wanted to get revenge.
And before I achieve that,

577
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,457
I will never be happy.

578
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,086
Oh, that.

579
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,548
You said getting revenge comes

580
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,550
before becoming happy with me.

581
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,221
Well...

582
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,099
I understand.

583
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,894
I can't stop you

584
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,229
because I know it all.

585
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,819
I'm causing everyone trouble.

586
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,989
You know what?

587
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,580
What if you're done with the revenge?

588
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,920
Then

589
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,547
are you going to be happy?

590
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,779
All the staff are struggling,

591
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,740
but the president
only cares about his pride.

592
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,575
The only thing that matters
is your integrity.

593
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,710
Boss, you're here.

594
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,673
Why aren't you going home?

595
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,967
We were preparing for the finals.

596
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,678
I have to go to the market
with her in the morning.

597
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:26,932
What about Yi-seo?

598
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,186
She's been going around
looking for investors all day.

599
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,985
DANBAM

600
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,797
-Hello?
-Toni.

601
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,800
I'm sorry to call you so late.

602
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,969
It's okay. I wasn't asleep.

603
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,179
Why?

604
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:06,805
Well...

605
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,477
I was wondering if I could meet Ms. Kim
tomorrow.

606
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,520
Grandma went to Jeju Island.

607
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,982
What? Jeju Island?

608
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,568
Why all of a sudden?

609
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,528
She has a vacation home there.

610
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,030
Yi-seo knows it.

611
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,656
Did she not tell you?

612
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,742
What?

613
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,258
Hello?

614
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,468
Where are you?

615
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,971
I'm here to meet an investor.

616
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,681
So where is it?

617
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,851
I'm in Jeju Island now.

618
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,941
To meet Toni's grandma?

619
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,529
I couldn't just sit back and wait.

620
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,864
I was going to tell you.

621
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,408
Are you upset?

622
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,660
No.

623
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,164
I'm sorry.

624
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,417
I'm not upset.

625
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,046
When are you going to meet her?

626
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,299
Ms. Kim?

627
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,720
Why are you looking for me?

628
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,307
Ms. Kim.

629
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,142
Did you already meet her?

630
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:38,730
Why are you guys making a fuss
this late at night?

631
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,358
Well...

632
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:44,820
What?

633
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,203
Please invest in my business.

634
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:56,748
I will try my best
so you won't make a loss.

635
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,958
You moron.

636
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,587
What kind of person asks
for investment over the phone?

637
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,426
That's why I'm here, Ms. Kim.

638
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,095
Forget about it, you fool.

639
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,014
Well...

640
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,516
You'll never make--

641
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,352
Even if I invest in your business,

642
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,188
it won't be because of Toni.

643
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,399
Pardon?

644
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,277
I'm a businesswoman after all.

645
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,989
And I know you a little.

646
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,199
It wasn't just about food

647
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,951
or restaurant.

648
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:37,372
I liked your insight
that you cared about the whole alley.

649
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,044
I told you I'm a businesswoman.

650
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,672
I don't like to waste money.

651
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,341
We should have the same spirit.

652
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,468
How far do you want to go?

653
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,095
How far?

654
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,806
I'm asking what your goal is.

655
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,982
The first place in the country.

656
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,652
You moron.

657
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,821
So we have the same spirit.

658
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,284
Then...

659
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,744
I told you.

660
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,496
I don't want to waste money.

661
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,207
"The first place in the country?"

662
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,751
Anyone can say that.

663
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,379
You have to prove it with actions.

664
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,632
-If you want me to prove it...
-The TV show.

665
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,425
I mean, the cooking contest.

666
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,178
There's this show you're working on now.

667
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:34,846
The Best Pub?

668
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,807
Win first place.

669
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,228
If you win in the contest,

670
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,106
I promise I will invest in your business.

671
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,360
Do you not like it?

672
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,570
No. Thank you.

673
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,780
Don't thank me.

674
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,242
You should say that
after winning the contest.

675
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,201
Okay.

676
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,078
We will make sure to win.

677
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,541
Gosh, I'm going to sleep now.

678
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,253
Wildcat, have breakfast here
tomorrow morning before you leave.

679
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,171
Thank you, ma'am.

680
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,424
Gosh, don't be silly.

681
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,893
Boss.

682
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,229
Good for you.

683
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,898
You have to win in The Best Pub tomorrow.

684
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,108
Good luck.

685
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,276
Okay.

686
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:34,656
I'll stay here to flatter her
and go back tomorrow evening.

687
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:37,659
Good night.

688
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,369
Yi-seo.

689
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,163
What?

690
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,458
Well...

691
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:49,963
I'm

692
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,674
really sorry.

693
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:57,596
Gosh, you say that all the time.

694
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,014
I...

695
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,058
I'm sorry.

696
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,228
And thank you.

697
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,526
Okay. I love you.

698
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,364
Good night.

699
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,617
I'll see you in your dream.

700
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,710
Thank you. I'll see you later.
Take good care of the pub.

701
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,379
Okay. Good luck.

702
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,132
You should say that to Hyun-yi.

703
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,885
Oh, well...

704
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,597
You better not lose.

705
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,725
Whatever.

706
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,270
Good luck.

707
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,232
-See you.
-Bye.

708
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,026
Hello.

709
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,487
Thank you.

710
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,535
THE BEST PUB

711
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:54,921
What's wrong?

712
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,258
Well...

713
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,261
We might be able to receive investment.

714
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,637
Really?

715
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,264
That's nice. From whom?

716
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,640
Toni's grandma.

717
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,102
You were being so stiff.

718
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,562
That's a good idea.

719
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,688
But...

720
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,649
There's a condition.

721
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,318
A condition?

722
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,572
You have to win first place
in The Best Pub.

723
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,823
I see.

724
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,659
What did you say?

725
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,748
The future of DanBam

726
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,750
depends on you.

727
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,503
Why are you telling me that
right before the show?

728
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,172
You can't do this to me.

729
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,715
I told you.

730
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,383
You can do this.

731
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,802
Good luck, Ma Hyun-yi.

732
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,803
What...

733
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:44,888
Hey!

734
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,185
Damn it.

735
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,113
What is this?

736
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:06,618
CHEF MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM
IN THE BEST PUB IS A TRANSGENDER

737
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:13,291
Hey. If the chef's a transgender,
does it mean the chef had the surgery?

738
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,627
What about the face?
Did the chef get plastic surgery too?

739
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,088
-I bet.
-Hey, stay quiet.

740
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:23,927
Boss.

741
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,137
You should read this.

742
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,308
IS CHEF MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM
A TRANSGENDER?

743
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,853
That's gross.

744
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,231
I had no idea. I thought the voice was--

745
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,774
Hey. Stop it.

746
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,152
Shut it, you damn idiots.

747
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,200
Stop it.

748
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,497
There's an article
Hyun-yi is a transgender.

749
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,170
-Hyun-yi.
-Hey.

750
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,636
So is this the high card you talked about?

751
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,812
A PERSONNEL FROM THE BEST PUB
REVEALED MA'S GENDER IDENTITY

752
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,522
Yes.

753
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,567
I contacted the press yesterday.

754
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,069
I told them

755
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,613
Hyun-yi is a transgender.

756
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,285
If Hyun-yi's popularity is reflected
in the result,

757
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,330
we should make Hyun-yi unpopular.

758
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,499
What about Hyun-yi?

759
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,585
What is going to happen to Hyun-yi?

760
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,213
Even if you hate Hyun-yi...

761
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,339
Hate Hyun-yi?

762
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,806
Hyun-yi's one of

763
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,933
my few dear friends.

764
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,602
If that's the case...

765
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,567
I did this to win.

766
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,571
Why do you have to--

767
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,697
This is

768
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,869
what people from Jangga Co. do.

769
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,916
Then what about you
and the people from DanBam?

770
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,044
What is going to happen?

771
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,091
I'm done

772
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,261
with this friendship stuff.

773
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:44,734
I thought that chef seemed tough
using the knife.

774
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,862
How could they deceive everyone...

775
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,409
This is a ladies' room.

776
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:21,771
There you are.

777
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,653
Boss.

778
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,125
Hyun-yi.

779
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,045
I'm sorry.

780
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,757
I didn't mean to run away.

781
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,134
It's just

782
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,178
my legs felt weak, so...

783
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,472
-Hyun-yi.
-Give me a minute.

784
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,228
I'll pull myself together and get ready.

785
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,274
I knew it would happen someday.

786
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,152
I have to win this

787
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,613
to receive investment.

788
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,908
No problem. I can do this.

789
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,830
It's okay.

790
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,337
It's all right.

791
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,681
When we

792
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,768
worked at the factory together,

793
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,686
do you remember what I said?

794
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,649
You are

795
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,404
the bravest person I know.

796
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,366
Whatever they say,

797
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,910
you're a brave

798
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,498
and pretty girl.

799
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,516
Once you calm down,

800
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,685
shall we go back to DanBam?

801
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,442
It's okay. You don't have to worry.

802
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,445
As you know, I'm very brave.

803
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,075
I'm doing this for DanBam.

804
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,870
I'm not going to run away.

805
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,209
I will convince them of my cooking.
I can do this.

806
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,128
It's okay to run away.

807
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,216
No.

808
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,761
It's not that you're running away.
You didn't do anything wrong.

809
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:04,142
It's not that important
to make you go through all this.

810
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,147
You don't have to

811
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,692
convince others about who you are.

812
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,446
It's okay.

813
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,748
It's all right.

814
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:32,503
It's okay.

815
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,181
It's okay.

816
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:50,146
I want my words and acts to have power

817
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,441
so no one can mess with me and my people.

818
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:59,030
I don't want to be swayed
by anyone or any injustice.

819
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,201
I want to live a life

820
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,371
where I make my own decisions

821
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,625
and I don't have to pay for my principles.

822
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,631
I'm burning

823
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,759
with anger.

824
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,973
Director, is everything
okay with this show?

825
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,433
Hello, Mr. Park.

826
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,895
Hey, Geun-soo.

827
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,480
I'm here to support you.

828
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,857
Isn't it to spy on me?

829
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,860
Don't worry. I can do this today.

830
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:42,156
But where are the people from DanBam?

831
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,158
Things are crazy here.

832
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,993
I heard the chef is a transgender.

833
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,414
My gosh. Their chef just ran away
as soon as they read the article.

834
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,791
So is DanBam

835
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,418
giving up?

836
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:57,171
I guess so. I was going
to bring them down today.

837
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,131
How disappointing.

838
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,174
So

839
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,593
this is it.

840
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,554
Not really.

841
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,810
We're not giving up.

842
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,525
Saeroyi.

843
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,110
What do we do now?

844
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,902
Hello, Yi-seo.

845
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,403
Hyun-yi.

846
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,034
You sound down.

847
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,787
I guess you read the article.

848
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,330
I did.

849
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,750
You must feel hurt.

850
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,629
Well...

851
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,716
I'm not feeling good.

852
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:27,386
What did Boss say?

853
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,599
He said I can run away.

854
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,977
I don't have to

855
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,398
convince others about who I am.

856
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,451
-Hello?
-So what about you?

857
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,162
What?

858
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:55,873
Will you run away?

859
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,877
I heard Hyun-yi ran away.

860
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,129
What are you going to do?

861
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:04,382
Director.

862
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:05,967
Yes?

863
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,094
What if I cook instead?

864
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:09,387
Is it against the rules?

865
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:12,890
No.

866
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,101
There are no rules like that.

867
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,853
I understand your situation.

868
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:19,564
But are you sure you can do this?

869
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,815
Good to know.

870
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,234
Are you going to be okay?

871
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:25,111
They are the top four chefs
in the country.

872
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,573
There's no way you can win.

873
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,368
You told me I'm a good cook.

874
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:36,038
-Saeroyi.
-You know what, Geun-soo?

875
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,625
Did you say run away?

876
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,715
Did Hyun-yi do something wrong?

877
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,306
Just be supportive.

878
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,226
I will be upset
if you keep acting like that.

879
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,860
Can he really do that?

880
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:09,655
We will think about it
and get back to you.

881
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:15,453
Seung-kwon.

882
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:17,997
What? What are you doing here?

883
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,290
What about your grandma?

884
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,544
I read the article. I was worried.

885
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:27,131
Gosh. You should
just get yourself together.

886
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,758
The article about Hyun-yi.

887
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,092
What should we do about it?

888
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,427
What can we do?

889
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,304
Hyun-yi's here as the chef of DanBam.

890
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,722
Hyun-yi has to do this.

891
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,184
I get that you two are on bad terms.

892
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,478
But you can't be like that
to your colleague.

893
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:46,651
If you were born as a boy,
you should live as a boy.

894
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,153
If you're a girl,
you should live like one.

895
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,947
That's the providence of nature.

896
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:52,323
It's just natural.

897
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,617
How could you say that?

898
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,287
Fine.

899
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,790
You.

900
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,001
Do you know what Hyun-yi is like?

901
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,128
What?

902
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,173
Hyun-yi ignores the way of nature

903
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:12,134
and lives Hyun-yi's own way.

904
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,765
Don't worry

905
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,477
and don't underestimate Hyun-yi.

906
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,279
Hyun-yi is

907
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,367
stronger than anyone.

908
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:52,466
This morning, I read a book of poems.

909
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,763
And you came to my mind.

910
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:03,561
I want to read this poem to you
at a time like this

911
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,230
because I'm a bitch.

912
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,160
I'm a rock.

913
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,580
Go ahead and sear me.

914
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,000
I won't budge an inch

915
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,002
because I'm a rock.

916
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,588
Go ahead and beat me up.

917
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,256
I'm

918
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,925
a solid rock.

919
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,687
Go ahead and leave me in darkness.

920
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,941
I'm a rock

921
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,528
that will shine all alone.

922
01:07:57,364 --> 01:08:00,326
I don't break, ash,

923
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,623
nor decay as I go against nature's way.

924
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:16,425
I'm Chef Ma Hyun-yi of DanBam.

925
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:21,138
I'm a transgender.

926
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,766
-What?
-What is going on?

927
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,825
I survive.

928
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,246
And today,

929
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,626
I'm going to win.

930
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:00,678
I'm...

931
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:13,732
I'm...

932
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,736
diamond.

933
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,117
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON NO-MIN,
LEE JUN-HYEOK, AND KIM IL-JUNG.

934
