00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,474
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,935
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,814
NEW BUILDING OWNER

4
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,070
Hello?

5
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:15,075
Hello. I'm the owner of DanBam in Itaewon,
Park Saeroyi.

6
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,578
I heard you took over the building.

7
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,162
So I'm calling you to say hello.

8
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,330
Okay.

9
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,040
What a coincidence.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,042
Pardon?

11
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,841
It's me.

12
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,634
Jang Dae-hee.

13
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:46,940
Is this

14
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,943
the kind of beating you talked about?

15
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,823
Don't get the wrong idea.

16
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,450
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

17
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,743
I heard business in that spot

18
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,579
is doing well these days.

19
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,914
And the value of the building has gone up,

20
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,792
so I just thought
that it'd be a good investment.

21
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,965
Come to think of it, it's funny.

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,094
What you did to take me down

23
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,514
ended up benefiting my company, Jangga Co.

24
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,602
This beating is quite cunning.

25
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,815
Don't you have a favor to ask of me?

26
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,945
Come to Jangga Co. tomorrow.

27
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,289
Is it Jangga?

28
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,919
EPISODE 8

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,047
-Yes.
-Jangga Pub?

30
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,216
They bought this building? Why?

31
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,134
I wonder too.

32
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,388
I'm so sick of them.

33
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,973
They just want to get rid of
someone they don't like.

34
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,309
So they just bought the building?

35
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,270
He is a man of huge caliber.

36
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,480
Yi-seo.

37
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,149
You see,

38
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,570
I don't even understand
how this shameless woman has the audacity

39
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,696
to come here to get ice.

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,866
And I can't wrap my head around
why Jang Geun-soo works here--

41
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,243
Enough!

42
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,545
Hey.

43
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,005
Another word and I won't let it go.

44
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,425
I'll go and bring Yi-seo.

45
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,764
Gosh.

46
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,141
This is so awkward.

47
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,227
That rude punk. She has such a bad temper.

48
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,313
I'll go get more ice.

49
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,231
It's okay.

50
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,445
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,744
You and the girl named Yi-seo.

52
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,747
I didn't know you were so emotional.

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,959
-What?
-Nothing.

54
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,463
You two seem very close.

55
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,300
And she has a point.

56
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,222
I can't borrow ice from you guys
because I feel bad.

57
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,037
You should've gotten a part-timer
to do this. Why carry this yourself?

58
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,750
-Give me that.
-Gosh, it's okay.

59
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,379
Ask me for favors anytime
when we're not at work.

60
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,052
Any plans for the weekend?

61
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,429
I have tickets to a musical.
They're for VIP seats.

62
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,391
I have an extra ticket.
Do you want to come with me?

63
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,567
Do you like me?

64
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:00,986
What?

65
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,241
Yes.

66
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,202
I don't like you.

67
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,540
Why not?

68
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,545
Because of that prick, Park Saeroyi?

69
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,924
Because of Mr. Park.

70
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,263
-What?
-The man you hit with your car

71
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,349
and killed.

72
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,063
He was like a father to me.

73
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,193
So please...

74
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,781
Stop hitting on me.

75
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,274
Sir, he's here.

76
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,375
We're meeting quite often these days.

77
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,251
I agree.

78
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,087
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

79
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,254
Let's hear it.

80
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,882
Are you here to argue with me?

81
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,680
So you wish to run the business yourself
at the spot?

82
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,682
You'd better sell it sooner than later.

83
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,558
To get the premium, that is.

84
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,519
Is that what this is about?

85
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,314
The premium...

86
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,860
It wouldn't be bad.

87
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,573
I know there's the Lease Protection Act,

88
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,619
but I can pretty much do anything I want
in this situation.

89
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,455
Who do you think will win
if this goes to court?

90
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,375
And how will you run the pub
during the trials?

91
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,837
You knocked down a wall
and made structural alterations.

92
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,881
I could ask you
to restore the space as well.

93
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,801
But those petty details...

94
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,430
I don't care.

95
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,102
Then what do you want?

96
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,522
My son, Geun-soo.

97
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,483
Why are you letting him work there?

98
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,112
-We were short-staffed.
-Let him go.

99
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:51,948
That's up to him to decide.

100
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,742
Does having my son to work for you

101
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,911
help you boost your self-esteem?

102
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,876
Sir.

103
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,088
I suppose you use your employees
to boost your self-esteem.

104
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,468
He said you're a strong person.

105
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,348
Therefore, I plan to take this opportunity

106
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,268
to teach my son

107
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,521
what it really means to be strong.

108
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,029
You bought the building
to show off your power?

109
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,617
That's not all.

110
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,286
I know how persistent you can be.

111
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,790
Even after you get kicked out,
you'll open up a pub somewhere else.

112
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,999
Am I right?

113
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,880
Then I'll buy that building as well.

114
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,428
I'm going to buy every building
that you rent out.

115
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,977
Is that

116
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,897
your definition of power?

117
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,778
I can easily control and have influence
over all your achievements.

118
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,990
Isn't that power?

119
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,290
Seeing you today

120
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,293
reminds me when we first met.

121
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,588
You got expelled
because you were too stubborn

122
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,132
to get on your knees.

123
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,346
Haven't you had enough?

124
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,892
Park Saeroyi.

125
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,105
What would I get for ruining your life?

126
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,990
What do you want me to do?

127
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,413
You started off on the wrong foot,
so let's fix that first.

128
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,916
Get on your knees and apologize.

129
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,673
If I get on my knees, will you allow me

130
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,303
-to continue my business?
-Of course.

131
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,263
Haven't you learned?

132
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:24,142
You can't get what you want
by being emotional.

133
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,853
If you kneel and sincerely apologize,

134
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,106
I'll put the past behind us.

135
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,402
And I'll no longer try
to take anything from you.

136
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:40,909
Money.

137
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,620
You think money is what I want?

138
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,332
There's too much involved between us

139
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,584
to think of it so lightly.

140
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,715
What I want out of this fight isn't money.

141
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,300
Because

142
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,928
I am

143
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,180
your enemy.

144
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,314
The day I got expelled
for refusing to get on my knees,

145
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:17,570
my dad told me
that he's proud to have me as a son.

146
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,700
Getting expelled? Getting kicked out?

147
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,787
You took

148
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,332
absolutely nothing from me.

149
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,509
In my opinion, power comes from people.

150
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,221
Because their trust gives me strength.

151
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,892
So Geun-soo told you
that I'm a strong person?

152
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,187
I'm glad to hear that.

153
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,273
I'll become

154
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,026
even stronger.

155
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,533
If your business fails,

156
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,994
you'll lose your people.

157
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,663
They're the reason why
I can continue to run my business.

158
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,958
Is that so?

159
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,006
So you want to keep going?

160
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,968
Yes.

161
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,856
That was your last chance.

162
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,611
You'll regret this.

163
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,081
You want to stop
this ill-fated relationship?

164
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,210
There's one way to stop.
Do you want to know what it is?

165
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,426
Get punished
for all that you've done wrong

166
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,429
and get on your knees.

167
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,338
Saeroyi.

168
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,552
Right. You work here during the day.

169
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,347
Yes. What about you?

170
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,015
What brings you here?

171
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,687
I met Chairman Jang.

172
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,525
We'll have to move out.

173
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,948
It's no big deal. Don't be so serious.

174
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,701
Are you okay?

175
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,208
I'm just upset that my plan

176
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,502
to make you quit
is going to take longer than expected.

177
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,881
You're such a fool.

178
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,844
Ms. Oh, the documents are ready.

179
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,554
It's time.

180
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,058
You should go.
I'll see you later at Itaewon.

181
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,186
Okay, I'll see you.

182
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,422
He bought the building?

183
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,300
I didn't know the old man
would be so aggressive.

184
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,051
Exactly.

185
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,265
What's going to happen
now that he can't run the pub?

186
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,435
The best choice is to receive a premium
before the lease is over.

187
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,437
The Saeroyi I know

188
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,439
will quickly find
another place for his pub.

189
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,485
How about asking him
to focus on my business instead?

190
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,404
A small business takes time to grow.

191
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,033
I was actually
planning to talk to him about that.

192
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,953
Is he doing okay?
He must be pretty discouraged right now.

193
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,915
He's fighting against Chairman Jang.

194
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,417
Deep down inside,
he's probably pretty upset.

195
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,127
But don't worry.

196
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,172
I've known Saeroyi for ten years,

197
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,716
and during all the ups and downs,

198
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,761
I've never once seen him discouraged.

199
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,097
Yi-seo!

200
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,770
You stormed out yesterday,
but you came to work early.

201
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,689
I don't want to talk to anyone
from the Jang family.

202
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,233
So will you stop talking to me?

203
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,330
Then just tell me.

204
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,666
I know it's because of Saeroyi.

205
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,378
Tell me what my family did to him.

206
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,007
Okay, fine.

207
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,345
You didn't know anything,
so you probably felt at ease.

208
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,223
What?

209
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,603
Do you really want to know
what your family did

210
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,689
to our boss?

211
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,575
Hey, you're here.

212
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,621
Hey, you're our manager.
You can't just storm out like that.

213
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,206
Our boss was really worried.

214
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,042
What?

215
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,591
Why would you be worried?
I'm not a little kid.

216
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,304
I thought I'd be the first to come,
but you're all here already.

217
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,724
Hey, Geun-soo.

218
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,809
So what you're going to do?

219
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:29,817
Let's eat first.

220
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,577
What do you need?

221
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,872
I heard you decided to buy

222
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,749
the building where DanBam
is doing business.

223
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,500
And?

224
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,837
May I ask you why?

225
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,839
Don't you know already?

226
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,719
I think I already know
what you're going to say.

227
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,097
But I'm not in a very good mood.

228
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,558
So choose your words wisely.

229
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,064
It was very unlike you.

230
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,738
It was unlike me?

231
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,616
Yes.

232
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,870
This may sound out of line,

233
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,748
but I've known you for over ten years.

234
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,584
You've made choices that sometimes

235
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,920
went against the social custom.

236
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,171
I clearly told you

237
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,174
that I'm not in a good mood.

238
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,679
Are you telling me that I was wrong
to kick him out like that?

239
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,555
You?

240
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,434
But even if those choices were wrong,

241
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,270
all those choices were made

242
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,065
to benefit the company.

243
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,028
But the purchase of the building
seemed like a very emotional decision.

244
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,822
-And that's not something--
-Enough.

245
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,160
That's enough.

246
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,250
You may leave.

247
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,530
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

248
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,617
What I want out of this fight isn't money.

249
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,661
Because

250
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,038
I am

251
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,291
your enemy.

252
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,295
Do I really think

253
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,506
of that little kid

254
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,343
as my enemy?

255
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,350
Do you know what he said to me?

256
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,061
"My life has just begun!

257
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,271
And I'll do

258
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,149
everything I want to do."

259
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,943
That's what he said to me.

260
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,320
I'm so impressed.

261
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,031
Will you stop telling that story?
I've heard it enough.

262
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,824
Just have some beef jerky.

263
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,079
Why do you guys look so down?
Did you fight?

264
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,165
No.

265
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,959
It's no big deal.
Those two fight all the time.

266
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,503
Let's go for a second round.

267
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,046
Where should we go?

268
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,925
I'm not that interested,
but how about we go to a club?

269
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,930
A club? Sounds great. Let's go.

270
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,433
You must've had a lot of fun
the first time you went clubbing.

271
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,269
You think I had fun?
After I saw you that night...

272
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,563
-What?
-Let's just drop it.

273
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,275
What is it? Don't you want to go?

274
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,822
No, it's not that.
I was just wondering if it's fun there.

275
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,616
-I've never been.
-Yes, it's fun.

276
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,951
Okay.

277
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,705
-There we go.
-What are you doing?

278
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,374
Just watch.

279
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,589
Get up. Let me teach you
how to have fun at a club.

280
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:21,882
-Here?
-Yes.

281
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,302
First, you need to smile.

282
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,137
-Smile?
-Yes, smile.

283
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,810
Okay, that's good.
The next step is to show your presence.

284
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,106
-Okay.
-Step three is to get close.

285
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,400
-Sit back down.
-Sorry.

286
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,794
When you go clubbing in Korea,

287
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,464
it's best not to hit on too many women.

288
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,758
Then what should I do?

289
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,261
Your first choice is very important, okay?

290
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,764
"Is he hitting on me
after getting rejected by her?"

291
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,642
You don't want a woman to think that way.

292
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,104
What's going on? Tell me.

293
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,899
-It's nothing.
-You're so petty.

294
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,569
Are you still upset
because of what Yi-seo said yesterday?

295
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,285
You guys can go first.
I want to have a word with Geun-soo.

296
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,454
Okay, we'll see you there.

297
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,289
-Okay.
-Let's go.

298
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,757
Let's go.

299
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,557
What's wrong?

300
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,518
Is it because of Yi-seo?

301
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,314
-I heard everything.
-Heard what?

302
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,567
I heard

303
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,279
what my family did to you.

304
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,494
Why didn't you tell me?

305
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,665
Because it's between me

306
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,959
and your brother and father.

307
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,671
It has nothing to do with you.

308
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,426
I knew

309
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,347
you would think like that.

310
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,976
Because that's your principle.

311
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,774
Why did you offer to work

312
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,068
at DanBam?

313
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,697
I told you.

314
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,574
I wanted to make money.

315
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,078
To be honest,

316
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,580
it looked like

317
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,375
you needed

318
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,671
someone to lean on.

319
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,386
This might sound out of line.

320
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,223
And it might sound funny.

321
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,475
But I thought DanBam

322
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:20,769
and I might be able

323
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,607
to give you something to lean on.

324
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,486
Thank you.

325
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,906
-But I don't need you to pity--
-I'm not pitying you.

326
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,742
You just reminded me of

327
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,663
myself.

328
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,295
I wanted to get along with you well.

329
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,923
But I didn't think of how you would feel

330
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,052
after you found out everything.

331
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,347
I'm sorry.

332
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,433
No.

333
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,312
No, you don't need to do that.

334
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,314
You don't need

335
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,025
to apologize.

336
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,613
Geun-soo.

337
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,536
I'm really sorry
for what my family has done

338
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,291
to you.

339
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,637
They will

340
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,140
get punished no matter what.

341
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,719
-What do you think? Isn't it great?
-It looks so fun.

342
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,888
-Haven't you been to a club in Korea?
-No, I haven't.

343
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,306
You're pretty new yourself.

344
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,141
I'm a professional clubber.

345
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,106
Here.

346
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,777
Oh, right. My ID. Just a second.

347
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,279
You don't need to show me.

348
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,699
Look at yourself.
You're obviously old enough.

349
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,534
Okay.

350
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,622
What?

351
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:49,001
-I'm...
-Why are you asking him that?

352
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,545
People from Africa
and the Middle East can't enter.

353
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,882
Come on. This is Itaewon.
Don't be like that.

354
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,091
You're embarrassing us.

355
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,051
I'm just following the rules.

356
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,929
Where are you from?

357
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,307
I'm Korean.

358
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,476
Show me your passport.

359
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,397
But I'm Korean.

360
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,816
My dad is Korean.

361
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,861
Hey, we have a bugger.
Send someone to the entrance.

362
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,866
Why would you call him that
when he's right there?

363
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,534
Hey, don't explode.

364
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,788
Just leave while I'm being nice.

365
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,834
-And what if I refuse?
-Forget it.

366
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,378
They don't accept Africans.
Let's go somewhere else.

367
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,965
But I told you that my dad is Korean.

368
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,009
Let's go already.

369
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,512
I'm also Korean, okay?

370
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,932
How are you Korean?

371
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,267
-You have dark skin.
-Hey.

372
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:48,977
You...

373
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,981
You're so mean!

374
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,608
-Toni!
-Hey!

375
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,069
Toni, where are you going?

376
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,320
Toni!

377
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,614
My gosh.

378
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,286
-What's with him?
-They wouldn't let him in.

379
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,121
What? Why?

380
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,957
They don't accept Africans.

381
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,252
That's up to the owner.

382
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,504
He kept saying he's Korean.

383
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,297
He got upset
because I didn't take his side.

384
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,758
Hey, will you stop being so mean?

385
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,971
You've been getting on my nerves
since yesterday.

386
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:24,888
What?

387
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,557
He's obviously not Korean.

388
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,351
Yi-seo, that's enough.

389
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,186
Boss, you should stop too.

390
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,653
BOGWANG KOSIWON
BOGWANG STUDY ROOM

391
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,862
DANBAM PUB

392
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,197
YOU'RE SO PRETTY

393
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,744
DON'T GET HURT,
AND LET'S MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

394
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,882
What am I going to do?

395
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,496
YOU RACIST

396
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,415
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY

397
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,167
YOU HUMILIATE KOREA

398
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,044
EAT SHIT

399
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,257
What the...

400
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,471
-What's on your jacket?
-What?

401
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,309
It's nothing.

402
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,521
What's your plan for the pub?

403
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,440
We'll have to move out.

404
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,744
-What's this?
-It's a decent firm.

405
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,079
You'll make money if you invest.

406
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,750
I don't have money to invest.

407
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,757
Why don't you just shut down the business?

408
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,344
It doesn't earn much money
compared to the investment.

409
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,470
And it's too risky.

410
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,139
And it'll be riskier
if Jangga Co. gets in the way.

411
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,557
This is an important period.

412
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,018
You should spend your energy
on receiving Ms. Kang's support.

413
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,437
But you need to move
and get ready to reopen.

414
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,189
It'll be too inefficient.

415
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,151
No.

416
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,489
If you invest your premium,
you'll make about--

417
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,782
I'm not going to invest.

418
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,286
What about Chairman Jang?

419
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,123
He warned that he'll buy
every building that you rent out.

420
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,499
You need to be realistic.

421
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,168
If he keeps targeting you,
your business will never succeed.

422
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,173
There's one way.

423
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,592
What's that?

424
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:21,064
I'm going to call Ms. Kang
and ask her to meet today.

425
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,278
No way.

426
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,158
I'm sorry.

427
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,847
DANBAM

428
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,325
You're here early.
You work too hard these days.

429
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,451
Hey, you guys.

430
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,467
Yi-seo.

431
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,344
What?

432
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,221
Can we talk?

433
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,765
DANBAM

434
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,769
What is it?

435
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,901
It's better to stay here

436
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,321
than to move to a new spot, right?

437
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,907
Why do you ask the obvious?

438
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,410
I plan

439
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,247
to quit working at Danbam.

440
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,922
That's what you wanted to say?

441
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,509
In return for going back home,

442
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,719
I'm going to ask my dad

443
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,514
to leave Saeroyi alone.

444
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:21,977
That would

445
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,021
be the best choice, right?

446
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:40,745
Will you please do that?

447
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,377
I'd be really grateful.

448
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,468
My gosh.

449
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,766
You really are mean.

450
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,321
After you dance with her a bit more

451
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:18,033
and give her a few compliments...

452
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,620
Aren't you thirsty?

453
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,706
I have a table over there
Do you want to drink with me?

454
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,334
That's all you need to say to her.

455
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,046
Then the night will be yours.

456
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,715
-Gosh, that's nuts.
-I'm so excited.

457
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,758
What?

458
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,358
-Hello?
-Aren't you cold?

459
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,234
Why do you look so sentimental?

460
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,541
I wanted to talk to you.

461
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,126
About what?

462
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,755
Chairman Jang bought the building
that I rented out.

463
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,801
Ho-jin already told me.
Do you need to borrow money?

464
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,427
No.

465
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,642
I'd like to withdraw one billion won
of my stocks in Jangga Co.

466
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,230
Then you won't have any influence
in the company.

467
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,982
I'm sorry.

468
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,156
This is completely different
from what Ho-jin had planned.

469
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,451
I thought you'd drop the pub
and focus on helping me.

470
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,750
It's not even a franchise
or a famous brand. Do you really need

471
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,628
to risk everything on that small pub?

472
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,840
It's precious to me.

473
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:01,010
Yes, but Chairman Jang easily took
that precious pub away from you.

474
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,345
The pub is all about

475
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,141
the people I work with.

476
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,619
So Toni didn't show up.

477
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,663
He's not even answering my calls.

478
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,083
Hey.

479
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,962
Why don't you apologize to Toni?

480
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,840
-Why would I?
-I knew you'd be like this.

481
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,011
Soo-ah, why are you carrying the beer?

482
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,137
Let me take them for you.

483
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,603
I made myself clear
that I hate you the other day.

484
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,396
But you keep showing up.

485
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,522
Where's Saeroyi?

486
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,274
You're here.

487
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,068
Hey, Soo-ah. You're here again.

488
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,904
I came to return the beer
I borrowed before.

489
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,530
Do you not want me to be here?

490
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,243
What? No one's here.

491
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,913
We had some customers earlier.
They just left.

492
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,247
I see.

493
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,666
Boss.

494
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,043
Yes?

495
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,836
Geun-soo has something to tell you.

496
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,974
DANBAM

497
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,605
What do you want to tell me?

498
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,069
Well...

499
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,034
I want to quit.

500
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,371
Why are you being like this?

501
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,048
What's the reason?

502
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,217
Nothing.

503
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,470
I just think it'd be better this way.

504
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,140
If the reason you're quitting

505
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,059
has something to do

506
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,062
with your father or brother,

507
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,274
can't you just stay?

508
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,318
I like you.
You're like my younger brother.

509
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,245
Geun-soo says he will talk to his dad

510
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,247
on condition that he quits his job here.

511
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,419
He will talk to his dad?
What does that mean?

512
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,546
So we can keep our business running here.

513
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,258
Even if we get the premium,
we will still have to find a new place

514
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,968
and pay brokerage
and interior design fees.

515
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,636
It costs hundreds of millions of won.

516
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,681
The best option is to stay here.

517
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,267
And we can do that with Geun-soo gone.

518
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,028
What do you think?

519
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,447
Of course I agree with it.

520
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,116
Geun-soo must've felt
uncomfortable working here.

521
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,493
You should understand how Geun-soo--

522
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,582
JO YI-SEO

523
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:35,642
What are you doing?

524
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:37,894
You don't deserve

525
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,105
to be the manager here.

526
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,818
But...

527
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,487
Saeroyi, wait.

528
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,821
This is my business.

529
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,242
Sympathy.

530
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,412
It's sympathy again.

531
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,081
It's...

532
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,375
It's just sympathy.

533
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,086
How long will you let
sympathy stand in your way?

534
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,338
You're always at the mercy of everyone.

535
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,966
Franchise? Leadership
in the foodservice industry?

536
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,592
How are you going to make it happen?

537
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,553
Forget about Jangga Co.

538
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,765
If you run your business like this,
you're no match for Jangga Co.

539
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,558
So you don't want to lose anyone.

540
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,852
Because DanBam is like a family.

541
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,773
Will you please wake up to the reality?

542
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,236
If you just fire a part-timer,
it'll all be over.

543
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,615
How much money do you want to lose
before you pull yourself together?

544
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,588
Business is all about profit--

545
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:48,798
For me...

546
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,473
If that's what business is all about,
I won't do it.

547
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,267
Boss, please...

548
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,769
If I were to become like him,
I wouldn't have started this.

549
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,604
Look what we are going through now.

550
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,940
We're about to get kicked out.

551
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,360
I just

552
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,781
don't want you to suffer a loss.

553
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,453
So what if we get kicked out

554
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,872
and it costs hundreds of millions of won?

555
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,790
Jangga Co. is my enemy.

556
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,543
It's only natural
that my enemy attacks me.

557
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,253
It was bound to happen anyway.
No big deal.

558
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,005
What makes me upset now

559
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,051
is you whom I thought was on my side.

560
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,180
I just said that for your sake.

561
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,474
-I was concerned about...
-Why?

562
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,977
Why do you have to fire

563
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,773
someone I care about for my sake?

564
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,001
I'm sorry.

565
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,047
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

566
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,842
I should go get some fresh air.

567
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,847
I get what you are saying.

568
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,475
But I'm the manager here.

569
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,894
No matter how idealistic you're being,

570
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,396
we will eventually get kicked out of here.

571
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,234
And we can't be sure
the same thing won't happen again.

572
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,782
I bet my life on you.

573
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,992
You have to take responsibility.

574
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,246
I need a realistic alternative.

575
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,377
You're an idealist.

576
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:54,465
That old man keeps his words
no matter what.

577
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,510
Even if you move to another place
with your precious employees,

578
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,428
the same thing will happen again someday

579
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,347
unless you have a realistic alternative.

580
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,349
That's the reason
I'm retrieving the investment.

581
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,813
To protect my people.

582
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,358
I won't be swayed
by Chairman Jang anymore.

583
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,074
You have no alternative.

584
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,620
I'll buy a building.

585
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,839
What are you talking about?

586
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,009
The realistic alternative.

587
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,938
It's a lie.

588
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,149
You know him.

589
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,652
Saeroyi never lies.

590
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,411
Can I talk to you for a moment?

591
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,808
JO YI-SEO

592
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,109
What do you want?

593
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,863
I want to give you some help.

594
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,407
Did you not hear
what my boss said earlier?

595
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,118
This is our business. Stay out of it.

596
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,537
No.

597
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,873
I mean about Saeroyi.

598
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,588
You work at DanBam
because you like him, right?

599
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,173
So?

600
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,637
If Saeroyi was a sly guy
who pursues practical interest,

601
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,222
would you still have liked him?

602
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,725
What's your point?

603
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,813
You know about

604
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:15,564
Saeroyi's past.

605
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,945
It counts only when he proves himself
in the opposite way

606
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,531
of what Chairman Jang has done.

607
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,076
And as you know,

608
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,538
it's a very hard thing to do.

609
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,165
For him

610
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,294
and for those who have to watch him do so.

611
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,216
But Saeroyi won't change.

612
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,052
I mean, no one can change him.

613
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,723
He's very strong.

614
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,853
If you really want to be on his side,

615
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,188
don't try to change him.

616
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,691
You should be ready to walk with him.

617
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,193
You should understand him.

618
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:07,366
So I guess you understand him very well.

619
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,243
Not really.

620
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,913
That's why I'm not on his side.

621
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,343
I should get going.

622
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,264
Why are you telling me all that?

623
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,185
Well...

624
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,895
I don't know.

625
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,608
I didn't feel like working.

626
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,653
Did you give up on him then?

627
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,073
No.

628
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,284
Because I'm confident.

629
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,660
I told you.

630
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,705
Saeroyi likes me.

631
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,793
You know what?

632
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,588
I really hate you.

633
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,090
Well...

634
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:05,758
I know that too.

635
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,679
Keep your chin up, Cutie.

636
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:27,488
If Saeroyi was a sly guy
who pursues practical interest,

637
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,781
would you still have liked him?

638
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,574
Just this once?

639
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,578
Just this once? Once and for all?
But there will be another time.

640
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,457
It will make things easy this once.

641
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,251
But you know what?

642
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,628
Those one times

643
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,214
might change your whole life.

644
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:49,093
Thank you for everything until now.

645
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,344
It's twice your pay.

646
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,181
If you like working here,

647
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,725
I want you to work twice as hard.

648
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,019
Can you do that?

649
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,361
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

650
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,572
YOU RACIST
YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY

651
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:13,200
Can't you do it right?

652
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,203
He's really strange.

653
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,958
It's strange,

654
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:24,545
but I like him.

655
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,283
Jang Geun-soo.

656
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,659
Oh...

657
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,119
Yi-seo.

658
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,212
I'm sorry.

659
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,258
You must be mad at me.

660
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,722
What can I do to make it up to you?

661
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,103
I'm not mad.

662
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,069
Yes, you are.

663
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,071
You have every reason to be mad.

664
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:33,822
I was heartless.

665
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,741
We've been friends for quite long.

666
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,576
You were always heartless.

667
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,247
You are also inconsiderate

668
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,207
and selfish.

669
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:48,254
I guess you were hurt a lot.

670
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,761
But I like you

671
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,683
the way you are.

672
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,776
I was being ambiguous before.

673
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,280
I think I should make myself clear.

674
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,075
I love our Boss like crazy.

675
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,038
I'm trying to be nice to you
when you're just a headache

676
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:26,667
because I want to stay by his side.

677
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,504
So

678
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,299
don't stand in my way.

679
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,135
I should go.

680
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:57,906
YONGSAN-GU OFFICE

681
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,325
I'm telling you.

682
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,076
How many times must I say it?

683
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,204
I can't retrieve personal information
without his consent.

684
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,124
He's not a stranger. He's my dad.

685
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,001
Take a look at this.

686
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,880
You can't prove the paternity
only with a picture.

687
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,758
You should bring
the family relation certificate.

688
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,176
Then I'll look into it for you.

689
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,934
I went to a club in Itaewon
with the employees of DanBam last night,

690
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,478
but we were denied admission

691
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,521
just because one of our employees,

692
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,648
Toni was from Africa.

693
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,692
I can't believe there's racism
in this day and age.

694
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,694
-This is crazy.
-Itaewon is an international town.

695
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,864
I resent all those racists.

696
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,992
This is embarrassing.
It's a disgrace to our country.

697
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,410
I can't believe it still happens.

698
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,245
It's just skin color.

699
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,206
You're here.

700
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,041
Hey.

701
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:52,044
Hey, did you do this?

702
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,337
Do what?

703
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,798
Well...

704
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,133
I did.

705
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,972
You said messing with your people

706
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,683
is just like messing with you.

707
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,102
So I made up my mind.

708
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:12,356
I will just kill those who mess with you.

709
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,234
Hey, Yi-seo. You sound so cool.

710
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,572
Where's Toni? Is he here yet?

711
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,409
Will you try calling him?

712
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,498
What? Hey.

713
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,543
-Well...
-Toni.

714
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,968
I WENT TO A CLUB IN ITAEWON

715
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,847
I'm Korean.

716
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,142
You know what?

717
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,561
You don't look Korean.

718
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,062
Why do you call yourself Korean?

719
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,647
What is she doing?

720
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,443
My dad is Korean.

721
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,612
My dad came to Korea to meet my grandma.

722
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,698
And I came to Korea to find my dad.

723
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,033
Once I find him,

724
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,536
I can acquire Korean nationality.

725
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,667
I'm Korean.

726
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,546
But the fact is that you didn't
acquire Korean nationality yet.

727
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,215
It means you're not Korean.

728
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,845
-Yi-seo.
-I'll

729
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,307
help you find your dad.

730
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,895
Yi-seo.

731
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,981
I'll do anything to help you.

732
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,361
I'm sorry

733
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,239
that I didn't take your side.

734
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:54,374
I have a stomachache.

735
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,293
I need to go to the restroom.

736
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,880
Gosh.

737
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,717
It feels so warm.

738
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,179
Spray painting was so childish.

739
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,306
You should use your brains.

740
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,107
Gosh.

741
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:20,317
Wait.

742
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,655
Give me back my name tag.

743
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:34,706
This?

744
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,214
Put it on me.

745
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,445
It's really hard
to deal with people like you.

746
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,615
But I'll try to understand.

747
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,204
Thank you.

748
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,837
Yi-seo, you're all grown up.

749
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,141
This is the last one
about Jiin Department Store.

750
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,309
Okay.

751
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:37,686
And

752
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:41,815
a new tenant has moved
into the building where DanBam was.

753
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,111
He must've had no choice but to move out.

754
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,405
We have to nip it in the bud.

755
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,825
You should buy the building
he moved in too.

756
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,369
Do you know where he moved to?

757
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,246
Well...

758
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,875
He bought a building at Gyunglidan-road.

759
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,135
What?

760
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:20,270
DANBAM

761
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,027
Please take a look.

762
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,321
Here?

763
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:33,158
-A little more to the left.
-Here?.

764
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,952
-I think it's done.
-Left?

765
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,415
All right.

766
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,711
Cool. You're a man of your word.

767
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,464
-We still have a long way to go.
-She's right.

768
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,716
Hello. We opened a new pub here.

769
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,762
Did you move in here?

770
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,014
Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you.

771
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:57,599
Why did you buy this building?

772
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,810
You are no good judge of buildings.

773
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,645
Why?

774
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,106
All the businesses here
have gone bust every year.

775
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,108
My gosh.

776
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,987
Call me if you need anything.

777
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,780
-Yes, ma'am.
-Oh, dear.

778
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,828
DAILY INSTALLMENT LOAN

779
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,163
What did she say?

780
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,332
All the businesses here have failed.

781
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,464
The pub is all about

782
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,383
the people I work with.

783
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,884
People.

784
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,762
I told you. Business is all about people.

785
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:40,017
It's not like we're a charity.
This is business.

786
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:41,768
We need to make a profit.

787
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,353
We should see it at large.

788
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,897
Who would trust a company
that's inconsistent?

789
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:49,693
It's all over once we lose
the confidence of people.

790
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,824
Like father, like son.

791
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,794
He retrieved the investment

792
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:10,756
and bought a building?

793
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,185
I was going to visit you to apologize.

794
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,062
I'm surprised you came all the way here.

795
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:26,438
Apologize?

796
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,982
About the investment I retrieved.

797
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,110
I caused trouble to your schedule.

798
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,196
I told you before.

799
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,739
One percent. Two billion won.

800
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,783
They are just numbers.

801
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:42,746
The mission I gave you was
to make Chairman Jang go to your pub.

802
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:43,789
It wasn't the money.

803
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,045
Do you still want me on your side?

804
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,255
Of course.

805
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,259
Chairman Jang and Jang Geun-won.

806
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,596
Your goal is to get back at them, right?

807
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,392
We should have the same goal
to plan something together.

808
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,771
Are you sure revenge is all you want?

809
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:09,898
Revenge.

810
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:14,861
Maybe after that.

811
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,574
What I want

812
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,119
is freedom.

813
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,204
Freedom?

814
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:30,752
I want my words and acts to have power

815
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,172
so no one can mess with me and my people.

816
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:39,636
I don't want to be swayed
by anyone or any injustice.

817
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:44,015
I want to live a life

818
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,893
where I make my own decisions

819
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,480
and I don't have to pay for my principles.

820
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,483
Gosh.

821
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,405
It's just an ambiguous pun of an idealist.

822
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,286
I like it though.

823
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:09,749
The freedom you talked about...

824
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,628
Let's enjoy it together.

825
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,341
Okay.

826
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:43,116
The power and people he talked about...

827
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,078
You took

828
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,832
absolutely nothing from me.

829
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,670
I couldn't take anything from him?

830
01:01:58,965 --> 01:01:59,799
What?

831
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,304
As I grow older,

832
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,515
I'm becoming pettier.

833
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,313
A building owner?

834
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,192
In the end, you keep moving forward.

835
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,778
I'm not even surprised.

836
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:23,823
We should wait and see.

837
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,284
I heard businesses at that spot
has failed every year.

838
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,912
You don't seem worried though.

839
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:31,915
Well...

840
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,293
Because I have my people.

841
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,212
I keep on going believing in them.

842
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,428
I'm jealous.

843
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:48,223
What?

844
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,309
Jealous of what?

845
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,188
You seem to care about them a lot.

846
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,278
-That's because--
-You really need her, right?

847
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:07,409
I mean, Yi-seo.

848
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,538
On your way

849
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,124
to make me unemployed.

850
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,335
You need her, right?

851
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,224
Chairman Jang,
the guest you're expecting is here.

852
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,059
Okay. Let her in.

853
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,603
Are you expecting someone?

854
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,624
It hasn't been a long time since she came,

855
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,753
but I can't imagine

856
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,340
DanBam without Yi-seo.

857
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,040
SPECIAL THANKS TO SON HYUN-JOO

858
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:10,573
DANBAM

859
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,492
DANBAM

860
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:17,789
