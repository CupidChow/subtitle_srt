ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

EPISODE 4

4
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,522
Once you're suspended,

5
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,191
that's just it. It's over.

6
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,818
Business suspension?

7
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,736
I can just open it again.

8
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,697
It's no big deal.

9
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,954
That's impressive.

10
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,373
It does sound like you, Park Saeroyi.

11
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,041
You haven't changed.

12
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,044
A naive rough-and-tumble amateur.

13
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,507
I understand you though.

14
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,051
You went to prison because of me,

15
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,804
you got expelled from school
because of me,

16
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,893
and you think your dad died
because of me, right?

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,440
My gosh.

18
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,444
You know what?

19
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,784
You're right about that.

20
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,669
He's a middle school graduate,
an ex-convict, and an orphan.

21
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,422
Poor Saeroyi who ruined his life
because of me.

22
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,509
Gosh, I feel so bad for you.

23
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,559
Jang Geun-won.

24
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,811
Gosh. You sound scary.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,314
My goodness.

26
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,153
Do you want to punch me?
Like you did before?

27
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,573
Go ahead and do it.

28
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,908
You're good at it.

29
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,243
Assault.

30
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,002
Go ahead.

31
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,922
Hit me. Give me a blow.

32
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,757
Punch me. Just do it.

33
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,636
Aren't you going to hit me? Do it.

34
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,971
Go ahead. Hit me.

35
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,020
I guess you've grown up.

36
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,064
Good for you.

37
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,818
If you want to make a living
with that tiny store,

38
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,986
you need to be patient, right?

39
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,076
Nine years.

40
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,998
I've been putting up
with it the whole time.

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,377
And I'll do it for another six years.

42
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,006
-What?
-I have...

43
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,217
a 15-year plan.

44
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,347
-What are you talking about?
-The statute of limitations.

45
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,646
Stubbornness and foolishness.

46
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,274
I'll show you what it's like.

47
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,444
So you'd better...

48
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,199
brace yourself.

49
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,468
What the hell is that moron saying?

50
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,476
What are you looking at?

51
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,478
Damn it.

52
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,064
Jeez, he scared me for a second.

53
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,317
YONGGAK HIGH SCHOOL

54
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,404
So that guy's business
will get suspended, right?

55
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,781
Because of us.

56
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,951
Since when was he your buddy?

57
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,661
And the punishment we got

58
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,372
is writing a letter of apology
and running a few laps.

59
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,791
I have to say, he was right.

60
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,710
We're kiddies who can't take
responsibility for what we did.

61
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,465
He didn't even get angry
when his pub might get suspended.

62
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,843
How could he be like that?

63
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,720
He's just a fogey who's full of himself.

64
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,681
What?

65
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,026
LETTER OF APOLOGY

66
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,203
He didn't even get angry
when his pub might get suspended.

67
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,414
How could he be like that?

68
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,335
LETTER OF APOLOGY
JO YI-SEO

69
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,805
DANBAM

70
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,479
You really didn't know?

71
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,902
I left it to you and you took them in
knowingly. What is it then?

72
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,612
It's our fault.

73
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,578
EIGHT YEARS AGO

74
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,789
I'd like to introduce myself to you, boss.
I'm Choi Seung-kwon.

75
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,959
Hi, Seung-kwon.

76
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,587
Make yourself at home.

77
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,588
Yes, boss.

78
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,634
He looks like a smart cookie.
It'll be good to have him around.

79
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,386
All the youngsters these days
look like that.

80
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:10,931
Hey, Saeroyi.

81
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,934
He's a year younger than you.
Take good care of him.

82
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,394
What's there to take care of?

83
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,522
That rude punk.

84
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,779
That was the first day I met him.

85
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,949
So this is your first time in jail?

86
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,033
Yes, boss.

87
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,203
It's not much different
from the outside world.

88
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,581
-If you have any questions, just ask me.
-Thank you, boss.

89
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,918
Well...

90
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,879
-Who is he?
-Who?

91
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,176
Oh, Saeroyi? He's a year older than you.

92
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,804
I hope you guys can get along,
like brothers.

93
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,390
But he was kind of rude to you.

94
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,517
Which gang does he belong to?

95
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,813
He comes across as rude and cocky,
but he's not one of us.

96
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,774
Don't get on his nerves
and get into a fight with him.

97
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,236
-Yes, boss.
-He's half mad.

98
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:13,994
What are you doing?

99
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,371
Reading.

100
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,708
What?
Why are you talking so casually to me?

101
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,710
I am reading a book.

102
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,753
What kind of book is it?

103
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,672
Got something to say to me?

104
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,340
No.

105
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,468
You read all the time,
so I was just curious.

106
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,721
I want to learn many things.

107
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,598
What for?

108
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,768
For people like us who come from nothing,

109
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,770
studying is of no use.

110
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,026
I may come from nothing,

111
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,695
but I want many things.

112
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,031
But no one...

113
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,117
will hire an ex-convict.

114
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,207
You think you have no chance
because you're a poor,

115
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,709
undereducated ex-con?

116
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,796
You can't do anything
if you believe that is the case.

117
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,631
Why not decide after trying?

118
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,845
Your words sting.

119
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,306
Are you talking about me?

120
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,059
Are you lecturing me right now?

121
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,268
Of course not.

122
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,938
I'm just saying you shouldn't force me
to understand your logic.

123
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,441
You little shit.

124
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,028
Jeez, I really don't like your attitude.

125
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,613
Why are you such a stuck-up?

126
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,324
You're also an ex-con
who has failed in life.

127
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,283
So?

128
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:36,951
Is your life over?

129
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,331
-What?
-You think your life is worth nothing.

130
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,416
Moron.

131
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,462
Okay, go on.

132
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,547
What will you do when you get out?

133
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,592
Work at construction sites?
Work on a fishing boat?

134
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,595
Inmate 2294!

135
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,264
-Cut it out!
-Who do you think you are?

136
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,934
Okay, I'm done.

137
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,316
Study?

138
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,777
Do manual labor?
Work on a fishing boat?

139
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,779
I'll begin with all of that.

140
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,656
I'll do anything I need.

141
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,326
You have no right to determine my value.

142
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,662
My life has just begun!

143
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,915
And I'll achieve everything I want.

144
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,976
Time passes by.

145
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,777
-My gosh.
-Damn it!

146
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,488
Every day is the same.

147
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,490
Hey!

148
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,163
Come here!

149
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,169
And I was sick of it.

150
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,509
Like that...

151
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,678
DANBAM

152
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,013
...seven years passed by.

153
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,029
Boss, what are we doing in Itaewon?

154
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,532
A guy I know opened up a pub here.

155
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,826
I should bring my boys for a few drinks.

156
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,954
Oh, right. Seung-kwon, you know him too.

157
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,122
Pardon?

158
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,999
Hee-hoon, over here.

159
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,377
My goodness, look at you.

160
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,672
-It's been so long.
-Have you been well?

161
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,673
Yes, I have.

162
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,426
I can't believe
you actually opened up a pub.

163
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,095
My gosh, I'm sure this cost you
a lot of money.

164
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,936
Everyone is given the same amount of time.

165
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,147
You know Seung-kwon, right?
You should say hello.

166
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,943
Have you been well?

167
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,948
But the depth of the time

168
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,035
he and I had spent

169
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,081
were completely different.

170
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,923
Why do you come here to drink every day?

171
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,468
Why? Am I making you feel uncomfortable?

172
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,805
Are you kidding?
You're helping me increase my sales.

173
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,683
Why are you so busy?
There are no customers.

174
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,476
Join me for a drink.

175
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,401
You come alone often these days.

176
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,361
Did something happen?

177
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,284
No, not really.

178
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,412
I just enjoy watching you work here.

179
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,330
What?

180
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,291
I'm your fan.

181
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,253
What are you talking about?

182
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:17,797
I'm impressed.

183
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,049
You're doing what you want to do.

184
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,595
I want to live a proper life like you.

185
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,394
What's a proper life?

186
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,770
Not doing bad things

187
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,189
and working diligently.

188
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,235
I remember the day we first met.

189
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,323
-What?
-You think your life is worth nothing.

190
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,408
Moron.

191
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,119
Are you still a moron?

192
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,426
I'm such a fucking moron.

193
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,521
What's wrong with him?

194
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,581
PARK SAEROYI

195
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,249
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

196
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,089
DANBAM

197
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,256
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

198
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,177
I guess he just ignored what I said.

199
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,347
Oh, no.

200
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,933
He got expelled before graduation.

201
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,060
So we aren't alumni.

202
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,855
He was in high school ten years ago.

203
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,152
Jang Geun-won.

204
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,908
JANG GEUN-WON

205
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,747
ELDEST SON OF JANGGA CO. GETS ASSAULTED

206
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,375
POLICE ARREST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT
FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER

207
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:23,089
You think your dad died
because of me, right?

208
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,427
"Attempted murder."

209
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,262
"Previous conviction."

210
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,565
Ms. Kang has been meeting
the stockholders quite often these days.

211
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,110
Her late father and I were friends
for 40 years.

212
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,737
She's like a daughter to me.

213
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,073
That's why you should be more careful.

214
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,700
Who built Jangga Co.?

215
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,326
It was you and Mr. Kang.

216
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,414
The company could've been hers.
I'm sure she gets tempted at times.

217
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,458
That's enough.

218
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,586
I already have a plan of my own.

219
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,213
Okay.

220
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,466
By the way,

221
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,594
remember how Geun-soo recently got caught

222
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,679
drinking at a pub?

223
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,057
Do you know
who the owner of that pub is?

224
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,312
It turns out,

225
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,022
it was Saeroyi's pub.

226
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,865
He got suspended for two months.

227
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,786
He probably saved up really hard
for seven years

228
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,706
so he could finally open up that tiny pub.

229
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,876
He won't have the money to maintain it.

230
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,794
He's done.

231
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,718
Atari.

232
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,181
You're finally pretty good.

233
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,058
No, I still have a long way to go.

234
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,809
Leave it. I want to take a look.

235
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,395
Okay.

236
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,315
I have to say, I feel bad.

237
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,445
He's suffering because of my family again.

238
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,157
Business isn't for everyone.

239
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,784
I'll be off now.

240
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,629
He should've drawn a bigger picture.

241
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,089
Pardon?

242
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,759
The borderlines are too weak
because he focused too much on the center.

243
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,886
I wouldn't call this a good game.

244
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,642
Mr. Kim.

245
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,394
Yes, sir.

246
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,479
How is Geun-soo doing these days?

247
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:45,982
Welcome.

248
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,407
I don't want to fire him either.

249
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,617
But the minimum wage
is going up next year.

250
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,787
So you want me to fire him
even though he works so hard?

251
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,247
What about severance pay?

252
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,666
What severance pay?

253
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,668
No one hires
high schoolers these days.

254
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,462
We were nice enough
to give him a job.

255
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:12,300
We're not paying for his insurance,
and we didn't even write up a contract.

256
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,385
You're unbelievable.

257
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,930
You should be mean to him from now on
so that he'll quit on his own.

258
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,143
What a joke.

259
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,730
I can't wait to see your frowning face

260
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,982
with your business closed down.

261
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,586
The business suspension starts tomorrow.

262
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,920
How exciting.

263
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,090
I'm not like other men
I will call you first...

264
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,301
You know it's because of you, right?

265
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,386
Yes, I know.

266
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,265
I'll go see you long as you want me there

267
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,727
I'll run to you and fly to you

268
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,064
I'll embrace you
and give you everything I have

269
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,569
Don't ever do that again.

270
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,404
Okay.

271
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,366
Call me when you're lonely

272
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,825
What's stopping you?

273
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,288
You know I want you

274
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,332
Just cancel the song.

275
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,501
I really can't stand this.

276
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,341
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:39,970
So tell me.

278
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,515
How long are you going to be like this?

279
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,558
It's in the past. It can't be undone.

280
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,477
How should we handle this?

281
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,771
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,065
I'll fire you if you apologize
one more time.

283
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,487
That's great. Hurry up and apologize.

284
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,242
Here.

285
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,081
A two-month suspension.

286
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,376
Let's think of it as a chance
to improve what we lack.

287
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,253
-Okay, Saeroyi.
-Okay.

288
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,298
Now, let's not stop the fun.
Where should we go next?

289
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,591
-Another karaoke room?
-No.

290
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,680
Do me a favor.
Please don't sing in public.

291
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,061
Do you want to get fired?

292
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,982
I was so shocked at the recent meeting.

293
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,777
-Because the chairman slapped Geun-won?
-Yes.

294
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,698
He's never treated his son that way
regardless of how immature he was.

295
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,284
I was startled as well.

296
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,786
It's because he caused trouble
in the past.

297
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,164
Our stock price plummeted because of that.

298
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,498
Don't get me started.

299
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,833
I still get angry

300
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,710
every time I think of that.

301
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,295
He has been quiet for a while.

302
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,466
But he recently started going around
telling people that he's the heir again.

303
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,843
So he just helped him get to his senses.

304
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,971
This proves that raising kids
is the hardest thing in life.

305
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,389
I wouldn't know.

306
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,185
But I'm worried.

307
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,022
The chairman is old now.
He's not clear-headed as he used to be.

308
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,442
Plus, his one and only child is a mess.

309
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,568
He's right.

310
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,278
The executives are very concerned.

311
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,406
They think we should start preparing soon.

312
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,659
-Prepare?
-For the succession.

313
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,412
You're the best person for the job.

314
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,957
Yes, of course.
He can't leave the company to that fool.

315
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,835
Then we'll go bankrupt.

316
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,465
There's no need to feel pressured.
We just want you to know

317
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,178
how we feel about you.

318
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,431
Do you think the chairman
will let that happen?

319
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,391
Aren't you scared?

320
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,270
Why would we be scared?

321
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,438
He's right.

322
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:59,151
If you agree with our plan,
we'll support you all the way.

323
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,613
Do you have the guts
to fight the chairman?

324
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,784
And that's not even the issue.

325
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,286
You think he's not as clear-headed?

326
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,372
Do you really think

327
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,958
the company will run fine without him?

328
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,087
Ms. Kang, please don't get the wrong idea.

329
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,797
I'll pretend like I didn't hear it.

330
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:24,218
I'm not very satisfied
with Geun-won either.

331
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,972
But I'm too young to be used
as your cannon fodder.

332
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,100
My goodness.

333
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,394
That's not what we meant.

334
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,151
DANBAM

335
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,203
THE PUB WILL BE CLOSED FOR TWO MONTHS

336
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,920
Hello, please show us your IDs--

337
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,181
Twenty years old.

338
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,517
I got accepted
to all the universities I applied for.

339
00:23:55,851 --> 00:24:00,230
I turned 20 as of January 1st,
and I'm bored.

340
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,400
Here's why I hang around
with these dumb brats.

341
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:07,613
Her dad is a chief prosecutor.
Her dad owns a clothing company.

342
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,240
I only befriend people

343
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,661
when they have something I want.

344
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,330
Hi.

345
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:18,874
Hello.

346
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,710
The food you ordered looks very delicious.

347
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,046
Will you let us join you ladies?

348
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,091
We'd like to treat you.

349
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,555
Sure.

350
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,975
BOGWANG STUDY ROOM

351
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,204
Congratulations on turning 20.
What are you up to later?

352
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,707
She hasn't even read it yet.

353
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:17,182
The rent is 300,000 won with no deposit.
It's about five square meters big.

354
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,144
Why don't you say hello since we're here?

355
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,233
-Let's just go.
-Okay, sir.

356
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,534
Three male strangers.

357
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,912
I'm starting to get annoyed.

358
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,667
This fool is desperate for attention.

359
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,587
This jerk is just horny.

360
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,672
And he's just thoughtless.

361
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,009
I don't have anything against hook-ups.

362
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,138
Whether it's to fulfill loneliness,
desire for sex, or boredom,

363
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,058
it's just something people do

364
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,186
to satisfy their own desires.

365
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,481
It wouldn't be so bad

366
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,941
if they fulfill each other's needs.

367
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:12,154
But I don't want anything from these guys.

368
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,075
I'm so bored.

369
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,036
I wonder why.

370
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,629
Are you all right?

371
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,512
Ever since I met that guy,

372
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,224
I can't seem to be interested
in anything else.

373
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,857
Hello.

374
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,620
Hi.

375
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,663
Sweetheart.

376
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,500
I heard your pub got suspended
for having minors.

377
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,544
Well, yes.

378
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,339
Oh, no. You should be
making money during this time of year.

379
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,967
-You're so unlucky.
-Why are you rubbing it in?

380
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,678
What? No, I mean,
I heard someone called the police.

381
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,555
I'm just angry at whoever did that.

382
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,933
It's okay. Thanks to that,
I'm able to take some time off.

383
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,434
You're so positive.

384
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,187
What would you like to drink?
It'll be on the house.

385
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:30,023
-Really? Then I want--
-Hey.

386
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,775
You need to pay.

387
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,154
Only guys get free drinks.

388
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,783
I'm jealous.

389
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,541
Your friends look drunk.

390
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,794
Yes, I know.

391
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:56,133
How about we go get some ice cream
to sober up a little?

392
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,218
Yes, you should go.

393
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,387
We'll make sure your friends stay safe.

394
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,347
What a joke.

395
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,811
No, it's okay. I'm going to go now.

396
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,860
-Yi-seo.
-Let me warn you just in case.

397
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,988
Her dad is a chief prosecutor.

398
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,325
Don't let your momentary desire
get you locked up in jail.

399
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,252
This reminds me of when we were younger.

400
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,255
What?

401
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,843
You used to like me
back when we were in high school.

402
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,762
I still do.

403
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,433
Whatever. Are you drunk?

404
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,105
I'm just saying.

405
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,193
You always end it so vaguely.

406
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,487
Come to think of it,

407
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,364
you never really asked me out.

408
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,409
Are you toying with me?

409
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,245
That's absurd.

410
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,375
It's just that we both prioritize
our jobs.

411
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,003
And once my business goes well,

412
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,883
you'll end up losing your job.

413
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,223
It'd be fun if I asked you out--

414
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,646
What's the straight face for?
I didn't mean it.

415
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,695
Don't lie to me.

416
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,031
You never say things you don't mean.

417
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,575
It's okay.

418
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,953
If I become jobless,

419
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,872
I wouldn't be able to help you out.

420
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,459
But I'd cheer for you.

421
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:08,557
Yi-seo, wait. Where would you go?
There are no buses anymore.

422
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,766
I'll take a taxi.

423
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,060
You know it's impossible
to get a cab in Itaewon.

424
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,771
I'll keep you company
until the buses run again.

425
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:15,731
You should stay.

426
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,775
Gyeongridan Street is this way.

427
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,402
I can grab a cab there.

428
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,988
Why are you suddenly leaving?

429
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,948
Don't you like me?

430
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,660
No, I don't.

431
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,748
Why? What don't you like about me?

432
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,669
Your face, the way you talk, your voice,

433
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,422
your pupils, teeth, eyelashes,

434
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,090
pupils...

435
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,717
Did I say that already?

436
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,887
I don't like anything about you.

437
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,097
Bye, then.

438
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,393
Hey, wait.

439
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,855
What a fucking joke.

440
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,857
Are you crazy?

441
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,026
Then why did you drink with us?

442
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,737
Do you know how much you drank?

443
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,450
You must feel like you wasted
all that money

444
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,577
trying to score tonight.

445
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,874
You can keep the change.

446
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,255
-Hey, stop.
-Will you just--

447
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,761
Why? What's wrong?

448
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,473
Acting like a bitch like that
can get you hurt.

449
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,226
Who do you think is going to help you now?

450
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,607
Myself.

451
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,152
My gosh.

452
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,279
You messed with the wrong guy.

453
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:49,241
You think you can treat me like this
just because your pretty?

454
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,743
Let me teach you a lesson.

455
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,964
What a fucking loser.

456
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,345
Hey.
Stop right there.

457
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:12,973
Hey.

458
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,433
Hey, stop!

459
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:19,980
UNDER REPAIR

460
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,106
This is so annoying.

461
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,199
You're dead.

462
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,549
You little...

463
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,932
-Hey.
-Get off me.

464
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,559
You little...

465
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,745
Come with me while I'm being nice.

466
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,414
-Let me go.
-Hey.

467
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,045
Hey.

468
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,173
Yes?

469
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,050
Well...

470
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,679
Don't let her bother you.
I need to talk to my girlfriend.

471
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,807
What? I'm not your girlfriend.

472
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,392
Hey.

473
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,479
Don't be like this.

474
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,482
You can go. She's just drunk.

475
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,995
Your cheek is swollen.

476
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,458
We had a small incident.

477
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,253
If you're done, then you should leave.

478
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,007
I'd love to leave,
but I can't help but feel bothered.

479
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,971
I'm wondering why her cheek is swollen

480
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,598
and why she's looking at me like that.

481
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,309
You see, I know her.

482
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,480
What's your problem?

483
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,817
Stop being nosy and just get out of here.

484
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,404
You tell me.

485
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,533
-What?
-If I meddle in here,

486
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,285
does that mean I'm nosy?

487
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,079
You crazy bitch.

488
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,001
Hold on.

489
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,503
How nosy.

490
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,633
I can't do anything

491
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,635
if you stay quiet.

492
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:01,891
Okay.

493
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,853
Help me.

494
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,149
Okay, let's go.

495
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,822
Who do you think you are?
I told you to get lost--

496
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,659
My gosh.

497
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,622
You fucking jerk.
Do you have a death wish?

498
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,380
Damn it.

499
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,267
Soo-ah!

500
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,852
What?

501
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,187
-Run!
-Wait!

502
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,356
What's going on?

503
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,523
Just run!

504
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,129
What was that? What's going on?

505
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,590
What is going on?

506
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:01,469
He just saved me from some crazy jerk.

507
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,557
I know you're a pushover,

508
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,143
but were you running around
just to help her?

509
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:11,980
What?

510
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,314
Do you know her?

511
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,775
What?

512
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,032
No.

513
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,076
How would I know her?

514
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,288
I'm just upset
that you only care about others.

515
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,039
Let's go.

516
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,128
Do you want to call the police?

517
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,255
I'm fine.

518
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,631
Are you not hurt?

519
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,718
I got a good slap in the face.

520
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,261
It really hurts.

521
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,637
Well...

522
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,308
You should go see a doctor.
Take care then.

523
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,646
Thank you.

524
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,106
We should get going then.

525
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:56,983
Wait.

526
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,652
I'd like to repay your kindness.

527
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,156
It's okay. You must be startled.
Go home and get some rest.

528
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,073
No.

529
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,035
I don't like to feel indebted.

530
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,747
Would you like some coffee?

531
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,292
Hey.

532
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,627
He says it's fine.

533
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,004
You're making him feel uncomfortable.

534
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,217
It's really fine.

535
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:24,844
Just go home.

536
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,642
You seemed interested
in promoting your pub before.

537
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:35,021
I'd like to give you some tips.

538
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,856
It's my thing.

539
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:00,463
Well...

540
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,008
So it's your thing.
You must have an interest in advertising.

541
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:04,926
Yes.

542
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,471
I earn my pocket money with promotion
on social media and websites.

543
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,057
What's going on between you two?

544
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,016
What?

545
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,101
We're friends.

546
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,895
I see.

547
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,105
But...

548
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,399
Saeroyi likes me.

549
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,114
It's been about ten years, right?

550
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,116
What?

551
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,328
Oh, I'll go get the coffee.

552
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,337
So you're famous on social media.

553
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,798
I thought you were familiar.

554
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,760
I saw you on the list
of social media models for Jangga Co.

555
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:51,097
Really? Why did you not hire me?

556
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,559
But I don't understand
why you're hitting on a guy like him.

557
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,814
Do you...

558
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:02,942
like Saeroyi?

559
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,863
Do I like him?

560
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,575
I guess I am hitting on him.

561
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,536
But I'm not sure if I like him.

562
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,580
I'm interested though.

563
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,916
Saeroyi is attractive.

564
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,043
But

565
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,963
he's not someone
a girl like you can deal with.

566
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,843
A girl like me?

567
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,762
What do you mean?

568
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,139
Well...

569
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,851
Those with a sheltered life
who think that the world

570
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,645
revolves around them.

571
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,400
I guess you think you know
who I am through my social media.

572
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,487
I can't deal with him?

573
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:53,034
Are you talking about the criminal record
of attempted murder?

574
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,830
You're hitting on him knowing that?

575
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,248
It makes him more attractive.

576
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:08,091
You're young, but it's not cute
when you have no sense of shame.

577
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,554
His pub is suspended because of you,

578
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,057
but you don't seem sorry at all.

579
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,941
I know you're a pushover,

580
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,068
but were you running around
just to help her?

581
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,027
What?

582
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,779
Do you know her?

583
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,199
What are you looking at?

584
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,493
How did you know?

585
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,329
We're friends. Of course I would know.

586
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,373
You got caught drinking there.

587
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,709
Do you know how much the damage isÂ

588
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,378
to pay for rent while the store is closed
for two months?

589
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,130
No.

590
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,133
His business getting suspended
because of me...

591
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,218
How do you know that?

592
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,889
-What?
-I thought it was strange.

593
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,685
He didn't tell you about me.

594
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,772
But why do you think
he's suspended because of me?

595
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,818
-That's--
-Well...

596
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,988
Is it you...

597
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,743
who called the police?

598
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,124
What?

599
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,126
Why aren't you saying anything?

600
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,294
You should deny it.

601
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,088
You'd never do that to your friend.

602
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,965
If he's suspended,

603
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,384
he has to suffer a lot of damage.

604
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,019
So it's true.

605
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,276
I must have some supernatural powers.

606
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,529
-You--
-I'm curious though.

607
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,240
Why?

608
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,660
Because it's across from your pub?

609
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:04,832
Is that why you stabbed your friend
who's liked you for ten years in the back?

610
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,171
That's unbelievable.

611
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,550
So what are you up to?

612
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,512
You still want to
have a barrier around him.

613
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,639
You can't let others have him.

614
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,107
You know what?

615
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,152
There's no way you can have him.

616
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:35,988
Why?

617
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,657
Because that's who Saeroyi is.

618
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:39,909
He won't change.

619
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:48,668
But if he finds out what you did,

620
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,045
he might change a little.

621
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,092
Don't worry.

622
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:59,428
Like I said, I'm just a little interested.

623
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,660
What's wrong with you two?

624
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:23,953
Did you guys fight?

625
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,414
No. Why would we fight?

626
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,250
She's really something.

627
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,586
How would I win against her?

628
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,052
Saeroyi.

629
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:46,684
The person
who reported your pub to the police.

630
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,773
It's me.

631
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,991
Do you still like me?

632
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:08,873
Yes.

633
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,337
There must've been a reason.

634
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,673
I wouldn't know why
unless you tell me.

635
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,427
I'm just a little

636
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,888
disappointed.

637
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,109
I should get going.

638
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:39,862
Are you all right?

639
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,530
You don't seem fine.

640
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,536
See you.

641
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,049
Shall we go now?

642
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,761
Aren't you interested
in promoting your pub?

643
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,847
As of today, I've come of age.

644
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,433
I guess it's a perfect time
to grab a drink.

645
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,644
What do you think?

646
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:33,291
You said you wish me happiness
for now and always.

647
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,669
That very sentence in your letter

648
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,088
meant a lot to me.

649
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,175
There's no way I can resent you.

650
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,430
You're just living your life.

651
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,391
And I'm always grateful.

652
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,371
It's so annoying.

653
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,048
You just went through something terrible.

654
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,508
Shouldn't you get some rest at home?

655
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,927
I'm fine.

656
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,305
We met again like this.

657
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,519
Aren't you upset?

658
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,982
-What do you mean?
-A friend whom you liked for ten years

659
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,650
just betrayed you.

660
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,069
Betrayed me?

661
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,740
I'm not sure if I can call it a betrayal.

662
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,284
She didn't say much,

663
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,745
but I think I know why she did that.

664
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,915
It's just that she's committed

665
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,334
to her job and her life.

666
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,754
You sound like Gandhi.

667
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,507
"I've liked you for ten years,

668
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,842
so you have to like me back."

669
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,761
This isn't about business.

670
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,847
Feelings aren't like a give-and-take deal.

671
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,016
Gosh.

672
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,310
I don't want to talk about her.

673
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,327
-What are you doing?
-What brings you here?

674
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,329
I need to organize things
when I have time.

675
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,164
What are you doing here?

676
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,916
I'm here to clean, but I got bored.

677
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,710
Do you even have time to feel bored?

678
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,088
Actually, I'm glad you came.

679
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,050
I'm soaked in sweat.
Let's go to the sauna.

680
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,719
-What?
-I'll pay.

681
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:51,971
Help me scrub my back.

682
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,807
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?

683
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,517
Why are you getting so worked up?

684
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,977
I'll scrub your back too.

685
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,146
I'm not going.

686
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:04,900
What?

687
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:10,948
What are you looking at?

688
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,786
I guess you don't have confidence.

689
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,289
What?

690
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,124
Nothing.

691
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,297
It's not just about size.

692
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,010
Go by yourself, you crazy idiot.

693
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,642
My gosh.

694
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,605
How did you start your pub?

695
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,525
I just worked hard and saved up money.

696
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:51,655
And you've never worked at a pub before?

697
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,825
How did you know?

698
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,869
I could tell from the place.

699
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,372
Your pub has bigger issues than promotion.

700
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,374
Like what?

701
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,459
Everything.

702
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,963
You don't have the basics.

703
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,132
The basics?

704
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,511
The most important thing
is getting the basics down.

705
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,057
Can you be more specific?

706
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,519
I bet you've been doing this
only with your passion.

707
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:23,437
The interior design is tacky,

708
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,564
and the employees seem dull.

709
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,733
The place has no character, nor basics.

710
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,238
How would it go well?

711
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,448
How do you know all this stuff?

712
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,450
You just turned 20.

713
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,743
I told you I make money

714
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,328
by promoting stuff on the web.

715
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,581
Eating shows and restaurant reviews
are lucrative contents.

716
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,333
Once I get the basic principles,

717
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,752
there's a thread of connections
between things.

718
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,509
You're impressive.

719
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,267
Drink up.

720
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,477
I think I should stop here.

721
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,104
I drank too much.

722
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:08,941
You can hold your liquor.

723
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,776
I'm feeling good today.

724
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,697
It's sweet.

725
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,245
That means you had

726
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,164
a very impressive day today.

727
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,296
The pub's name is a problem.

728
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,463
DanBam?

729
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,717
-What's wrong?
-It's just lame.

730
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,510
It doesn't suit Itaewon.

731
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,721
Why did you choose that name?

732
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,938
My life

733
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,274
is a little

734
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,776
bitter.

735
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,990
It's just too bitter.

736
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,161
I can't sleep well at night.

737
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:04,872
I feel nostalgic,

738
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,499
lonely,

739
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,169
and upset.

740
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,722
So my job is cut out for me.

741
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,266
There's no other reason.

742
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,518
It's just...

743
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,481
I want

744
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,359
my bitter night

745
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,570
and my life...

746
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,161
to be sweet.

747
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:48,957
There it goes again.

748
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:51,960
My heart...

749
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:56,465
feels strange.

750
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,474
Am I drunk?

751
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,394
I'm talking too much.

752
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,065
I should stop drinking.

753
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,033
Right now, I'm...

754
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,578
not drunk at all.

755
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,544
This guy with a buzz cut
just sprawled out drunk.

756
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,630
But he looks cute.

757
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:40,884
This is awkward.

758
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,306
He says his night is bitter,

759
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,226
but I want it to be sweet.

760
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,895
I want to make

761
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,065
his life sweet.

762
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,278
The feeling I have now

763
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:04,283
is the most foolish thing
that a human being can do.

764
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:07,953
I just can't resist

765
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,915
this impulse.

766
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:15,794
Do you like Saeroyi?

767
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:28,932
I like him.

768
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,410
Gosh, it's a hospital room.

769
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:56,502
That was a dangerous dream.

770
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,349
Gosh, I feel much better now.

771
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:15,270
You've been staying out a lot these days.

772
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,564
It's how a 20-year-old should act.

773
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,150
You said studying hard
won't help me find a good guy

774
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,777
and that I should have fun too.

775
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,820
So?

776
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,738
Are you seeing someone?

777
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,366
Why do you ask?

778
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,534
Don't.

779
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,286
Guys whom you date at your age
are just useless.

780
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,334
I've always been curious.

781
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,712
Why did you marry Dad?

782
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,381
Because I loved him.

783
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,007
That's surprising.

784
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,425
I was serious.

785
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,261
I mean, back then.

786
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,722
Why did you divorce him?

787
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,308
A person's feelings can be

788
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,185
very shallow.

789
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,521
They change depending on the situation.

790
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,940
After you were born, I got sagging skin

791
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,692
and more wrinkles.

792
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,864
Are you saying it's because of me?

793
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,824
I wanted to be a woman

794
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,786
who's always loved
instead of a mother of a child.

795
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:14,496
So I got divorced.

796
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,914
It's simple.

797
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,916
I guess you regret

798
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,002
meeting Dad.

799
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:21,545
Not really.

800
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,464
Two years of dating
and seven years of marriage.

801
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,175
It was a short period
of less than ten years' time.

802
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:30,095
But I loved him and he loved me.

803
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,181
It's like the completion of youth.

804
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,351
Without those memories,

805
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,271
I don't have anything left
for my life as a woman.

806
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,151
Like you did,

807
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,777
what if I fall in love

808
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,947
with a mediocre man
and I--

809
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:50,532
Don't.

810
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:55,621
Don't ruin your life
for something trifle like love.

811
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,498
You're too good for that.

812
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,086
My sweet daughter.

813
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,340
You won't make me sad, will you?

814
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,762
Mom, you're so selfish.

815
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,819
Life is a series of choices.

816
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,283
Producing a result
that matches your values.

817
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,371
People call it a good choice

818
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,331
or a correct answer.

819
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,000
I'm 20.

820
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,837
I'm still confused about values of life.

821
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,135
If the coin comes up heads,

822
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,597
I'll become a person you want me to be.

823
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:59,434
If it comes up tails,

824
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,604
You'll end up crying, Mom.

825
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,714
Did the coin come up heads

826
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,424
or tails?

827
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,177
Flipping the coin,

828
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,014
which one did I wish for?

829
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,228
I decided to call it tails.

830
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:38,033
DANBAM

831
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,394
I realize something as soon as I see him.

832
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:15,320
Did you go home well last night?

833
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,698
I didn't even need to hesitate.

834
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:21,868
Yes.

835
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,582
What brings you here?

836
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,727
I want to be with you.

837
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,816
What did you say?

838
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,527
Like Mom said,

839
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,612
I'm just too good.

840
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,908
Love and success.

841
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:04,703
I can achieve all those things.

842
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:08,999
I mean...

843
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,335
Feel sad just for a little while, Mom.

844
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:18,091
I want to work here.

845
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:27,517
I will help you achieve your dream, Boss.

846
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,231
He's not just a mediocre man.

847
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,276
I will turn him into someone amazing.

848
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,447
I will.

849
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:59,132
DANBAM

850
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,167
What the hell are you talking about?
How dare you come here?

851
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,794
-Do you want to go clubbing?
-Club?

852
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,170
Let's go!

853
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,631
She's too good for him.

854
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,967
-What?
-Why?

855
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:42,968
Is that...

856
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,552
I'm like Zhuge Liang.

857
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:46,554
I'm Merlin and Rayleigh.

858
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,473
So it's all about taste.

859
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,309
Hyun-yi's not good at cooking.
You have to make a decision.

860
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,186
He's one of my people.
I care about it.

861
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,980
Whoever it is,
I'll make my decision.

862
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:56,648
So this is Park Saeroyi's pub?

863
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,985
It is time for action, not words.

864
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:00,986
It's so annoying!

865
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:05,156
I'm not sorry for you at all.

866
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,867
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

867
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,829
You are always shining

868
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:12,872
too bright.

869
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,586
