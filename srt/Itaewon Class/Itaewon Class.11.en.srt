PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

EPISODE 11

5
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,105
The Best Pub?

6
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,944
The business is doing pretty well
these days,

7
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,946
so I'm not sure if there's a point.

8
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,198
Should I talk to them?

9
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,284
Yes, so...

10
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,496
We don't have to pay
to be on the show, right?

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,289
Okay.

12
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:25,460
Then I'll discuss with my staff
and get back to you.

13
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,003
All right.

14
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,589
The Best Pub?

15
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,466
They want us on the show again?

16
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,178
Goodness. They refused to put us on,
but now they want us back?

17
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,014
We generated quite the buzz
thanks to Jangga Co.

18
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,517
The victim of a big company's power abuse
overcame a hardship

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,769
-and opened his own business.
-Hey.

20
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,857
What? It's an inspiring story.

21
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,236
And everyone loves
success stories like this.

22
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,824
We've received a number of inquiries
regarding using the name, DanBam.

23
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,078
-When is Hyun-yi back from her vacation?
-In a week.

24
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,956
Then it'll work out, time-wise.

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,251
What do you guys all think
about going on the show?

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,213
Well, I have no reason to object to it.

27
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,673
I'm on board.

28
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,389
Me too.

29
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,599
I think it'll be beneficial for DanBam.

30
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,939
Then...

31
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,440
Also,

32
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,610
I have something to tell you.

33
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,738
Okay, what is it?

34
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,242
I will

35
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,411
leave DanBam.

36
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,544
Hey, what the heck are you talking about?

37
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,883
I've been thinking about it for a while--

38
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,926
Let's go upstairs and have a chat.

39
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,939
I'm curious.

40
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,153
You've been holding out well
even though you don't really belong here.

41
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,323
Why do you want to quit now?

42
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,663
Because of you.

43
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,770
I've mentioned this before,
but if it's because of your family--

44
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,188
No, it's not.

45
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,775
That's not the reason.

46
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,319
Then what is it?

47
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,490
I'm not sure if you know this,

48
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,034
but I was born out of wedlock.

49
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,161
What about it?

50
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,665
There are things I always used to hear

51
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,167
because of it.

52
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,086
"Don't be greedy.

53
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,005
Know your place.

54
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,132
Mooch off the Jangga Co."

55
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,302
So I kept that in mind

56
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,722
and never wanted anything in life.

57
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,063
That's how I used to live,

58
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,358
but you're...

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,696
Your "way of life," shall I say?

60
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,701
It was very stimulating.

61
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,664
I must've learned something here.

62
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,208
I think I've changed a little.

63
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,336
No.

64
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,423
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

65
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,969
you should take over Jangga Co.

66
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,725
I'm going to change.

67
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,277
I'm not sure what the reason is,

68
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,279
but I can't ask you to stay.

69
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,577
I wish you all the best.

70
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,001
I'll do my best.

71
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,394
Look who's here.

72
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,188
What's up, Soo-ah?

73
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,444
How are you?

74
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,488
Are you all right?

75
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,617
I won't be here long anyway.

76
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,828
I'll get out soon. Don't worry.

77
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,709
Thanks for visiting me.
This makes me feel better.

78
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,170
I appreciate it.

79
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,132
The chairman

80
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,135
sent me here.

81
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,682
My dad?

82
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,603
He's doing well, right?

83
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,606
Right, I'm the sole heir of the company.

84
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,733
He can't be at ease,
knowing that I'm locked up here.

85
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,237
Tell him not to worry.

86
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,281
Let him know I'm doing well here.

87
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,960
JANGGA CO.

88
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,303
It's an agreement

89
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,181
for share transfer.

90
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,184
What?

91
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,188
The chairman

92
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,234
wants you to transfer your shares

93
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,613
to himself.

94
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,191
Sir, I just heard that all went well
with the share transfer.

95
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,402
Good.

96
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,029
Dad.

97
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,329
You...

98
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,456
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,256
I think I should start learning

100
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,675
about management.

101
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,679
-What?
-I'm talking about Jangga Co.

102
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,474
I should

103
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,018
run the company down the road.

104
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,110
-What are you--
-You dedicated your life to Jangga Co.

105
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,034
Can you really leave it in the hands
of a complete stranger?

106
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,956
You don't have

107
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,041
an alternative.

108
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,553
CHOI SEUNG-KWON

109
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,471
I have to say, that was too heartless.

110
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,140
Shouldn't we have thrown
a goodbye party for him?

111
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,561
I know. I feel like it was too rushed.

112
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,229
With Geun-soo gone,

113
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,690
this place feels empty.

114
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,692
Why did he quit?

115
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,736
What do you think?
It's obviously because of someone we know.

116
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,200
Hello, welcome to...

117
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,540
What?

118
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,293
Hold on.

119
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,130
Pretty lady, what's with all this makeup?

120
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,633
The surgery went well.

121
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,512
I'm back at work tomorrow, you know.
I'm stopping by to let you know

122
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,306
that I'm back safe and sound.

123
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,018
-You look pretty.
-I know, right?

124
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,186
I can't believe
you look prettier than I do.

125
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,105
My gosh.

126
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,316
You totally surprised us.
Right, Seung-kwon?

127
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,859
Yes. What? What did you say?

128
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,324
You heard the news, right?

129
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,910
Yes. About Geun-soo
and The Best Pub, right?

130
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,413
Sounds like a lot happened
while I was gone.

131
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,333
Let's spend some time with Geun-soo soon.

132
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,127
What do you want to do?
About The Best Pub.

133
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,465
Why even ask?
It's a good opportunity for us.

134
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,592
We should do it.

135
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,846
I knew it. Great minds think alike.

136
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,853
JANGGA CO.

137
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,605
This is good enough.

138
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,525
You don't have to manage the pub anymore.

139
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,152
Pardon?

140
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,364
-Then--
-I don't need you in Itaewon anymore.

141
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,157
Focus on the planning team.

142
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,619
Yes, sir.

143
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,206
The project Geun-won was in charge of...
The TV show...

144
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,751
The Best Pub, right?

145
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,294
I want you to be in charge of it.

146
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,131
And do me a favor.

147
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,092
What is it, sir?

148
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,762
Come in.

149
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,817
Hello. I'm Jang Geun-soo, Ms. Oh.

150
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,737
What brings you here?

151
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,198
You two have met before, right?

152
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,077
He's my younger son.

153
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,746
I want you to train him.

154
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,002
I'm looking forward to working with you,
Ms. Oh.

155
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,843
Don't mind us. This is your desk.

156
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,724
And this is the planning team's manual.

157
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,228
It's very thick.

158
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,064
You need to be multifaceted
to work in Planning.

159
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,191
This has all the basic information.

160
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,068
Okay.

161
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,613
By the way,

162
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,534
why did you leave DanBam?

163
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,621
There's something I want.

164
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,582
I guess I've gotten greedy.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,126
"Greedy"?

166
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,546
I have to stay in Jangga Co. to get it.

167
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,465
And that's why

168
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,844
I'll do my best, Ms. Oh.

169
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,644
Ma'am. Please, ma'am.

170
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,813
-That money is for my son's school lunch.
-Let go!

171
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,315
Please give me a little more time.

172
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,485
Please, I have to make sure
my son gets his lunch at least.

173
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,826
-Dad!
-Don't give me such bullshit.

174
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,496
Why have him in the first place
if you can't feed him?

175
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,333
Ma'am.

176
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,045
Ma'am!

177
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,172
Gosh.

178
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,843
What are you doing here?

179
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,106
I used to be fond of you, but you're mean.

180
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,194
What are you talking about?

181
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,740
I was just collecting the money
I lent to him. You call that "mean"?

182
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,660
What about his son though?
What's he going to eat?

183
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,622
He can afford to drink
but doesn't have money to feed his son?

184
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,999
That's ridiculous.

185
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,918
Still.

186
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:58,963
Shut it.

187
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,051
One mussel soup for Table Eight.

188
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,559
Toni, can you season
the mussel soup for me?

189
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,894
Sure.

190
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,443
CURRY POWDER

191
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,992
-Hey, what about the mung bean sprouts?
-Hang on a second.

192
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,827
All right. It's ready.

193
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,329
By the way, why do I smell curry here?

194
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,998
We don't have anything with curry.

195
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,423
-Toni.
-Yes?

196
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,967
Why did you put curry powder
in the mussel soup?

197
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,095
Why is it taking so long?
The orders are...

198
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,229
What are you doing?

199
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,359
This actually isn't bad.

200
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,249
DANBAM PUB

201
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:22,296
On cold winter days, we crave
spicy kimchi stew accompanied by soju.

202
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,965
All year-round, even if it rains or snows,

203
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,842
pubs are there to console us.

204
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,220
Sixteen famous pubs
from all over the country

205
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,639
are here.

206
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,474
This is the first round.

207
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,311
Which pubs will survive?

208
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,356
What will the panelists' choice be?

209
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,192
The search
for the best pub in the country.

210
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,236
The winner of the first round.

211
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,697
The winner is...

212
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,867
WHICH PUB WILL COME IN FIRST PLACE?

213
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,123
THE BEST PUB

214
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,918
It's DanBam Pub's Ma Hyun-yi.
Congratulations.

215
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:08,676
Yes, Ma Hyun-yi! Ma Hyun-yi!

216
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,762
Ma Hyun-yi!

217
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,973
Ma Hyun-yi!

218
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,144
-Are you that excited?
-Gosh, I'm sorry!

219
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,354
Jeez, my ears...

220
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,356
THE JUDGES LOVED HER CURRY MUSSEL SOUP

221
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,108
How many times
have we watched this already?

222
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,276
You already know I won.
Don't make such a fuss.

223
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,445
It means you're number one in the country.

224
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,450
She's our head cook, you know.
This was to be expected.

225
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,202
Didn't you want to fire her?

226
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,122
Me? When? I never said that.

227
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,165
I can't live without you, Hyun-yi.

228
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,888
Hello, we're not open yet.
Could you come back at 5 p.m.?

229
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,809
I'm not here to eat. Is the owner around?

230
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,897
What a nice view.

231
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,110
We have to go get ready
for the opening shift.

232
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,279
My apologies.

233
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,826
I'm Do Jung-myeong,
the CEO of JM Holdings.

234
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,912
I'm interested in franchising DanBam.

235
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,917
Franchising our pub?

236
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:28,255
JM Holdings? And you're interested
in franchising our business?

237
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,591
Then are you here
with an investment offer?

238
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,967
That's correct.

239
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,012
I'm glad you came, sir.

240
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,016
How did you hear about us?

241
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:43,062
We're an investment firm, but we also have
a few stable subsidiaries.

242
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,646
An interior design firm, for example.

243
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,233
We were looking for a franchise business
to partner with,

244
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,028
and I happened to watch the show,
The Best Pub, recently.

245
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,994
MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM WINS

246
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,329
So the winner is DanBam.

247
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,958
Park Saeroyi's pub.

248
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,669
CHAIRMAN JANG DAE-HEE

249
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,338
I suppose I overestimated your abilities.

250
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,341
I'm sorry, sir.

251
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,515
This is a cooking competition show
in a tournament format.

252
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,433
They've passed the first round,

253
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,061
but the current ranking
isn't that important.

254
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,687
Enough.

255
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,818
We came in second place, sir.

256
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,072
I guess you're happy

257
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,533
that we came in second.

258
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,703
I apologize, sir. I'll train him well.

259
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,540
I'll train my own son. You may leave.

260
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,430
Don't give me that stupid face.

261
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,017
I guess
you just can't gauge the situation.

262
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,897
I guess not.

263
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,235
We came in second
among all the famous pubs in the country.

264
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,238
What's the problem?

265
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,200
Because Saeroyi's pub won?

266
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,459
How would you describe Jangga Co.?

267
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,422
-What?
-The best in the restaurant industry.

268
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,216
But what?

269
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,386
It's a tournament,
and that was only the first round?

270
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,221
Coming in second is impressive enough?

271
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,646
We're always number one.
That's why we're the best in the industry.

272
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,775
And you just ruined it.

273
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,199
I thought you were
determined to prove yourself,

274
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,576
but you're such a softie.

275
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:03,911
What?

276
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,165
You'll run the company?

277
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,667
You're the only alternative I have?

278
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,503
Nonsense.

279
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,756
"The best."

280
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,218
I even ousted my eldest son
to protect that image.

281
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,304
I wouldn't even hesitate
to desert a punk like you.

282
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,933
Get out.

283
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,153
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,621
I thought you were pretty smart.

285
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,627
You're a mere employee.

286
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,797
How dare you talk back to the chairman
in front of your manager?

287
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,508
Why are you so confident?

288
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,426
Because he's your father?

289
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,683
I know what kind of working relationship
you had with Saeroyi,

290
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,436
but things are done differently here.

291
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,275
We are a strictly
vertically structured company.

292
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,235
I don't care even if you're his son.

293
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,655
I do not need an incompetent employee
on my team.

294
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,618
Get used to it quickly.

295
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,249
That's all good, but...

296
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,380
Things like "the family"

297
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,716
and "the chairman's son"...

298
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,761
Please refrain
from using such expressions.

299
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,851
You don't know much about my relationship
to the family and what kind of life

300
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,228
I've lived.

301
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,984
Is that so?

302
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,699
But you see,

303
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,705
you didn't even go to college,
and you're not qualified for this job.

304
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,292
So how did you get this job
without even going through an interview?

305
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,462
Because the chairman
is your father, right?

306
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,882
I have no interest in your story.

307
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,675
If you don't want to hear these things,

308
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,219
just do your job right.

309
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,025
MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM WINS

310
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,360
We're definitely benefiting
from being on this show.

311
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,821
We're certainly getting more customers.

312
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,115
We've been getting
more franchise inquiries.

313
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,117
And now, even an investment offer.

314
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,995
I think now's the perfect time.

315
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,790
Let's streamline our branding.

316
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,875
I agree with you, boss.

317
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,171
What? What are we doing?

318
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,757
-First, we'll--
-First off...

319
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,594
Ta-da. Have a look at this.

320
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,012
What is it?

321
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,848
A manual for our interior design,
recipes, and employee guidelines.

322
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,768
I put everything together
while working on our reopening.

323
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,105
I took all the trials and errors
into consideration.

324
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,026
When did you have time
to put this together?

325
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,278
I'm impressed.

326
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,537
We can open another location
right away with this.

327
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,625
-What?
-We've been receiving many inquiries.

328
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,627
We'll keep on opening locations,
one by one.

329
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,420
We'll make it a success

330
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,006
-and participate in the Franchise Expo--
-Hang on.

331
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,717
But why do it in such a roundabout way?

332
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,262
There's a company
that wants to invest in us.

333
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,639
Oh, that company? Something Holdings?

334
00:23:55,851 --> 00:24:00,021
It's too soon to attract investment
to start something.

335
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,273
In what way?

336
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:05,068
We only have one location now. We don't
have experience in another location.

337
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:09,406
Boss, we managed to do so well
even in this remote alley.

338
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,199
You think we need more experience?

339
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,036
For the franchisees,
their livelihood depends on this.

340
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,746
Are you sure we'll never go bust?

341
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,167
What business is completely immune

342
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,544
to the risk of going bust?

343
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,047
All I'm saying is,
it's safer to open locations one by one

344
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,551
than to open multiple franchise locations
at once.

345
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,431
I understand.

346
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,684
But there's a company
that's willing to invest in us,

347
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,935
so we can take that money

348
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,522
and create a system
that can manage multiple locations.

349
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,608
If we open locations one by one,

350
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,068
when will we catch up with Jangga Co.?

351
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,583
Well, Yi-seo does have a point.

352
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,960
She always does.

353
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,254
Then what's the problem?

354
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,383
Nothing, really.
I just want to find the best solution.

355
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,472
-CEO Do Jung-myeong...
-Do you know him?

356
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,265
I've heard of his name.

357
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,018
This investment firm is quite well-known.

358
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,938
I'll look into this, just in case.

359
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,065
Oh, what about the other thing?

360
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,441
Right, just a second.

361
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,951
His name is Toni, right?

362
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,411
It's for his visa extension.
Three years would be no problem.

363
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,996
Thanks.

364
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,415
I told you employing foreigners
can be a headache.

365
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,125
All the paperwork is one thing,

366
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,169
but that. What a hassle.

367
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,963
You're doing it again today?

368
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,924
It's not a hassle.
It doesn't even take long.

369
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,803
Anyway, find out more information
about JM Holdings. I'm off.

370
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,268
I can't get a hold of your boss.

371
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,645
I'm a little surprised
because I feel like I'm being clingy.

372
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,064
That's not true, sir.

373
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,025
My boss is very careful and cautious.

374
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,946
We're positively considering it,
so please give us a little more time.

375
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,365
Okay. All right, then.

376
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,618
But we need to come up with a plan,
so we can't keep on waiting.

377
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,454
We'll visit you soon.

378
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,123
I'm sorry, sir.

379
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,424
Damn it.

380
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,011
-What?
-Where's Boss?

381
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:44,311
LOOKING FOR KIM TONI'S FATHER,
KIM DONG-GIL

382
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,693
I want pupa soup and a bowl of rice.

383
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,612
Ma'am, how many times
do I have to tell you?

384
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,740
You can't order just the side items
on the menu.

385
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,158
Why are you saying I can't do it?

386
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,160
Chestnut told me it's fine.

387
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,246
There he is.

388
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,374
I'd like pupa soup and a bowl of rice.

389
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,709
Sure.

390
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,214
-Hey, Toni.
-Boss, you're back.

391
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,761
Take this. It's the visa application.

392
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,512
You can stay for another three years.

393
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,307
Boss.

394
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,519
Thank you.

395
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,608
Can you put this back there?

396
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,701
NAME IN FULL: KIM TONI

397
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,453
I'm so relieved now.

398
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,623
You need to do all this just to stay?

399
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,125
It's stressful being a foreigner.

400
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,668
I told you that I'm Korean.

401
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,295
I know that, you fool.

402
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,631
Where are you from?

403
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,759
I'm from Guinea. It's a country in Africa.

404
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,928
Guinea?

405
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,310
Hello.

406
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,895
Hello.

407
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,901
DANBAM

408
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,577
Did you put these up?

409
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,081
-Yes.
-Someone reported it to us.

410
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,958
It's illegal to put up flyers like this.

411
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,628
You'll be fined 100,000 won.

412
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,923
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

413
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,968
I feel bad for the guy looking
for his father, but don't put these up.

414
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,011
Okay.

415
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,479
Boss, how long have you been
distributing these?

416
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,149
For about a month.

417
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,109
Sorry, that wasn't helpful.

418
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,194
Don't say that. You've done enough.

419
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,488
Thank you.

420
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,783
Don't worry. We'll look for him together.

421
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,329
-Boss.
-Yes?

422
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,748
Let's talk.

423
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,583
Okay.

424
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,170
Jeez, there she goes again.

425
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,838
Hey, just ignore her.

426
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,216
Ma'am?

427
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,636
Ma'am.

428
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,534
What did your friend say?

429
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,081
He said it's a renowned investment firm.

430
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,211
There's this thing
I asked Ho-jin to look into it,

431
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,756
and I want to think about it.

432
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,174
Then what?

433
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,260
It's not like we can stop the bus
once it leaves.

434
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,680
Mr. Do called earlier.

435
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,766
He can't wait indefinitely.

436
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,230
It's great that you're trying

437
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,982
to help Toni find his father
and to look after everyone else.

438
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:22,070
But the timing is important,
and there's a thing called priority.

439
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,239
Am I the only one who's anxious?

440
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,908
Why must you make me so antsy?

441
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,082
I'm always the heartless bitch, aren't I?

442
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,708
-Yi-seo.
-Of course, I understand

443
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,335
you're the one who makes the call.

444
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,379
I will follow your decision.

445
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,798
But can't you

446
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,510
trust me?

447
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,898
Are you confident?

448
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,860
What?

449
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,324
Yes.

450
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:09,909
Okay then.

451
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,452
Let's do it.

452
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,248
That's great.

453
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,960
But why the sudden change?

454
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,379
Because I trust you the most.

455
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,053
You're not mean and coldhearted.

456
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,015
I'm just a stupid boss.

457
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,602
I'm sorry

458
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,354
for making you the bad guy.

459
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,320
Schedule a meeting with JM Holdings.

460
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,197
Okay, Boss.

461
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,798
First of all,
you need to set the value of your pub.

462
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,342
You need to decide on the value

463
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,094
if you don't want to get swayed by others.

464
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,558
I want to know why you chose DanBam.

465
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,313
You want to know why?

466
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,816
I got interested and looked into your pub.

467
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,152
You have quite a connection
with Jangga Co.

468
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,030
I had the chance to eat
with Chairman Jang a few times

469
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,407
when my father used to do politics,

470
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,701
so I also know him a little.

471
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,412
And I also know what happened
between you two

472
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,581
due to the recent incident.

473
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,543
He even made you move out of the place
where you first opened your pub.

474
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,881
A small but sturdy brand

475
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,717
that the top food company
thinks of it as a competitor...

476
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,221
You managed to come this far
even though you started from scratch.

477
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,723
And you also have
a competent and trendy manager.

478
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,936
I can say your brand
is surely worth the investment.

479
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,524
Is that not enough?

480
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,153
It's enough. Thank you for the compliment.

481
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,948
I would like to know

482
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,535
exactly how much
you think our brand is worth.

483
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,579
You mean the investment?

484
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,791
-I'll invest--
-Five billion won.

485
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,755
I think five billion won will be enough.

486
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,760
Boss.

487
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,058
That's how much we think DanBam is worth.

488
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,494
IS DANBAM RECEIVING FIVE BILLION WON
TO BECOME A FRANCHISE?

489
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,332
I can't believe

490
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,627
he asked for this much.

491
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,216
He's one of a kind.

492
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,387
Hello, this is DanBam.

493
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,183
Yes. An investment? Just a second.

494
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,186
Hello, I'm Jo Yi-seo,
the manager of DanBam.

495
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,022
We still need to check a few stuff.

496
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,400
-So we can't give you...
-Our boss will call you back.

497
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,569
Okay, bye.

498
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,366
Hello, this is DanBam.

499
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,243
-What is going on?
-Yes.

500
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,455
-Yes.
-We'll have to check...

501
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,751
JM Holdings became your lead investor.

502
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,837
"Lead investor"?

503
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,049
A famous investor
invested five billion won.

504
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:57,303
And that caused others
to trust your brand and do the same.

505
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,226
5 BILLION WON, 2.3 BILLION WON,
2 BILLION WON, 250 MILLION WON

506
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,936
If we add all this together,

507
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,938
we'll have over 10 billion won.

508
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,482
Ten billion won.

509
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,193
You got really lucky.

510
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,696
I told you that we've got what it takes.

511
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,282
Let's make this worth it.

512
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,077
Okay.

513
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,171
He invested five billion won in DanBam?

514
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,090
Yes, sir.

515
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:38,302
There are also other investors,
and they got over ten billion won.

516
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,222
They rented an office
to turn their business into a brand.

517
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,809
Twenty people signed up to open the pub,
and over 50 people are waiting--

518
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,018
That's enough.

519
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,858
-Soft tofu stew
-Here?

520
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,324
We need to know the trend
of the alcohol market.

521
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,576
People are starting to drink alone...

522
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,954
Our signature menus are soft-tofu stew
and stir-fried pork belly.

523
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,414
Go ahead and try some.

524
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,375
Okay, everyone. Cheers to IC.

525
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,544
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

526
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,836
Ma'am.

527
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,714
I'm not a ghost. Why are you so startled?

528
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,049
Ma'am.

529
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,593
Look at you.

530
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,929
You're drinking again?
You can't even feed your son.

531
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,932
-My goodness gracious.
-No, wait. The thing is...

532
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,813
Are you kidding me?

533
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,025
-Are you serious? How could you?
-Give it back.

534
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,153
You're going to die
without even paying me back?

535
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,656
You useless punk!

536
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,034
What do you expect me to do?
I can't even afford food for my son.

537
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,870
Do you think
he'll be able to eat if you die?

538
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,957
You should think about getting a job.
How can you call yourself a dad?

539
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,460
You're just going to die
and forget about everything?

540
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,338
-You reckless punk!
-Stop it!

541
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,009
Ma'am!

542
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,807
Five billion? Ten billion?

543
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,767
It's so unreal!

544
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,269
What did I tell you guys?

545
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,604
If Saeroyi says we can do it,
then we can really do it!

546
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,398
And I told you

547
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,567
that it's all thanks to you guys.

548
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,070
Look.

549
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,614
Ma'am.

550
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,659
Ma'am!

551
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,078
HANGUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY ROOM

552
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,625
You don't need to worry.
She'll be fine once she gets some rest.

553
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,044
Thank you.

554
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,883
I'm sorry.

555
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,635
Go die.

556
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,763
-Go kill yourself.
-Ma'am.

557
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,183
Stop it.

558
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,149
I'm such a useless father.
I thought he'd be better off without me.

559
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,694
You're unbelievable.

560
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,783
If you have the guts to die,
you should try your best to stay alive.

561
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,577
Don't make it sound like it's nothing.

562
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,455
Do you know how it feels
to see your child starve?

563
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,165
You don't even have a family.

564
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:39,335
Are you kidding me?
How dare you yell at me?

565
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,669
Ma'am, calm down.

566
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,549
Sir.

567
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,804
I'd rather have a dad

568
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,931
than a full stomach.

569
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,354
Your son will be sad.

570
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,067
Whenever you're gone,

571
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,612
he always thinks of you

572
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,240
and misses you.

573
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,172
-Here.
-What?

574
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,465
Take it.

575
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,968
I'll buy this from you.

576
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,306
I'll use this to grill some meat at home.

577
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,059
Get going.

578
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,895
Didn't you hear him? Your son is waiting.

579
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,065
Ma'am.

580
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,036
Goodbye, sir.

581
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,084
Your family must be worried.

582
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,752
Shouldn't you call them?

583
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,714
I also once

584
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,425
had a family.

585
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,307
He lived his entire life

586
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,437
doing what I always asked him to do.

587
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,858
He was a kind son.

588
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,699
But one day, he suddenly told me
that he married a black woman.

589
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,665
She was from Africa.

590
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,628
She was Guinean.

591
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,467
But I disapproved.

592
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,303
Then by any chance...

593
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,721
Ma'am.

594
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,598
Here.

595
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,558
Take a look at this.

596
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:07,608
LOOKING FOR KIM TONI'S FATHER,
KIM DONG-GIL

597
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,782
For the first time in his life,

598
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,785
he told me what he wanted.

599
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,790
But I disapproved of it.

600
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:29,255
He must've hated me so much.

601
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,842
Where is your son?

602
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,057
He died.

603
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,770
Due to a car accident.

604
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm sorry, my baby.

605
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,810
I really don't know what to say.

606
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,812
At least he found his grandmother.

607
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,982
He'll finally be able
to get his citizenship.

608
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,402
My gosh, she has no compassion.

609
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,406
Is Toni going to keep working with us?

610
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,160
We'll let him decide.

611
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,621
Let's just focus on our business for now.

612
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,960
Okay, I got it.

613
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,758
We need to cook a stew or soup.
Without artificial seasoning.

614
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,176
No artificial seasoning?

615
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,013
How about cheonggukjang?

616
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,056
Cheonggukjang?

617
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,976
I'm the best
when it comes to cheonggukjang.

618
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,020
You know how good I am.

619
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,482
How did you find out the mission?

620
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,944
Well, let's just say
I have some connections.

621
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,488
That's amazing.

622
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,115
Everyone knows that she's amazing.

623
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,410
Geun-soo, you should learn from her.

624
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,330
Cheonggukjang.

625
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:36,382
That's too thick.
That's not how you do it.

626
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,093
Try to keep it thin.

627
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,097
I learned at the pub.

628
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,140
But I still can't get it right.

629
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,436
Don't you hate me?

630
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,943
Why are you here?

631
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,321
Dad told me a lot about you.

632
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,577
"We were poor.

633
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,081
But thanks to her, we never knew that.

634
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,917
Your grandmother starved.

635
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,586
But I was always full.

636
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,965
And I learned how incredible that was

637
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,552
after you were born."

638
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,227
Dad didn't hate you.

639
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,480
The reason he came back to Korea

640
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,734
was because he wanted to thank you.

641
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,326
Let me tell you on his behalf.

642
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,539
Grandma.

643
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,251
Thank you.

644
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,475
Grandma.

645
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,394
Thank you.

646
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,417
Come in.

647
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,044
Hyun-yi.

648
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:40,923
Well, look who's here.

649
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,092
It's Geun-soo who just left to Jangga Co.
without telling me.

650
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,677
I'm sorry.

651
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:49,181
I was going to call,
but I've been really busy.

652
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,850
Where are Saeroyi and Yi-seo?

653
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,644
They went to meet the producer.

654
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,104
Have you been well?

655
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,606
Yes.

656
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,982
What about you?

657
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,109
I was really startled
when I saw you on TV.

658
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:03,779
Oh, right.

659
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,364
It's awkward, isn't it?

660
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,867
No, you look gorgeous.

661
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,411
Your new look suits you.

662
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,163
Thanks.

663
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,878
Today's mission is also very challenging.

664
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,463
They need to make stew or soup

665
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,049
without using any sugar, salt
or other artificial seasonings.

666
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,970
Most of the chefs are
cooking stew right now.

667
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:32,307
Kimchi stew, fish cake soup,
and doenjang stew.

668
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,561
I'm starting to crave soju
just by smelling all this food.

669
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,147
And let's take a look
at last week's number one.

670
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,149
Ma Hyun-yi from DanBam Pub.

671
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,819
Can you tell us what you're cooking?

672
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,655
Yes, I'm cooking soft tofu stew,
our pub's signature menu.

673
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,156
That's really new.

674
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,950
Your pub's signature menu
is soft tofu stew?

675
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:54,204
Yes, our boss loves this menu.

676
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,582
But you're kind of in the way.

677
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,251
Oh, okay. She's very cold.

678
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,045
People call her the Coldhearted Witch.

679
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,590
DanBam's soft tofu stew.

680
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,050
And Jangga Co.'s cheonggukjang.

681
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,844
You've had both, right?

682
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,513
Yes, they're both good.

683
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,266
It'll depend on the judges' preference.

684
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,519
Who do you think will win?

685
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,151
Jangga Co.

686
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,904
will lose.

687
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,040
-Let's give it a taste.
-Okay.

688
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,465
The competition has come to an end.

689
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,924
The Best Pub.

690
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,843
Among the eight teams,

691
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,055
which team do you think will be

692
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,266
the winner of the second round?

693
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,562
The winner of the second round

694
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,274
is right here in my hand.

695
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,698
This is unbelievable.
It's Ma Hyun-yi from DanBam Pub!

696
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:12,699
Congratulations!

697
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,706
WINNER OF QUARTERFINALS
MA HYUN-YI OF DANBAM

698
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:38,517
My mom used to tell me
that she hates black bean noodles

699
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,312
Why are you all so down?

700
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,857
It's nothing.

701
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,818
You did great, Mr. Park.

702
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,861
You too, Ms. Oh.

703
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,447
Geun-soo, you did great too.

704
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,579
Ms. Oh deserves most of the credit.

705
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,748
She'll probably get scolded

706
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,584
by the chairman again.

707
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,214
You became popular
after the last episode aired, right?

708
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,591
You even held autograph sessions.

709
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:13,427
What?

710
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,471
You could've spent time
getting ready for the second round.

711
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,266
-Hey.
-Are you trying to tell me

712
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:23,395
that I'm not doing my best
because I held a few autograph sessions?

713
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,940
Of course not.

714
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,984
He doesn't know what he's saying.

715
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:33,113
Hey, do you think it's easy
to come in second place?

716
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,534
We're always number one.
That's why we're the best in the industry.

717
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,745
I know, right?

718
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,373
That's what I thought,

719
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,793
but I heard we can't be
like that at Jangga Co.

720
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,254
My father, I mean...

721
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,924
The Chairman told me.

722
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,428
"Jangga Co.

723
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,056
has always been at its peak."

724
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,810
"If you want to settle for second place,

725
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,856
you don't deserve to be in Jangga Co."

726
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,738
I'm just worried about you.

727
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,199
Thank you

728
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,242
for being so concerned.

729
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,672
I was being impertinent again.

730
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,049
I'm sorry.

731
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,552
Don't be. You weren't wrong about that.

732
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,888
I thought Mr. Park was being too carefree.

733
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:41,848
Well done.

734
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,185
Soo-ah.

735
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,646
How are you, Geun-soo?

736
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,440
It's good to see you here.

737
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,692
I read articles about your investments.

738
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,153
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

739
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,155
You look great in that suit.

740
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,533
Thank you.

741
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,159
Do I look good?

742
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,661
So so.

743
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,705
Congratulations on winning first place.

744
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,416
Congratulations on second place.

745
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,752
Are you happy
that you excel at everything?

746
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,174
We're going to have a party.
Do you want to come?

747
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,467
The guys will be there.

748
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,762
Forget it, Boss. We don't need
someone who already quit.

749
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,390
What do you want?

750
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:26,935
I want to go.

751
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,689
So the winner is paying.

752
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,232
Well...

753
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,358
Sure.

754
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,329
Why aren't you doing anything?

755
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,374
Meddling in now won't
make things any better.

756
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,836
Everything is all about timing, Geun-soo.

757
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,381
Just wait for another two years.
You'll see how it ends.

758
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,093
What about Jangga Co.?

759
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,054
Is everything good there
as you joined it through nepotism?

760
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,558
I'm still trying to adjust.

761
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,144
I see. We should stay in close contact.

762
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,896
You could tell me some trade secrets.

763
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,191
Have you been doing well?

764
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,070
What? It hasn't even
been long since you quit.

765
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,406
I know.

766
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,867
It hasn't been long,

767
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,369
but I miss the time already.

768
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,414
But you seemed quite cool when you quit.

769
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,749
I told you.

770
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,626
It was because of you.

771
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,965
Aren't you guys going to eat?

772
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,300
I'm coming.

773
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,103
Let's keep on going like this.

774
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,772
-Congratulations.
-Well done.

775
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,106
Cheers.

776
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,738
Hyun-yi, you looked so cool today.

777
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,865
I almost fell for you.

778
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,368
What? Have you not fallen for me yet?

779
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,370
Gosh, it's my mistake.

780
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,580
I've fallen for you long ago.

781
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,165
That's absurd.

782
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,334
What's wrong with him now?

783
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:19,965
What are you looking at?

784
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,511
Hyun-yi, congratulations.

785
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,682
Go easy on us. You're being matchless.

786
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,392
I know. I've been lucky.

787
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,560
Fill your glasses. Let me make a toast.

788
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,649
All right.

789
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,157
-Jo Yi-seo, it's you.
-Gosh.

790
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,951
I said I didn't want to do this.

791
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,911
Who would play Truth or Dare these days?

792
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,705
Why? It's fun.

793
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,419
What about you, Saeroyi?
Do you have any questions for Yi-seo?

794
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,922
Well...

795
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:06,511
If there's anything you want to know,
you can ask me.

796
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,060
Not really. I know everything about her.

797
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,817
Let me ask her then.

798
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:26,322
Hey, this isn't fun.
Let's just get this over with.

799
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,576
You said you'd come to me

800
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,995
once I take over Jangga Co.

801
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,501
Do you remember that?

802
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,921
Yes.

803
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,507
I remember that, but it's just--

804
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,967
Okay. I'm done.

805
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,221
-I'm glad you remember it.
-Hey.

806
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,223
What? Is there something
going on between you two?

807
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,641
Gosh, hell no.

808
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,228
That's not true. Boss, it's not like that.

809
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,564
What? Okay.

810
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,525
Can't you be more respectful to me?

811
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,819
Do you have any more questions?

812
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,154
It's not fun. Let's move on.

813
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,322
Let me spin it.

814
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,913
-All right, Boss.
-It's you, Boss.

815
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,542
Do you have any questions for me?

816
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,711
Of course, we do.
Let me ask you something.

817
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,592
Your first kiss. When was your first kiss?

818
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,189
-I don't have one.
-What do you mean?

819
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,026
You don't? No way. That's ridiculous.

820
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,195
I've never kissed.

821
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,615
You've never kissed a woman before
at your age?

822
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,257
Is it sad?

823
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,845
I mean...

824
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,097
Well... I have a question.

825
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,056
What?

826
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,227
Between you and Soo-ah.

827
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,645
What's going on?

828
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,897
Are you sure you are friends?

829
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,405
It's just...

830
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,827
I like Soo-ah.

831
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,622
Seriously?

832
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,374
What?

833
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,547
Can't you see what's going on?

834
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,923
Why did you pinch me?

835
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,633
Congratulations.

836
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,184
It's my turn.

837
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,562
Why do you guys have so many questions?

838
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,773
Did you ever

839
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,736
have feelings for Yi-seo?

840
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,243
You son of a...

841
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:35,929
No.

842
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,389
Not even once.

843
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,566
She's my friend and partner.

844
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,572
What kind of question is that?
Isn't it obvious?

845
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,616
You should take a shot.

846
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,413
Well...

847
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,917
I knew it though.

848
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,174
I already knew it, but...

849
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,718
Are you guys done?

850
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,179
Yes. Well done, Hyun-yi.

851
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,767
What?

852
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,648
Yi-seo.

853
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,066
Yes?

854
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,779
Are you crying?

855
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,786
What's wrong with me?

856
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,789
Gosh, it's embarrassing.

857
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:48,751
What's wrong?

858
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,924
What are you waiting for?

859
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,553
-What?
-Do you not know? She's hurt.

860
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,222
Go bring her.

861
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,059
She's hurt?

862
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,811
Then he shouldn't go after her.

863
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,985
You said you don't have feelings for her.

864
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,406
If you go to her,
you'll be giving her false hope.

865
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:22,827
You don't have to
be so firm to hurt her feelings.

866
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,748
You said that she means a lot.

867
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,459
Don't let her cry alone.

868
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,094
I'll be right back.

869
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,266
What is going on?

870
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:50,104
Does Yi-seo like him?

871
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,106
Geun-soo, why are you being like this?

872
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:54,859
Me?

873
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,695
Why?

874
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,199
What you just did.

875
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,576
It was so sick.

876
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:19,550
Yi-seo.

877
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:22,553
Stop there.

878
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,062
Why are you being like this?

879
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,313
Let go of me.

880
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:37,735
It's cold.

881
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,154
-Let's go in.
-Get off me.

882
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,241
You said you don't have feelings for me.

883
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,660
What's wrong with you?

884
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,663
You're a smart girl.
Why are you acting like a kid?

885
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,376
I had a plan for two years.

886
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,130
But Geun-soo just ruined the whole thing.

887
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,383
What?

888
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,178
If that's the case,

889
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,015
I'm going for plan B.

890
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,066
I should

891
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,069
tell him now.

892
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,117
I feel like

893
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,828
my heart will burst out of my chest.

894
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,418
-Are you all right?
-I love you.

895
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,678
I love you.

896
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,476
I love you, Boss.

897
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,563
I love you.

898
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,025
I really love you.

899
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,249
It's just

900
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,920
you're mistaken

901
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,339
because we're like a family and you feel--

902
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,174
I'm not mistaken.

903
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,721
I've never thought of you as a family.

904
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,230
From the moment we first met

905
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,190
until now,

906
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:43,528
I couldn't be more sure about my feelings.

907
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,085
I heard Geun-soo likes you.

908
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,422
You said you'd go out with him
if things go well for him.

909
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,801
-That's how we're supposed--
-Why are you talking about Geun-soo?

910
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,305
I just

911
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,559
said that the other day,
but I didn't mean it.

912
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,978
I just said such a thing

913
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:20,314
to take advantage of his feelings
to help you.

914
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:22,733
What's that?

915
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,820
Do you not care about Geun-soo's feelings?

916
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,614
How could you do that
with someone's feelings?

917
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,532
I know

918
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,618
that it's not ethical.

919
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,163
I don't expect you to understand me.

920
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,002
I just don't want to lie to you.

921
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,545
This is me.

922
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,506
But

923
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,634
since I know you hate things like this...

924
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:50,219
Now that I know it,

925
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,471
I won't be like that anymore.

926
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,640
So

927
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,976
stop talking about Geun-soo

928
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:00,146
and see me for what I really am.

929
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,029
Yi-seo.

930
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,741
I'm ten years older than you.

931
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,373
Things have been good for us so far.

932
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,461
-I have a lot of things to do and--
-That's enough.

933
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,881
If you don't like me,

934
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,759
that's just what it is.

935
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:36,265
Work, age gap, and all that.

936
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,976
They are just excuses.

937
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:45,191
That's the last thing
I want to hear from you.

938
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:54,742
All you need

939
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,620
is one word.

940
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,792
Is it

941
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,586
never going to happen?

942
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,357
No.

943
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,319
Don't like me.

944
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,408
My life

945
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,619
is a little

946
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,288
bitter.

947
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,290
I want

948
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,918
my bitter night

949
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,173
to be sweet.

950
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:47,039
I have you.

951
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,505
That just consoled me

952
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,841
more than anything.

953
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:42,303
SPECIAL THANKS TO JEON NO-MIN,
LEE JUN-HYEOK, AND KIM IL-JUNG.

954
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:03,365
So it's the final round, right?

955
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,409
I have a high card
that I don't want to use.

956
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,161
So is this the high card you talked about?

957
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:09,580
I told you. You can do this.
Good luck, Ma Hyun-yi.

958
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,582
Look how we ended up after trusting her.

959
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:13,459
You all signed a deal after you came here.

960
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,085
You decided after you tasted our food!

961
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,712
All the staff are struggling,

962
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,547
but the president
only cares about his pride.

963
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,466
Forget the whole thing and come to me.

964
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,303
And the harder he tries,
the harder he'll fall and collapse.

965
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:27,306
I'm burning with anger.
