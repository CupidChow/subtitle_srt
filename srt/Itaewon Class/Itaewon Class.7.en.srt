PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,109
A SWEET NIGHT

4
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,826
So your goal is my doom.

5
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,455
It's funny I'm feeling this way

6
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,166
at my age.

7
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,171
Hello. Welcome to DanBam.

8
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,357
I wanted to see you.

9
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,153
I really wanted to meet you too.

10
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,164
BOSS PARK SAEROYI

11
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,625
Yes.

12
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,460
EPISODE 7

13
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,088
-What would you like to order?
-What would you recommend?

14
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,506
The squid is good,

15
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,008
so you should try
our mussel soup with squid.

16
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,677
-I see. Then we'll get this and...
-Okay.

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,846
Is there anything else you need?

18
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,681
A glass of iced water for me, please.

19
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,267
Sure. Your food will be out shortly.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,268
-Thank you.
-No problem.

21
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,857
Are you ready to order, Mr. Chairman?

22
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,859
Do you know who I am?

23
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,820
Everyone in the restaurant industry knows
who you are.

24
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,576
I'd like a stew and a stir-fried dish.

25
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,328
Pick what you think is best.

26
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,747
And a bottle of soju as well.

27
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,292
One stew, one stir-fried dish,
and a bottle of soju.

28
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,835
Right away, sir.

29
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,597
What did he order?

30
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,640
A stew and a stir-fried dish.

31
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,559
He told me to pick the best one.

32
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,940
A stew and a stir-fried dish?

33
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,903
He's your dad. Do you know what he likes?

34
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,863
He tends to like salty, spicy foods.

35
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,867
Let's do stir-fried pork belly
with mung bean sprouts and soft tofu stew.

36
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,535
Yes, those are the best choices.

37
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,329
I'll have the cook put in extra seasoning.

38
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,872
No, don't.

39
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,750
Listen, guys.

40
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,341
I don't want him to catch any flaws today.

41
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,760
So

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,514
just do what you normally do.

43
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,266
-Okay.
-Okay.

44
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,815
Excuse me.

45
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,778
Have you lost your mind?

46
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,031
-What are you doing here?
-I'm working, as you can see.

47
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,784
Exactly. Why the hell are you--

48
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,785
Enough.

49
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,705
You don't belong here.

50
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,878
Where do I belong?

51
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,551
Is Jangga

52
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,346
where I belong?

53
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,436
I'm here to eat.

54
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,730
We'll talk another time.

55
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,363
Enjoy your food.

56
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,368
JANG GEUN-SOO

57
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,834
Boss.

58
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,586
-Yes?
-The stove.

59
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,387
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

60
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,063
Enjoy.

61
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,523
Hey.

62
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,736
I noticed you bought our stock.

63
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,946
What?

64
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,159
It's a blue-chip stock.

65
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,953
-I thought it'd be a good investment.
-No.

66
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:30,997
I'm talking about

67
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,083
when our stock price plummeted
eight years ago.

68
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,466
You invested over 100 million won.

69
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,762
It was probably money
from Mr. Park's insurance. You invested

70
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,640
all of that money in Jangga,
which was collapsing?

71
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,267
Why?

72
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,980
Because I believed in it.

73
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,652
You believed in it?

74
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,073
The brand image might have been tarnished,

75
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,991
but Jangga's core values...

76
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,619
Its brand essence didn't change.

77
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,916
I thought it'd be
a good long-term investment.

78
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,962
So it was just for the profits?

79
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,714
What else would it be for?

80
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,764
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

81
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,976
What's the investment of this morning
supposed to mean?

82
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,438
This morning?

83
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,190
You invested about 600 million won.

84
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,276
What? 600 million?

85
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,490
You invested that much?

86
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,870
What are you trying to do?

87
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,293
I guess

88
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,714
you're bothered about me.

89
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,138
I did it for the same reason.

90
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,103
You're not a good liar.

91
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,876
Here you go, sir.

92
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,879
To be honest, I had high expectations.

93
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,966
I'm saying this because
I've now tasted the food here.

94
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,220
No matter what you're thinking,
you can't beat Jangga.

95
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,556
Just be grateful

96
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,893
that I don't consider you my enemy.

97
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm saying this because of Mr. Park.

98
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,830
Give up and take it easy.

99
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,754
-Let's go.
-Okay, Dad.

100
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,885
"Give up and take it easy"?

101
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,433
I can't, sir.

102
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,730
Being stubborn

103
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,607
and foolish

104
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,235
and my life itself...

105
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,712
You know I will keep fighting
so let me tell you again.

106
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,176
It may be a slow process,
but I am doing things step by step.

107
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,388
And you are my end goal.

108
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,476
Are you out of your mind? Know your place.

109
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,728
You!

110
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,405
Keep your mouth shut.

111
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,335
Because of my father?

112
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,296
Don't kid yourself.

113
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,966
The only thing you can do
for my late father

114
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,511
is getting on your knees
and paying for what you did.

115
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,890
And I'll make that happen.

116
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,241
A stubborn fool is now even bluffing.
What a joke.

117
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,703
You deserve a beating.

118
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,039
I'm not just bluffing.

119
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,084
Do you know this?

120
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,628
Tigers don't growl or roar.

121
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,546
They just chew you to pieces.

122
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,761
I'll soon teach you what that means.

123
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,519
Goodbye!

124
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,438
Thank you for visiting DanBam!

125
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,014
DANBAM

126
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,350
DANBAM

127
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,606
You're actually looking that up?

128
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,235
Tigers do roar, of course.

129
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,278
I know.

130
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,655
They roar so loudly.

131
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,784
He's obviously never seen a tiger
in his life. That old man bullshitted me.

132
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,245
He was implying
that he will trample all over you.

133
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,289
I won't be fazed by it.

134
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,709
You should've kept your cool.
You're no match for him, after all.

135
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,961
That's not how you start a fight.

136
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,506
He'll think I'm a kid
who can't even control his anger.

137
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,551
I want him to think that.

138
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,680
-What?
-He'll try to walk all over me,

139
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,224
but that was bound to happen.

140
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,811
Now that he thinks I'm just
a clueless kid, he won't go all out.

141
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,191
What are you talking about?

142
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,402
Chairman Jang came by. Can we meet now?

143
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,696
A fight

144
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,865
is all about the first punch.

145
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,992
And you throw the first punch

146
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,246
behind the back.

147
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,714
Sure.

148
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,397
I'm here to see one of your inmates.

149
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,192
Here's a visiting application.

150
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,611
Fill it out and wait a few minutes.

151
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,950
NAME OF INMATE YOU WISH TO VISIT:
PARK SAEROYI

152
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,038
RELATIONSHIP

153
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,292
Hey, 2127. You have a visitor.

154
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,756
Hey.

155
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,474
What's up?

156
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,351
I'm curious about something.

157
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,688
Curious? About what?

158
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,358
Why did you

159
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,652
hit Jang Geun-won that day?

160
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,154
I just couldn't stand him.

161
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,659
-You don't need to thank me--
-I don't need to thank you?

162
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,245
Don't be delusional.
You were just being nosy.

163
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,497
That's not how you fight.

164
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,709
I was fighting against him in my own way,
by enduring and holding out.

165
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,337
And you ended up behind bars
because you couldn't control your temper.

166
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,266
Why are you all prickly?

167
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,146
Well, you are right.

168
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,356
But don't be such a know-it-all.

169
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,277
There are times when you're faced
with things that you just can't tolerate.

170
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,616
You should leave if you're finished.

171
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,826
What will you do?

172
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,329
Any plans after getting out?

173
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:14,955
Well,

174
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,999
I don't really want to tell you.

175
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,126
I find you obnoxious.

176
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,470
I got into Business Administration
at Hanguk University.

177
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,848
I achieved it
by going through hell for three years.

178
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,767
I see.

179
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,103
It'll be good
if you can forget everything.

180
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,397
That's great.

181
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,567
Can you?

182
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,322
Can you put everything behind and move on?

183
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,079
It's just something
those who have never been bullied say.

184
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,332
Don't you know that I hate white milk?

185
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,875
Tell me.

186
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,044
Look at me.

187
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,756
Still to this day, Jang Geun-won shows up
in my dreams and wakes me up at night.

188
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,468
I've gone up to the roof countless times
in the middle of the night, to die.

189
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,597
I don't really know how to comfort--

190
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,474
Three years is a long time.

191
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,102
What got me through that hell

192
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,942
was my goal to get my revenge.

193
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,411
I want to be an asset manager.

194
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,956
It's like a fund manager.

195
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,334
First off,

196
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,628
I admit that I'm a little twisted.

197
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,339
That's why I lied earlier.

198
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,800
To be honest,

199
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,302
I wanted to thank you.

200
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,264
For helping me.

201
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,937
I plan to open a pub

202
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,689
when I get out.

203
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,401
I want to succeed in the food industry

204
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,279
and take Jangga down.

205
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,785
That's my goal.

206
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,708
It won't be easy though.

207
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,918
-I never thought it'd be--
-It'll be hard.

208
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,969
Unless you work with a fund manager
who knows what he's doing.

209
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,358
What's your name?

210
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,821
Lee Ho-jin.

211
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,076
I'm Park Saeroyi.

212
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,244
Ho-jin.

213
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,832
Do you want to be my ally?

214
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,967
That's why I came to see you.

215
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,772
RELATIONSHIP: FRIEND

216
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,615
1.9 billion won in Jangga.

217
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,243
It was a bit of an impulsive move.

218
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,831
If we waited for about a year, it would've
gone up by 500 million won more.

219
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,833
Why didn't you stop me?

220
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,379
What about you?
I was still in school seven years ago.

221
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,464
Why did you trust me with it?

222
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,927
Why ask now? You did a good job
of growing my money.

223
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,764
But that money
was your dad's death benefit.

224
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,642
I know nothing about stocks.

225
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,352
That's why a professional fund manager--

226
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,272
I know nothing about stocks,
but I know you.

227
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,317
You said those three years were like hell.

228
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,530
You endured and held out
throughout that grueling fight

229
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,949
and got into the best university.

230
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,618
You're stubborn and tenacious.

231
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,420
You say that and make me do
all sorts of shit.

232
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,047
What?

233
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,799
Kang Min-jung.

234
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,844
Thinking about that
still makes me shudder.

235
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,518
The last time I saw you was
at Mr. Park's funeral, right?

236
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,521
I should be happy to see you,

237
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,690
but I'm quite upset.

238
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,695
Did you order Ho-jin
to deliberately approach me?

239
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,240
I apologize if it upset you.

240
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,827
I heard about
what the chairman did to you.

241
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,331
You see, I was fond of Mr. Park,
and I admired him.

242
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,335
But unfortunately, I'm not motivated
by things like sympathy and compassion.

243
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,298
I heard Ho-jin has helped you

244
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,842
double your money.

245
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,636
So?

246
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,889
And I heard you want Jangga to do well
more than anybody else does.

247
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,432
And?

248
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,519
I'd like to support you.

249
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,107
How?

250
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:40,155
If a shareholders' meeting were to be held
sometime in the future, that is.

251
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,830
You must've gauged the scope
of Ho-jin's abilities by now.

252
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,333
Yes, he's very capable.

253
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,376
But what about you?

254
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,587
You worked hard for seven years
and opened a pub, I heard.

255
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,672
It's impressive.

256
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,049
Mr. Park would be so proud of you.

257
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,051
But you see,

258
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,886
this is a whole different ball game.

259
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,140
Even if you sell your precious business
that's worth a few hundred million won,

260
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,227
you can only buy under one percent share
of Jangga Co. Do you realize that?

261
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,775
There's nothing you can do to support me.

262
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,364
What if I come to own
one percent share of Jangga Co.?

263
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,493
One percent?

264
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,538
The total value of Jangga's shares
exceeds 200 billion won.

265
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,416
One percent of that is two billion won.

266
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,711
Kiddie, you'll never get to touch
that kind of money.

267
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,338
And truthfully,
even that won't really be a big help.

268
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,050
But it'll be a great way to test me.

269
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,554
If I pull it off, you'll know that
you shouldn't underestimate me.

270
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,933
And even if it's not a big help,
it'll still be helpful for you.

271
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,814
And I'd like you to know

272
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,234
that I don't have to have you
join hands with me.

273
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:01,945
Saeroyi.

274
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,832
You're talking as if you already have
what you haven't even acquired.

275
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,418
That's how I've lived so far.

276
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,255
What do you want from me?

277
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,093
You're the second-biggest shareholder,
following Chairman Jang.

278
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,722
-So what?
-You've known Geun-won for many years.

279
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,224
Can he really lead Jangga Co.?

280
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,188
Jangga Co. led by Jang Geun-won.

281
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,233
-Will it succeed and thrive?
-What are you trying to say?

282
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,359
Jangga Co.

283
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,695
should be led by you.

284
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,326
When the dismissal of Chairman Jang
is brought up,

285
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,412
I will be by your side.

286
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,146
You said the chairman is your enemy.

287
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,148
Yes.

288
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,067
Revenge...

289
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,694
What do you think he thinks of you?

290
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,072
You're like a fruit fly to him.

291
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,286
I mean, look at you bluffing
just because you now own a small pub.

292
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,916
Your brazen bluff won't get me excited

293
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,168
because I like peace.

294
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,015
I suppose I'm talking
to the wrong person, then.

295
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,480
Sorry to bother you.

296
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,899
-Saeroyi.
-However,

297
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,823
you are Mr. Park's son, so maybe

298
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,701
I should give you
the benefit of the doubt.

299
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,126
What I trust more than your words
and my discerning eye

300
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,587
is Chairman Jang's intuition.

301
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,672
Your pub... DanBam, did you say?

302
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,466
Yes.

303
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,595
Jea Foods, Hyeonil Foods,
Soso Brothers, and so on.

304
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,596
Do you know about them?

305
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,931
They're top restaurant companies.

306
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,892
Chairman Jang eats at their restaurants.

307
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,437
One percent, two billion won.
That's very ambitious of you,

308
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,191
but you can't persuade me
with such numbers.

309
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,908
Make him dine at your tiny pub.

310
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,826
That's your mission.

311
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,542
If you prove to me
that you can get on his nerves,

312
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,632
then I'll put my trust in you.

313
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,469
I wanted to see you.

314
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,513
I can see

315
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,974
his back.

316
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,853
I really wanted to meet you too.

317
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,785
You've accomplished your mission.

318
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,955
-I owe it all to you.
-It was a lucky move.

319
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,917
He wouldn't even have glanced at you
if you didn't put in the investment.

320
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,798
He came because I was the one
who made the investment.

321
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,842
You do have a point.

322
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,845
You withdrew from other investments
and bought more Jangga stock.

323
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,432
Doesn't that mean
you've already made up your mind?

324
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,684
Hey.

325
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,270
Yes.

326
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,689
Don't people call you obnoxious?

327
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,820
No, never.

328
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,530
You can be a little obnoxious.

329
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,534
Maybe that's your charm.

330
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
Fine.

331
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,041
Shall we join hands?

332
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,670
-Then--
-Yes.

333
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,007
Together, we'll take down
Chairman Jang and Geun-won.

334
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,467
Let's do it.

335
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,514
I look forward to it, partner.

336
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,189
Likewise.

337
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,116
Did you ask me to stop by just to play go?

338
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,163
I felt like I've been neglecting you.

339
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,250
I'm over 40 now.
You don't need to look after me.

340
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,003
You're so cold.

341
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,339
I'm getting old,

342
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,593
so I'm not as energetic as I used to be.
I have many worries.

343
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,888
Maybe I don't have
that much time left to live.

344
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,099
I think about Bo-hyeon, your father,
often these days.

345
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,272
You're still healthy. You'll live long.

346
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,193
I've lived long enough,
so I don't have many regrets.

347
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,570
But I'm worried about the company
after I die.

348
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,239
I don't know if I can leave it
in Geun-won's hands.

349
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,875
The latest trend is hiring
a competent management specialist.

350
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,880
It's not easy for me to say this,

351
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,927
but I hope you don't feel obligated
to pass it on to your son.

352
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,515
Even internally, there are many employees
who are more capable than Geun-won.

353
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,102
The company's continued success
should be our top priority, you know.

354
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,064
Then I suppose...

355
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,984
You will be

356
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,613
most suited for the position.

357
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,082
I lost.

358
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,169
I see that you're now on par with me.

359
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,380
It was a good game.

360
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,257
You should stay for lunch.

361
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,260
I have to meet someone.
Please invite me again another time.

362
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,848
Min-jung.

363
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,019
You're like family to me.
I'm very fond of you.

364
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,858
And as the chairman of Jangga Co.,

365
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,944
I'm always grateful for how much
you care about the company.

366
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,537
You're the only one I trust,
so keep up the great work.

367
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,208
I always trust you and do as you say, sir.

368
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,154
It looked like they had met before.

369
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,282
This is quite hurtful.

370
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,456
What a pity.

371
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,424
His relationship with Jangga Co.

372
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,677
It may look like

373
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,014
he's a show-off and a narcissist.

374
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,517
But those stocks...

375
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:11,976
And the first punch?

376
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,023
He had planned all this eight years ago.

377
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,860
The fight I have no idea about.

378
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,197
And it's getting really annoying.

379
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,285
Hey, Ho-jin. No, I'm not busy.

380
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,703
Your office?

381
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,747
I'll be right there.

382
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,211
I need to go somewhere.

383
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,296
Where?

384
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,969
-I need to meet someone.
-Can't I go with you?

385
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,305
-You don't even know what it's about.
-What is it about?

386
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,063
Geun-soo, clean up
and go home with Yi-seo.

387
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,147
Okay.

388
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,083
Do you even know what kind of relationship
your brother has with him?

389
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,173
Yi-seo.

390
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,093
You know what happened

391
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,721
between Saeroyi and my family, don't you?

392
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:34,851
No, I don't.

393
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,061
Really?

394
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,356
I really don't know.

395
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,904
Yes, you do.

396
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,947
What is it?

397
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,741
Are you deaf?

398
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,993
I told you that I don't know.

399
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,163
Why the fuck are you asking me
about your family?

400
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,125
What's going on?

401
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,044
What's the matter?

402
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,549
Mind your own business.

403
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,471
What am I going to do with that rude brat?

404
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,807
I only asked her one question!

405
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,809
My gosh.

406
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:23,816
STOCK OWNERSHIP RATIO
OF CHAIRMAN JANG'S PEOPLE

407
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,076
I think we made a move a bit too early.

408
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:34,911
Why?

409
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:39,457
There are those who support the chairman
and those who support Ms. Kang like us.

410
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,085
And when it comes
to the stock ownership ratio,

411
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,463
we own about 12 percent less than they do.

412
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,092
Many people in the company
have a lot of trust in Chairman Jang.

413
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,847
Then we should make him lose their trust.

414
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,810
-How?
-You know what I'm talking about.

415
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,397
The detective?

416
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,232
Do you think it'll work?

417
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,192
Doesn't he still ignore you
every time you visit?

418
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,696
I'll just have to keep trying.

419
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,119
JANGGA PUB TARGETS CHINA
TO BE THEIR NEXT MARKET

420
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,288
You asked for me?

421
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,461
The Best Pub.

422
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,464
Why did you pay them money?

423
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,385
They should be paying us instead.

424
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,973
This?

425
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,685
Saeroyi wanted to be on the show as well.

426
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,812
So I paid them to kick him off the show.

427
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,147
Why would you do that?

428
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,066
Pardon?

429
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,152
Well...

430
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,071
I didn't want to risk
losing the competition...

431
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,161
This is why people think
you're incompetent.

432
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,246
You fool.

433
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,957
Sorry?

434
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,627
By doing that, you just admitted
that he's better than us.

435
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,174
Why can't you be more sophisticated?

436
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,637
I'm sorry.

437
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,473
Get out of here.

438
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,359
My successor.

439
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,653
Lack of competence.

440
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,994
I can never talk to that old man.

441
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,209
Hey.

442
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,629
What do you think you're doing here?

443
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,388
-Am I not allowed to be here?
-What was that, you jerk?

444
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,849
Dad asked me to come.

445
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,230
Why?

446
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,445
Why did he ask you to come?

447
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,159
Are you nervous?

448
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,912
You must be fucking crazy.

449
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,923
You haven't hit me in ages, brother.

450
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,967
What?

451
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,010
"Brother"?

452
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,930
I didn't get why you hit me
when I was little.

453
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,934
But I guess you were just nervous.

454
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,437
You must've lost your mind.

455
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,990
Don't get so scared.

456
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,576
I'm not even interested.

457
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,421
Damn it.

458
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,154
What happened to your face?

459
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:41,240
You always asked me that when I was young.

460
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,537
FOREIGN STUDIES EDUCATION CONSULTING

461
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,956
Study abroad
and meet your mom while you're there.

462
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,462
What kind of relationship

463
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,173
do you have with Saeroyi?

464
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,927
I only came to ask you that.

465
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,138
As you've already seen,

466
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,724
we don't have
a very amicable relationship.

467
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,017
What's the reason

468
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,435
for that?

469
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,730
Why are you asking me

470
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,524
instead of asking him?

471
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,237
Because I'm scared.

472
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,615
-You're scared?
-Because the atrocious side

473
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,701
is probably our family.

474
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,040
Don't worry.

475
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,125
I'm not the bad guy.

476
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,215
Here's my favorite idiom.

477
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,218
"The strong prey on the weak."

478
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,179
"The strong prey on the weak."

479
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,057
Who do you think decides

480
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,269
good side or the bad side?

481
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,854
The winner gets to decide.

482
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,482
And I always win.

483
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,531
A carp that's raised in a fishbowl

484
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,742
only grows as big as your hand.

485
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,622
But a carp that lives in a river

486
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,042
grows up to over 1m.

487
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,877
-I'm--
-Did you move out

488
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,462
only to be a waiter at a small pub?

489
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,716
You're my son.

490
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,554
You may be an illegitimate son,
but I won't let you live a useless life.

491
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,895
-I'm going to leave.
-I want you to quit--

492
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,063
Listen!

493
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,951
I don't want to live like you.

494
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,375
I'll be off now.

495
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,047
And one more thing.

496
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,801
I don't know what happened
between you two.

497
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,183
But are you really sure

498
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,478
that DanBam is a small fishbowl?

499
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,731
What?

500
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,068
Saeroyi

501
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,447
is a lot stronger than you think.

502
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,878
I told you.

503
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,463
Don't worry about me.

504
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,007
Whatever you do, I'll be just fine.

505
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,930
So that you won't suffer,

506
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,974
I'll...

507
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,518
destroy Jangga Co.

508
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,735
WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH?

509
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,113
Call Saeroyi.

510
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,033
Calling Saeroyi.

511
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,309
Did

512
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,311
something bad happen?

513
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,647
What? No.

514
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,485
You?

515
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,778
No, me neither.

516
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,035
How did you save up all that money?

517
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:37,912
What?

518
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,082
It's a secret.

519
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,793
Is it because I work at Jangga Co.?

520
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,922
No, that's not why.

521
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,217
I just don't want you to get involved

522
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,094
in this fight
between me and Chairman Jang.

523
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,888
Whatever.

524
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,224
You already got me involved.

525
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,981
Sometimes,

526
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,776
I get confused.

527
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,906
I know I work at Jangga Co.

528
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,076
And I always do my best for the company.

529
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,163
But when you told me
that you'll make me quit,

530
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,250
it made me really happy.

531
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,549
I sometimes wish you'd stop this fight,

532
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,425
but then I find myself rooting for you.

533
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,303
As I stand between you and Jangga Co.,

534
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,597
I don't know what to do

535
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,350
or whose side I'm on.

536
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,022
It sounds weird
now that I've said it out loud.

537
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,567
I feel so two-faced.

538
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,160
Did I ever tell you why I like you?

539
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,288
What?

540
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,957
Remember back in high school?

541
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,042
You were late
to your university interview,

542
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,045
so you ran all the way there.

543
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,714
Oh, right.

544
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,925
You told me that you didn't need my help,

545
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,595
and you persistently ran
the entire way there.

546
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,472
In the end, you got there in time.

547
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,350
And as I saw you going inside from behind,

548
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,185
I could sense

549
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,023
that you were
an incredibly independent person

550
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,859
who knew how to take care of yourself.

551
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,864
I was impressed.

552
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,581
Don't get swayed.

553
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,876
You don't need to be on anyone's side
but your own.

554
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,674
Okay.

555
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,096
DANBAM

556
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,431
Hello.

557
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,063
Toni, you can greet them.

558
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,064
Okay.

559
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,607
Hello.

560
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,484
Welcome to DanBam.

561
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,546
I don't understand what he's saying.

562
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:36,632
What?

563
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,926
Isn't he speaking English?

564
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,386
Hurry up and talk to him.

565
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,933
I don't speak English.

566
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,603
Well...

567
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,940
Then who does?

568
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:58,362
Why? Why can't you speak English
when you look like

569
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,738
someone that would?

570
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,074
Because I'm Korean.

571
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,328
But it's only been a year
since you came to Korea.

572
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,372
Where were you before that?

573
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,498
Guinea.

574
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,418
So I'm fluent in French.

575
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,627
I see.

576
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,133
Yi-seo will flip out if she finds out.

577
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,760
She's going to fire you for sure.

578
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,691
Do you like Saeroyi?

579
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,031
I'm just curious.

580
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,451
It's already weird that you gave up

581
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,453
going to university
just to work at DanBam.

582
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,333
What if I do like him?

583
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,800
It doesn't matter, right?

584
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,344
What do you mean?

585
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,764
I know you like me.

586
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,481
But you probably never

587
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,025
even thought of dating me
in the first place.

588
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,528
Do you know something?

589
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,157
I was friendly to you
because I knew your family is rich.

590
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,328
I figured you'd eventually
be an asset to me.

591
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,750
But in the end,
you just turned out be a loser

592
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:39,379
who had no balls to go after me
or the company.

593
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,762
You're talking nonsense.

594
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,265
You're probably satisfied
with what you have.

595
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,644
You want to know if I like Saeroyi?

596
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,106
Yes, I do.

597
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,069
But it's not like I'm crazy about him.

598
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,031
Emotions are shallow and inconsistent.

599
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,283
They change according to the situation.

600
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,794
That means you've still got a shot.

601
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,088
What?

602
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,132
By any chance...

603
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:29,888
If you desperately want me
to be yours one day,

604
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,144
you should take over Jangga Co.

605
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,028
I'm kidding.

606
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,406
Let's go.

607
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,043
She's so mean.

608
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,758
Toni.

609
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,345
Do you like working here?

610
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,099
Yes, it's fun. I really like it.

611
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:18,854
Then learn

612
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,773
how to speak English.

613
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,066
What?

614
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,943
English?

615
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,322
Hey, you're back early.

616
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,573
You're all here.

617
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,199
Yes, well...

618
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,493
How did it go?

619
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,413
We can't get the display stand.
But they agreed to give us an ice machine.

620
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,624
That's great.
I felt bad having to borrow it

621
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,168
from the restaurant next door
every weekend.

622
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,754
-Great work.
-You're going somewhere again?

623
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,047
Yes, I need to go.

624
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,965
What is it this time?

625
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,759
It's something urgent. I'll be right back.

626
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,135
I'll see you guys.

627
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,304
-Okay.
-Okay, see you.

628
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,893
Today's a weekday,
so you don't need me, right?

629
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,728
What? Why?

630
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,362
-I also need to go somewhere.
-Go ahead.

631
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,072
Yes, we'll do fine without you.

632
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,531
-Thanks, you guys.
-Sure. Go on.

633
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,950
Go ahead. Gosh, that was close.

634
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,793
By the way, what's going on
between our boss and Yi-seo?

635
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,379
What do you think?
He's her boss, and she's the manager.

636
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,923
What's wrong? Do you sense something?

637
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,259
It's hard to explain.

638
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,471
Forget that. You need to hurry up
and learn how to speak English.

639
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,098
Get to your senses.

640
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,518
Yes, you should stay away from Yi-seo
for a while.

641
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,480
Boss.

642
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,148
Boss!

643
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,237
What's the emergency?

644
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,364
Isn't it about work?

645
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,782
It's something personal.

646
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,867
You always make up things like that.

647
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,203
You told me this before.

648
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,788
It's hard to do it alone,

649
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,581
but you can do it because you have us.

650
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,208
I don't know anything

651
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,211
about the shares or the relationship
between Jangga and DanBam.

652
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,588
Am I really the manager of DanBam?

653
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,465
You said you needed me.

654
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,135
Can you not trust me?

655
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,095
I'm smart.

656
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,849
I want to be supportive.

657
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,728
Even if it's something personal,

658
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,021
you can share a little with me.

659
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,698
It might have something to do
with work in a way.

660
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,659
It's quite far, and you might
feel uncomfortable there.

661
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,078
Do you want to come with me?

662
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,375
I'd love to.

663
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,595
FROM NAMBU TERMINAL TO PAJIN

664
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,891
It's a long story. And it's boring.

665
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,102
It's okay. Tell me everything.

666
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,524
When I was little,

667
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,445
I lived alone with my dad.

668
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,615
On the running bus,

669
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,576
he kept talking.

670
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,455
What his dad meant to him.

671
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,417
Jang Geun-won.

672
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,295
I'll resign, sir.

673
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,380
Dad.

674
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,549
The ill-fated relationship
with Chairman Jang.

675
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,886
The death of his dad caused by them.

676
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,972
Hidden truth.

677
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,851
The bottomless pit
he went through later on.

678
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,772
His friend named Lee Ho-jin.

679
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,483
His plans for revenge.

680
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,694
And the time he spent for his plans.

681
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,447
He kept telling me

682
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,200
composedly and incessantly

683
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,869
about what he's been through.

684
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,873
And I listened carefully.

685
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,960
I just listened.

686
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,088
FROM NAMBU TERMINAL TO PAJIN

687
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,050
Why did we come here?

688
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,261
To meet someone.

689
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,347
Because it's winter.

690
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,517
You should wear it for long in winter.

691
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,019
Make sure to keep it clean.

692
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,899
It's been a long time.
Have you been doing well?

693
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,609
Saeroyi!

694
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:36,778
Hye-won.

695
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,197
You've grown a lot.
Have you been doing well?

696
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,490
Yes.

697
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,326
What? Where are you going, Dad?

698
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,161
Dad.

699
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,790
Why do you keep coming
when he hates you like that?

700
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,043
Because I want him to take my side.

701
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,464
Help yourself.

702
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,175
Take some if you need them.

703
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,138
Is he our supplier?

704
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:06,391
Yes. These are what my dad prepared.

705
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,938
My pub is doing well thanks to you.

706
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,900
Gosh, you've finally achieved your dream.

707
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,153
This is just the beginning.

708
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,949
What's your dream, Hye-won?

709
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,911
A cop. I want to be a cop.

710
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,172
That sounds cool.

711
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,050
I also wanted to be a cop as a kid.

712
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,636
What? Why did you not become one?

713
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,721
Hye-won. If you're done,

714
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,223
can you go gather up the laundry
before the sun sets?

715
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,517
Okay.

716
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,860
Yi-seo, will you go help Hye-won?

717
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,029
Sure.

718
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,676
She seems brave and kind.

719
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,103
Unlike you, Officer Oh.

720
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,524
I'm not a cop anymore.

721
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,401
Don't call me like that.

722
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,570
When I first met you,

723
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:46,324
you were a cop in charge of my dad's case.

724
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,160
Wake up, you punk.

725
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:53,707
Get to your senses
if you want to keep your job.

726
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:59,629
Isn't your daughter
turning one next month?

727
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,174
Don't let that useless sense of justice
get the best of you.

728
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,844
You should think about your family.

729
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,556
Therefore, according to Article 254
of the Criminal Law, the defendant will be

730
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,851
sentenced to three years in prison.

731
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,189
And you didn't finish the case yet.

732
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,209
I'm really sorry.

733
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,422
Please stop...

734
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:47,594
Please stop coming here.

735
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,765
Get up.

736
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,477
I will do anything.

737
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,562
I'll do anything

738
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,814
to make it up to you.

739
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,317
I'll do anything you want.

740
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,819
Whether it's tens or hundreds
of millions of won,

741
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:07,822
I'll pay the money
no matter how long it takes.

742
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,990
Make it up to me?

743
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,715
The only thing

744
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,260
you can do for me

745
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,431
is turning yourself in
and revealing the truth.

746
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,479
You should

747
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,107
at least be an honorable dad

748
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,567
who can support his daughter's dream.

749
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,570
No. But it's just...

750
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,782
Without me, Hye-won will...

751
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,991
I'm

752
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,702
a businessman.

753
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,123
You should pay the price.

754
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,874
Don't try to welsh on your debt.

755
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,960
But...

756
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,212
You're not

757
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,342
supposed to say that to me, right?

758
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,061
If the guy gives testimony...

759
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,064
What?

760
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,942
Jang Geun-won will be put in prison,

761
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,738
and you will get the stockholders
on Chairman Jang's side on yours.

762
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,532
Is that your plan?

763
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,287
Did I wake you up?

764
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,749
So did it go well?

765
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:24,667
No.

766
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,253
I knew it.

767
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,507
If he could be moved with compassion,

768
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,967
he wouldn't have carried
a false investigation.

769
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,678
We'll see.

770
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,536
What are you doing?

771
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:03,414
I can't sleep on the bare floor.

772
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,416
Just stay like this for a while.

773
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:17,428
We should get going
before the last bus leaves.

774
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,189
What is this scar?

775
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:32,193
I got hurt when I worked

776
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,195
on the deep-sea fishing vessel.

777
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,534
And what about this one?

778
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,245
When I did manual labor.

779
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,423
You must've had a hard time all alone.

780
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:13,818
A little.

781
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,204
What?

782
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,874
As I felt heartbroken

783
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,501
by his past...

784
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,963
Why are you crying?

785
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,926
I realized my feelings for him

786
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,223
was love.

787
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,323
As I heard his calm voice,

788
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,454
I got really emotional.

789
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,376
I didn't want to let him
suffer alone ever again.

790
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,588
I decided to kill

791
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,549
those who mess with this guy.

792
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,992
I love him.

793
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,040
I really do.

794
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:14,165
JANGGA'S TRIPE, JANGGA RAMEN

795
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,293
The business is going well, right?

796
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,549
This is the main street on the weekend.

797
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,842
It has to go well.

798
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,594
I guess you're right.

799
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,846
Are you on your way to work?

800
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:29,764
Yes.

801
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,725
I was on my way to DanBam to get some ice.

802
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:33,684
I'll come with you.

803
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,562
How shameless you are.

804
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,022
What?

805
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,818
I heard the whole thing from Mr. Park.

806
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,320
The relationship between Jangga and him.

807
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,950
He rarely talks about himself.

808
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,285
I guess he trusts you.

809
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:55,414
Were you involved
in the stock purchasing too?

810
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,543
Why? So that you can go and tell them?

811
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,212
I can tell you hate me.

812
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,256
It's nothing surprising.

813
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,843
Too bad. I don't hate you.

814
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,474
Will you give me some ice?

815
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,394
No.

816
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,275
Boss.

817
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:24,735
You're here.

818
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,488
Why did you two come together?

819
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:30,241
I'm here to get some ice.

820
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,827
Will you go in there and talk to Geun-soo?

821
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,251
What's the matter?

822
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,670
He's the building owner.

823
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,130
Oh, hello.

824
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:45,590
Hello.

825
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,676
Anyway, that's what's going to happen.

826
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,682
What was it about?

827
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,112
I can do that.

828
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,156
No, it's okay.

829
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,494
He sold the building.

830
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:19,081
And the new building owner wants
to raise the rent.

831
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:20,875
How much?

832
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:21,959
By five percent.

833
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,629
Five percent? How much is it?

834
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,547
How much would it be?

835
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:30,259
The current rent is 5,940,000 won.
So 5 percent is...

836
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,386
It's 297,000 won.

837
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,432
That's just too much.

838
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:39,727
I know. Isn't it a breach of contract?

839
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,188
What's worse is that

840
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,149
he wants us to move out
when the contract runs out.

841
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:47,109
-What?
-He wants to run his business here.

842
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,278
That's ridiculous.

843
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,199
When does the contract run out?

844
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,576
I took over the contract,
so it runs out in half a year.

845
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,537
-Can I take a look at it?
-Sure.

846
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,291
There's no legal issue
about a rent increase.

847
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,044
They can raise it
by up to five percent every year.

848
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,005
They are just like muggers.

849
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,509
Stop staring at me.

850
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,344
Once our lease is up,

851
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,429
do we have to move out?

852
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:19,183
It doesn't say much about the conditions.

853
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,561
If you ask him to renew
the contract, you can stay.

854
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,563
It's unilateral termination
of the contract.

855
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,357
There's the law to protect the tenants.

856
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,067
You can be protected for five years.

857
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,486
It's a good thing.

858
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:31,612
What is it then?

859
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,364
We don't have to move out, do we?

860
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:38,744
But no good can come
from arguing with the building owner.

861
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,206
You better work things out well.

862
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:46,419
But it bothers me that the new owner
wants to run his business here.

863
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:48,838
That's what bothers me too.

864
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,756
It happens a lot.

865
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,384
Owners often kick out their tenants
to run their business.

866
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:57,138
It means they want to take the premium.

867
01:06:57,221 --> 01:07:00,558
The premium of this pub
is more than 100 million. That's absurd.

868
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:02,435
There's nothing you can do

869
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,645
if you can't find a new tenant
during the last 3 months.

870
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:08,607
You can assert your legal rights
for the last three months,

871
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,026
-but...
-It means,

872
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,486
we have to move out.

873
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,366
We've done the marketing work.

874
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,076
Even if we get the premium,

875
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,619
it's our loss once we move out.

876
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,247
I have the number
of the new building owner.

877
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,707
I should convince him.

878
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:29,754
Damn it.

879
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:39,472
NEW BUILDING OWNER

880
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,311
Hello?

881
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:50,524
Hello. I'm the owner of DanBam in Itaewon,
Park Saeroyi.

882
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,902
I heard you took over the building.

883
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,779
So I'm calling you to say hello.

884
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,030
Okay.

885
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,032
What a coincidence.

886
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,408
Pardon?

887
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,748
It's me.

888
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,542
Jang Dae-hee.

889
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,150
RELATIONSHIP: FRIEND

890
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,996
Is it Jangga? They just want to get
rid of someone they don't like.

891
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,623
He is a man of huge caliber.

892
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,917
Yi-seo, another word
and you will get scolded.

893
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,086
You and the girl named Yi-seo.

894
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:53,712
I didn't know you were so emotional.

895
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,631
Why don't you just shut down the business?

896
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,091
There's one way.

897
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:58,175
No way.

898
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,761
What do you want me to do?

899
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:04,014
-Get on your knees and apologize.
-Getting expelled? Getting kicked out?

900
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:07,184
You took absolutely nothing from me.

901
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:10,980
I'm really sorry
for what my family has done to you.

902
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:14,441
Geun-soo says he will talk to his dad
on condition that he quits his job here.

903
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,776
What do you think?

904
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,736
Of course I agree with it.

905
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:20,698
You don't deserve

906
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,367
to be the manager here.
