She has an unrivaled presence on stage,

but usually, she's just a warm-hearted big sister.

395
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,920
She's the all-rounder artist all the queens love.

You're right.

I was disappointed and upset.

During the first two matches, I was constantly in first place.

But during the third match, my scores weren't too good.

I need to go back to winning first place.

I thought I should make some adjustments.

So instead of talking, I just wrote everything down.

That's really sad. I read it at times.

480
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:24,930
We kept having this problem.

481
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,131
I just can't shorten it.

482
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,930
(Seo Ji Eum, a songwriter, will shorten it.)

483
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,700
I also agree that the thirst you have...

484
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,031
is what drives you.

485
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,771
- The thirst for music. - You're right.

486
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:35,841
I think that's why I used the word "thirst".

487
00:33:36,571 --> 00:33:41,041
(She revises her lyrics around this word.)

488
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:45,621
I'd like everyone to pay more attention to the lyrics.

489
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,480
This song will be...

490
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,551
a shortened version...

491
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:53,391
of my past journey.

492
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:56,361
(Let's see.)

(After making countless revisions)

494
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,260
I'm finally done with the lyrics.

00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,601
(She has finally completed her lyrics.)

496
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:03,500
If you look here,

497
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:07,041
the rap part is empty.

498
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,841
For this final match,

499
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:13,081
I've invited someone who will give a marvelous performance by my side.

500
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:15,210
Aren't you curious...

501
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,910
who it'll be?

502
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,950
(Who could be this marvelous rapper?)

503
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,720
Hello.

504

(Lee Young Ji appears with her faced zoomed in.)

505

Hello.

What is this?

520
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,921
- It's a money tree. - A money tree?

521
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:55,720
Yes. I hope you make a lot of money.

522

Thank you so much.

523
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:59,921
The fortune-teller told me that I lacked trees in my fortune.

(Are they meant for each other?)

let's have a heart-to-heart talk about it...

527

- in the other room. - Sounds good.

- What does that mean? - Let's go.

- It's really nice. - Right?

536
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,621
I chose this place solely because of the view.

537
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:31,990
I bet this place helps you focus.

538

(What kinds of fruits of labor did they reap here?)

539

You really wanted to do well.

540

You weren't easily satisfied.

- I like it. - Thank you.

553

As for the latter part,

554
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,160
I was even baffled that you'd be able to do it...

555
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,430
without running out of breath.

556
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,001
I wrote that solely on the fact that this would be a live stage.

557
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:15,671
There are some lines where I paid homage to your songs.

558
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,671
You mentioned "Layin' Low" and "Dally".

559
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,610
(She was smart enough to mention HYOLYN's songs.)

560

This part...

561
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:27,340
moved me a lot.

562
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:29,711
It must've been tough for you too.

563
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:32,851
Creating something new is difficult especially if you're young.

564
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:35,691
- But that's what you did. - Thank you for acknowledging.

565

- This is great. - Thank you.

566
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:41,360
Your lyrics talk about how you're paving your own path.

567
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,160
I based mine on yours.

568
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,530
"This is my journey. After much hard work,"

569

"I've monopolized everything and feel full."

570
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:47,860
"It's the end for you all."

571
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,930
"I'll uproot you all like an excavator."

572
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,200
- That's the attitude I have. - But here,

573
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,371
you wrote, "I can always eat again tomorrow."

574

But you're full now?

575

(Having good food makes you desire more.)

576

I'll cut to the chase. I'll rap my part.

(She revs up the excavator.)

591
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:38,251
Is that how you're going to dance?

592

No!

I tried to make this as real as possible.

- Now that I heard it myself, - Right.

596
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,990
I guarantee that it'll be fun.

597
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:48,820
- Right? - We'll have a blast...

598
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,930
singing and rapping.

599
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,001
I feel so proud right now...

600
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,760
because you said it was going to be fun.

601
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:56,871
But hold on.

602
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:58,470
Why are you so mad?

603
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,441
That's not the attitude you're supposed to give here.

604
00:38:00,501 --> 00:38:01,970
Oh, is it not?

605
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:04,240
I'm not mad. I just have this sadness.

(She finally gets it.)

607
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,481
I'm no longer mad.

608
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:10,711
I'm more laidback and placid about it.

609
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:12,010
That's even scarier.

610
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:14,550
That's more terrifying. You should just get angry.

611
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,090
People will beg you to just express your fury.

612
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,191
I'm not expressing my anger...

613
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:20,860
by shouting out loud.

614
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,090
It's more like, "So what?" Like this.

615
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:25,331
"What is it?" Something like this.

616

I totally get it.

617

She completely understood the message I wanted to give.

618
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,570
I could also tell that she thought long and hard about this.

619
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,871
I really liked that.

620

This is going to be really fun.

621
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:41,880
It wasn't easy for us to come this far.

622
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,510
This dog-eat-dog world was definitely not a cakewalk.

623
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,180
We paved our own paths.

(They can relate to each other.)

We probably feel angry too.

626

But I think that's just one of the many emotions we feel.

627
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:55,990
I agree.

628
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,061
That's not the only emotion I want to portray.

629
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:00,030
- I want to express them all. - I get it.

630

- That's my wish. - I understand.

Since this is the final match,

633
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:06,671
I truly want to give my all...

634
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:10,371
so that I won't regret anything.

635
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,481
I want my performance to be the only one...

636
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:15,880
that resonates with the audience.

Can you say a few words to HYOLYN?

691

This was my first time seeing her performance...

692

in person. I had only seen her in the green room.

So I'm truly honored.

694

Okay.

(We're not used to them looking this serious.)

715
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:13,481
We should do our best since it's EXY's song.

716
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,121
- Let's listen to it twice first. - Okay.

717
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,961
I've been writing lyrics and composing songs...

718
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:22,021
ever since my debut.

719
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:25,090
My best and most confident songs...

720
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,760
are still WJSN's.

721
00:48:27,901 --> 00:48:32,231
I want our final song to express who we truly are.

722
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:35,570
That was the thought I had in mind while making this.

723
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,840
Hi.

724
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:40,410
It's 11:05pm right now.

725
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,211
I'm here to work on our song.

726
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,851
I'm at the studio.

727
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:45,550
I came here to work.

728
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,651
I have many different versions...

729
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:51,791
of melodies that I've worked on here in the studio.

730

(She sings her own melodies.)

731
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,930
I think I've made about 100 verses so far.

732
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,300
I feel like I can do better.

733
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:03,871
(She repeatedly worked on it to get a better version.)

734
00:49:03,871 --> 00:49:07,541
I need to keep working on it to get a better one.

735
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:10,840
I think that's why I kept going.

736
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:14,481
(The final version of "Aura")

737

(The actual final version of "Aura")

740
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,691
I've compiled many tracks.

741
00:49:24,691 --> 00:49:28,691
These precious tracks are the result of my hard work.

742
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:32,760
I believe there's no other songwriter...

743
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,231
who knows WJSN's characteristics and charms...

744
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:37,800
as well as I do.

745
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:40,901
That gave me pride and confidence...

746
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:42,240
to work on this.

747
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:44,871
- This last hook... - Verse three?

748
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:46,780
Yes. I tried to emphasize...

749
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,610
their fortes.

750
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,740
Should Soobin sing that part?

751
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,680
But the key is really high.

752
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:56,621
(Yeonjung, the lead vocalist, will sing these hooks.)

753
00:49:56,651 --> 00:49:58,820
(But even she struggled.)

754
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,421
This is pretty high.

755
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,820
No, you can do it.

756
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:04,660
Soobin is good at falsetto, so she could do that.

757
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:07,260
- Will she manage? - Yes, she will.

758
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:09,231
I know my members very well.

759

(She feels pressured.)

760
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,570
Try to sing it normally first.

761
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,941
If it's too difficult, you can always sing in falsetto.

762
00:50:17,211 --> 00:50:19,340
The best thing to do is sing "you" in falsetto.

763
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,410
Would that be too difficult?

764
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,751
The key was higher than I thought.

765
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:25,010
I was unsure.

766
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:27,180
I'll try.

767
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,820

00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:59,470
because it was my song.

804
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:01,141
I was grateful.

805
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:05,510
It must've been extremely tiring...

806
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,220
to practice until late at night then work on the song afterward.

807
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,820
I'm truly thankful that she did so without complaining.

808
00:52:13,251 --> 00:52:16,891
I'm sure she's the one who feels the most pressured.

809
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:18,930
You look pretty exhausted.

810
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:21,200
It's because I'm not simply preparing...

811
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,901
- for another regular song. - I agree.

812
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:24,671
I'm betting everything on this.

813
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,101
I wondered what I could do...

814
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:30,910
to encourage her.

815
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:34,110
I wanted to help her.

816
00:52:34,981 --> 00:52:36,010
(While EXY was busy working...)

817
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,481
Let me call EXY.

818
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:40,720
Why is Dayoung calling?

819
00:52:41,621 --> 00:52:43,590
- Hey. - EXY.

820
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,490
Please watch what you say because this could be aired.

821
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,691
Do I curse or something when I pick up the phone?

822
00:52:49,691 --> 00:52:51,791
I just simply say, "Hello?"

823
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,191
(They all disagree.)

824
00:52:53,191 --> 00:52:55,630
- Did you eat yet? - I don't have an appetite.

825
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:58,530
Don't be ridiculous. Come here. I'll send you the address.

826
00:52:58,530 --> 00:52:59,800
What's the menu?

827
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,371
- Just come! - Just come!

828
00:53:03,101 --> 00:53:05,371
I shouldn't say anything else. Fine.

829
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:06,840
Hurry.

830

(The night is filled with beautiful colors.)

831

When is she coming?

832
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,981
She's taking her sweet time.

833
00:53:14,981 --> 00:53:16,251
I'm famished.

834

(Will they be able to eat dinner?)

835
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:18,521
She's here.

(The door opens.)

(EXY is befuddled.)

838

(Shy)

840

(It's a surprise party.)

845
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:41,410
EXY is working hard for us.

846
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:45,110
So we prepared a surprise dinner party for her.

847
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:48,481
We prepared the party to cheer her up today.

848
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:49,621
(Our leader's hard work makes our hearts beat.)

849
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:51,021
We need to hurry and eat.

850
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:52,151
Hang on.

851
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,220
(What is it now?)

852
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,961
Hang on. Yeonjung prepared something for you.

853
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,191
Today is a historic day.

854
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:00,601
- What is it? - What is this?

(Curious)

Did our agency approve of this?

- They did. - Really?

864
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,581
I lost my voice working on the guide track.

But it just came back.

Wait, EXY.

(Heavy drinking is bad for your health.)

- I'm so happy to be outside... - Right.

872
00:54:33,731 --> 00:54:35,930
at this hour of the night.

873
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,501
- Me too. - I like the vibes here.

874
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,101
So is the master track done yet?

875
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:41,541
The one we recorded.

876
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:43,401
- It's almost done. - Great.

877
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:46,010
- I've never heard it. - I want to hear it.

878
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,081
It's not the final version, but it's almost done.

879
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:50,481
I'm curious.

880
00:54:50,651 --> 00:54:54,081
(The members listen to "Aura" by WJSN for the first time.)

881
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:59,820
Someone who knows us better than anyone...

882
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,090
wrote the song for us.

883
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,260
So I believe it will best describe us.

884
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,130
I felt like we'd finally found something that fits us perfectly.

885
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:11,300
(Loving it)

886
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:12,901
(That's really nice.)

My goodness.

888
00:55:14,271 --> 00:55:17,141
- It sounds great. - It's different.

889
00:55:17,211 --> 00:55:19,311
It clearly shows our own color.

890
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:22,641
I think the song shows how we've been working on...

891
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:24,610
our performances for Queendom 2.

892
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:26,820
What I want to say with this song...

893
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,291
is that we've managed to get through the hard times well.

894
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:32,220
There were many tough times,

895
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,860
and we are still going through one,

896
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,691
but I believe...

897
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:39,130
even those times are part of us.

898
00:55:39,231 --> 00:55:42,231
Before we joined Queendom 2...

899
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:46,800
I know we're loved by many people, and I'm grateful for that.

900
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,200
But I want us to be more famous.

901
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,371
We should try hard as if our lives depend on it.

902
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:53,711
I think that was...

903
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:56,740
when we were going through the darkest time.

904
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:59,410
(Nothing's going right.)

905
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:02,780
There were tough times.

906
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:05,251
Thank you.

907
00:56:05,521 --> 00:56:07,191
And there were happy times.

908
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:10,630
But all those hours...

909
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,660
have become part of our "Aura". That's what I wanted to say.

910
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:19,470
Now that I think of it, what we've been through...

911
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,871
makes us stronger and gives us energy.

912
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,871
Imagine there's a book about the images of WJSN.

913
00:56:24,871 --> 00:56:27,711
This song, "Aura" will be the last chapter of the book.

914
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:30,811
So I want to try...

915
00:56:30,811 --> 00:56:34,081
many new things after this song.

916
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:40,360
I want us to give short messages to each other.

917
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,660
(It will be a special gift for them.)

918
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:46,530
It's a message to the WJSN after Queendom 2.

919
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:49,461
I'd like us to encourage and thank ourselves.

920
00:56:49,461 --> 00:56:50,671
(It's a message to the WJSN after Queendom 2.)

921
00:56:50,871 --> 00:56:52,930
- Ta-da. - It looks lovely.

922
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:56,470
EXY will make a finale on here.

923
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:57,811
I love this.

924
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,110
Wait. I'm reading the messages.

925
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:01,740
It was heart-warming.

926
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,410
I could feel their sincere hearts from every word.

927
00:57:06,711 --> 00:57:09,121
I felt all warm inside as I read the messages.

928
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:11,090
(The members could share their sincere stories together.)

929
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:14,090
- Now we want you to finish it. - "Queens, let's go."

930
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,621
I can't believe this is our last chant.

931
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:20,530
(They chanted together before the match every time.)

932
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:23,061
(Queen WJSN, let's go for the victory!)

933
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,871
(They narrowly missed out on 1st place every time.)

934
00:57:27,871 --> 00:57:32,141
So we will work harder than ever before...

935
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:36,340
so we will meet with a great result with the song EXY wrote for us.

936
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,481
The great result should be the first place.

937
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:43,581
The times we have ahead of us won't be easy.

938
00:57:43,581 --> 00:57:46,961
I'm sure there will be tougher times.

939
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:48,990
But just like we did on Queendom 2,

940
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:52,191
I believe we will get over it.

941

(WJSN's "Aura" will shine brightly in the universe.)

942

So I'm not afraid...

943

of the future ahead of us.

(You can check out all the songs on Queendom 2 on Spotify.)

951
01:03:14,481 --> 01:03:16,651
That was "Aura" by WJSN.

952
01:03:16,851 --> 01:03:19,521
It was amazing. I think everyone's into it.

953
01:03:19,521 --> 01:03:23,891
Yes, this person's expression was especially noticeable.

954
01:03:23,891 --> 01:03:28,530
SinB, who's an official partner of Eunseo of WJSN on the show.

955
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:31,030
What did you think of their performance?

956
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:34,570
Firstly, the song was great.

957
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:37,171
So I was curious to see how the performance will turn out.

958
01:03:37,171 --> 01:03:39,441
I think the performance showed WJSN's characteristics,

959
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,680
and something that we've never seen in them before.

960
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,851
So I thought it was really cool.

961
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:45,950
- It was the best. - Right.

962
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:49,251
What would you like to say to your best friend, Eunseo?

963
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,820
Your aura was extraordinary.

964
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:59,061
You're saying something you should say in a private message...

965
01:03:59,061 --> 01:04:00,090
on a live show.

966
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,260
All right, then.

967
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:06,271
Yujeong of Brave Girls. You trained with Yeoreum as a trainee.

- What would you say? - Actually,

971
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:16,211
I've seen Yeoreum since very young.

972
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:18,211
It's surprising to see her grow every time I see her.

973
01:04:18,211 --> 01:04:21,550
I think WJSN is growing every time too.

974
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:24,050
The stage was very cool.

975

Thank you.

Now it's time to meet the third team of the final match.

With stronger energy than anyone else,

Baby Queen fascinated Queendom.

981

As super rookies who're getting attention globally,

982
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:52,380
they are planning to show their amazing power today.

983
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,621
Should we meet the rebellion of the youngest right now?

984
01:04:55,621 --> 01:04:57,621
- Run the world, Kep1er! - Kep1er!

985

Leader, go.

988
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,171

(Scores from the 3rd match)

990

Luckily, there's not much difference.

991
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:20,271
The third, fourth, and fifth places have similar scores.

992

In the comments, people wrote...

995
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:28,450
it was the best performance among the ones we did so far.

996
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:30,751
- Right. - They said "Kep1er's best stage".

997
01:05:31,021 --> 01:05:32,151
- I saw many comments like that. - Yes.

998
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:36,061
I also saw a comment saying that everyone is full of spite.

999
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,461
Seeing the comments saying that we've grown...

1000

since the 1st and 2nd match,

1001

made me think that it's not only us who thought that way.

- Right. - People think the same as us.

1003

Now, we have only the final match to prepare.

(My heart should stop racing.)

1005
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,541
We need a new song this time.

1006

I'm thrilled.

1007

- Since it'll be our song. - Yes.

1008
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:05,090
I'm excited and thrilled.

1009
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:09,021
What kind of songs do you want?

1010
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,961
The one with the best reaction and we were most confident with.

1011
01:06:12,391 --> 01:06:13,990
("The Boys" by Kep1er was praised by the audience.)

1012
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:16,961
A mixture of "The Boys" and "See the Light".

1013
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:18,331
That'd be nice.

This application is used all around the world.

1019

So there are many songs in it.

1020
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,621
The songs I listen to are similar to each other.

1021

It's from "Street Dance Girls Fighter".

a song that represents Kep1er well, so I chose this song.

We can do it.

1178
01:13:25,061 --> 01:13:27,630
Our members went through a lot.

1179
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,330
I realized we shared so many memories...

1180
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:33,630
with Queendom.

1181
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,741
Each photo reminded me...

1182
01:13:36,141 --> 01:13:37,470
- everything of that time. - Yes.

1183
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:39,571
- The memories of that time. - Really.

1184
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:42,111
I can clearly recall them.

1185
01:13:42,611 --> 01:13:45,911
Since this is the last performance on Queendom,

1186
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:50,151
I hope we can show everything that we've got.

1187
01:13:50,151 --> 01:13:52,491
For the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd matches,

1188
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:55,220
- we had too many thoughts. - Yes.

1189
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:58,161
We thought about our rankings and all.

1190
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:00,330
It felt most thrilling...

1191
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,830
- during our opening stage. - Yes.

1192
01:14:02,861 --> 01:14:04,500
After the ranking was revealed,

1193
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,731
I lost my confidence.

1194
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:08,500
There were times when I lost my confidence.

1195
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:11,911
So I also think it was most thrilling during our opening stage.

1196
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:15,741
Since this is our last stage, let's finish it well...

1197
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:17,210
and feel happy.

1198
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,580
- Yes, let's do that. - I hope...

1199
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,111
- we can feel like that. - Yes.

1200
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:24,080
For our final performance,

1201
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,750
let's remember our original resolution.

1202
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,661
With the feelings and emotions we had then,

1203
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,691
I hope we can show everything we've got.

1204

- Here. In 5, 6, 7, 8. - In 5, 6, 7, 8.

VIVIZ has colored the stage with their own colors once again.

1595
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:38,749
Just like the song title, we were enchanted.

1596
01:42:38,789 --> 01:42:41,690
That's right. SinB from VIVIZ...

Eunseo.

1600
01:42:48,959 --> 01:42:52,699
Could you tell us what you thought about their performance?

1601
01:42:53,369 --> 01:42:56,039
First of all, I think this is the one stage...

1602
01:42:56,039 --> 01:42:58,069
that'll come to my mind...

1603
01:42:58,069 --> 01:43:01,539
when I think of VIVIZ on Queendom 2.

1604
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:05,350
All three of them were terrific.

1605

Fantastic!

1606
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:12,090
All right. There's this team that VIVIZ has a strong bond with.

1607
01:43:12,249 --> 01:43:14,690
Da Yeon from Kep1er...

1608
01:43:14,690 --> 01:43:18,060
has also formed a strong bond with them.

1609
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:20,130
How was the stage?

1610
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:24,829
It felt like a musical, and I just couldn't stop smiling...

1611
01:43:24,829 --> 01:43:28,430
throughout their performance.

1612
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:29,640
They were the best.

1613
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:33,239

1614
01:43:34,039 --> 01:43:36,239
the highlight of their stage?

1615

Could you show it to us?

1616

It's time to meet our fifth contestant.

1626
01:44:14,650 --> 01:44:16,650
This group has always surprised us...

1627
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,890
by pushing their limits every time.

1628
01:44:19,650 --> 01:44:22,090
They have transformed into rascals today...

to turn the tables.

1630

It's really difficult for us to get a high score on that.

I don't know why, but the other artists...

always have high expectations for us.

They always mentioned that they had high hopes.

There are so many cars.

There's nowhere to go even though we're in a car.

Where should we go?

we placed first with our new song.

The place we shot the music video is Surfyy Beach in Yangyang.

We wanted to get the energy from the beach.

2217
02:18:57,089 --> 02:19:01,570
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2218
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:04,800
The live voting has ended.

2219
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:07,640
(The live voting is over.)

2220
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:13,939
Run the world, Queendom 2. The live voting has...

2221
02:19:13,939 --> 02:19:15,650
now ended.

2222
02:19:16,050 --> 02:19:18,279
Thank you to all the viewers...

2223
02:19:18,279 --> 02:19:21,289
and the global fans for your votes.

2224
02:19:21,490 --> 02:19:22,550
Thank you.

2225
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:25,859
All right.

2226
02:19:26,859 --> 02:19:29,029
The queens have prepared a present...

2227
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:32,500
to show their appreciation for you all.

2228
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:35,300
- Yes. - The six teams have prepared...

2229
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:38,240
a special performance after the long four-month journey.

2230
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:41,109
Taeyeon, I hear...

2231
02:19:41,109 --> 02:19:42,839
you know what it is.

2232
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:45,580
- I know a bit about it. - Okay.

2233
02:19:45,580 --> 02:19:48,279
I took a sneak peek...

2234
02:19:48,279 --> 02:19:50,310
at them preparing for it.

2235
02:19:50,679 --> 02:19:54,150
Here's a hint. You'll hear a familiar melody,

2236
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:58,289
and the lyrics are about Queendom.

2237
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:00,689
You're curious, aren't you?

2238
02:20:00,689 --> 02:20:03,890
I wonder what performance it is.

2239
02:20:04,199 --> 02:20:07,000
Let's go and check it out now!

2240
02:20:09,529 --> 02:20:12,269
(It's a sunny day in May.)

2241

(Who arrived at the recording studio before everyone else?)

2242

Hello.

(She feels awkward.)

2245
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:24,179
(It's awkward being on her own.)

2246
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:27,920
(This reminds us of the painful time at the workshop.)

2247
02:20:29,349 --> 02:20:30,390
Room C?

2248
02:20:31,289 --> 02:20:33,259
There's nowhere to hide here.

2249
02:20:33,459 --> 02:20:34,929
I can't really hide here.

2250
02:20:35,929 --> 02:20:37,390
I'm too big for this.

2251

(She's so awkward.)

2252
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:40,699
I'm here to record the ending song...

2253
02:20:40,699 --> 02:20:44,170
that we'll all be singing together at the end of the final match.

2254
02:20:45,839 --> 02:20:47,670
(Who's the second to arrive?)

2255

Goodness.

2259
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:55,109
Did you eat?

2260
02:20:56,650 --> 02:20:58,880
- I had some pastries before. - Did you?

2261
02:20:59,550 --> 02:21:02,650
(They've gone silent after the small talk.)

2262
02:21:04,259 --> 02:21:07,119
(It's their first time together without anyone else.)

2263
02:21:07,119 --> 02:21:09,959
(Here comes the third member to break the awkward silence.)

2264
02:21:11,599 --> 02:21:13,029
- Hello! - Hello!

2265

You're here!

You're all here on behalf of your teams, right?

2268
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:19,839
- Yes. - I guess so.

2269

- This is so funny. - Hello!

2270

- Hello! - Hello!

2271

Is everyone here?

2272
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:29,310
We're missing one person.

2273
02:21:30,349 --> 02:21:31,650
- Kep1er! - Yes.

2274

(Where's the youngest one, the Kep1er member?)

2275
02:21:33,179 --> 02:21:37,390
(Ye Seo recorded her part beforehand due to a schedule conflict.)

2276
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:39,920
I'm so sad I can't be there for the recording session,

2277
02:21:39,990 --> 02:21:42,230
but I will be there with them in my heart...

2278
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:44,060
and join them on the stage.

2279
02:21:44,529 --> 02:21:46,259
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.

2280
02:21:46,259 --> 02:21:47,529
Should we start?

2281
02:21:47,529 --> 02:21:48,570
- Yes. - Yes.

2282
02:21:48,570 --> 02:21:51,000
(They'll listen to the group song first!)

2283

- Please play it! - Yes.

2284
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:53,439
(How does the group song sound?)

2285
02:21:56,339 --> 02:21:58,140
(She's intrigued.)

2286
02:21:58,140 --> 02:21:59,939
(She's so focused.)

2287
02:22:00,009 --> 02:22:01,609
It sounds familiar.

2288
02:22:01,609 --> 02:22:03,050
I've heard it before.

2289
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:06,080
Doesn't it sound like it was on the show?

2290
02:22:06,150 --> 02:22:08,650
Right. In previews...

2291
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:10,150
Or sad moments.

2292
02:22:10,150 --> 02:22:12,060
And touching moments.

2293
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:19,630
(This melody played at every touching moment.)

2294
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,869
It played so often on the show, right?

2295
02:22:22,369 --> 02:22:25,300
No wonder it sounds so familiar when it's our first time hearing it.

2296
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:28,709
So you've been building it up...

2297
02:22:28,839 --> 02:22:31,009
just for this final moment!

2298
02:22:31,009 --> 02:22:33,339
- I had no idea. - Absolutely not.

2299
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,650
(They're all applauding to welcome this group song.)

2300
02:22:35,650 --> 02:22:36,679
It sounds great.

2301
02:22:37,349 --> 02:22:39,619
The song is called "Epilogue".

2302
02:22:40,019 --> 02:22:43,550
I feel like it's a song that speaks...

2303
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:46,560
about all of our time on Queendom 2.

2304
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:49,160
It's truly like the last bow.

2305
02:22:49,959 --> 02:22:51,330
(I feel so sad.)

2306

(The group recording session is starting for real.)

2307
02:22:53,459 --> 02:22:55,929
(How will their voices harmonize with each others'?)

2308
02:22:55,929 --> 02:23:01,810
(At the end of this journey, the moments we've walked together)

2309
02:23:01,939 --> 02:23:04,109
- We'll record two more times. - Okay.

2310
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:07,750
(Everyone is busy recording.)

2311
02:23:07,810 --> 02:23:09,709
It was great. Let's do it once more.

02:23:10,009 --> 02:23:11,080
Okay.

2313
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:13,380
(Who is that?)

2314
02:23:14,650 --> 02:23:16,250
- Hello. - Hello.

(Grand Master Taeyeon is here for a surprise visit.)

(But the members in the booth have no idea.)

So good!

(What's going on?)

2321
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:34,070
Taeyeon!

2322

What?

- No way. - I thought I was seeing things!

2327

I was so surprised.

2328

I turned around, and there she was!

2329
02:23:49,490 --> 02:23:52,459
I thought there was a big monitor. I didn't expect this at all.

2330
02:23:53,459 --> 02:23:55,189
Thank you!

2331
02:23:55,189 --> 02:23:57,759
- Thanks so much. - I'm here for moral support.

- Look, macarons! - They look delicious!

2333

- They're cake and macarons. - Look at these!

2334
02:24:02,170 --> 02:24:03,470
Thank you!

2335

- Thanks so much. - You're welcome.

2336
02:24:05,369 --> 02:24:07,670
We met when it was cold, in February.

2337
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:09,810
- Yes. - Time sure flies.

2338
02:24:10,009 --> 02:24:12,140
You all came such a long way.

2339
02:24:12,310 --> 02:24:14,109
What was most difficult for you?

2340
02:24:14,509 --> 02:24:16,580
We didn't have enough time...

2341
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:19,980
to prepare for our performances,

2342
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:21,820
and the recording days were so hard.

2343
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:25,359
Everyone grew quiet because we were all so sensitive...

2344
02:24:25,820 --> 02:24:26,990
and exhausted.

2345
02:24:27,189 --> 02:24:29,390
The viewers have no idea...

2346
02:24:29,859 --> 02:24:32,359
that you'd been rehearsing from before dawn,

2347
02:24:32,359 --> 02:24:34,730
and they were to evaluate you guys...

2348
02:24:34,730 --> 02:24:37,000
based on a single performance.

2349
02:24:37,470 --> 02:24:39,769
That's why I felt so bad for you.

2350
02:24:39,769 --> 02:24:43,910
I know it's a show and a competition,

2351
02:24:44,339 --> 02:24:46,179
but I hope you don't burn out.

2352
02:24:46,880 --> 02:24:49,880
I hope you don't burn out...

2353
02:24:50,179 --> 02:24:53,250
from this environment and system.

2354
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:56,320
Some colleagues I've seen...

2355
02:24:56,390 --> 02:24:59,890
ended up giving up...

2356
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:02,990
on all the dreams they had at first.

2357
02:25:03,029 --> 02:25:05,560
All because of the circumstances in this industry.

2358
02:25:05,759 --> 02:25:07,130
Indeed.

2359
02:25:07,130 --> 02:25:09,170
Reality is so different, you know?

2360
02:25:09,599 --> 02:25:12,769
No matter what happens here,

2361
02:25:12,769 --> 02:25:15,310
your teams will still be there.

2362
02:25:15,839 --> 02:25:18,109
And I believe you'll perform your best...

2363
02:25:18,109 --> 02:25:20,380
so that you are proud of yourself...

2364
02:25:20,839 --> 02:25:22,109
when you look back.

2365
02:25:22,179 --> 02:25:23,709
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2366
02:25:24,109 --> 02:25:26,420
- Good luck. - Good luck!

(She's raising her hand.)

2368
02:25:28,589 --> 02:25:30,289
- Me. - Yes?

2369
02:25:31,150 --> 02:25:34,359
Can I call you "Taeyeon" once Queendom 2 is over?

2370
02:25:36,529 --> 02:25:38,959
(What will Grand Master Taeyeon say?)

2371
02:25:38,959 --> 02:25:41,599
(Her heart is pounding.)

2372
02:25:43,029 --> 02:25:45,269
You can do that now too!

2373
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:47,800
Feel free to call me by my name.

2374
02:25:48,070 --> 02:25:49,310
- Go ahead. - Thank you.

02:56:28,203 --> 02:56:31,502
When we first joined the show, we were really worried.

2850
02:56:31,502 --> 02:56:36,313
I want to thank the members who made it possible...

(Queen WJSN)

2855
02:56:56,032 --> 02:56:59,233
It still feels surreal.

2856
02:57:00,102 --> 02:57:02,133
I still can't believe...

2857
02:57:02,133 --> 02:57:07,043
that we actually won.

2858

02:57:22,323 --> 02:57:26,022
that everything we did wasn't in vain.

2862
02:57:26,393 --> 02:57:31,662
I want to thank everyone who supported us...

2863
02:57:31,662 --> 02:57:34,973
and hoped for us to win.

And our leader will say a few things.

2881
02:58:39,703 --> 02:58:42,133
We could make it this far...

2882
02:58:42,133 --> 02:58:45,672
and become the final winner of Queendom 2...

2883
02:58:45,973 --> 02:58:50,672
thanks to the help of so many people.

02:59:26,243 --> 02:59:30,313
Let's hear from LOONA who won second place.

2895
02:59:30,612 --> 02:59:33,983
Yves, tell us how you feel on behalf of your team members.

First off, I want to congratulate WJSN for winning.

2897
02:59:44,832 --> 02:59:48,672
As we went through many things on the show,

2898
02:59:48,672 --> 02:59:51,502
there were many moments...

2899
02:59:51,502 --> 02:59:54,873
when we were uncertain about ourselves and about our team,

2900
02:59:54,873 --> 02:59:57,373
and when we didn't have confidence.

2901
02:59:57,373 --> 02:59:59,582
But finishing second on Queendom...

2902
02:59:59,582 --> 03:00:03,182
helped us realize that all our efforts weren't in vain.

2903
03:00:03,182 --> 03:00:07,782
So we'll work even harder with this mindset.

2904
03:00:07,782 --> 03:00:12,022
Please continue to show the support you've given us.

Please tell us how you feel.

2909
03:00:27,272 --> 03:00:30,012
Although we came in second place,

2910

from fifth place. I'm really grateful.

2914
