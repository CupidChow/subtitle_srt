Because I like "I Wish".

164
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,158
But in my opinion...

165
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,729
Because I like "I Wish".

166
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:02,229
SinB likes the song, "I Wish".

167
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,067
Whenever I listen to the song, I screenshot it and say,

168
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,468
"Honey, I'm listening to this right now."

169
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:08,568
So I sent her "I Wish" a lot.

170
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:10,339
She really likes it.

171
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:13,269
This is my favourite WJSN song.

172
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,778
- Right. - Honestly, if we perform...

173
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,648
WJSN's songs, the colours...

174
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,578
- Lyricism. - and the lyricism is similar to us.

175
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,888
Since we gave off that impression in the first match,

176
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,988
- we want to do something different. - Right.

177
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,928
While watching HYOLYN's performance,

178
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,797
we saw that she put in a lot of great LED sources.

179
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,027
- Right. - The colours,

180
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:37,729
the golden flakes,

181
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,767
- and the red. - It was shiny.

182
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:40,838
(The performance became full with the bright colours.)

183
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,367
(Did you all watch that?)

184
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:46,169
(You know what we should do for the 2nd match, right?)

185
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,407
During the first match, we kept our colours simple.

186
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:53,309
If it was closer to a monotone vibe...

187
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,748
It's about how that white outfit gets coloured.

188
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:00,287
What colours will it be filled with?

189
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,118
That's the point.

190
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,329
When you think about that...

191
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:09,128
- It's "UNNATURAL". - Right.

192
00:09:09,158 --> 00:09:10,698
Right, because...

193
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,497
it's the song WJSN...

194
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,699
- changed its image with. - That's right.

195
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,168
(From telling a story that was reminiscent of a fairytale...)

196
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:20,339
(about a fairy-like girl with a mysterious vibe, )

197
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:23,078
(WJSN transformed to mature and enchanting women...)

198
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,579
(through "UNNATURAL".)

199
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:28,247
- It fits our intention. - It does.

200
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:32,147
I think we can show who we are as VIVIZ in the second match.

201
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:34,487
We should have bold colours and be dynamic.

202
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:35,518
(Their key point is bold and dynamic colours.)

203
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:37,688
I feel like "UNNATURAL" could open up...

204
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:38,887
a lot of options for us.

205
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,128
I agree.

206
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:42,458
It has a polished air to it,

207
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,298
but we can try different concepts with it.

208
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,267
- We choose "UNNATURAL"! - "UNNATURAL"!

209
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,709
(We choose you, "UNNATURAL".)

210
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,107
During the second match, we hope to paint the stage...

211
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:57,048
with the bold and dynamic colours...

212
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,079
that are unique to us, VIVIZ.

213
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:02,179
We intend to try something daring.

214
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:04,618
Shall we try the rap?

215
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:06,988
- I'll try it. - Okay.

216
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:10,829
There are rap parts that are new to me,

217
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:14,199
so I thought a lot about how I should record it.

218
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:18,398
(Hwang SinB débuts as a rapper after 7 years.)

219

220

(succeed this time?)

222

- I think we're done. - Okay. Thank you!

223
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:35,678
(SinB's rap recording ends easily.)

224
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,778
Done!

225
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:41,059
(Next up is Umji.)

226
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:44,089
I'll try it again.

227
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:49,127
(Their CEO, aka Jang Geun, knows how to rap, so he helps.)

228
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,898
- Like that. - Okay.

229
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:55,299
(The rap part sounds more natural now.)

230
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,938
- Your tone and vibe were good. - This was good.

231
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:00,268
- Let's move on. - Okay.

232
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,679
Hello.

233
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,049
The chorus... Oh, the really, really part.

234
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,579
Gosh, this is hard.

235
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:10,518
(They start recording while filled with worry.)

236
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,118
(Really, really unnaturally)

(She gets tongue-tied again.)

239
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,998
This is so fast. I'll try it again.

(She can't pronounce it as well as she'd like.)

241
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:29,998
I got so mad at myself while I was recording.

242
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:33,808
(She sees Umji watching her record.)

243
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:35,507
- Hey, Umji. - Yes?

244
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:37,979
- Can you listen to my chorus? - Sure.

245
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,319
(She monitors Eunha's part seriously.)

246
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:46,588
If it comes out sounding like this,

247
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:48,458
try pronouncing it like this.

248
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,258
You don't have to drag it out at the end.

249
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:55,258
Okay.

250
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:56,858
I'll try it again.

251
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,699
I'll do it again.

252
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,068
I'll go again.

253
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:06,368
(The difficult recording session continues.)

254
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,679
I felt a huge sense of responsibility.

255
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,179
The lyrics are sung really fast, so it was hard to record.

256
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,287
I wonder how WJSN managed to sing that part so quickly.

257
00:12:19,288 --> 00:12:21,988
I felt like my mouth wasn't listening to me.

258
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,559
During the actual match, I hope I can do it well.

259
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:29,458
We'll practice the choreography and create a pretty performance.

260
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,568
I'll be practicing my part a lot too and do a great job.

261
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:33,998
(Optimistic Eunha promises to put on a great performance.)

262
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:38,968
During the first performance, we only used the main stage.

263
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:41,007
This time, we're using...

264
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:42,839
- all the stages. - We'll use them all.

265
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,277
The audience...

266
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:46,948
is also spread out.

267
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:49,319
We can get close and make eye contact...

268
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,388
which will help us steal their hearts.

269
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,558
Our performance is composed in a way...

270
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,288
where each member's individual performance shines.

271
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:00,429
It'll become a charming performance.

272
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:05,099
(The key point to Eunha's part is the paired choreography.)

273
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,398
I have to spin faster.

274
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:11,538
When I received the video for my performance...

(Paired choreography draft, Dancer version)

276

I thought, "This is what I have to do?"

277
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:19,949
"Is this for real?" This was the thought that crossed my mind.

What can I do to do better?

284
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,839
Imagine that you're pushing something to the side.

285
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:44,038
- From here. Three, four. - Right.

286

One, two.

Goodness. I'm exhausted.

289

The other members are doing a great job...

290
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,757
with their dance breaks.

291
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,728
Since I'm in charge of the finish,

292
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:08,628
I have to show everyone a great performance.

293

(Eunha is disheartened.)

Eunha is a bit...

We're VIVIZ, and we're the best!

296
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,108
Of course, I'm the best out of all of us.

(She's the icon of optimism, who never stops smiling.)

301
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:30,319
She tends to forget things easily and moves on quickly.

302
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:33,448
But everyone puts in a lot of effort for their performances...

(An unexpected result of the Self-Assessment)

Since that's the case, she's starting to want more.

306
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,469
I think she's struggling a lot because of that.

307

(Eunha feels pressured as she starts practicing on her own.)

My legs need to swing around like this,

310

but one leg won't straighten.

311

I'll try it again.

Five, six, seven, eight.

313
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:09,888
Right? My leg keeps going up like this.

314
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:12,229
It feels awkward to be lifted up,

315

I'm practicing hard.

I hope that during the actual performance,

319
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:31,408
everyone can see me and say, "Look at Eunha!"

- Talk to me. - We're a couple.

491
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,807
Why are you in the car then? You can just break up.

492
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:15,547
It's not that you don't like each other.

493

If you didn't, you would've broken up.

494

Then why are they in the car together?

495

Since they're still dating...

496
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:24,057
How frustrating. You're frustrating me.

497

Why? I'm frustrated too!

498

You should talk to each other.

But they're not talking to each other in the lyrics.

What's ennui?

Ennui?

- In the lyrics for "We Ride"... - "We Ride".

Ennui...

535
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:50,438
is when your feelings die down all of a sudden.

536
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,449
It's when you look at your boyfriend,

but you don't feel butterflies in your stomach like before.

It's when you look at them, but they annoy you.

539

It's when they annoy you, and you don't miss them one bit.

- You do? What is it? - What's ennui?

544
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:13,369
Ennui is when love...

gets spoiled.

546
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:17,498
Spoiled?

I don't think we can do this song.

Let's not do "We Ride".

- Right. - Summer props.

559

What do you think about doing a mash-up with "Rollin'"?

562

- Rollin' - Can't you hear it?

567
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:07,118
We'll combine "Pool Party" with "Rollin'".

We heard you had trouble choosing a song.

- Really? Why? - Really?

573
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,567
Yes because Brave Girls...

574
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:27,508
has a lot of songs about adult love.

575

How cute.

We weren't sure if we could portray those aspects,

580
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:40,889
so we gave a lot of thought...

581

before choosing our song.

582
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:46,928
If there's a difference between the original song that Brave Girls sang,

583
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,257
what would it be?

584
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:51,698
Hikaru and I have a rap part.

585

It'd be nice if you anticipate that.

I'm excited.

587
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:58,708
I'm a huge fan of Hikaru.

588

She also has...

- great pronunciation. - She does.

590

I want to show them how we rap.

(In the original song, E CHAN from DKB was in charge of the rap.)

592

In this part, Hikaru and Da Yeon can rap.

Difficulties in life

601
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:34,237
It's because you're trying to pronounce it properly.

602
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:36,538
You don't always have to...

I may not be a villain,

974
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:48,588
and mischievous character.

975
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:50,958
I wanted the message of the song...

976

to be expressed in a playful...

977

While I was thinking, I learned...

that the group's English name was LOONA.

983
00:51:07,178 --> 00:51:10,217
So I thought of using the moon.

984
00:51:10,218 --> 00:51:12,117
And I thought of a circle,

985
00:51:12,118 --> 00:51:14,387
Then, I thought it would be a good idea...

986
00:51:14,388 --> 00:51:16,717
to add a hoop, which I've always wanted to learn.

987
00:51:16,718 --> 00:51:20,327

I wanted to show a performance that I'm proud of.

1442
01:13:51,104 --> 01:13:53,502
I thought it would be nice...

1443
01:13:53,503 --> 01:13:56,144
to encourage and motivate each other.

1444
01:13:56,873 --> 01:13:59,983
Now I will announce the team who WJSN thinks...

1445
01:13:59,984 --> 01:14:01,354
as a cut below.

1446
01:14:01,783 --> 01:14:03,653
This is the Cover Song Battle after all.

1447
01:14:03,684 --> 01:14:05,523
I don't think it was as good as the original song.

1448
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:09,224
I liked the musical-like features and setting,

1449
01:14:09,293 --> 01:14:11,564
but it wasn't right for the competition.

1450
01:14:12,594 --> 01:14:18,903
(Kep1er, Brave Girls, and LOONA showed musical-like performances.)

(Nervous)

1455
01:14:24,604 --> 01:14:27,572
The team a cut below WJSN is...

1456
01:14:27,573 --> 01:14:29,912
(The team a cut below WJSN)

1457
01:14:29,913 --> 01:14:31,344
LOONA.

1458
01:14:32,444 --> 01:14:33,743
LOONA.

I thought it would be us.

1461
01:14:40,554 --> 01:14:42,423
Tell us why you chose them.

1462

(Why did they choose WJSN as a cut below them?)

1463
01:14:44,394 --> 01:14:47,792
All the teams did amazing. It was hard to pick.

1464
01:14:47,793 --> 01:14:48,833
But...

1465
01:14:49,793 --> 01:14:51,663
When we dwelled on their performances,

1466
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:55,434
I couldn't think of anything that was memorable.

1467
01:14:56,104 --> 01:14:57,303
I see.

1468
01:14:57,304 --> 01:14:58,373
I'm sorry.

1469

She said it wasn't that memorable.

1470
01:15:01,213 --> 01:15:03,774
Our performance? That can't be right.

1471
01:15:03,814 --> 01:15:06,083
I didn't feel good about it.

1472

(There's a silence in the studio after announcing a cut below.)

1473
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:11,353
All right then. Now...

1474
01:15:11,354 --> 01:15:14,184
This is their first Self-Assessment.

1475
01:15:14,224 --> 01:15:16,053
- It's LOONA. - Us?

1476
01:15:16,054 --> 01:15:17,963
I will announce their Self-Assessment...

1477
01:15:18,424 --> 01:15:20,162
- Us? - result.

1478
01:15:20,163 --> 01:15:21,333
What do we do?

1479
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,893
The team that LOONA thinks as a cut above them is...

(Who is a cut above LOONA?)

I bet they picked one.

as a cut below.

- What do we do? - My gosh.

1491
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:49,224
I was thinking of VIVIZ.

1492
01:15:50,194 --> 01:15:51,424
- I see. - Because...

1493

the setting of their performance...

1494
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:55,163
was similar to that of ours.

1495
01:15:55,363 --> 01:15:57,863
And I think we did a better job.

1496
01:15:58,533 --> 01:15:59,902
I think it's Kep1er.

1497
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:02,474
They showed their cheerful energy.

1498
01:16:02,734 --> 01:16:05,903
But I think we did a better job delivering such energies.

1499
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:10,243
I think they are looking at us. Right?

1500
01:16:11,644 --> 01:16:14,354
They are not looking at anyone else, but us.

1501
01:16:14,413 --> 01:16:15,453
I know.

1502
01:16:15,884 --> 01:16:17,253
I have no idea.

1503
01:16:17,984 --> 01:16:19,684
I really don't want our name to be called.

1504
01:16:20,323 --> 01:16:22,523
The team LOONA picked...

1505
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:24,993
as a cut below them is...

1506
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:26,322
What do we do?

1507
01:16:26,323 --> 01:16:28,194
I don't want to hear it.

1508
01:16:28,594 --> 01:16:29,694
Kep1er.

1509
01:16:30,663 --> 01:16:32,862
- Please. - Kep1er.

(A cut below LOONA, Kep1er)

1511
01:16:38,604 --> 01:16:40,703
Is it supposed to be like this?

1512
01:16:41,444 --> 01:16:43,873
- It's always like this. - I just can't get used to it.

1513
01:16:44,913 --> 01:16:47,383
(Frustrated)

1514
01:16:47,384 --> 01:16:50,513
They had a theme that was similar to ours...

1515
01:16:50,514 --> 01:16:51,783
for their performance.

1516
01:16:52,253 --> 01:16:55,024
They slid around the stage using some props...

1517
01:16:55,054 --> 01:16:57,924
and moved to the thrust stage during the bridge.

1518
01:16:58,123 --> 01:17:00,423
It was also similar that they had the cheerful image.

1519
01:17:00,424 --> 01:17:03,563
But I believe the audience would find...

1520
01:17:03,564 --> 01:17:05,734
our performance more relatable.

1521
01:17:05,804 --> 01:17:09,134
So we thought we were a little better than them.

1522
01:17:09,573 --> 01:17:11,973
A little better than them. I'm sorry for saying this.

1523
01:17:11,974 --> 01:17:15,014
We just picked them because this was our first time.

1524
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:17,412
I understand that they could feel that way.

1525
01:17:17,413 --> 01:17:20,913
- I agree. - We had the same theme.

1526
01:17:21,814 --> 01:17:24,484
I just hope we didn't get the majority votes.

1527
01:17:25,924 --> 01:17:27,923
Now I will announce the Self-Assessment result...

1528
01:17:27,924 --> 01:17:29,723
of Kep1er.

1529
01:17:29,724 --> 01:17:32,194
The team that Kep1er thinks as a cut above them is...

The team that Kep1er thinks as a cut above is...

(Kep1er chose HYOLYN as a cut above them.)

(Did they pick her again?)

A cut above them is...

1534

What do we do? A cut above them?

1535
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:50,343
- I don't think they picked one. - HYOLYN?

1536
01:17:50,344 --> 01:17:51,444
They didn't pick anyone.

1537
01:17:52,184 --> 01:17:53,243
They didn't pick anyone.

1538
01:17:54,554 --> 01:17:57,923
This is a competition. But during the first match,

1539
01:17:57,924 --> 01:17:59,753
we were being too nice.

1540
01:18:00,224 --> 01:18:02,993
I think we should be selfish at least once.

1541
01:18:03,694 --> 01:18:06,463
I understand. This is about points.

1542
01:18:06,764 --> 01:18:08,094
It can't be helped.

1543
01:18:08,663 --> 01:18:11,502
All right then. The team that Kep1er thinks...

1544
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:13,533
as a cut below them is...

(VIVIZ that they picked during the first match?)

1546

What if they picked the same team?

(Kep1er calmly waits for it to be announced.)

1548

They are avoiding our eyes.

1549
01:18:22,474 --> 01:18:26,144
We picked them last time, so I guess they picked us.

1550
01:18:27,184 --> 01:18:29,053
A cut below them is...

- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

refreshing and cheerful.

It could've been better.

HYOLYN is a cut above us.
