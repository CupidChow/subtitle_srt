Despite lacking the skills,

641
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,100
I thought maybe I was being too greedy. I regretted it.

642
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,169
Unlike the other members, my time as a trainee was short.

643
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:00,238
And I'm the type who can dance comfortably on stage...

644
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,649
only once I've fully learned the choreography.

645
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,478
That's why I believe...

646
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:09,620
I should practice far more than the others.

647
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:14,458
Compared to all the things I had to do up until now,

648
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:18,959
I believe dancing with this unit is the hardest task of all.

I may be slow and stuck at times.

651

But I promise to do my best...

652
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:28,638
- It's okay. - so that I won't burden you.

653
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:30,540
- I'll do my best. - Me too.

654
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,479
Do we go in after the count of four?

655
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,448
- What comes after that? - Just lift your leg.

656
00:29:37,449 --> 00:29:40,080
Like this. And then the other way?

657
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:42,119
Do we put our hands here?

658

(She set aside her pride and asked for their help.)

659

I had no time to feel embarrassed.

Don't force them to go up. Make it natural.

671

They just move a bit as you do the body wave.

675

Hikaru was selfless and eager to help me.

676

I was touched by that.

677

Normally, you wouldn't like...

678

a junior to be teaching you.

679
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,718
However, she was very open.

680
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,479
I'm truly thankful for that.

- Right. - We were motivated by you all.

So we're truly glad that you're in our unit.

685

It was truly an honour that we could practice together.

686

- I agree. - Is that so?

687
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:17,750
- This is a rare opportunity. - Right.

688
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,779
Maybe it's because we were a team.

689
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,359
We shared tips with one another...

690
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,059
with no hesitation.

691

Seeing how hard they tried to perfect this stage...

692
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,530
gave me so much confidence and motivation.

693
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:41,039
I don't want people to think, "Why did she join?"

"Why did she join..."

"if she wasn't capable of it?"

I did a bit more than I could.

697
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:51,079
I pushed myself a bit more...

698
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,119
so that I'd exceed their expectations.

699

I truly hope it will show.

Since we'll be performing with seniors,

701

I'm really doing my best so that I can help our unit...

and Yeoreum of WJSN.

801
00:39:35,245 --> 00:39:36,443
(Eunseo and Yeoreum can't hide their nervousness.)

802
00:39:36,444 --> 00:39:39,073
Why are you so tense? You seem more nervous than performing with us.

803
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:42,043
Don't you feel less nervous when you're standing next to HYOLYN?

804
00:39:42,044 --> 00:39:44,244
Earlier, HYOLYN said, "Hey, just believe in me."

805
00:39:44,245 --> 00:39:45,285
"Sure."

806
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,314
(We ardently believe in you, HYOLYN.)

807
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:49,854
- Seriously. - That is so assuring.

808
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:52,055
- You should believe in her. - She's so cool.

(The cool HYOLYN is looking relaxed before her performance.)

810
00:39:55,964 --> 00:40:00,293
Both teams have shown great teamwork since they formed this unit.

811
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:03,534
Are you ready to fall for them, where there's no exit?

812
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:04,835
(Everyone's ready.)

Run the world, Ex-it.

I can't wait.

816
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:17,113
I'm so curious about Eunseo and Yeoreum.

817
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,815
I think they'll be amazing.

Here's our energy.

822
00:40:27,154 --> 00:40:28,193
- Sure. - Take our energy with you.

823
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:29,994
- Okay. - We'll get going now.

They look hip.

830

They're the prettiest.

831
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:47,574
They're already the winners.

HYOLYN has transformed.

840

How could she look so good with yellow eyeshadow?

841
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,694
I agree.

843
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:08,835
She looks so different from when she performed for the vocal unit.

844
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:13,474
Your team name sounds impressive.

845

WJSN's current agency...

is my former agency.

847
00:41:20,274 --> 00:41:23,414
I never thought I'd be seeing the three of them perform together.

848
00:41:23,415 --> 00:41:26,213
We used to be in the same agency, yet we never got to do this,

849
00:41:26,214 --> 00:41:27,355
- but now, they're doing it. - Right.

I think it's been five years since I've been there.

It's been so long,

858

We'll have our final meeting about our concept.

(The theme of Ex-it's performance is "Villain".)

899

We are villains stealing something,

but instead of stealing an object,

901
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,843
I thought we could be stealing hearts.

(The heart-stealing villains, Ex-it)

903

I felt that she was an experienced artist, indeed.

904
00:43:35,944 --> 00:43:39,214
When we saw her performance in the 1st and 2nd matches,

905
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:44,185
my members and I were just amazed by it.

906
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:47,724
I was able to realize while preparing our performance...

907
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,495
that these didn't happen just easily like that.

908

HYOLYN...

909
00:43:52,734 --> 00:43:55,165
I realized that's why people empathized with her.

910
00:43:55,305 --> 00:43:57,504
That's what I learned from her too.

911

Have you ever tried a villain style?

912

- Not a real villain. - Right?

it would be nice if we could show a real villain style.

- That sounds like fun. - I'm looking forward to it.

917
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,254
I'd cringe if I did it myself, but I can do it if it's with you.

We can do it.

Fold them in.

924

We'll be cool villains, that people can't really hate.

A queen among villains.

I want Yeoreum and Eunseo to get responses...

such as "That's Eunseo of WJSN?"...

00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:26,555
Personally,

971
00:46:26,714 --> 00:46:29,554
I think Eunseo and Yeoreum...

972
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:32,793
need to make fiercer looks.

- Got it. - You've got amazing moves,

974

with a destructive image here.

976
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:44,464
I hope you make fiercer looks. Your dancing was good.

Can you dance this part one more time?

When we performed as WJSN,

we've focused on our moves for five years.

980
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:57,384
We had to give off a nostalgic and dreamy vibe when performing.

981
00:46:57,785 --> 00:47:00,515
We've never tried...

982

dancing to hip hop...

983
00:47:02,884 --> 00:47:05,395
or grooving with these kinds of gestures.

984
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:09,794
We needed to emphasize that, so that was a bit challenging.

(Eunseo and Yeoreum try harder because it's new to them.)

986

You shouldn't stay still in this part.

987

- Right. - You have to move as you do it.

Right. I'm just worried I might step on her.

989

No, you won't be stepping on her. I assure you.

990
00:47:25,975 --> 00:47:28,614
- I won't step on you. - I won't be stepped by you.

991
00:47:28,785 --> 00:47:31,085
Try moving backward here.

992
00:47:31,145 --> 00:47:33,613
You go this way, and you won't be stepping on her.

I will never step on you.

that can improve your skills.

1094

Since we have 4,000 points, I'm not afraid anymore.

No, I should just enjoy this.

I shouldn't get too competitive. I should enjoy this.
