I think it'll be okay. It'll be cool.

809
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:40,572
It'd be nice if we could get this vibe down on stage

810
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:41,744
(The key is how good they portray it.)

811
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:44,572
I was really worried,

812
00:32:44,573 --> 00:32:46,343
but I suddenly gained confidence.

813
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:49,852
To be honest, nobody wanted this song.

814
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:50,953
Right.

815
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:53,782
Wouldn't it be cooler if we came in first with that kind of song?

816
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:54,822
Right.

817
00:32:54,823 --> 00:32:56,653
- I'm so excited all of a sudden. - Same.

818
00:32:56,654 --> 00:32:58,224
- I think it'll be fun. - So weird!

819
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:00,623
(Ten minutes before the interim checkup)

820
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:02,964
(Oh, no!)

821
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:04,333
(Will we be able to do the interim checkup?)

822
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:06,363
(What should I do about this?)

823
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:08,674
(What happened to them?)

824
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:10,832
Should we try to learn the choreography?

825
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:13,004
Should we study it?

826
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:17,743
(Someone is walking towards them.)

827
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:20,713
I think that's what we have to do.

828
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:23,353
- We have to... - If not...

829
00:33:25,484 --> 00:33:28,852
(Monika, the choreographer of "Envious" appears.)

830
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,323
- No way. - What is this?

831
00:33:30,994 --> 00:33:34,224
- Nice to meet you! - Hello.

832
00:33:34,924 --> 00:33:36,193
- Oh, my. - We...

833
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:38,633
- Were you watching the video? - Yes.

834
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:40,802
- It's so cool. - It really is.

835
00:33:40,803 --> 00:33:42,073
(It's true.)

836
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:46,244
It's the most basic concept to the theme "Envious".

837
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:50,713
I looked for a concept that everyone could understand.

838
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:55,313
I would like you to portray the classic vibe...

839
00:33:55,984 --> 00:34:00,153
to become a team that is known for your talent.

840
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:01,823
Sounds amazing. Right.

841
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:05,993
When Monika came into the practice studio,

842
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:09,532
it was an honor to be able to learn this choreography...

843
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:12,333
from such an amazing dancer. I was really happy.

844
00:34:12,334 --> 00:34:13,363
But...

845
00:34:13,503 --> 00:34:15,474
(Screaming)

846
00:34:15,573 --> 00:34:18,543
- Hold on. - I'm getting a cramp!

847
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:20,342
(Screaking)

848
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:23,573
The stretching itself was really hard.

849
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:25,483
(The warm-up stretching was difficult.)

850
00:34:25,783 --> 00:34:28,713
(The practice studio is filled with screaming.)

851
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:30,283
(She covers her mouth.)

852
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:33,823
(Meanwhile, )

853
00:34:33,923 --> 00:34:36,353
(Eunji from Brave Girls is the top student.)

854
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:38,692
- You look like a mollusk. - I do?

855
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:40,393
Push down the tip of your toes.

856
00:34:40,394 --> 00:34:42,092
Oh, my. You're so flexible.

857
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,192
(Eunji's toes are on point too.)

858
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:45,363
I'm envious.

859
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:48,604
To be honest, I majored in modern dance.

860
00:34:49,274 --> 00:34:50,502
That's amazing.

861
00:34:50,503 --> 00:34:52,974
I love it.

862
00:34:54,244 --> 00:34:57,974
(She does difficult moves perfectly with her flexibility.)

863
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:05,624
To be honest, there are moves that are similar to what I studied,

864
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:09,993
so I thought this choreography was perfect for me.

865
00:35:09,994 --> 00:35:12,363
With cat hands, rotate it towards the ceiling. One.

866
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:15,834
Cross your hand over and pull the other hand out.

867
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,064
Eight...

868
00:35:18,294 --> 00:35:20,132
and a two.

869
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:22,033
(Lay down and wipe the floor.)

870
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:25,273
Meow and stretch.

871
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:28,613
Turn it around and show the triangle.

872
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:30,544
Your left hand goes in.

873
00:35:31,414 --> 00:35:34,083
Then do a split.

874
00:35:34,084 --> 00:35:35,252
(It gets harder.)

875
00:35:35,253 --> 00:35:37,353
This is so hard. Oh, no.

876
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:40,224
You memorized it, so I'll watch. Let's try it.

877
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:41,994
(They continue practicing.)

(They practice the choreography according to the beat.)

Until there.

880
00:35:47,494 --> 00:35:48,733
Again.

881
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:52,463
I'd like each movement to look cool.

(Monika explained where the hands go.)

883
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,902
(Olivia Hye's hands are still awkward.)

884
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:02,842
You have to cross, cross, and cross again...

885
00:36:02,843 --> 00:36:05,072
for your body to spin around better.

886
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:06,212
- Okay. - Okay.

887
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:07,383
From the top.

888

(They try it again.)

Gosh, my socks...

890
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:15,052
If your hands move but your body doesn't,

891
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:16,623
it'll look like a kid's routine.

892
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:18,624
- Okay. We can do it. - You can do it.

893
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:20,624
Five, six, seven, eight.

- Focus. - Okay.

898
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,934
Right. Everyone focus.

899
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:35,313
Would you like some water?

900

- Yes. - You might pass out.

- You can do it. - Thank you.

902

(Nervous)

904
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:48,184
- How long? - It's been over ten years.

905
00:36:48,354 --> 00:36:51,224
To be honest, I can look in your eyes...

906
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:52,893
and know if you want to do it.

907
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:55,732
If you're just here for the sake of it, I'm sorry about this.

908
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:57,362
But I'm not here for the sake of it.

909
00:36:57,363 --> 00:36:58,803
- Right. - Right.

910
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:01,263
Let's put some tension in your bodies.

911
00:37:01,264 --> 00:37:04,403
You're losing focus, and your body doesn't want to do it.

912
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:06,204
- Bring up your energy. - Okay.

913
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:09,843
Even while I was receiving a lesson from Monika,

914
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:12,982
I think I was rejecting "Envious".

915
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:14,583
I was wondering how I ended up here.

916
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:16,353
I couldn't focus...

917
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:18,113
because of that thought.

918
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:21,652
I have so much pride in my job.

919
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:23,893
- Yes. - I'm doing this with all my heart.

920
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:25,822
- Yes. - I made this whole-heartedly.

921
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:26,894
Okay.

922
00:37:27,064 --> 00:37:30,133
After I heard that, I was determined to do my best.

923
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:31,794
Ready.

924
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:34,302
Don't forget to point your toes.

925
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:37,172
- You have to look like a cat. - Okay.

926
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,203
That's right.

927
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:40,942
What you did slowly right now should be sped up.

928
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:42,113
Okay.

929
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:45,244
Seven eight. One and two and three and...

930
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:47,244
Again.

That's right. Again.

(Monica and the members give their best.)

942
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:15,843
One.

943
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:19,982
First of all, my choreography isn't that hard.

944
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:21,942
- Yes. - You just need practice.

945
00:38:21,943 --> 00:38:23,913
You need to practice a lot.

946
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:26,383
How many times do you think you need to practice?

947
00:38:26,524 --> 00:38:30,193
I've never thought of a specific number for practice.

948
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:33,264
You say that because you have never done it.

949
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:35,434
Yes.

950
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:37,893
Make it to 100 from the start.

951
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:38,933
- Okay. - Did you get it?

952
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,233
- Got it. - Got it.

953
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:41,704
You should be the best.

954
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,173
- Why are you crying? - I don't know.

955
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:47,072
You have to be the best, okay?

956
00:38:47,073 --> 00:38:48,303
- Okay. - You can do it.

957

- In 1, 2, 3. - Let's do this!

Okay. Keep going. Good luck!

- I haven't felt this in a while. - Me too.

Honestly speaking, she could just teach us and leave.

966

if anyone has ever led us...

with this much passion...

2238
01:35:55,874 --> 01:35:57,904
Your voice sounds thick...

2239
01:35:57,905 --> 01:35:59,744
so it sounds like a symphony.

2240
01:36:01,574 --> 01:36:04,315
I'm usually not like that. I'll try that again.

2241
01:36:09,824 --> 01:36:11,185
(That is liberating.)

(Amazed)

2243
01:36:13,124 --> 01:36:14,254
I think the speakers will break.

2244
01:36:15,395 --> 01:36:16,423
(Their youngest member has such a powerful voice.)

2245
01:36:16,424 --> 01:36:17,664
That was shocking.

2246
01:36:18,365 --> 01:36:19,365
- I like it. - I like it.

2247
01:36:19,366 --> 01:36:20,865
- This is it. - Is it?

2248
01:36:21,034 --> 01:36:22,133
It's hard.

2249
01:36:22,134 --> 01:36:25,503
Yeonjung is known for her powerful voice.

2250
01:36:25,504 --> 01:36:28,333
It's very refreshing to hear.

2251
01:36:28,334 --> 01:36:30,043
That's the type of voice she has,

2252
01:36:30,044 --> 01:36:31,744
so I'm not worried about her at all.

She looks quite nervous.

2256
01:36:42,454 --> 01:36:43,624
It's understandable.

2257
01:36:45,555 --> 01:36:49,524
WJSN members didn't have that many chances...

2258
01:36:49,525 --> 01:36:51,095
to show off their singing abilities.

2259
01:36:53,494 --> 01:36:55,533
(Due to having so many members in her group, )

(Soobin wasn't able to sing that much on stage.)

2261
01:37:00,405 --> 01:37:03,974
I believe this is my chance to prove myself.

We'll start from there.

This is the hardest part.

2269

(Soobin's part has a higher key.)

(What should I do?)

2274
01:37:33,105 --> 01:37:35,503
The key to this song is pretty high.

2275
01:37:35,504 --> 01:37:38,774
Yeonjung was mainly the one who sang...

2276
01:37:38,775 --> 01:37:41,414
all the high parts of our songs.

2277
01:37:41,544 --> 01:37:43,384
So it wasn't easy to sing that part.

2278
01:37:43,584 --> 01:37:45,684
You sound intimidated when you sing this part.

2279
01:37:45,685 --> 01:37:47,654
Let's do it again.

2280
01:37:47,655 --> 01:37:48,714
Okay.

2281

Gosh.

2282
01:37:51,454 --> 01:37:53,155
It's okay. What matters is that you're confident.

(She struggles to get the notes right.)

You can do better.

(She's disappointed in herself.)

2287
01:38:04,865 --> 01:38:07,674
- Okay. - I was so frustrated.

2288
01:38:07,775 --> 01:38:10,573
Some people in the audience may be seeing me for the first time.

2289
01:38:10,574 --> 01:38:12,644
That's why I don't want to make any mistakes.

2290
01:38:12,645 --> 01:38:15,145
I want to excel.

(She has jotted down many things on her paper.)

01:38:24,824 --> 01:38:27,124
This is proof of her hard work.

2294

I need to take extra care of my throat...

for this performance.

2296
01:38:32,735 --> 01:38:35,534
That's why I've always been wrapping my neck.

2297
01:38:35,634 --> 01:38:39,534
We have only a week left, so I'm very nervous.

and the way I sing...

2304
01:39:03,725 --> 01:39:05,794
through this upcoming performance.

2305
01:39:06,865 --> 01:39:11,405
When were you the happiest as a singer?

2306
01:39:11,905 --> 01:39:16,044
Recently, we had a meet-and-greet. It had been a while.

2307
01:39:16,105 --> 01:39:18,845
We hadn't been on stage in a long time too.

2308
01:39:18,945 --> 01:39:21,074
So I became really emotional.

01:39:22,115 --> 01:39:25,515
(She felt true happiness while performing that day.)

2310

"This was what I wanted to do the most."

2311
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:35,555
I feel happiest when I'm singing and dancing...

2312
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:37,565
on stage.

2313
01:39:40,235 --> 01:39:42,703
We will try...

2314
01:39:42,704 --> 01:39:44,934
to melt their cold hearts...

2315
01:39:44,935 --> 01:39:49,074
and make them feel emotional.

2316
01:40:01,147 --> 01:40:02,418
That's a pretty swing.

2317
01:40:03,017 --> 01:40:04,647
She looks like a spring princess.

2318
01:40:04,717 --> 01:40:07,087
They could be a tough match.

2319
01:40:07,088 --> 01:40:09,048
I'm worried our vibes will be too similar.

They were like flowers singing.

2344
01:45:04,477 --> 01:45:07,016
Soobin seemed professional.

2345

The back part of her dress was long.

2346

When the fan was blowing, she moved her dress to the side.

- She was outstanding. - She was so professional.

Minyoung had trouble singing.

- I'm curious... - How she'll do?

01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:25,011
How she'll do today.

(Her throat wasn't doing too well during the interim checkup.)

This was my first time singing this. I'm sorry.

At first,

2404

I didn't know she was in such bad condition.

2405

But she was coughing so much.

(Coughing)

2407

You keep coughing.

The after-effects of COVID-19 are just too serious.

My throat is very unstable right now.

2410
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:55,970
She must've been very worried...

2411
01:47:55,971 --> 01:47:57,909
due to her throat's condition.

2412
01:47:57,910 --> 01:48:00,651
I didn't know this and asked if she could sing higher.

2413

I felt terrible.

Let's adjust the key according to your condition.

I have barely any confidence right now.

2416
01:48:08,521 --> 01:48:11,090
And my condition wasn't that good...

2417

to begin with.

2418
01:48:13,431 --> 01:48:15,960
So I felt even more pressured.

2419
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,261
If she lacked confidence,

2420
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:22,571
I wanted to help out and support her.

Hello.

How's your throat?

I just hope I don't cough.

I think it's all in your head.

Stop worrying about coughing. Just think that you won't cough.

2426
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:41,050
I won't cough.

2427

- You need to hypnotize yourself. - Right.

- I'm fine. - "I couldn't be better."

It didn't get any better

2438
01:49:08,311 --> 01:49:11,450
Do you think we're singing too fast or too slow?

2439
01:49:11,521 --> 01:49:13,390
We could go slower.

2440
01:49:13,391 --> 01:49:17,021
The lyrics are too sad that we become very emotional.

2441
01:49:17,191 --> 01:49:19,290
I think the original song is too fast for us.

2442
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:20,561
I agree.

(She braces herself and sings once again.)

2444

You don't need to follow the original key.

You can just follow...

your emotions and sing.

- Me too. - The lyrics themselves...

Don't feel pressured about doing well.

Don't worry about making mistakes.

Because of your responsibilities.

is when I'm singing.

2715
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:10,230
I want to see a good result.

2716
02:06:10,231 --> 02:06:11,369
If not, don't come home.

2717
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:13,670
Okay. I had a great time with you.

2718
02:06:13,771 --> 02:06:16,311
I don't know if we'll meet again, but that's okay.

2719
02:06:16,410 --> 02:06:18,180
Do you think you'll be able to re-enter the green room?

2720
02:06:18,181 --> 02:06:19,680
I think I can.

2721
02:06:19,681 --> 02:06:21,111
I have these girls.

2722
02:06:23,011 --> 02:06:27,080
- Here is the result. - Gosh.

2723
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:28,789
Gosh.

2724
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:30,390
- What should I do? - What should I do?

2725
02:06:30,391 --> 02:06:31,720
Look at it first.

2726
02:06:31,721 --> 02:06:33,560
- Let me since I'm the leader. - Sure.

2727
02:06:33,561 --> 02:06:35,830
- Don't tell us, though. - Oh, dear!

2728
02:06:36,431 --> 02:06:37,460
(What?)

2729
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,530
Should we just go home?

2730
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,630
It's either really good or really bad.

2731
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,169
Let's be indifferent...

2732
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:47,770
- about the result. - Okay.

2733
02:06:47,771 --> 02:06:50,739
I think you'll worry about it the most.

2734
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:52,909
"What did you say was the result?" I could be like this.

2735
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:54,110
(People who say that tend to be the most sensitive.)

2736
02:06:54,111 --> 02:06:56,350
I hate these moments the most.

2737
02:06:56,351 --> 02:06:58,220
- Can you predict the result? - What should I do?

2738
02:06:58,221 --> 02:06:59,351
Should I look at it first?

2739
02:06:59,551 --> 02:07:00,620
Yes.

2740
02:07:02,821 --> 02:07:05,160
(She shows the result nonchalantly.)

2741
02:07:05,290 --> 02:07:07,191
(Why is she smiling?)

2742

(They return after learning of the result.)

2743
02:07:09,490 --> 02:07:11,601
(They applaud them.)

2744
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:14,369
Well done, Sun and Moon.

2745
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:16,700
- Sit here. - Good work.

2746
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,839
Well done.

2747
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:21,441
- Good work. - You did a good job.

2748
02:07:22,141 --> 02:07:23,169
(I'm here.)

2749
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:25,181
Eunha!

2750
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:27,011
Did you do well?

2751
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:30,709
I guess so. I predicted the result.

2752
02:07:30,710 --> 02:07:31,820
Really?

2753
02:07:31,821 --> 02:07:36,321
This is a result that we've never gotten before.

2754
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:38,659
(A ranking they've never gotten before?)

2755
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:39,789
(Could it be 1st place?)

2756
02:07:39,790 --> 02:07:41,561
Right, since we never got to even third place.

2757
02:07:42,231 --> 02:07:43,489
- What's the result? - That's why it's more shocking.

2758
02:07:43,490 --> 02:07:44,900
- Come on. - That's why.

2759
02:07:44,901 --> 02:07:47,529
- Should I show them right now? - She seems to be in a good mood.

2760
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:49,971
- Me? - I think it's a poker face.

2761
02:07:50,700 --> 02:07:52,101
She's hiding something behind her smile.

2762
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:54,410
(The result will be revealed!)

2763
02:07:54,870 --> 02:07:56,540
(No way.)

2764
02:07:56,641 --> 02:07:58,210
I was terrified before opening it.

2765
02:07:59,210 --> 02:08:01,910
(She reveals the result.)

2769
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:22,529
(I really worried a lot...)

2770
02:08:22,530 --> 02:08:24,700
(because this was something I've never done.)

(But I also perform on stage just like you guys do.)

(I want you to think like this when you're on the stage.)

(Galaxy Embracing the Universe is done performing.)

2780

You have to press number two.

Okay!

2782
02:09:49,551 --> 02:09:50,620
