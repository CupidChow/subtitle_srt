deserve that kind of evaluation.

970
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,240
This is going to be a nerve-racking assessment.

971
00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:54,301
Everyone's here.

972
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:55,910
What's going on here?

973
00:38:55,911 --> 00:38:57,040
Is today the finals?

Hi, I'm MIYEON of (G)I-dle.

976
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,309
I feel very nervous as I'm sitting here.

977
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,309
As someone who has experienced "Queendom",

978
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,080
I send my support to the participants.

979
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:09,321
- Good luck. - All right.

980
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,050
This reminds me of three years ago,

981
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:15,160
and my memories of back then are rekindled.

982
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:17,090
I'll be rooting for them all. Good luck!

(We got your support.)

984
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:21,700
We have two AOA members, who must have special memories...

985
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,870
of today's mission, the Cover Song Battle.

986
00:39:24,871 --> 00:39:27,471
Hello, I'm Hyejeong of AOA.

987
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,269
Didn't AOA perform...

988
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,109
- a really amazing cover song? - You're right.

989
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,210
Yes, they were the best.

990
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:36,910
It was very memorable.

991
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:38,249
A lot of people loved it,

992
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,189
and we had really put in a lot of thought on the performance.

993
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,689
Though it may not be their own song,

994
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,160
I hope the participants of Queendom 2...

995
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:49,729
show different charms they have.

996
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,931
And I'm looking forward to watching them.

997
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,559
We also have The BOYZ and PENTAGON...

998
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,830
here with us.

999
00:39:54,831 --> 00:39:57,571
Hello, I'm Sun Woo of The BOYZ.

1000
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,339
We're not here to assess,

1001
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,039
but I think we will be able to witness...

1002
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,109
how hard they've worked and how much effort they've put in.

1003
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,749
This feels like an end-of-the-year awards ceremony.

1004
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,780
I agree.

1005
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:12,350
I think they'll feel nervous as well...

1006
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:13,979
because they've been through this.

1007
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,551
They'll empathize with us.

1008
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,749
How can we become the ending fairies...

1009
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,359
- in front of experts like them? - How can we?

1010
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,660
They've been through this all.

1011
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:24,229
- I bet they're rooting for us all. - Right.

1012
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,899
- I bet they'll have high standards. - Right.

(Worried)

1014

Before we start the match,

1015
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:33,440
we are joined by this group, who cannot be missed from Queendom.

1016
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:35,740
Shall we meet our global judges...

1017
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,140
who are sending their messages from all over the world?

1018

(The sounds of the cheers used on Queendom 2 were recorded.)

1019
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,580
This cheer is quite addictive.

1020
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:47,220
This keeps ringing in my head when I go home.

(Grateful cheers that liven the atmosphere)

1022

Queendom 2 is joined not only by global supporters...

1023
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,089
but also global viewers...

1024
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,860
with all our global fans.

1025

Now, shall we start the 2nd match of Queendom 2?

1026

- Run the World, Queendom! - Queendom!

(The 2nd match is finally starting.)

1028

It's finally starting for real.

1029

- Queendom! - Queendom!

1030

(Finally starting)

1031
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,781
My gosh.

1032
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,019
WJSN must already be on standby.

1033
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,080
(That's making me nervous.)

1034
00:41:21,081 --> 00:41:22,249
That's possible.

1035
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,520
I should cheer with this.

1036
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,660
- Sounds good. - You can do it, WJSN!

1037
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:27,359
Good luck, WJSN!

1038

Oh, my gosh!

- Girls, it's okay. - We can't help it now.

1047
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:49,898
- We're already here. - Let's go.

1048
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,466
- Let's wait for them. - I wonder if they'll hear us cheer.

1049
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:54,327
- You're right. - They'll probably be too busy.

1050
00:41:54,668 --> 00:41:55,668
Oh, my gosh.

1051
00:41:55,669 --> 00:41:58,167
- This is unbelievable. - Good luck!

1052

Honey, break a leg!

1053

We heard you loud and clear.

1054

- Good luck. - You can do it!

1055
00:42:04,677 --> 00:42:07,076
- You must be nervous. - They're the first to perform.

1056
00:42:07,077 --> 00:42:09,276
- It's not easy to go first. - I think...

1057
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,878
they'll do great.

1058
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:16,458
(WJSN chose the cover song by themselves.)

1059
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:18,557
- What about us? - Choose us.

1060
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:20,728
(A vigorous wooing)

1061
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,157
We really have a lot of songs.

1062
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:28,127
(WJSN chose to go against VIVIZ after their strong proposal.)

1063
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,398
(This is exciting.)

1064
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:31,838
All right!

1065
00:42:31,938 --> 00:42:34,568
VIVIZ really asked us vigorously,

1066
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:36,608
and it made me feel good.

1067
00:42:36,978 --> 00:42:38,877
So before we choose any song,

1068
00:42:38,878 --> 00:42:41,507
I think we need to discuss our priorities first.

1069
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:44,777
I think it has to be a song that we know.

1070
00:42:44,818 --> 00:42:46,616
- The popularity is important. - Yes, the familiarity.

1071
00:42:46,617 --> 00:42:47,987
In my opinion,

1072
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,517
one of the reasons why HYOLYN got...

1073
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:52,588
a good reaction during the on-site voting...

1074
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:55,026
is because people knew the song,

1075
00:42:55,027 --> 00:42:56,526
and it really livened up the atmosphere.

1076
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:58,157
- That's a big influence. - Right.

1077
00:42:58,927 --> 00:43:00,426
But more than anything,

1078
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:04,498
I think we need a concept that really suits us.

1079
00:43:04,597 --> 00:43:08,237
So I spent the whole night thinking what would go well with us.

1080
00:43:08,507 --> 00:43:10,777
(SOOBIN prepared a presentation during the first match.)

1081
00:43:10,878 --> 00:43:13,346
(This is what a graduate student is like.)

1082
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:15,006
I thought about it all night.

1083
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:16,318
No, you didn't do it all night.

1084
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:17,576
Secretary Chu, get my materials.

1085
00:43:17,577 --> 00:43:18,947
Let the materials come in.

1086
00:43:19,288 --> 00:43:20,986
(Here it is.)

1087
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:23,558
- Gradation. - You made it nicely this time.

1088
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:27,058
The début song of VIVIZ is "BOP BOP!"

1089
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:29,426
When we think about their group,

1090
00:43:29,427 --> 00:43:32,827
I think "BOP BOP!' really reminds us of the group, so I added it here.

1091
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,596
Second, VIVIZ was...

1092
00:43:35,597 --> 00:43:37,938
- GFRIEND previously. - Right.

1093
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:46,378
(GFRIEND had many hit songs, along with their début song "Glass Bead".)

1094
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:49,116
But they really have a lot of great songs.

1095
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:51,517
Fortunately, almost everyone knows...

1096
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:54,187
- GFRIEND's songs. - They know it all.

1097
00:43:54,188 --> 00:43:56,386
When we were trainees,

1098
00:43:56,387 --> 00:43:58,587
we trained with their songs.

1099
00:43:58,588 --> 00:44:00,486
- That's right. - Luda's audition song...

1100
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:01,826
- was "Glass Bead". - That's right!

1101
00:44:01,827 --> 00:44:02,827
Me too.

1102
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:05,026
(Here's baby Luda.)

1103
00:44:05,027 --> 00:44:07,797
(Luda achieved her dream through GFRIEND's song.)

1104
00:44:07,827 --> 00:44:10,538
(Good luck to the members in choosing the song.)

1105
00:44:11,038 --> 00:44:14,268
If I were to choose the song that suits us, it'd be "NAVILLERA".

1106
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:17,237
I'm leaning towards "NAVILLERA" and "Glass Bead".

1107
00:44:18,308 --> 00:44:21,507
I've never felt chills by watching music videos of other artists,

1108
00:44:21,748 --> 00:44:23,817
but watching "NAVILLERA" really gave me the chills.

1109
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:26,117
That's why I prepared this. Let's watch it right away.

1110
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:28,347
They look young.

1111
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:30,958
(WJSN will be performing our song?)

1112
00:44:31,558 --> 00:44:33,858
I feel like I'm replaying their happy moments.

1113
00:44:34,387 --> 00:44:35,426
About youth.

1114
00:44:35,427 --> 00:44:36,427
- Yes. - Right!

1115
00:44:36,428 --> 00:44:38,597
- Why is this making me sad? - Me too. Why is this sad?

1116
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:40,197
This is making me teary too.

1117
00:44:41,427 --> 00:44:44,796
(GFRIEND's music makes them nostalgic of the old days.)

1118
00:44:44,797 --> 00:44:48,067
If we make a good arrangement, I think we can make this song ours.

1119
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:51,307
If we add a twist and plan a majestic impact...

1120
00:44:51,308 --> 00:44:53,947
to add to our arrangements, I think we'll have a chance.

1121
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:58,047
Because the music video lingered on our minds,

1122
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,187
we thought that other people must've felt...

1123
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:03,058
what we felt,

1124
00:45:03,157 --> 00:45:07,027
and it was a song where we could really show our identity.

1125
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:10,227
But the original song has...

1126
00:45:10,228 --> 00:45:13,026
a very strong impression, so it's a bit of a burden for us.

1127
00:45:13,027 --> 00:45:16,096
When a song is popular, it means it's familiar,

1128

- but that can be disadvantageous. - Right.

1129
00:45:19,097 --> 00:45:22,907
It's our job to mesmerise the listeners.

1130
00:45:23,438 --> 00:45:26,347
Anyway, we went through a lot of things in the first match.

1131
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,177
Did you all get a good mental recovery?

1132

What I felt after the first match...

1140
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:51,768
is that the time we spent wasn't in vain.

1141
00:45:51,797 --> 00:45:52,838
That's a relief.

1142
00:45:52,907 --> 00:45:56,208
I prepared something for you all, since you all must be exhausted.

She's not the type to prepare anything.

(Here's the broken hourglass.)

1148
00:46:11,588 --> 00:46:13,157
We were really devastated because of this,

1149
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:15,927
- but we can laugh about it now. - So why did you bring that here?

1150
00:46:15,998 --> 00:46:18,327
- So... - Why would you bring that?

1151
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:20,167
- Why? - I was curious about that too.

1152
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:22,427
- Why did you bring that? - We should remember...

1153
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:23,998
this hourglass in our hearts.

1154
00:46:25,668 --> 00:46:29,277
I wanted to say that we should renew our hearts in preparing the next,

1155
00:46:29,878 --> 00:46:30,938
that's why I brought this.

1156
00:46:31,507 --> 00:46:34,406
I don't know if you remember, but when the members were crying,

1157
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,847
I said that we should turn our crisis into chance.

1158
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:40,217
Our group always stands back up after facing adversities.

1159
00:46:40,887 --> 00:46:43,188
Let's use this...

1160
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:45,057
to create something new in the second match.

1161
00:46:45,058 --> 00:46:46,926
We might come up with a better performance.

1162
00:46:46,927 --> 00:46:47,958
That's right.

1163
00:46:48,657 --> 00:46:51,997
We were determined to turn our crisis into chance,

1164
00:46:51,998 --> 00:46:55,228
so we thought of using the broken hourglass to create a story.

1165
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:58,067
We also thought about how we can...

1166

deliver that message.

1167

From crisis to chance!

1168

I brought some props.

- Props! - Our company is sensitive.

- It says, "Please don't touch." - "Please don't touch."

You better watch out if you touch this.

1172

00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:27,367
My confidence is very low right now.

1283
00:52:29,197 --> 00:52:32,297
- Yeoreum, you need to do this well. - Yes.

1284
00:52:32,438 --> 00:52:34,437
You need to burst the energy...

1285
00:52:34,438 --> 00:52:37,207
for the whole performance to intensify.

1286
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:38,576
I've never danced alone.

1287
00:52:38,577 --> 00:52:41,407
It's my first time to be spotlighted.

1288
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:42,608
I'm pressured.

1289
00:52:42,808 --> 00:52:45,576
- Consider this as your explosion. - Yes. Here.

1290
00:52:45,577 --> 00:52:46,647
This is your only chance.

1291
00:52:46,648 --> 00:52:48,588
You don't know when you'll do a solo dance again. Right?

1292
00:52:52,887 --> 00:52:53,986
Is it here?

1293
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:57,057
- That move makes it hard to see. - Yes.

1294
00:52:57,058 --> 00:52:59,127
You need to show with bigger movements.

1295
00:52:59,128 --> 00:53:00,397
Your body is facing too much in the middle.

1296
00:53:00,398 --> 00:53:02,667
I think you're right.

1297
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:05,537
- This rotating move... - Yes.

1298
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:07,507
Is something that I've never tried.

1299
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:10,977
- Rotating at this height... - Yes.

1300
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:13,906
Is different with moving your upper body downwards.

1301
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:16,417
- Then move your head. - Like this.

1302
00:53:16,418 --> 00:53:17,817
Yes.

1303
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:19,546
- I think this is far better. - Yes.

1304
00:53:19,547 --> 00:53:20,547
- Yes, here. - It feels right.

He gave me private lessons.

1306
00:53:25,088 --> 00:53:26,958
I was very touched by that.

00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:30,628
(Yeoreum constantly practiced her solo performance.)

1308
00:53:30,898 --> 00:53:35,767
It's been only 2 to 3 years since I've become the main dancer.

1309
00:53:35,768 --> 00:53:39,467
There weren't many opportunities for me to show my dancing skills.

1310
00:53:39,938 --> 00:53:44,308
I think that's why I'm working so hard.

1311
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:53,117
I'm still a bit unfamiliar with the moves using my knees.

1312
00:53:54,217 --> 00:53:56,588
I think I need to practice more.

1313
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:02,886
I want to take this opportunity...

1314
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:04,796
to remind the public that...

1315
00:54:04,797 --> 00:54:07,967
Yeoreum of WJSN is a good dancer.

1316
00:54:12,297 --> 00:54:16,607
I want to have a good results and impress the public even more.

1317
00:54:16,608 --> 00:54:18,708
I thought about this many times.

1318
00:54:19,338 --> 00:54:21,478
I want to perform proudly in front of everyone.

1319
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,716
The mistakes we made during the first match was our driving force...

1320
00:54:24,717 --> 00:54:27,116
to prepare the second match with a stronger heart.

1321
00:54:27,117 --> 00:54:30,288
So we'll show you everything on this stage today.

1322

- They're performing. - It's starting.

1323
00:54:48,637 --> 00:54:49,977
Which song did they choose?

1324
00:54:49,978 --> 00:54:52,107
Maybe GFRIEND's song.

1325
00:54:52,108 --> 00:54:53,447
I'm really looking forward to it.

- It's amazing. - What should we do?

1349

It's great that they came up with putting the powder in on stage.

1355
01:00:21,308 --> 01:00:25,207
The song they chose, "NAVILLERA", was already shocking.

1356
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:30,047
The direction of the arrangement was also unexpected.

1357

So it was interesting to watch.

1358
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:36,386
Yeoreum performed her solo part so well in a powerful manner.

1359

She's definitely known to be a great dancer.

She danced very well since she was a trainee.

Until now, we only danced our album-based choreography.

1367

We didn't have many chances...

to show other forms of more intense dances.

So I was disappointed,

Everyone has different symptoms.

1601
01:09:25,247 --> 01:09:28,886
When we heard that the first round will commence without us,

1602
01:09:28,887 --> 01:09:31,916
it was impossible for us to be disappointed.

1603
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:35,728
I felt guilty and thought if it was my fault.

1604
01:09:36,427 --> 01:09:37,927
It's like a jinx.

1605
01:09:38,028 --> 01:09:40,496
When we released our album after a long time,

1606
01:09:40,497 --> 01:09:43,926
the pandemic happened.

1607
01:09:43,927 --> 01:09:47,238
We had to stop performing after a week as we had to quarantine.

1608
01:09:47,368 --> 01:09:50,006
- We had many hardships like this. - I see.

1609
01:09:50,007 --> 01:09:52,807
So I thought if it was our jinx.

1610
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:55,706
We have good and bad things happening in our lives.

1611
01:09:55,707 --> 01:09:57,077
- Right. - When that happens,

1612
01:09:57,078 --> 01:09:59,176
consider that you have more stairs to climb...

1613
01:09:59,177 --> 01:10:02,086
as deep as you've fallen.

1614
01:10:02,087 --> 01:10:04,988
- Then the slump won't be too hard. - Right.

1615
01:10:09,658 --> 01:10:12,727
We had about a year with nothing on our schedule.

1616
01:10:12,728 --> 01:10:15,768
I think it was the hardest time for me.

But there was nothing to do in the studio.

1622
01:10:37,717 --> 01:10:42,487
If I was a trainee, I would have a monthly assessment.

1623
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,528
But we didn't have anything like that...

1624
01:10:44,597 --> 01:10:47,568
and we didn't have songs to practice.

1625
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:51,137
I sat in the practice studio,

1626

and practiced singing.

1627
01:10:53,368 --> 01:10:54,807
I thought,

But the reality was different.

So I was frustrated on my own.

she said that again. "Choerry, we will be on Queendom."

- No. Not this one. - Pick another song.

1916
01:27:39,278 --> 01:27:41,907
- I can do well. - I can't picture you guys...

1917
01:27:41,908 --> 01:27:44,808
- Are you underestimating me? - Hold on.

1918
01:27:44,847 --> 01:27:46,876
I thought we joined this show...

1919
01:27:46,877 --> 01:27:50,647
to show a new side of us.

1920
01:27:50,648 --> 01:27:52,018
But that's too new.

1921
01:27:52,318 --> 01:27:53,887
(This is too much to handle.)

1922
01:27:54,587 --> 01:27:57,627
- What should we do? - Do I look that bad?

1923
01:27:58,328 --> 01:27:59,957
I'm still sad about it.

1924
01:28:00,457 --> 01:28:02,898
But I decided to listen to them.

1925
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:04,097
"MVSK".

1926

("MVSK" by Kep1er)

(It contains a modern beat and shows their maturity.)

1928
01:28:10,568 --> 01:28:15,036
They give off a femme fatale vibe.

1929

- They look completely different. - You're right.

1930
01:28:16,948 --> 01:28:18,477
- I like this one. - Me too.

1931
01:28:18,478 --> 01:28:21,078
Rearranging the song is the issue.

1932
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:26,358
(Fourteen days before the match, day of recording)

(two weeks before the match.)

1937
01:28:35,927 --> 01:28:38,697
We spoke on the phone earlier,

1938

and they didn't sound good at all.

1939

This is our first day in quarantine.

1940
01:28:44,837 --> 01:28:47,677
My voice is pretty much gone.

1941
01:28:49,207 --> 01:28:52,078
This is bad. My voice is gone.

1942
01:28:52,448 --> 01:28:55,188
We need to record and create our choreography...

1943

as soon as we get out.

1944

But my voice is gone.

1945
01:29:03,427 --> 01:29:05,197
I'm truly worried.

1946
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:09,828
Let's see. Once our quarantine is over...

1947
01:29:11,427 --> 01:29:14,738
We only have 6 to 7 days to practice.

1948
01:29:17,108 --> 01:29:19,507
I'm not sure if I can do well.

1949
01:29:20,108 --> 01:29:21,907
To be honest, I panicked.

1950
01:29:21,908 --> 01:29:25,216
Given everyone's condition,

1951
01:29:25,217 --> 01:29:27,876
it was pretty much impossible.

1952
01:29:27,877 --> 01:29:30,087
But we never give up.

1953
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:32,886
The only reason we came this far...

1954
01:29:32,887 --> 01:29:35,286
and made it to Queendom 2...

1955
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:37,757
was because we never gave up.

1956
01:29:37,828 --> 01:29:40,658
We'll do everything we can...

1957
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:44,127
to prepare for the second match.

1958
01:29:45,368 --> 01:29:48,707
I spoke with the choreographer earlier.

1959
01:29:49,167 --> 01:29:53,408
He said he'd send us the choreography.

1960
01:29:53,637 --> 01:29:56,407
Once we get it,

1961
01:29:56,408 --> 01:30:00,177
we'll have to practice our parts at home.

1962

(- We can still practice dancing. - Okay! I'll be practicing!)

1964
01:30:06,087 --> 01:30:08,057
It breaks my heart...

1965
01:30:08,058 --> 01:30:11,127
that they need to practice despite their condition.

1969
01:30:22,408 --> 01:30:27,177
we found ways to practice for the match.

1970

This is an emergency situation.

We each steal something on stage.

I steal a necklace.

I steal money.

And the votes.

2035

And the votes.

2036

This is the biggest theft ever.

Report us?

2236
01:44:46,137 --> 01:44:49,808
For killing me with their performance.

2237
01:44:50,467 --> 01:44:51,737
How adorable.

2238
01:44:51,738 --> 01:44:53,577
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2239
01:44:53,578 --> 01:44:55,308
- Taeyeon. - I love you.

2240
01:44:56,247 --> 01:44:59,448
Let's meet the group who will go fourth.

2241
01:44:59,717 --> 01:45:02,518
These three fairies are known for their vivid charms.

2242
01:45:03,287 --> 01:45:04,318
It's VIVIZ.

2243
01:45:04,347 --> 01:45:06,787
It's VIVIZ. I'm so excited.

2244
01:45:06,818 --> 01:45:09,787
They'll be singing one of WJSN's songs.

2245
01:45:09,927 --> 01:45:12,256
I'm so curious how they reinterpreted the song...

2246
01:45:12,257 --> 01:45:14,228
into their own.

2247
01:45:14,358 --> 01:45:15,426
I'm so curious.

2248
01:45:15,427 --> 01:45:17,398
I bet they'll be seductive.

2249
01:45:17,768 --> 01:45:19,427
Let's enjoy their stage together.

2250
01:45:19,497 --> 01:45:21,367
Run the world, VIVIZ.

2251
01:45:21,368 --> 01:45:23,007
(Run the world, VIVIZ.)

2252
01:45:24,908 --> 01:45:27,177
(Which WJSN's song did they pick?)

2253
01:45:29,377 --> 01:45:31,747
Being chosen three times as a cut below...

2254
01:45:32,877 --> 01:45:35,778
would hurt anyone's pride.

2255
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:40,858
We don't care. We're just going to prove ourselves.

2256
01:46:09,887 --> 01:46:11,086
(Focused)

2257
01:46:11,087 --> 01:46:12,547
I feel like we're in Mexico.

2258
01:46:12,648 --> 01:46:13,916
They look like matadors.

2259
01:46:13,917 --> 01:46:15,687
(VIVIZ has made a powerful transformation...)

2260
01:46:15,688 --> 01:46:17,456
(that will surprise everyone.)

2261
01:46:17,457 --> 01:46:19,997
(To be continued)

2262
01:46:20,230 --> 01:46:22,831
This is our very first powerful performance.

2263
01:46:22,961 --> 01:46:25,100
We will captivate everyone's hearts.

2264
01:46:26,949 --> 01:46:29,580
- Let's do this together! - Let's do this together!

2265
01:46:29,949 --> 01:46:32,220
- We are Kep1er! - We are Kep1er!

2266
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:36,359
Come on.

2267
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:49,199
Where are they?

2268
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:56,180
- She's hanging from the top! - That's insane.

2269
01:46:57,449 --> 01:46:59,309
- Isn't that computer graphics? - No, it's her.

2270
01:47:05,989 --> 01:47:07,819
This should be for Billboard.

2271
01:47:11,989 --> 01:47:13,659
It's already the best performance of the day.

2272
01:47:59,569 --> 01:48:01,639
Did you change on time?

2273
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:03,409
- Did you transform well? - No.

2274
01:48:03,479 --> 01:48:04,680
I think I'm going to cry.

2275
01:48:05,309 --> 01:48:06,350
Do you have regrets?

2276
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:08,779
Can I check your microphone?

2277
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:09,989
Sure.

2278
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:11,550
Don't cry.

2279
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:12,720
Don't cry.

2280
01:48:16,119 --> 01:48:18,659
Since we came last during the first match,

2281
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:22,029
I wanted this performance to be perfect.

2282
01:48:26,569 --> 01:48:28,938
My clothes got stuck on my hand...

2283
01:48:28,939 --> 01:48:30,409
and didn't come off right away.

2284
01:48:31,369 --> 01:48:33,009
- It was a bit... - It's okay.

2285
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:34,108
It looked like it was a part of the performance.

2286
01:48:34,109 --> 01:48:36,979
- Right. - It was natural for your character.

2287
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:38,909
- Let's go. - Okay.

2288
01:48:39,710 --> 01:48:42,680
Hyun Jin, when you ripped your clothes,

2289
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,648
everyone was so shocked.

2290
01:48:44,649 --> 01:48:46,489
- Right. - Seriously.

2291
01:48:47,059 --> 01:48:48,519
They looked so shocked.

2292
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,659
- Really? I'm relieved. - Really.

2293
01:48:50,729 --> 01:48:52,790
- They'll remember it. - You were the best.
