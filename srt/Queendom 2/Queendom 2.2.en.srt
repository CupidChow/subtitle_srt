It was our first time dancing with our stage costumes on.

We've only practiced in our studio, so we never actually sat on steps.

Over here? When we do this?

We didn't think about...

how to use the props...

371

or the stage when we practiced.

372

It was our first time performing on a big stage.

373

- There's something... - Right.

00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:50,075
Compared to how we perform on music shows...

382
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:51,675
This isn't even an eighth of what we can do.

We don't have power.

384

We lack power and energy.

If we need to practice, we'll practice.

388
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:04,784
Can we practice the part...

389

where we stand in a line?

390
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:08,424
The only solution is practicing.

391
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,625
We practice it, and if it doesn't work,

392
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,865
we change it quickly and practice again.

393
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:14,136
- We look forward here. Right? - Right.

394
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:15,836
We have to be in sync here.

395
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,805
We have practiced...

for this moment,

There's no point in practicing it.

I thought we didn't show people what we could do...

500

If you think about it objectively,

(Brave Girls is only remembered for their song "Rollin'".)

504
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,954
Since that's all they know about us,

505
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,125
maybe they don't see us as rivals.

506
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:02,796
That made my blood boil.

507
00:29:03,356 --> 00:29:05,225
I thought we should put on a great performance.

508
00:29:06,025 --> 00:29:07,465
The theme of the first match...

509
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:09,665
is our signature song.

510
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,605
- Our signature song. - That's what we have to do.

511
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:14,674
Honestly, I think everyone participating in this competition...

512
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:16,135
will expect us to do "Rollin'".

513
00:29:16,136 --> 00:29:18,105
- Right. - Even the public.

514
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:19,645
Everyone.

515
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:23,045
I want to do something unexpected.

516
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:24,984
Out of all the songs we performed,

517
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:27,146
we have "High Heels" and "Rollin'".

518
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,915
More recently there's "Chi Mat Ba Ram" and "We Ride".

519
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,985
But compared to "Rollin'",

520
00:29:32,386 --> 00:29:34,325
- none of them are known. - Of course.

521
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:36,724
None of them are as known as "Rollin'".

522
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:39,464
Our signature song has to be a song...

523
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:40,934
that reminds people of us...

524
00:29:40,935 --> 00:29:43,595
- when they hear it. - Right.

525
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:47,005
But realistically speaking, the only song we have is "Rollin'".

526
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:52,045
So I think we have to sing "Rollin'".

527
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:53,774
We have to sing it,

528
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:56,474
but I want to show a different side of us this time.

529
00:29:56,475 --> 00:30:00,146
- Right. - We didn't get to show ourselves.

530
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:02,954
I want to show our performance and dancing skills.

531
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:04,254
- In the 1st match? - In the 1st match.

532
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:06,125
Even in the comments,

533
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:08,295
- people ask if we can dance. - Right.

534
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:10,055
"Aren't they all in their 30s?"

535
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:11,566
There are comments like that too.

536
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,365
Just based on the comments,

537
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:15,395
- they don't have expectations. - Right. They don't.

538
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,135
I wanted to break the bias against us.

539
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:18,305
When they see our performance,

540
00:30:18,306 --> 00:30:20,335
I want them to think, "Brave Girls can do that too?"

541
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:22,674
I want them to see a different side of us and what we can do.

542
00:30:22,675 --> 00:30:25,646
I want to create a performance that makes them think that.

543
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:29,244
My pride is hurt, and I'm a bit upset right now.

544
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,674
Let's remember this...

545
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:32,815
and focus more on the performance...

546
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:34,954
than our vocals.

547
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:36,784
- Sounds good. - That's a good idea.

548
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:39,684
- Let's show a different side of us. - Sounds good.

549
00:30:39,685 --> 00:30:41,454
We need something to captivate them.

550
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:43,795
I want to show them our power.

551
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,825
- Power. Our power on stage? - Brave Girls'...

552
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:47,325
- power. - Power?

553
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:51,034
So if you think about the BPM for that,

554
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:53,806
I think "Chi Mat Ba Ram" would be better to perform.

555

- It was acknowledged. - Right.

It was our first time coming in first upon the release.

560

We performed it in the summer, but time has passed,

561
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:10,684
so we should create a new version to have...

562
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:11,885
a different vibe.

563

and use the other stages.

641
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,965
- How should we do this? - In my performance,

642
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:15,304
I'm going to have male dancers.

643
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:17,435
- To make it look powerful? - Yes.

644

Use the male dancers.

645

Use them?

646

- How? - If a dancer's here,

647
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:23,974
you can sit on their lap.

648
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:25,216
How could I do that?

649

- Or you can hug them. - Oh, my.

650

- She thought of something. - Right.

655
00:34:40,265 --> 00:34:42,565
I'll try to get the audience to cheer for us.

656
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:43,994
- How? - The audience is in front of us,

657
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:47,134
so imagine how much they want to cheer?

658
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:50,474
I'll do gestures that'll make them scream inside.

a dance break over here.

I think it will look cool.

675
00:35:19,135 --> 00:35:20,965
We'll be using our props at this time,

676
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:22,974
so it would look amazing if we used some video effects...

in the central LED screen and the LED screen on the stairs.

to showcase this kind of performance,

- My gosh, are you okay? - We're okay.

695
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:04,244
We're rehearsing with the dancers for the first time today,

696
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,385
but it's not easy.

We kept changing the choreography until a day before the performance.

705
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,135
We made a lot of detailed changes.

706
00:36:24,196 --> 00:36:26,135
We're really concentrating...

707

We've never put on a big performance before,

801
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:46,904
so I feel like everyone would've been shocked.

802
00:43:46,905 --> 00:43:49,175
When Minyoung was beating the drums,

803
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:52,685
it looked she had all the charm in the world.

804
00:43:52,785 --> 00:43:56,114
- Of all the performances I've seen, - Out of all the intros,

805
00:43:56,115 --> 00:43:59,755
I think it was the most impressive prelude performances ever.

806
00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:01,025
- The neon stick. - Yes.

807
00:44:01,026 --> 00:44:02,895
It was a bit fascinating.

808
00:44:02,896 --> 00:44:06,764
It was a great idea that they thought of using it.

809
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:07,925
It was cool.

810
00:44:07,926 --> 00:44:12,005
I could see in their performance that they wanted...

811
00:44:12,006 --> 00:44:15,535
to show their different charms through Queendom 2.

812
00:44:16,606 --> 00:44:19,876
(A performance where we could see a new charm by Brave Girls)

813
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:22,646
- We'll get going. - Thank you.

814
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:23,845
Thank you!

815
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,115
Great work.

816
00:44:29,155 --> 00:44:30,215
Thank you.

817
00:44:30,216 --> 00:44:31,285
I'm thirsty.

818
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:33,055
I need water.

819
00:44:33,185 --> 00:44:34,425
(Her throat is already drained.)

820
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:35,756
- It was impressive. - I need to take a break.

821
00:44:35,995 --> 00:44:37,054
What's going on?

822
00:44:37,055 --> 00:44:39,594
I must've hit the drums really hard.

823
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:42,295
Look, I'm covered in pink.

824
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:43,594
(This is the evidence of Minyoung's passion.)

825
00:44:43,595 --> 00:44:46,606
(The pink powder)

826
00:44:46,836 --> 00:44:48,835
(She gave her all and got covered in pink.)

827
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:50,404
Great job, girls.

828
00:44:50,405 --> 00:44:51,945
Good job, everyone.

829
00:44:51,946 --> 00:44:55,175
I even forgot I had to get the mic. I was dancing, and one dancer...

830
00:44:55,176 --> 00:44:57,014
- Me too. - You're right, me too.

831
00:44:57,015 --> 00:44:58,785
(After the song changed to "Rollin'")

832
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:00,845
(Yuna, get your mic.)

833
00:45:02,655 --> 00:45:03,954
(Oh, right.)

834
00:45:03,955 --> 00:45:05,585
(Excuse me, get your microphone.)

835
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:07,125
(Okay, that looked natural.)

836
00:45:07,126 --> 00:45:09,025
Eunji wasn't taking her mic for until the end.

837
00:45:09,026 --> 00:45:11,225
- So the dancer had a hard time. - That's so funny.

838
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:12,724
Right.

839
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:13,896
(This is so exciting.)

840
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:16,466
(Please take this.)

841
00:45:16,495 --> 00:45:19,235
- I'm sorry. - She must've had a hard time.

842
00:45:19,236 --> 00:45:21,736
This ended so quickly.

843
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:24,405
- I feel sad. - It's sad.

844
00:45:24,475 --> 00:45:25,974
I've moved on from the past.

845
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:27,305
We're going to forget this dance now.

846
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:28,545
We need to think about the next one.

847
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:31,415
- We must think of the next dance. - Regrets change nothing.

848
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,586
(It's a beautiful queen-like night to have regrets.)

849
00:45:33,086 --> 00:45:36,555
We finally have one team left.

850
00:45:37,055 --> 00:45:38,585
As we've waited a long time,

851
00:45:38,586 --> 00:45:40,324
we are looking forward to them even more.

852
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:43,324
They have a lot of masterpieces.

853
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:44,555
Right.

854
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,126
Shall we meet them right now?

855
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,595
Run the world, WJSN!

856
00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:54,738
All the other teams have powerful songs.

857
00:45:56,526 --> 00:45:57,824
It's a big advantage...

858
00:45:57,825 --> 00:45:59,896
- to sing well-known songs. - Right.

859
00:46:01,195 --> 00:46:04,435
Because the audience get to vote on the spot,

860
00:46:04,436 --> 00:46:07,174
we had a feeling that popular songs...

861
00:46:07,175 --> 00:46:11,675
would have more of an advantage.

862
00:46:12,246 --> 00:46:14,916
We felt a little pressure because of that.

863
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:18,915
(What did WJSN choose as their top song?)

864
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:20,215
(Office of WJSN's company)

865
00:46:21,825 --> 00:46:25,255
(The atmosphere is down with the upcoming first match.)

866
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:26,825
(Yeonjung broke the silence.)

867
00:46:28,726 --> 00:46:32,264
After the Introduction, it triggered us in a couple of ways.

868
00:46:32,265 --> 00:46:34,296
- That's right. - I agree.

869
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:37,105
We met the lineup of artists during the Introduction.

870
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:39,105
There were so many teams that were popular among the public,

871
00:46:39,106 --> 00:46:42,574
with iconic songs that represented them.

872
00:46:42,575 --> 00:46:44,075
- On the other hand... - So I'm worried.

873
00:46:45,546 --> 00:46:49,215
- We have many great hidden songs. - That's right.

874
00:46:49,285 --> 00:46:53,686
(WJSN's songs have already been acknowledged among K-pop fans.)

875
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:58,654
Because other artists have...

876
00:46:58,655 --> 00:47:01,726
many songs that are already popular,

877
00:47:01,756 --> 00:47:05,496
we thought we'd be a little behind in terms of that.

878
00:47:05,896 --> 00:47:09,805
To be honest, it's not something we want to talk about.

879
00:47:11,035 --> 00:47:14,305
We don't have songs that won first place for several weeks.

880
00:47:14,606 --> 00:47:18,305
Our group hasn't been successful to have one single iconic song.

881
00:47:18,476 --> 00:47:19,945
But we've always been mediocre.

882
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:21,816
It was frustrating.

883
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:24,715
I really wanted to break away from that.

884
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:30,126
So I was determined to grab this opportunity.

885
00:47:30,925 --> 00:47:32,554
Because it's a match,

886
00:47:32,555 --> 00:47:38,025
we have quite a disadvantage to go against popular songs.

887
00:47:38,026 --> 00:47:39,694
We need to find a solution.

888
00:47:39,695 --> 00:47:40,765
That's right.

889
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:44,006
(WJSN is stuck at their song selection.)

890
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:46,775
So I was thinking...

891
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,805
this could be a signature song mission,

892
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:52,145
but I thought we should actually take this chance...

893
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:53,976
to create our signature song.

894
00:47:54,445 --> 00:47:55,715
We just have to do it.

895
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:58,384
Honestly, "Secret" was a good song.

896
00:47:58,385 --> 00:48:01,115
I was thinking of "As You Wish" and "SAVE ME, SAVE YOU".

897
00:48:01,316 --> 00:48:04,555
When we first started "Queendom 2," I thought of "As You Wish".

898
00:48:04,586 --> 00:48:06,824
- Thankfully, it went up the charts. - Right.

899
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:07,825
It was the first time.

900
00:48:07,826 --> 00:48:09,694
People played it every New Year.

901
00:48:09,695 --> 00:48:11,865
(WJSN wins first place with "As You Wish" on New Year's.)

902
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,404
"As You Wish" is a very grateful song for us.

903
00:48:15,405 --> 00:48:17,465
We call it the joy-giving song.

904
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,735
It's the song that ranks first place every year,

905
00:48:22,805 --> 00:48:26,475
but there are a lot of people who don't know that it's our song.

906
00:48:26,476 --> 00:48:27,876
(Nodding)

907
00:48:29,246 --> 00:48:31,915
- We are the owner of this song. - It's WJSN.

908
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:33,456
I hope we use this chance...

909
00:48:33,715 --> 00:48:36,855
to show people that we are WJSN.

910
00:48:36,856 --> 00:48:38,385
Then, it's set on "As You Wish".

911
00:48:38,595 --> 00:48:39,655
Let's do our best.

912
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:43,566
"As You Wish" is a song that makes us proud.

913
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,765
It gives us energy.

914
00:48:46,936 --> 00:48:49,165
We're going to show our strong will...

915
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:54,776
and achieve our dreams in Queendom 2.

916
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:56,145
That's why we chose this song.

917
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:57,506
("As You Wish," WJSN's song of determination)

918

("As You Wish" will win 1st place in the 1st match.)

919
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:03,784
We gathered ideas from everyone...

920
00:49:03,785 --> 00:49:06,715
on the kind of performance we want and the theme we want to show...

921
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:08,626
- for the first match. - Right.

922
00:49:08,885 --> 00:49:10,324
This is by Eunseo.

923
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:13,026
She really emphasized the moon.

924
00:49:13,226 --> 00:49:16,225
I feel like the moon appeared...

925
00:49:16,226 --> 00:49:17,525
in every album we had,

926
00:49:17,526 --> 00:49:20,666
so I prepared the lunar eclipse cycle.

927
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:23,265
- I thought of lunar eclipse too. - Oh!

928
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:26,606
The first thing that came to my mind when I thought of wish was the moon.

929
00:49:27,175 --> 00:49:29,105
The moon would listen to a child's wish...

930
00:49:29,106 --> 00:49:31,405
and would give an hourglass as a gift.

931
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:33,115
You prepared so much!

932
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,345
An item that symbolizes WJSN.

933
00:49:35,746 --> 00:49:37,185
We could choose the hourglass for that.

934
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:38,815
I think the hourglass sounds great.

935
00:49:38,816 --> 00:49:40,915
I hope we use this in every performance we do.

936
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:41,984
Sounds good.

937
00:49:41,985 --> 00:49:45,256
Because this is a match with our team name at stake,

938
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:49,165
I could feel that all our members were passionate about this.

939
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:50,666
I could feel that they were sincere.

940
00:49:51,126 --> 00:49:53,065
Also, since Eunseo...

941
00:49:53,066 --> 00:49:55,635
isn't feeling well,

942
00:49:56,805 --> 00:49:58,905
But there's something I'm worried about.

943
00:49:58,936 --> 00:50:00,074
- Are you talking about Eunseo? - Yes.

944
00:50:00,075 --> 00:50:01,336
What's going to happen to her?

945
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:06,115
(Eunseo wasn't in the Introduction after testing positive for COVID.)

946
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:08,445
- We can't do it without Eunseo. - But...

947
00:50:09,646 --> 00:50:11,444
we only have one week left.

948
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:14,316
We can't leave her out. It's our first match.

949
00:50:14,856 --> 00:50:16,185
It's our first match.

950
00:50:16,186 --> 00:50:19,055
I think having Eunseo is a big factor.

951
00:50:19,126 --> 00:50:20,496
We have to do it together no matter what.

952
00:50:20,595 --> 00:50:22,365
It was a big blow.

953
00:50:22,765 --> 00:50:26,034
Because we didn't have any time, I really contemplated...

954
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:27,836
if we were going to make it.

955
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:31,804
Because I knew Eunseo really well, I knew she was going to make it.

956
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:33,405
I had blind faith in her.

957
00:50:33,506 --> 00:50:36,376
We could just help her out as much as we can.

958
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:39,815

Put the thumb and pinky of your left hand together.

Until now,

we didn't have many chances to be in the spotlight.

we didn't get that much recognition compared to our efforts.

We've been performing for six years.

I want to prove to myself and others...

that it wasn't in vain.

1003
00:52:53,215 --> 00:52:55,685
I think we have to do this...

1004

thinking that it's going to be our last chance...

1005
00:52:58,746 --> 00:53:03,526
because there are a lot of things we can show through Queendom 2.

1006
00:53:04,126 --> 00:53:06,924
Even when the members weren't saying anything,

1007

they had their own concerns and pressure.

1008
00:53:09,996 --> 00:53:11,796
I felt like I should stay strong for them...

1009
00:53:11,825 --> 00:53:15,296
and that I had to hold the ground for them.

1010

Shall we do it again, thinking that Eunseo is here?

We don't look that energetic.

And there's WJSN who gave a performance in white costumes...

to hold us back.

1472
01:18:31,513 --> 01:18:33,673

1476

WJSN chose HYOLYN...

as their rival to show their respect.

Then let's find out the team a cut below them.

They used all the props and settings for their performance.

I think their performance just flew by.

1490

There was nothing impressive about their performance.

1597
01:24:48,652 --> 01:24:50,322
It's okay.

1598

Don't say that they're performance was disappointing, okay?

1599

- Then you can talk. - No.

1600

What should we do?

1601
01:24:57,362 --> 01:24:59,462
They were the first ones to go,

1602
01:24:59,463 --> 01:25:03,263

I think that's why we chose them.

1606

Did they not take the other groups into consideration?

1607
01:25:20,183 --> 01:25:23,451
Or did they just come up with an excuse...

1608
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:25,191
because they thought we were a cut below?

1609
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:27,662
I'm not sure what it is.

1610

But for now,

1611

I just thought, "I see."

Next up is Brave Girls' Self-Assessment result.

1613

(No one chose them as a rival during the Introduction.)

Forget about it being good or bad.

1617

Did no one choose us?

1618
01:25:56,353 --> 01:25:58,822
I don't know what to say anymore.

1619
01:26:04,463 --> 01:26:07,963
Brave Girls didn't pick any group...

1620
01:26:08,362 --> 01:26:09,502
as a cut above.

1621
01:26:11,402 --> 01:26:13,702
- No one picked a group. - I see.

1622
01:26:14,173 --> 01:26:16,942
Was this a strategy or...

1623
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:19,941
I believe it was.

1624
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:23,242
We didn't feel the need to necessarily pick a group.

1625
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:26,213
We all think the same except for Kep1er.

1626
01:26:26,553 --> 01:26:29,152
- But we were serious about it. - We were.

1627
01:26:29,252 --> 01:26:31,093
Those who did well should be acknowledged.

All right, then. As a cut below,

Brave Girls picked...

1630
01:26:36,923 --> 01:26:39,332
We could pick a group that's too competent.

1631

just for that.

1635
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,901
There are many different people in life.

1636

- Right. - And some people use...

- the rules in a different way. - Right, and...

An angel and a devil are fighting inside my head.

Who will our big-eyed member pick?

We weren't trying to target them.

1658
01:28:01,412 --> 01:28:05,312
VIVIZ performed first.

1659
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:07,552
Then the other groups performed...

with their own colours.

1661
01:28:10,023 --> 01:28:11,651
I think we were captivated by the others.

1662
01:28:11,652 --> 01:28:12,991
Every time a new group performed,

1663
01:28:12,992 --> 01:28:16,593
we naturally wondered which group had come before them.

1664
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:20,292
I believe that was why we chose them.

I don't think this part will be broadcast.

But being chosen like this...

1670
01:28:36,742 --> 01:28:38,151
could motivate us...

1671

to work harder and succeed during the second match.

You're right. Gosh.

Exactly. Maybe it's expressing my feelings.
