So we envied them a lot.

975
00:54:08,904 --> 00:54:12,534
We were curious how it would feel being in such position.

976
00:54:13,773 --> 00:54:15,772
They were always being congratulated at the end...

977
00:54:15,773 --> 00:54:19,312
after we performed on stage.

978
00:54:19,313 --> 00:54:21,014
I'm a bit curious about them.

979
00:54:21,683 --> 00:54:26,553
Back then when we saw that, we wanted to work with you.

980
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:30,424
We're glad to see you here and we're actually curious too.

981
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:33,863
So in Queendom 2,

982
00:54:33,864 --> 00:54:36,792
we'll show a good performance...

983
00:54:36,793 --> 00:54:38,793
and take those votes.

984
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:41,804
(Brave Girls' sincerity melted VIVIZ's hearts.)

985

(Proud)

986
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:45,804
Let's have a great match.

987
00:54:45,973 --> 00:54:48,873
(That's great.)

988
00:54:49,643 --> 00:54:51,573
At first, I was curious.

989
00:54:51,574 --> 00:54:53,884
But after hearing the reason, I felt good.

990
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:58,484
Now, let's find out who VIVIZ's rival is.

991
00:54:58,683 --> 00:55:02,324
It'll be amazing if both teams chose one another.

992
00:55:03,893 --> 00:55:04,993
No way.

993
00:55:05,493 --> 00:55:09,963
Brave Girls have a similar number of members.

994
00:55:09,964 --> 00:55:12,034
We debuted around the same time too.

995
00:55:12,364 --> 00:55:14,804
Now, please reveal...

996
00:55:15,134 --> 00:55:16,404
VIVIZ's rival!

997
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:18,904
(Who did VIVIZ choose as a rival?)

998
00:55:19,304 --> 00:55:21,273
I wanted them to be conscious of us.

999

(Really?)

1000
00:55:30,714 --> 00:55:33,784
Really? Is that true?

1001

Please reveal it!

1002
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:38,653
The rival that VIVIZ chose...

1003
00:55:38,654 --> 00:55:39,823
is HYOLYN!

1004
00:55:39,824 --> 00:55:41,162
(VIVIZ's rival is HYOLYN.)

1005
00:55:41,163 --> 00:55:42,493
(Clearing her throat)

1006
00:55:42,694 --> 00:55:44,963
HYOLYN just cleared her throat.

1007
00:55:44,964 --> 00:55:47,603
I'm sorry.

1008
00:55:47,904 --> 00:55:50,034
We didn't mean it to be that way.

1009
00:55:51,504 --> 00:55:53,272
They chose HYOLYN as a rival.

1010
00:55:53,273 --> 00:55:55,142
What's going on? Can you explain?

1011
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,372
(Curious)

1012
00:55:56,373 --> 00:56:00,483
Queendom has a mission to change songs...

1013
00:56:00,484 --> 00:56:02,483
as far as I know.

1014
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:07,384
Actually, she has a lot of songs that we want to sing the most.

1015
00:56:09,154 --> 00:56:11,352
Oh, that's right.

1016
00:56:11,353 --> 00:56:14,893
So we dared to choose her as our rival.

1017
00:56:15,023 --> 00:56:16,833
I...

1018
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,133
felt that I've worked hard enough...

1019
00:56:21,134 --> 00:56:24,803
to have songs that they want to sing.

1020
00:56:24,804 --> 00:56:27,003
The reason they chose me made me feel so happy.

1021
00:56:27,004 --> 00:56:28,073
Yes!

1022
00:56:28,074 --> 00:56:30,473
(Their respect for the rival is heartwarming.)

1023
00:56:31,143 --> 00:56:33,582
- It's a good thing to be chosen. - It's a good thing.

1024
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:35,682
But is it because they think they can compete with us?

1025
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,852
That's possible.

1026
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:39,352
But if we're not chosen, we might think...

1027
00:56:39,353 --> 00:56:40,823
they didn't choose us since we're not that good.

1028
00:56:40,824 --> 00:56:43,653
Not being chosen should make us feel worse.

1029
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:44,792
No, it doesn't feel good.

1030
00:56:44,793 --> 00:56:47,623
When we're chosen, we realize that they're conscious of us.

1031
00:56:47,924 --> 00:56:51,863
Now, let's find out which team is HYOLYN's rival.

1032
00:56:51,864 --> 00:56:54,304
Let's reveal her rival.

1033
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:55,634
(Meaningful look)

1034
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:58,333
- Does she have a rival here? - That's what I'm saying.

1035
00:56:58,674 --> 00:57:00,743
- I'm curious. - Who could it be?

1036
00:57:02,674 --> 00:57:05,243
Anyway, since I'm their senior,

1037
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:08,043
I think I can go against any of them.

1038
00:57:09,114 --> 00:57:12,614
Now, please reveal HYOLYN's rival.

1039
00:57:13,424 --> 00:57:15,424
I wanted to be picked by HYOLYN.

1040
00:57:15,824 --> 00:57:18,493
She's a senior who's perfect in everything.

1041
00:57:20,194 --> 00:57:22,094
(The junior singers expect to be chosen by HYOLYN.)

1042
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:29,574
(HYOLYN's rival is Kep1er.)

1043
00:57:30,203 --> 00:57:31,472
(They never expected that HYOLYN would make this choice.)

1044
00:57:31,473 --> 00:57:32,533
Amazing.

1046

(Kep1er is stunned.)

1048
00:57:47,683 --> 00:57:49,284
They're going, "Thank you."

1049
00:57:50,523 --> 00:57:52,623
Why are they being thankful?

1050
00:57:53,324 --> 00:57:55,964
(Thank you for doing this, HYOLYN.)

1051
00:57:56,594 --> 00:57:58,393
It's a novel response.

1052
00:58:00,134 --> 00:58:01,703
- It's really unexpected. - It is.

1053
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,403
I wonder what the reason is.

1054
00:58:03,404 --> 00:58:06,843
I chose them because of how they shout their chant...

1055
00:58:06,844 --> 00:58:08,772
and what they show on the stage.

1056
00:58:08,773 --> 00:58:11,613
They're filled with so much passion and spirit...

1057
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:14,583
and they work very hard.

(Kep1er is filled with energy everywhere, every time.)

00:58:21,824 --> 00:58:23,892
Actually, since I started working as a soloist,

1061
00:58:23,893 --> 00:58:28,222
I'm doing performances with such passion and vigour.

1062
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,492
I thought, in that respect, Kep1er and I...

1063
00:58:30,493 --> 00:58:33,634
have a similar feel. That's why I chose them.

1064
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:36,372
- I feel honoured. - I can't believe this.

I felt so happy...

1067

and was also afraid if I could feel happy.

1068

I felt honoured.

1069

- The atmosphere now... - Right.

1070
00:58:47,014 --> 00:58:49,984
Feels like not being chosen means we're not good.

1071
00:58:50,384 --> 00:58:53,784
Now, please reveal Kep1er's rival!

I think they chose Kep1er.

I'm sure they chose each other.

Are we sending Cupid's arrows to each other?

Here's the rival LOONA chose.

Please show us!

1094

When the other team chose us,

we don't know the reason they choose us,

so we're not sure whether we should be happy.

You don't know whether they're looking down on you...

or they're respecting you.

That's right.

Then, what's the reason...

LOONA chose WJSN as their rival?

We thought they might have chosen us with a different intention,

so we decided not to rush into being happy about it.

To be honest, during the pre-interview,

we chose WJSN...

01:01:39,353 --> 01:01:40,384
No.

1133
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:44,123
Do you think you'll be chosen by the rest of them?

1134
01:01:46,563 --> 01:01:48,393
I don't think so.

1135
01:01:50,734 --> 01:01:54,034
We need to keep a straight face.

1136
01:01:55,364 --> 01:01:59,472
Now, let's reveal the last rival chosen.

1137
01:01:59,473 --> 01:02:02,073
- Oh, my. - Goodness, I can't look at it.

(Trying to be calm)

1139
01:02:04,743 --> 01:02:07,683
Please reveal the rival WJSN chose!

1140
01:02:07,884 --> 01:02:09,852
I think we can expect that they chose us.

1141
01:02:09,853 --> 01:02:12,554
Right. It's the same reason we chose our rival.

1142
01:02:15,424 --> 01:02:19,993
Would Brave Girls be chosen as a rival?

1143
01:02:20,223 --> 01:02:23,734
Whether the vote is good or not, I want to get a vote.

(Upset)

1148
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:43,483
The rival WJSN that chose is HYOLYN.

1149
01:02:43,484 --> 01:02:47,352
So, that means VIVIZ and WJSN, two teams...

1150
01:02:47,353 --> 01:02:50,324
chose HYOLYN as their rival.

1151
01:02:50,853 --> 01:02:52,923
- What could be the reason? - I'm curious.

1152
01:02:52,924 --> 01:02:57,133
First of all, since we were trainees,

1153
01:02:57,134 --> 01:03:01,404
we have chased our dreams while watching HYOLYN.

1154
01:03:01,933 --> 01:03:03,403
(WJSN debuted with the title, "A junior version of SISTAR".)

1156

Just competing with her on the same stage...

1157
01:03:07,773 --> 01:03:11,373
is very meaningful to us.

(Thankful and proud)

1159
01:03:14,043 --> 01:03:17,083
As for me, when I was a trainee,

1160
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:21,554
I appeared in "Unpretty Rapstar" with HYOLYN.

1161
01:03:21,884 --> 01:03:23,223
Right.

1162
01:03:23,694 --> 01:03:25,293
Yes, that's right.

1163
01:03:25,523 --> 01:03:27,463
Back then, my nickname...

1164
01:03:27,464 --> 01:03:30,964
was "HYOLYN's Freebie".

1165
01:03:31,493 --> 01:03:34,603
- That's too much. - That's harsh.

1166
01:03:34,964 --> 01:03:36,634
Who said that?

1167
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,602
(I'm a trainee in the same agency with HYOLYN.)

1168
01:03:41,603 --> 01:03:42,872
(My name is EXY.)

1169
01:03:42,873 --> 01:03:45,073
They could say it was like a so-called tie-in sale.

1170
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:47,713
I was very afraid the viewers might think that way.

1171
01:03:47,714 --> 01:03:51,352
Back then, I received a lot of help from HYOLYN.

1172
01:03:51,353 --> 01:03:54,984
While looking up to her, I improved a lot.

1173
01:03:57,424 --> 01:04:00,094
This situation is so meaningful to us.

1174
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:04,433
Time has passed and we're a girl group of six years already.

1175
01:04:04,563 --> 01:04:07,733
We want to show her that we grew up this much while admiring her...

1176
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:12,373
and that we became singers who make great performances.

1177
01:04:15,373 --> 01:04:16,742
I'm getting goosebumps.

1178
01:04:16,743 --> 01:04:18,413
I'm so moved.

1179
01:04:19,614 --> 01:04:20,784
I'm so touched.

1180
01:04:20,844 --> 01:04:22,214
I feel like crying.

1181
01:04:23,114 --> 01:04:26,153
Actually, it is a privilege...

1182
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,324
to be someone's role model.

1183
01:04:28,683 --> 01:04:34,123
So I'm flattered to hear all the good things today.

1184
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:37,094
I want to teach the person who said that a lesson.

It's so cool.

1188
01:04:43,203 --> 01:04:46,003
So you two just met again after a long time.

1189
01:04:46,004 --> 01:04:47,174
Why don't you give each other a hug?

(They have spent a lot of time together.)

There you go.

I feel like crying.

1200
01:05:22,174 --> 01:05:24,243
The smell of her perfume hasn't changed at all.

1201
01:05:24,344 --> 01:05:26,373
When I smelled it again,

1202
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:29,884
I felt like everything was exactly as it had been like the perfume.

1203
01:05:31,214 --> 01:05:33,783
She's still reliable...

1204
01:05:33,784 --> 01:05:37,254
and really cool. That's who she is.

1205
01:05:38,324 --> 01:05:40,364
I can't describe the feeling in words.

1206
01:05:40,563 --> 01:05:43,222
So I got a little emotional.

1207
01:05:43,223 --> 01:05:45,062
(HYOLYN has always been a big support for the little girl, EXY.)

I think...

1209

HYOLYN was always on a page of my dream.

1210
01:05:52,103 --> 01:05:53,844
It felt really strange.

1211
01:05:54,344 --> 01:05:58,043
And the fact that I will compete...

1212
01:05:58,243 --> 01:06:00,143
against someone like her...

1213
01:06:01,514 --> 01:06:04,453
means a lot to me.

1214
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:09,622
"I've improved a lot watching you."

1215

This is what she just said.

I hope she will show performances...

1217

1219

I'm so jealous.

To have a mentor like her.

01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:39,753
The big senior, HYOLYN got two votes.

And the comeback-on-the-chart queen, Brave Girls...

1228
01:06:42,554 --> 01:06:44,993
didn't receive any votes.

1229
01:06:46,094 --> 01:06:49,594
I guess you expected to get at least one vote.

1230
01:06:49,723 --> 01:06:53,264
Right. I was hoping to get at least one vote.

01:06:54,103 --> 01:06:55,364
Actually, I was upset.

1232

Honestly, we didn't show anything impressive.

1233
01:06:57,873 --> 01:07:01,443
It made me think that we had to show them something.

1234
01:07:01,444 --> 01:07:02,472
To be honest.

1235
01:07:02,473 --> 01:07:04,343
- I think we should try harder. - We should try harder.

1236
01:07:04,344 --> 01:07:06,813
We will put in a lot more effort.

1237
01:07:07,384 --> 01:07:09,682
We never know what this means.

1238
01:07:09,683 --> 01:07:13,412
You can't say not getting picked is good or bad.

1239
01:07:13,413 --> 01:07:15,853
Try not to think about it too much.

1240
01:07:16,123 --> 01:07:19,153
I am excited about the beautiful competition...

1241
01:07:19,154 --> 01:07:20,623
that is going to begin.

I knew the first match...

01:07:50,893 --> 01:07:52,352
- would be about signature songs. - What should we do?

1255
01:07:52,353 --> 01:07:53,723
- Our signature song? - There's only one.

1256
01:07:54,464 --> 01:07:55,964
- It's "WA DA DA". - We have only one song.

1257
01:07:56,023 --> 01:08:00,364
The score you can achieve in the first match is...

1258

a total of 10,000 points.

1259

- That's so high. - It's 10,000 points, not 100.

1260
01:08:08,473 --> 01:08:10,943
- It's 10,000 points. - On a scale of 10,000 points,

the first match will be graded...

1262
01:08:14,543 --> 01:08:16,812
by the self-assessment of the cast of Queendom,

1263
01:08:16,813 --> 01:08:19,754
votes from the global fans, and votes from the live audience.

1264
01:08:19,884 --> 01:08:22,353
This is important. I don't want us to be the last.

1265
01:08:22,354 --> 01:08:24,053
We're at a disadvantage.

1266
01:08:24,054 --> 01:08:25,193
Because we're new.

1267

Before the match begins,

1268
01:08:27,924 --> 01:08:29,862
we have an important decision to make.

1269
01:08:29,863 --> 01:08:32,763
That's right. We should decide the running order of performances.

All right. Now Queen Manager Yong Jin...

1273
01:08:40,504 --> 01:08:42,703
will open the cue sheets one at a time.

(Curious and excited)

1275

What if we all picked the same number?

1276

This is crazy.

1277

The number Kep1er picked for the first match...

(Kep1er's desired number)

is three.

I believe we will show the best energy in that order.

1281

What's the number Brave Girls picked?

1282
01:09:04,293 --> 01:09:05,493
It's number four.

1283
01:09:06,663 --> 01:09:09,433
I heard the team that went fourth...

1284

in the first match of Queendom One...

1285

won first place.

1286

I guess you are a little superstitious.

Of course. They have a lot of experience.

at the first round.

1677

Is it because you're confident?

1678
01:26:41,453 --> 01:26:44,224
Or is it strategic?

1679

It's the "first view of the world".

1680

I think they'll have a similar concept with us.

1690
01:27:07,913 --> 01:27:11,553
You must have had a hard time choosing the song.

1691
01:27:11,554 --> 01:27:13,112
Whether to choose a GFRIEND's song...

1692

or VIVIZ's song.

1693

I'm curious how you chose.

Yes, we had a hard time choosing.

1695
01:27:23,623 --> 01:27:25,593
The signature song refers to our hit song.

- Yes. - Right.

1697

- we're VIVIZ and also GFRIEND... - Yes.

And vice versa.

1704
01:27:44,953 --> 01:27:46,883
So we have no reason...

1705
01:27:46,884 --> 01:27:49,152
- to exclude GFRIEND songs. - Yes.

1706
01:27:49,153 --> 01:27:52,023
Actually, choosing GFRIEND songs...

1707
01:27:52,024 --> 01:27:54,094
- is more beneficial for us. - Yes, better for us.

01:29:53,413 --> 01:29:55,243
(Very touched)

1762
01:29:55,884 --> 01:29:57,214
You're the best.

1763
01:29:57,844 --> 01:30:00,854
It was a very encouraging call.

1764
01:30:04,993 --> 01:30:08,594
(We started on January 16, 2015.)

1765
01:30:10,293 --> 01:30:11,593
(In any situation...)

1766
01:30:11,594 --> 01:30:13,934
We really went through a lot.

1767
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:19,233
But we always performed with thanks.

1768
01:30:20,604 --> 01:30:22,974
(They made it to the top together.)

1769
01:30:23,573 --> 01:30:27,014
There were many things that we could accomplish as a team.

1770
01:30:29,783 --> 01:30:31,653
For almost eight years,

1771
01:30:32,583 --> 01:30:35,122
we experienced hard, sad,

1772
01:30:35,123 --> 01:30:38,424
and happy times together.

1773
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:43,123
Thinking about them makes me...

1774
01:30:43,623 --> 01:30:45,793
emotional and warm.

1775
01:30:47,533 --> 01:30:49,703
They're my lifetime friends,

1776
01:30:50,363 --> 01:30:51,873
lifetime family.

1777
01:30:54,774 --> 01:30:57,003
We debuted with the song "Glass Bead".

1778
01:30:57,004 --> 01:31:00,113
(We promised not to break apart.)

1779
01:31:02,483 --> 01:31:06,714
(They said their goodbyes in May 2021.)

1780
01:31:07,384 --> 01:31:09,884
It was a sudden notice.

1781
01:31:11,453 --> 01:31:14,493
GFRIEND. Oh, no. VIVIZ will sing.

1782
01:31:15,224 --> 01:31:18,333
Sometimes, I mention GFRIEND.

1783
01:31:20,363 --> 01:31:23,403
I'm still getting used to it.

1784
01:31:26,373 --> 01:31:28,304
- Shall we have a look? - Yes.

1785
01:31:31,474 --> 01:31:33,543
(Amazed)

1786
01:31:35,113 --> 01:31:36,583
(Her body reacts first.)

1787
01:31:36,743 --> 01:31:38,353
- It's cool. - Yes.

1788
01:31:38,354 --> 01:31:39,553
- Oh, gosh. - Gosh.

1789
01:31:39,554 --> 01:31:41,083
We won.

1790
01:31:41,283 --> 01:31:42,853
This performance is completely for Queendom.

1791
01:31:42,854 --> 01:31:44,224
(Eunha can already imagine the Queendom stage.)

1792
01:31:45,724 --> 01:31:49,493
Looking at the video,

1793
01:31:49,663 --> 01:31:51,793
- the verse choreography is great. - Right.

1794
01:31:53,493 --> 01:31:57,304
(She was serious while the other members were busy reacting.)

1795
01:31:58,873 --> 01:32:00,474
(Nervous)

1796
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:02,542
Our choreographies until now...

1797
01:32:02,543 --> 01:32:05,243
were directly linked with the lyrics.

1798
01:32:05,413 --> 01:32:07,013
(Blooming like a flower)

1799
01:32:07,014 --> 01:32:08,072
(The way you look at me)

1800
01:32:08,073 --> 01:32:10,442
(If you listen carefully)

1801
01:32:10,443 --> 01:32:12,082
(I'll follow you)

1802
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:14,754
(While being asleep)

1803
01:32:14,983 --> 01:32:18,223
I think it would be better to have something linking with the lyrics.

1804
01:32:18,224 --> 01:32:21,152
There are some sources that are left blank.

1805
01:32:21,153 --> 01:32:22,862
It would be better if our hands...

1806
01:32:22,863 --> 01:32:24,662
are higher than staying low.

1807
01:32:24,663 --> 01:32:27,094
The clock choreography in "Rough"...

1808
01:32:28,134 --> 01:32:30,964
I saw the choreography made by the choreography team.

1809
01:32:31,203 --> 01:32:35,673
But it didn't have the unique GFRIEND characteristics.

1810
01:32:35,674 --> 01:32:37,974
So I suggested a lot of corrections.

1811
01:32:38,144 --> 01:32:40,314
We want to do this very well.

1812
01:32:41,373 --> 01:32:44,684
(VIVIZ starts practicing.)

1813
01:32:44,783 --> 01:32:47,314
(Is this choreography okay?)

1814
01:32:47,613 --> 01:32:50,152
We have too many poking motions.

1815
01:32:50,153 --> 01:32:52,524
- Even in the chorus. - This motion is constantly used.

1816
01:32:53,754 --> 01:32:54,793
What?

1817
01:32:55,524 --> 01:32:56,663
Are we doing this?

1818
01:32:56,724 --> 01:32:58,193
We said we'll change this.

1819
01:32:58,464 --> 01:33:00,393
I'm singing while dancing.

1820
01:33:00,394 --> 01:33:03,063
I feel like my body is moving before the lyrics end.

1821
01:33:03,064 --> 01:33:05,233
(They had to practice while having "BOP BOP!" shows.)

1822
01:33:05,373 --> 01:33:06,433
(Despite their busy schedules, )

1823
01:33:06,434 --> 01:33:08,573
(they practiced again and again.)

1824
01:33:09,403 --> 01:33:12,443
I didn't want to ruin the image...

1825
01:33:12,514 --> 01:33:17,943
of a group that performs well as GFRIEND.

1826
01:33:18,913 --> 01:33:23,583
I really want to do well for the other members.

1827
01:33:23,924 --> 01:33:26,992
I won't say I'll do well.

1828
01:33:26,993 --> 01:33:28,193
I must do well.

1829
01:33:28,354 --> 01:33:29,622
We can do it.

1830
01:33:29,623 --> 01:33:30,623
(Her truthful facial expression.)

1831
01:33:30,663 --> 01:33:31,693
We can do this.

1832
01:33:32,793 --> 01:33:34,792
I think many of our fans...

1833
01:33:34,793 --> 01:33:37,703
are worried as only three of us will be performing.

1834
01:33:38,233 --> 01:33:41,903
We'll work many times harder so that...

1835
01:33:42,144 --> 01:33:45,214
we don't harm the name of GFRIEND.

1836
01:33:46,543 --> 01:33:49,743
(VIVIZ is on stage with great determination.)

1837
01:33:51,344 --> 01:33:53,013
I want to show people...

1838
01:33:53,014 --> 01:33:55,782
that the three of us can do well.

1839
01:33:55,783 --> 01:33:57,783
(We'll show you that the three of us can do well.)

1840
01:34:04,894 --> 01:34:07,094
Wait, there are so many dancers.

1841
01:34:07,293 --> 01:34:09,033
They're finally out.

1842
01:34:09,134 --> 01:34:10,362
Our rival.

1843
01:34:10,363 --> 01:34:11,833
Our one-sided love.

1844
01:34:11,974 --> 01:34:14,003
I'm going crazy.

1845
01:34:14,004 --> 01:34:15,844
Oh, gosh. I think they'll be amazing.

1846
01:34:26,384 --> 01:34:31,354
("Time for the Moon Night" and "Rough" by VIVIZ)

1847
01:34:33,524 --> 01:34:34,653
It's a clock.

1848
01:34:35,094 --> 01:34:36,623
Maybe they're performing "Rough".

1849
01:34:44,163 --> 01:34:45,533
It's "Time for the Moon Night".

1850
01:34:45,634 --> 01:34:46,733
I got goosebumps!

1851
01:35:34,384 --> 01:35:35,424
They're so pretty.

1852
01:36:24,403 --> 01:36:26,203
That makes me want to do well.

1853
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:28,974
- I'm feeling nostalgic. - Me too.

1854
01:36:45,224 --> 01:36:46,653
That's so pretty.

1855
01:36:53,533 --> 01:36:54,832
Are those fireflies?

1856
01:36:54,833 --> 01:36:56,504
(They're all mesmerized.)

1857
01:37:06,814 --> 01:37:08,242
(What is this familiar melody?)

1858
01:37:08,243 --> 01:37:09,714
It's "Rough"!

1859
01:37:10,214 --> 01:37:11,583
Gosh, that's incredible.

1860
01:38:02,634 --> 01:38:03,902
I really love this song.

1861
01:38:03,903 --> 01:38:05,533
- The audience could cry. - Totally.

1862
01:38:27,793 --> 01:38:28,924
That's so pretty.

1863
01:38:33,134 --> 01:38:35,863
(She's becoming teary-eyed.)

1864
01:39:04,924 --> 01:39:06,793
Zero, one, one, six, zero...

1865
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:09,263
Is it the date of their début?

1866
01:39:09,264 --> 01:39:10,933
They debuted on January 16.

1867
01:39:10,934 --> 01:39:12,832
Then on February 9, they debuted as VIVIZ.

1868
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:15,373
I'm going to cry. That's what the numbers mean.

1869
01:39:40,993 --> 01:39:42,433
(The performance has made them all emotional.)

1870
01:39:42,434 --> 01:39:43,732
That was really touching.

1871
01:39:43,733 --> 01:39:45,403
(Ye Seo is lost for words.)

1872
01:39:45,774 --> 01:39:48,073
That stage would've made anyone emotional.

1873
01:39:48,403 --> 01:39:49,543
Seriously.

1874
01:39:50,543 --> 01:39:53,144
I was a total fan of GFRIEND.

1875
01:39:53,913 --> 01:39:57,482
In elementary and middle school,

1876
01:39:57,483 --> 01:40:01,554
I used to listen to "Rough"...

1877
01:40:01,714 --> 01:40:05,524
and cried a lot.

1878
01:40:05,953 --> 01:40:08,863
Those feelings still linger in my heart to this day.

1879
01:40:09,424 --> 01:40:12,093
It seemed to show how time passed to this day...

1880
01:40:12,094 --> 01:40:13,733
as they became VIVIZ.

1881
01:40:13,833 --> 01:40:17,763
They showed a panorama...

1882
01:40:17,764 --> 01:40:19,634
of all their past ups and downs.

1883
01:40:19,703 --> 01:40:21,873
And finally, they stopped in the present.

1884
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:25,474
It's actually quite indescribable.

1885
01:40:26,314 --> 01:40:27,673
They probably had so much on their minds.

1886
01:40:27,674 --> 01:40:30,442
- Every time a member changed, - Right.

1887
01:40:30,443 --> 01:40:33,384
We also had to fill their absence somehow.

1888
01:40:33,514 --> 01:40:36,053
I know how difficult that is.

1889
01:40:36,054 --> 01:40:38,353
They must've practiced much more.

1890
01:40:38,354 --> 01:40:39,394
I agree.

1891
01:40:39,724 --> 01:40:42,463
I think they all became emotional.

1892
01:40:42,464 --> 01:40:43,594
I couldn't watch them.

1893
01:40:43,623 --> 01:40:44,793
Did you become emotional too?

1894
01:40:45,024 --> 01:40:47,263
I think I can understand.

1895
01:40:47,264 --> 01:40:48,264
(Feeling sad for them, she bursts into tears.)

1896
01:40:48,333 --> 01:40:50,333
SinB said she wasn't nervous.

1897
01:40:52,233 --> 01:40:56,003
But her words and actions were similar to how I was...

1898
01:40:56,004 --> 01:40:57,903
when I became very nervous.

1899
01:40:59,113 --> 01:41:01,314
Although we're rivals, we're also friends.

1900
01:41:01,373 --> 01:41:04,783
I was proud of her once she was done.

1901
01:41:06,483 --> 01:41:10,554
(The responsibility she felt must've weighed down on her.)

1902
01:41:12,594 --> 01:41:15,924
(They finally end their performance.)

1903
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:18,823
My legs are going to give out.

1904
01:41:19,134 --> 01:41:20,564
It's finally over.

1905
01:41:20,634 --> 01:41:22,133
We're finally done.

1906
01:41:22,134 --> 01:41:23,202
(Unlike the other two who are relieved that it's over, )

1907
01:41:23,203 --> 01:41:25,903
(Eunha bursts into tears.)

1908
01:41:30,403 --> 01:41:33,674
Once the performance was done, I looked at the audience.

1909
01:41:36,184 --> 01:41:38,644
And they were crying.

1910
01:41:43,384 --> 01:41:46,653
That made me emotional as well.

1911
01:41:46,724 --> 01:41:47,753
But I held back my tears...

1912
01:41:47,754 --> 01:41:50,094
because I didn't want to cry in front of them.

1913
01:41:51,724 --> 01:41:55,464
But as soon as I went backstage, I couldn't help but cry.

1914
01:41:57,203 --> 01:42:00,103
When it came to GFRIEND's songs,

1915
01:42:00,104 --> 01:42:03,474
I often wondered if I'd be able to perform it...

1916
01:42:05,104 --> 01:42:06,974
on stage ever again.

1917
01:42:07,543 --> 01:42:10,143
The fact that we could perform them...

1918
01:42:10,144 --> 01:42:12,982
as VIVIZ...

1919
01:42:12,983 --> 01:42:16,083
mean the world to us.

1920
01:42:16,283 --> 01:42:17,854
All of our wishes have come true.

1921
01:42:18,823 --> 01:42:21,253
At first, we were worried that we wouldn't be able...

1922
01:42:21,254 --> 01:42:22,862
to fill up the gap made by the other members.

1923
01:42:22,863 --> 01:42:25,692
But I think we pulled it off

1924
01:42:25,693 --> 01:42:26,934
in our own way as VIVIZ.

1925
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:29,464
(Good work.)

1926
01:42:36,004 --> 01:42:40,413
Let's meet the next performer.

1927
01:42:42,983 --> 01:42:46,413
Few words come to mind when we think of her.

1928
01:42:47,354 --> 01:42:50,724
"Stage charisma" and "an all-rounder artist".

1929
01:42:51,724 --> 01:42:52,854
Who could it be?

1930
01:42:54,054 --> 01:42:55,924
Can you guess?

1931
01:42:56,224 --> 01:42:57,992
It's HYOLYN.

1932
01:42:57,993 --> 01:42:59,434
(The time has come!)

1933
01:42:59,564 --> 01:43:01,064
- What song will she sing? - Seriously?

1934
01:43:01,863 --> 01:43:04,203
- How will she perform them? - I'm really curious.

1935
01:43:04,703 --> 01:43:05,974
(Anticipating)

1936
01:43:07,233 --> 01:43:09,203
(HYOLYN is getting ready to perform on stage.)

1937
01:43:09,274 --> 01:43:11,104
HYOLYN, let's go.

1938
01:43:14,974 --> 01:43:17,143
It's been a long time since I performed alone...

1939
01:43:17,144 --> 01:43:18,714
for such a large audience.

1940
01:43:19,613 --> 01:43:21,813
Since it was a solo performance,

1941
01:43:21,814 --> 01:43:24,924
I really thought long and hard about how I should do it.

1942
01:43:25,554 --> 01:43:27,453
This was a very important stage for me.

1943
01:43:27,653 --> 01:43:30,094
I really needed this.

1944
01:43:31,224 --> 01:43:34,993
So I decided to do my best so I wouldn't regret anything.

1945
01:43:36,604 --> 01:43:39,233
(What kind of performance will she give?)

1946
01:43:39,703 --> 01:43:41,833
(First match D-8)

1947
01:43:41,903 --> 01:43:46,743
(HYOLYN's studio)

1948
01:43:47,573 --> 01:43:50,543
(She has prepared everything for Queendom 2.)

1949
01:43:51,214 --> 01:43:53,083
I'm currently in my studio.

1950
01:43:53,283 --> 01:43:56,024
I'm going to pick out the signature songs...

1951
01:43:56,623 --> 01:43:57,883
for the first match.

1952
01:43:57,884 --> 01:44:00,223
Signature songs...

1953
01:44:00,224 --> 01:44:01,322
(What are...)

1954
01:44:01,323 --> 01:44:02,863
(my signature songs?)

1955
01:44:02,894 --> 01:44:06,064
I can think of some songs by SISTAR.

1956
01:44:08,134 --> 01:44:09,863
(SISTAR, the summer queens, had many hit songs.)

1957
01:44:10,264 --> 01:44:12,633
I can also think of some of my own songs.

1958
01:44:12,634 --> 01:44:13,703
(Will she perform one of her own songs?)

1959
01:44:13,974 --> 01:44:16,443
The songs I performed by myself.

1960
01:44:17,703 --> 01:44:20,344
(Her solo songs show what kind of person she is.)

1961
01:44:20,543 --> 01:44:21,674
What should I pick?

1962
01:44:22,014 --> 01:44:23,413
I like "Lonely".

1963
01:44:24,214 --> 01:44:26,453
But I think the song will be too sad.

1964
01:44:29,254 --> 01:44:30,884
I like this one too.

1965
01:44:32,283 --> 01:44:35,924
(This addictive melody captures our ears.)

1966
01:44:36,024 --> 01:44:38,663
(She gets into character.)

1967
01:44:39,663 --> 01:44:41,362
(This song was a hit...)

1968
01:44:41,363 --> 01:44:43,434
(thanks to the addictive melody and choreography.)

1969
01:44:43,634 --> 01:44:45,303
(She watches her old self performing.)

1970
01:44:45,304 --> 01:44:47,333
(She bursts into laughter.)

1971
01:44:48,104 --> 01:44:50,443
As if I knew anything about love at that time.

1972
01:44:50,573 --> 01:44:52,714
(They were 22, 24, 23, and 20.)

1973
01:44:53,113 --> 01:44:54,573
Let's go!

1974
01:44:55,174 --> 01:44:57,582
(In this signature summer song, they showed off...)

1975
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:59,953
(their healthy bodies and freshness.)

1976
01:45:00,514 --> 01:45:03,754
There are definite charms to performing as a group.

1977
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:08,193
But my songs have a completely different vibe.

1978
01:45:08,724 --> 01:45:11,264
I really like "Dally" too.

1979
01:45:12,863 --> 01:45:16,233
The music video is a bit R-rated. Is that okay?

1980
01:45:16,804 --> 01:45:18,303
(This song became a hit...)

1981
01:45:18,304 --> 01:45:21,304
(thanks to its artistic beats and her extraordinary performance.)

1982
01:45:21,674 --> 01:45:23,274
(She's watching all the music videos.)

1983
01:45:23,674 --> 01:45:27,674
("Layin' Low" was ranked number 1 globally.)

1984
01:45:27,873 --> 01:45:30,383
(She's busy preparing notes before her meeting.)

1985
01:45:30,384 --> 01:45:32,313
If I'm going to perform SISTAR's songs,

1986
01:45:32,314 --> 01:45:34,753
it'll be "Alone" or "Touch My Body".

1987
01:45:34,754 --> 01:45:37,122
As for my own songs,

1988
01:45:37,123 --> 01:45:39,524
I've picked out the famous ones.

1989
01:45:39,823 --> 01:45:42,424
So these are my options.

1990
01:45:42,493 --> 01:45:45,162
I have to choose my songs soon...

1991
01:45:45,163 --> 01:45:48,032
so that I can work on the arrangement, practice,

1992
01:45:48,033 --> 01:45:51,402
come up with the theme, and buy the props as well.

1993
01:45:51,403 --> 01:45:54,833
(She has a lot on her mind since she's performing alone.)

1994
01:45:55,333 --> 01:45:56,572
I struggled a lot at first.

1995
01:45:56,573 --> 01:45:59,104
I was new at it, so I lacked so much.

1996
01:45:59,674 --> 01:46:01,473
I realized that I didn't do much compared to the work...

1997
01:46:01,474 --> 01:46:02,714
everyone else had to put in.

1998
01:46:03,083 --> 01:46:06,413
I had really underestimated showbiz.

1999
01:46:06,983 --> 01:46:11,753
(Eight years after her début, she decided to go solo.)

2000
01:46:11,754 --> 01:46:14,653
(I still have a lot to learn, but I've decided to go solo.)

2001
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:18,893
(Her fans trusted and supported her decision.)

2002
01:46:18,894 --> 01:46:20,663
(She wants to pay them back with her own type of songs.)

2003
01:46:20,693 --> 01:46:22,232
"Why did I decide to go solo?"

2004
01:46:22,233 --> 01:46:25,033
"I really had no idea what it took."

2005
01:46:25,304 --> 01:46:26,873
But now, I'm used to it.

2006
01:46:27,403 --> 01:46:28,902
I'm very used to it.

2007
01:46:28,903 --> 01:46:30,004
(She has matured a bit more now.)

2008
01:46:30,573 --> 01:46:32,573
After much thought,

2009
01:46:32,814 --> 01:46:36,183
I thought they'd be the happiest to hear...

2010
01:46:36,184 --> 01:46:38,583
SISTAR's songs.

2011
01:46:39,014 --> 01:46:40,883
Have you picked out some songs?

2012
01:46:40,884 --> 01:46:43,853
SISTAR's songs are known to be exciting and pleasant.

2013
01:46:43,854 --> 01:46:46,122
- And refreshing. - Right.

2014
01:46:46,123 --> 01:46:48,952
I think that would be better,

2015
01:46:48,953 --> 01:46:50,724
so I picked...

2016
01:46:51,224 --> 01:46:52,993
"Touch My Body".

2017
01:46:53,493 --> 01:46:54,993
That's a good one.

2018
01:46:55,064 --> 01:46:57,902
Since this match was about our signature songs,

2019
01:46:57,903 --> 01:46:59,732
I wanted the audience...

2020
01:46:59,733 --> 01:47:03,203
to be content with the stage and not only me.

2021
01:47:03,504 --> 01:47:06,174
Let me tell you the overall concept.

2022
01:47:06,474 --> 01:47:10,144
I live in paradise, and I like festivals and parties.

2023
01:47:10,443 --> 01:47:12,413
- Are you the queen? - Not really.

2024
01:47:12,714 --> 01:47:14,983
How do I put it? A party host?

2025
01:47:19,394 --> 01:47:21,524
(She listens to the song even while driving.)

2026
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:24,464
(She sings relentlessly.)

2027
01:47:24,564 --> 01:47:28,333
(She's having a blast driving alone.)

2028
01:47:28,793 --> 01:47:31,504
I didn't know a place like this existed.

2029
01:47:32,774 --> 01:47:33,872
Is this artificial?

2030
01:47:33,873 --> 01:47:35,233
(Why did she set aside time to come here?)

2031
01:47:35,533 --> 01:47:36,974
This one's pretty too.

2032
01:47:38,104 --> 01:47:40,373
It's like an imaginary paradise.

2033
01:47:40,814 --> 01:47:44,213
I want some green leaves. I also want...

2034
01:47:44,214 --> 01:47:48,814
an LED waterfall and some colourful flowers.

2035
01:47:48,913 --> 01:47:50,384
There's a lot to prepare.

2036
01:47:52,384 --> 01:47:53,822
I can't do this alone.

2037
01:47:53,823 --> 01:47:56,792
(She picks out the props herself to make the perfect performance.)

2038
01:47:56,793 --> 01:47:58,823
(She gathers all the colourful flowers.)

2039
01:47:59,224 --> 01:48:01,933
After deciding on the song,

2040
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:04,863
I thought it'd be nice to have a tropical theme.

2041
01:48:05,033 --> 01:48:08,273
So I went to the flower market, bought the flowers myself,

2042
01:48:08,274 --> 01:48:09,373
and created the stage.

2043
01:48:09,573 --> 01:48:12,274
I've purchased all the samples.

2044
01:48:12,543 --> 01:48:13,943
How do I turn this off?

2045
01:48:14,844 --> 01:48:15,844
(Looking around)

2046
01:48:15,845 --> 01:48:17,884
How do I turn off the camera? Is this it?

2047
01:48:18,644 --> 01:48:21,983
(Where is this busy lady headed next?)

2048
01:48:22,083 --> 01:48:24,823
You bought a bouquet of flowers.

2049
01:48:24,953 --> 01:48:26,822
This is all I can give you.

2050
01:48:26,823 --> 01:48:28,594
- Thank you. - It's quite heavy.

2051
01:48:29,153 --> 01:48:31,263
- Meanwhile... - Do you want to have a meeting?

2052
01:48:31,264 --> 01:48:33,593
- What do you think? - It suits you perfectly.

2053
01:48:33,594 --> 01:48:34,693
Really?

2054
01:48:34,894 --> 01:48:37,303
Thankfully, we have LED lights...

2055
01:48:37,304 --> 01:48:39,264
and paths on the sides.

2056
01:48:39,604 --> 01:48:41,503
There are stairs on the sides too.

2057
01:48:41,504 --> 01:48:46,243
I want to be able to use all of them.

2058
01:48:46,514 --> 01:48:48,513
I want the audience...

2059
01:48:48,514 --> 01:48:50,482
to be satisfied with my performance.

2060
01:48:50,483 --> 01:48:52,143
I want them to like what they see.

2061
01:48:52,144 --> 01:48:54,184
That's our assignment.

2062
01:48:54,254 --> 01:48:56,523
Show us the original version.

2063
01:48:56,524 --> 01:48:58,653
What for? I'm embarrassed.

2064
01:48:58,754 --> 01:49:00,953
(They really want to see it.)

2065
01:49:03,323 --> 01:49:05,424
(She gets into character.)

2066
01:49:06,033 --> 01:49:08,064
(This song makes anyone want to dance.)

2067
01:49:08,733 --> 01:49:12,033
(They're mesmerized by her dance moves.)

2068
01:49:14,304 --> 01:49:16,603
(The original singer has some fancy footwork.)

2069
01:49:16,604 --> 01:49:19,643
(You're amazing.)

2070
01:49:19,644 --> 01:49:21,113
(She's embarrassed.)

2071
01:49:21,174 --> 01:49:24,013
Many people know this song.

2072
01:49:24,014 --> 01:49:27,213
I hope the image I have in my head...

2073
01:49:27,214 --> 01:49:29,684
will be exactly portrayed through my performance.

2074
01:49:29,854 --> 01:49:33,493
Then there would be nothing more I could ask for.

2075
01:49:34,594 --> 01:49:37,822
I will do my best to show you the imaginary paradise...

2076
01:49:37,823 --> 01:49:41,033
I have in my head during this first match.

2077
01:49:41,564 --> 01:49:43,964
That's the only choice I have.

2078
01:49:44,934 --> 01:49:49,373
Let's meet the second performer.

2079
01:49:51,703 --> 01:49:54,242
She's the former leader of SISTAR, the legendary summer queens.

2080
01:49:54,243 --> 01:49:58,042
Now, she's back as a fierce solo queen. It's HYOLYN.

2081
01:49:58,043 --> 01:50:01,113
(Good luck, HYOLYN.)

2082
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:04,054
Let's watch her performance now.

2083
01:50:04,184 --> 01:50:06,224
Run the world, HYOLYN.

2084
01:50:08,193 --> 01:50:10,024
- I wish I was in the audience. - Me too.

2085
01:50:10,224 --> 01:50:11,264
Me too.

2086
01:50:11,293 --> 01:50:12,893
I bet she'll be terrific.

2087
01:50:12,894 --> 01:50:13,992
Let's be motivated...

2088
01:50:13,993 --> 01:50:15,463
- by her performance. - Okay.

2089
01:50:15,464 --> 01:50:17,103
I bet it'll be like a wake-up call.

2090
01:50:17,104 --> 01:50:18,333
- Right. - Will we be okay?

2091
01:50:18,504 --> 01:50:21,274
- Please be gentle. - Please be gentle.

2092
01:50:21,403 --> 01:50:22,804
Good luck.

2093
01:50:23,844 --> 01:50:25,473
Let's be on standby.

2094
01:50:25,474 --> 01:50:27,943
(Amid the anticipation, HYOLYN appears.)

2095
01:50:32,113 --> 01:50:34,413
(She looks anxious.)

2096
01:50:34,913 --> 01:50:36,683
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

2097
01:50:36,684 --> 01:50:39,184
(What's going on?)

2098
01:50:39,693 --> 01:50:40,924
Are you okay?

2099
01:50:42,153 --> 01:50:44,493
(HYOLYN suddenly puts a stop to it and goes backstage.)

2100
01:50:47,134 --> 01:50:49,863
- Hold on. - Check.

2101
01:50:49,964 --> 01:50:55,073
(Will she be able to finish the performance with flying colours?)

2102
01:51:04,049 --> 01:51:05,978
- It already looks grand. - What's going on?

2103
01:51:05,979 --> 01:51:06,988
What's going on?

2104
01:51:07,618 --> 01:51:09,389
(She's tense.)

2105
01:51:22,969 --> 01:51:23,969
Isn't that a waterfall?

2106
01:51:25,368 --> 01:51:27,167
It's totally a summer theme.

2107
01:51:27,168 --> 01:51:31,339
("Touch My Body" by HYOLYN)

2108

(They cover their mouths in shock.)

2109
01:51:54,328 --> 01:51:55,667
She looks so laid back.

2110
01:51:55,668 --> 01:51:57,269
This is insane. I can't believe it.

2111
01:52:05,839 --> 01:52:07,508
She's so amazing!

2112
01:52:07,509 --> 01:52:08,648
Paradise!

2113
01:52:08,649 --> 01:52:09,719
My gosh!

2114
01:52:21,288 --> 01:52:22,288
Incredible.

2115
01:52:24,998 --> 01:52:26,129
HYOLYN...

2116
01:53:07,269 --> 01:53:08,439
Enjoy it.

2117
01:53:20,649 --> 01:53:22,248
Her stage is giving me goosebumps.

2118
01:53:30,429 --> 01:53:31,798
(Squealing)

2119
01:53:31,799 --> 01:53:33,368
This is so unfair!

2120
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:53,688
She's a true summer queen.

2121
01:53:53,689 --> 01:53:55,389
- That's enough. - What's going on?

2122
01:54:23,019 --> 01:54:24,378
She's so incredible.

(They're in love.)

2124

My gosh!

2125
01:55:01,948 --> 01:55:03,117
Unbelievable.

2126
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:04,418
It's a festival.

2127
01:55:08,788 --> 01:55:11,229
- She's should've gone last! - She's should've gone last!

Be gentle!

2129
01:55:36,049 --> 01:55:38,657
I know! She was so amazing!

2130
01:55:38,658 --> 01:55:40,258
What should we do?

2131
01:55:40,259 --> 01:55:42,288
(She tore up the stage!)

2132
01:55:42,358 --> 01:55:43,799
Did you see that?

2133
01:55:43,998 --> 01:55:45,058
We need to work harder...

2134
01:55:45,059 --> 01:55:46,327
- for the second match. - I understand.

2135
01:55:46,328 --> 01:55:47,768
You get it now, right?

2136
01:55:47,769 --> 01:55:49,028
Okay.

2137
01:55:49,769 --> 01:55:51,099
I want to go home.

2138
01:55:51,439 --> 01:55:52,838
I'm suddenly so intimidated.

2139
01:55:52,839 --> 01:55:54,407
That was grand. She has my respect.

2140
01:55:54,408 --> 01:55:57,638
Kep1er is next. I bet they feel burdened.

2141
01:55:57,639 --> 01:56:00,309
I agree. Even we feel burdened.

2142
01:56:00,448 --> 01:56:01,747
Don't be burdened.

2143
01:56:01,748 --> 01:56:04,378
It's an honour to be performing side by side with her.

2144
01:56:04,379 --> 01:56:05,448
- Right. - I agree.

2145
01:56:05,849 --> 01:56:09,649
In the intro, she began the performance...

2146
01:56:10,288 --> 01:56:12,118
by saying, "Welcome to paradise."

2147
01:56:14,658 --> 01:56:16,799
That was the cue for the festival.

2148
01:56:16,899 --> 01:56:20,998
Watching her live performance was so exciting.

2149
01:56:21,229 --> 01:56:25,769
I couldn't believe she filled up that huge stage by herself.

2150
01:56:29,809 --> 01:56:32,078
Are your boots okay? Are they better now?

2151
01:56:33,479 --> 01:56:34,509
Darn it.

2152
01:56:35,809 --> 01:56:37,577
I couldn't stop worrying about them.

2153
01:56:37,578 --> 01:56:39,417
I was on the lift,

2154
01:56:39,418 --> 01:56:42,519
and it lifted me up to the stage.

2155
01:56:42,748 --> 01:56:45,088
I crouched and got ready.

2156
01:56:45,089 --> 01:56:48,157
That was when one of the heels ripped apart.

2157
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:50,028
I looked at it,

2158
01:56:50,198 --> 01:56:53,599
and the heel was completely separated.

2159
01:56:53,828 --> 01:56:56,799
Since the choreography was pretty dynamic,

2160
01:56:57,139 --> 01:56:59,438
I knew there was no going back...

2161
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:01,738
if I just went through with it...

2162
01:57:01,969 --> 01:57:03,237
and got badly injured.

2163
01:57:03,238 --> 01:57:05,778
Because I only had one chance to perform.

2164
01:57:06,809 --> 01:57:08,077
(After taking temporary measures, she went back onto the stage.)

2165
01:57:08,078 --> 01:57:10,349
I was sad and worried.

2166
01:57:12,448 --> 01:57:14,988
But thankfully,

2167
01:57:15,189 --> 01:57:18,388
I think the audience understood...

2168
01:57:18,389 --> 01:57:20,728
the thoughts and determination I had...

2169
01:57:20,729 --> 01:57:23,698
before getting up there to perform.

2170
01:57:24,958 --> 01:57:25,997
So...

01:57:25,998 --> 01:57:27,068
(They gave her a standing ovation for her hard work.)

2172
01:57:28,129 --> 01:57:29,769
I was truly thankful.

2173
01:57:31,269 --> 01:57:33,607
Don't you feel less nervous?

2174
01:57:33,608 --> 01:57:35,238
We should enjoy our performance too.

2175
01:57:35,509 --> 01:57:37,577
We're her sisters.

2176
01:57:37,578 --> 01:57:40,247
- You're right. - So I feel proud of her.

2177
01:57:40,248 --> 01:57:42,178
- I'm getting teary-eyed. - I have so much respect for her.

- Me too. - Me too.
