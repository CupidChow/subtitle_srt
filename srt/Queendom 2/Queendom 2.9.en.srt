It's "Love of a Thousand Years" by Park Wan Kyu.

I think they wrote this because of Minyoung.

641
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,798
What does it say?

642
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,238
- "UJUNG's Queen, Queen WJSN..." - Queen.

643
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,239
"will become everyone's queen."

644
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:19,147
- My gosh. - Thank you UJUNG.

645
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:20,847
This is so touching.

646
00:28:20,848 --> 00:28:22,519
My goodness.

647
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:26,549
Before we officially say hello again,

648
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:28,718
we prepared a gift...

649
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:31,018
- for the online meeting. - Right.

650
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:34,029
- Should I bring it in? - Can the gift come in?

651
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:36,127
- The gift! - The gift!

652
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:37,798
- Come on out. - Come out, gift!

653
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,998
- Come on in. - Should we bring it in?

654
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:42,539
- Come in. - Does the gift walk?

655
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:45,739
Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm embarrassed.

656
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:47,368
(What is it?)

657
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:49,837

(but UJUNG breaks out in smiles.)

659

(Bona went from WJSN's confident center...)

665
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,299
(to actress Kim Ji Yeon, who is loved by the entire nation.)

666
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,499
(She's a multi-faceted character who has various charms.)

(Everyone has been waiting for Bona to join Queendom 2.)

Hello. I'm Bona, and I've returned to my normal job.

(We've been waiting for you.)

671
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:31,348
There's no greater gift than her for UJUNG.

672
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:35,318
I'm so grateful that UJUNG has been waiting for me for so long.

673
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,158
It felt a bit strange.

674
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,488
The eight of you were sitting down, and I walked in from over there.

675
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,697
It was an awkward sight for us,

676
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,499
so I felt a bit awkward.

677
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,498
Why don't we all say hello again? Two, three.

678
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:50,499
- Would you like! - Would you like!

679
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,068
- Hello, we're WJSN! - Hello, we're WJSN!

680

(UJUNG's Queens, Queen WJSN will become everyone's queen.)

681
00:29:55,608 --> 00:29:59,607
We were planning this as an online surprise.

682
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:02,548
But we got surprised instead.

683
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:05,488
I know. I was totally fooled on my first shoot.

684

(Queendom 2... Not even the first shoot is easy.)

(Bona is waiting.)

687
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:10,888
What is it?

688
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:12,989
What is it? I'm curious!

689
00:30:13,588 --> 00:30:16,098
I was so surprised.

690
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:17,798
It's not a video?

691
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,969
They're here in person?

692
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:22,168
What? I wish I got more dressed up!

693
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:25,708
It's been so long since we've seen each other. Isn't this nice?

694
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:26,938
- Yes. - Yes.

695
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:31,378
There's a reason why we're all here today.

696
00:30:31,638 --> 00:30:33,347
We were told that when you came in,

697
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:37,448
you wrote what kind of performance you wanted to see on Queendom 2.

698
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,248
- Can you bring the panel in? - Bring it in.

699
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:40,417
(The panel is coming in.)

700
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:41,549
Come on in!

701
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:46,489
These are the songs that UJUNG chose.

702
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,229
- They like touching songs. - Right.

703
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:55,769
I'm sorry, everyone. We're choosing them seriously.

704
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:58,137
"Characteristics of real women."

705
00:30:58,138 --> 00:31:00,039
"Any song that WJSN sings will be good."

706
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:01,868
- Gosh. - I like that.

707
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:06,509
Eun Seo chooses "Renaissance".

708
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:12,148
"My most beautiful days That name is you."

709
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:15,248
"My most brilliant season, You were in the center of it."

710
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:18,519
"If there was anyone who was okay after hearing these lyrics,"

711
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,059
"come on out!"

712
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:23,127
"Come on out!"

713
00:31:23,128 --> 00:31:24,398
There's nobody.

714
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:28,697
I think only WJSN can do this song. "Pantomime". I love you.

715
00:31:28,698 --> 00:31:30,637
(A song in WJSN's 8th mini-album, "Pantomime")

716
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,837
"Masquerade."

717
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:33,607
(A song in WJSN's 5th mini-album, "Masquerade")

718
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:36,708
"I believe we could see a different performance."

719
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,208
"The song I want to hear again..."

720
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:41,209
"A performance that will show more of WJSN's charms."

721
00:31:41,348 --> 00:31:45,417
Even if my skull gets cracked open, it's "Pantomime".

722
00:31:45,418 --> 00:31:46,947
Skull?

723
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,489
Do you mean skill?

724
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:50,587
Let me say something.

725
00:31:50,588 --> 00:31:52,958
"Pantomime" will end everything...

726
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:56,498
once Luda sings, "suffocating mute."

727
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,857
(Agreed)

728
00:31:57,858 --> 00:31:59,798
I think we need to be take a unique approach...

729
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,728
to get the chance to win this!

730
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:03,539
(Getting heated up in the meeting for their song selection)

731
00:32:03,698 --> 00:32:06,368
Think of the hard work of the songwriters of "Pantomime"!

732
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:09,009
Eunseo, come back here. Calm down.

733
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:14,778
Whatever song it may be, we're going to put on...

734
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:17,677
a much better performance than you expect, UJUNG.

735
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:19,187
- Thank you so much, everyone. - We can do it.

736
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,847
Thank you all.

737
00:32:20,848 --> 00:32:24,219
- We are WJSN. - Thank you.

738
00:32:25,418 --> 00:32:27,788
It was heartwarming when we met UJUNG.

739
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:29,028
I never imagined...

740
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:31,728
we'd be doing it together.

741
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:35,768
They really thought our performance through.

742
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:39,539
I was amazed by them and I was really grateful once again.

743
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:42,579
Thank you for coming.

744
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:45,579
Thank you! I want to stay here for an hour.

745
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:49,018
I think this performance is something...

(Instead of just dancing without energy)

764

We could do something like this.

I'm sad, but I'm still going to move forward.

00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:24,797
from the 1st and 2nd match.

961
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:26,428
I really want to do my best and win this round.

962
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:30,367
Everyone only remembers the first-place winner.

963
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,499
So I think we should show them what we're made of.

964
00:41:35,738 --> 00:41:38,777
Because this is the last preliminary match before the finals,

965
00:41:38,778 --> 00:41:40,277
since we already got this far,

966
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:42,818
we want to take the glorious victory in the last match.

967
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:50,257
We've been going down 1 rank at a time since the 1st match.

968
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,528
I don't like this flow, so we'll turn the tables around.

969
00:41:56,629 --> 00:42:00,468
I hope people realize that we really prepared hard for this.

970
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:03,597
I hope the message of our performance...

971
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:06,039
will be strongly imprinted in their minds.

972

Because this could be our last.

973

We performed sincerely from our hearts.

974

I heard they really put in a lot of effort into this...

1024
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:36,888
after hearing the voices of the fans.

1025
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:38,289
I'm curious.

1026
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:42,228
As significant as it is, there must be a lot of points at stake.

1027
00:44:42,229 --> 00:44:45,598
That's right. The points they'll receive from the third match are...

1028
00:44:45,698 --> 00:44:48,928
a maximum of 5,000 points for Round 1, Position Unit Battle...

We need to catch up.

1036

Today is really important.

1037
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:06,749
The order of FANtastic Queendom for the 15,000 points...

1038
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:09,718
will be composed of 9,000 points from the on-site judges,

1039

a total of 5,000 points from the global judges,

and 1,000 points from the self-assessment in Queendom 2...

1041

to be summed up in total.

1042
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:19,228
That's huge.

1043
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:21,329
It changed from 6,000 to 9,000 points.

1044
00:45:21,698 --> 00:45:23,399
The on-site points are really important.

1045

01:08:01,888 --> 01:08:03,359
so that I can deliver this feeling with love to you.

1432
01:08:07,059 --> 01:08:09,328
We had a complicated feeling...

1433
01:08:09,329 --> 01:08:11,698
after the first match performance.

1434
01:08:12,868 --> 01:08:15,769
But we know how hard you worked on it.

1435
01:08:17,238 --> 01:08:20,009
(Sharing their thoughts with a trembling voice)

1436
01:08:20,339 --> 01:08:23,147
I just turned 20...

1437
01:08:23,148 --> 01:08:26,419
and I liked you since I was in sixth grade.

1438
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:32,058
Honestly, last year, it was a difficult time for us to wait,

1439
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:35,388
even though it was not as much as you.

1440
01:08:35,389 --> 01:08:40,898
I wanted to thank you for coming back to us.

1441
01:08:41,568 --> 01:08:43,868
I love you and thank you always.

1442
01:08:44,639 --> 01:08:46,398
(We know how sincere "Love you and thank you" means.)

1443
01:08:46,599 --> 01:08:48,969
We won't make you wait anymore.

1444
01:08:53,408 --> 01:08:57,849
We always waited to meet them closer...

1445
01:08:58,749 --> 01:09:03,349
and it was so much better meeting them on the spot.

1446
01:09:03,688 --> 01:09:07,419
And I think the warm conversation we shared here...

1447
01:09:07,558 --> 01:09:10,857
would give us the motivation...

1448
01:09:10,858 --> 01:09:12,959
and the strength for our future moves.

1449
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:16,397
So, this day really charged our energy.

1450
01:09:16,398 --> 01:09:18,568
(And so they charged each other with love that night.)

1451
01:09:19,539 --> 01:09:20,968
(That night at VIVIZ's agency)

1452
01:09:20,969 --> 01:09:24,508
The fans recommended a song...

1453
01:09:24,509 --> 01:09:25,679
- for the third match, earlier. - They did.

1454
01:09:26,808 --> 01:09:29,248
(Na.V knows VIVIZ more than VIVIZ themselves.)

1455
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:32,517
(Na.V's recommended song list has been created...)

1456
01:09:32,518 --> 01:09:34,618
(filled with their hearts.)

1457
01:09:34,988 --> 01:09:36,389
They are diverse.

1458
01:09:36,419 --> 01:09:38,617
There is "Lemonade".

1459
01:09:38,618 --> 01:09:41,658
"We want to see it performed with VIVIZ's refreshing charms."

1460
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:44,599
There's "Love You Like".

1461
01:09:44,658 --> 01:09:47,357
"We got a lot more love that we deserve."

1462
01:09:47,358 --> 01:09:49,568
"We want to see it performed as VIVIZ's dedication to the fans."

1463
01:09:51,299 --> 01:09:53,598
So many recommended "BOP BOP!".

1464
01:09:53,599 --> 01:09:56,509
(Their début song "BOP BOP!" was recommended the most.)

1465
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:59,638
I think it is a song that can show who VIVIZ is...

1466
01:09:59,639 --> 01:10:01,947
and it can also show various sides of VIVIZ.

1467
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,679
- I agree. - Yes.

1468
01:10:03,879 --> 01:10:05,179
I think "BOP BOP!" is the right choice.

1469
01:10:05,379 --> 01:10:07,117
(I like it too.)

1470
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:09,647
I think we craved this moment...

1471
01:10:09,648 --> 01:10:12,687
in showing the "BOP BOP!" performance...

1472
01:10:12,688 --> 01:10:15,188
on Queendom because honestly...

1473
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:17,158
- Na.V. - Na.V.

1474
01:10:17,289 --> 01:10:18,328
Thank you.

1475
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:21,328
- We thought we could somehow... - I thought we could be together.

1476
01:10:21,329 --> 01:10:22,767
Be together for this début performance...

1477
01:10:22,768 --> 01:10:24,698
It was unfortunate that we couldn't be together, but...

1478
01:10:25,999 --> 01:10:28,737
"BOP BOP!" is our début song.

1479
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:29,968
But because of the pandemic...

1480
01:10:29,969 --> 01:10:33,438
we were not able to perform this song on stage for our fans.

1481
01:10:34,379 --> 01:10:37,478
And even though the first and second performances...

1482
01:10:38,518 --> 01:10:43,018
were great and we prepared so hard for them,

1483
01:10:43,749 --> 01:10:49,759
they were songs you were forced to compare to the original.

1484
01:10:50,629 --> 01:10:54,197
So, for the third match, we wanted to show VIVIZ's song...

1485
01:10:54,198 --> 01:10:55,799
performed by VIVIZ.

1486
01:10:55,898 --> 01:10:59,067
(Following this feeling to do better...)

1487
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:01,938
(they are practicing "BOP BOP!" real hard.)

1488
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:07,509
(VIVIZ is practicing harder so that they can give Na.V more energy.)

1489
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:11,818
(This is tough.)

1490
01:11:11,948 --> 01:11:13,777
- Sir. - Yes?

1491
01:11:13,778 --> 01:11:16,447
- The arrangement has changed... - Yes.

1492
01:11:16,448 --> 01:11:18,788
And I think having the same choreography for the chorus...

1493
01:11:18,789 --> 01:11:20,289
doesn't seem to liven up the performance.

1494
01:11:20,558 --> 01:11:22,157
(Meaning: Please, help us.)

1495
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:23,227
(The choreography teacher...)

1496
01:11:23,228 --> 01:11:24,759
(as well as the doctor)

1497
01:11:24,799 --> 01:11:28,697
Rather than being powerful from start to end,

1498
01:11:28,698 --> 01:11:30,897
I think doing something unexpected like this...

1499
01:11:30,898 --> 01:11:32,099
(Do you know this feeling?)

1500
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:36,969
As long as it leads in smoothly with the next choreography.

1501
01:11:37,308 --> 01:11:39,408
It looks a bit weak right now,

1502
01:11:39,639 --> 01:11:43,778
so I think it's better to have a storyline added.

1503
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:47,378
I think it'd be more effective if we all go on stage together.

1504
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:49,219
I wish there was a wow moment.

1505
01:11:49,448 --> 01:11:51,759
I hope it's more energetic.

1506
01:11:52,459 --> 01:11:55,388
One, two, and three.

1507
01:11:55,389 --> 01:11:57,959
Two and... I think it should go like this.

1508
01:11:58,028 --> 01:12:00,658
Let's try it again together. Five, six, seven, and eight.

1509
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:03,768
Bop, bop, and feel the music

1510
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:06,099
(The exciting dance moves are done.)

1511
01:12:06,799 --> 01:12:09,108
Sir, by the way...

1512
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:11,169
I have one more request.

1513
01:12:11,438 --> 01:12:13,778
You know how we jump when it goes, "About to explode."

1514
01:12:14,478 --> 01:12:16,778
(The draft choreography has the part where they jump during the chorus.)

1515
01:12:17,049 --> 01:12:19,249
I know it is cheerful and lovely,

1516
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,988
but I think it'd be better to have some cheerleading moves.

1517
01:12:22,188 --> 01:12:27,219
(Working on cheerleading-like jumps)

1518

- I like the kicking. - Right.

1519
01:12:29,889 --> 01:12:31,298
We have experience in this.

1520
01:12:31,299 --> 01:12:32,459
We can do this.

01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,669
(They used to kick a lot.)

1522

Five, six, seven, and eight. One and two.

Your legs are at a perfect angle.

1524

our performance with a few adjustments.

- Seven and eight. - No, I can't.

1539

Even if it's difficult, I want to practice hard...

1540
01:13:26,148 --> 01:13:29,618
to give a performance with impressive moves.

1541
01:13:29,889 --> 01:13:30,988
That's the plan.

1542
01:13:31,049 --> 01:13:33,158
Something like a lift.

She took off the crown of WJSN.

I found their performance really cool.

At the same time, they were very lovely and cheerful.

VIVIZ showed three completely different performances.

The first one was very touching.

We didn't make a single mistake.

We are very satisfied with our performance.

1650

For the first time, we performed a VIVIZ song.

1651

That's why we were delighted.

1652

1723
01:25:22,739 --> 01:25:25,537

(She's still not used to this.)

1725
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:27,909
The core?

1726
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:32,377
Until now, we showed them our colours.

1727
01:25:32,378 --> 01:25:33,417
Right.

1728
01:25:33,418 --> 01:25:37,587
Let's discuss what we should show them from now on.

1729
01:25:37,588 --> 01:25:40,417
I think "Pantomime" is...

1730
01:25:40,418 --> 01:25:45,287
UJUNG picked "Pantomime" and "Masquerade".

1731
01:25:45,288 --> 01:25:48,797
I think they picked "Masquerade" because of its distinct concept.

1732
01:25:48,798 --> 01:25:51,167
- As for "Pantomime", - The song.

1733
01:25:51,168 --> 01:25:53,398
The song itself is distinct.

1734
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:56,207
I'm leaning more toward "Pantomime".

1735
01:25:56,208 --> 01:25:58,537
We showed our colours enough...

1736
01:25:58,538 --> 01:26:00,909
through the previous three performances.

1737
01:26:01,939 --> 01:26:04,347
So now, I want to surprise them.

1738
01:26:04,348 --> 01:26:08,448
I think we're all leaning toward "Pantomime".

1739
01:26:08,449 --> 01:26:10,087
I like it.

1740
01:26:10,088 --> 01:26:11,618
Should we go with that then?

1741
01:26:11,619 --> 01:26:12,818
- Yes. - Okay.

1742
01:26:12,819 --> 01:26:15,188
UJUNG and WJSN's song of choice...

1743
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:16,558
for the third match is...

1744
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:17,989
"Pantomime".

1745
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:20,728
- Is this how you do it? - Yes.

1746
01:26:20,729 --> 01:26:21,729
Well done.

1747
01:26:22,059 --> 01:26:26,097
During our song meeting, we were given some papers.

1748
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:29,108
UJUNG gave us their feedback...

1749
01:26:29,109 --> 01:26:32,739
before leaving that day.

1750
01:26:33,378 --> 01:26:35,439
(When the fan meet was over...)

1751
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:36,748
Hold on.

1752
01:26:37,178 --> 01:26:43,088
(The fans shared the opinions of those who couldn't make it.)

1753
01:26:43,519 --> 01:26:46,189
- So... - No way.

1754
01:26:46,288 --> 01:26:49,058
I simplified it.

1755
01:26:49,059 --> 01:26:51,059
This is their feedback.

1756
01:26:51,329 --> 01:26:52,627
I like that one.

1757
01:26:52,628 --> 01:26:56,828
"A story that can be understood intuitively is important."

1758
01:26:56,829 --> 01:26:59,467
For our 1st and 2nd matches, we needed to explain.

1759
01:26:59,468 --> 01:27:03,268
- Right. It may have been tricky. - I agree.

1760
01:27:03,269 --> 01:27:06,978
This time, the story should be easy to understand.

1761
01:27:06,979 --> 01:27:09,878
Something that can be understood right away.

1762
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:12,618
"We'd like to see a different side to you than the ones we saw..."

1763
01:27:12,619 --> 01:27:14,717
"in the previous two matches."

1764
01:27:14,718 --> 01:27:17,488
I think they want to see...

1765
01:27:17,489 --> 01:27:19,787
- something new from us. - Exactly.

1766
01:27:19,788 --> 01:27:21,917
I think we've shown enough of our dreamy image...

1767
01:27:21,918 --> 01:27:25,028
- for the past six years. - I agree.

1768
01:27:25,029 --> 01:27:27,398
Let's challenge ourselves this time.

1769
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:29,698
I'd like it to be a real show.

1770
01:27:29,699 --> 01:27:32,637
Something related to musicals and festivals.

1771
01:27:32,638 --> 01:27:36,667
I want the entire audience to enjoy the performance with us.

1772
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,037
Even the lyrics of "Pantomime" talk about...

1773
01:27:38,038 --> 01:27:41,408
- setting ourselves free. - I love the lyrics.

1774
01:27:41,409 --> 01:27:44,207
- It'd be nice to express that. - Right.

1775
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:47,847
I want us to enjoy this performance.

1776
01:27:47,848 --> 01:27:50,148
Our fans should be able to have fun with us.

1777
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:53,087
Let's create posters like a Broadway show.

1778
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,358
We could actually use a curtain.

1779
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:59,558
How about this? When she moves her hand,

1780
01:27:59,559 --> 01:28:02,927
the LED lights will follow it. Butterflies could fly.

1781
01:28:02,928 --> 01:28:04,898
We have so many things we want to try out.

1782
01:28:04,899 --> 01:28:06,939
This will be fun. I think we can do well.

1783
01:28:07,598 --> 01:28:10,467
Our fans came up with these ideas,

1784
01:28:10,468 --> 01:28:14,278
so this is a very meaningful stage for us.

1785
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:17,178
That's why we want this performance to pass with flying colours.

1786
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:18,877
(A studio somewhere)

1787
01:28:18,878 --> 01:28:20,717
(Amazed)

1788
01:28:20,718 --> 01:28:21,979
How do you do that?

1789
01:28:22,178 --> 01:28:23,247
(They're watching aerial acrobatics.)

1790
01:28:23,248 --> 01:28:25,788
Now, spin.

1791
01:28:28,359 --> 01:28:30,329
(She's hesitant.)

1792
01:28:30,529 --> 01:28:31,558
It looks amazing.

1793
01:28:31,559 --> 01:28:33,529
We'll definitely win if we can do that.

1794
01:28:34,029 --> 01:28:35,828
If our theme is "a show",

1795
01:28:35,829 --> 01:28:39,967
we should hire actual aerial acrobats.

1796
01:28:39,968 --> 01:28:41,168
(That's a good idea.)

1797
01:28:41,468 --> 01:28:43,608
And we should learn it too.

1798
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:45,337
It's going to be fun.

1799
01:28:45,338 --> 01:28:47,079
Let's do it ourselves.

1800
01:28:47,309 --> 01:28:51,177
When people think of parades or shows,

1801
01:28:51,178 --> 01:28:54,318
they have a certain image in mind.

1802
01:28:54,319 --> 01:28:56,387
We wanted to break that image.

1803
01:28:56,388 --> 01:28:59,658
We wanted to show them something new.

1804
01:28:59,659 --> 01:29:01,217
We practiced with ropes.

1805
01:29:01,218 --> 01:29:05,159
We wanted to challenge ourselves with something new.

1806
01:29:05,288 --> 01:29:06,358
So...

1807
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:08,529
(Luda will show her rope performance.)

1808
01:29:08,899 --> 01:29:10,028
Like this?

1809
01:29:10,029 --> 01:29:11,229
(She's weak.)

1810
01:29:11,699 --> 01:29:13,769
I think she can do it.

1811
01:29:14,168 --> 01:29:15,668
(Please, Luda.)

1812
01:29:16,069 --> 01:29:18,007
(She carefully hangs on the rope.)

1813
01:29:18,008 --> 01:29:19,409
She's good.

1814
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,638
(She spins!)

1815
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:23,609
(And she's good!)

1816

(They all have the same expression.)

1817
01:29:26,718 --> 01:29:27,779
Hey.

1818
01:29:28,218 --> 01:29:29,587
(The downside of this is...)

1819
01:29:29,588 --> 01:29:30,688
I'm dizzy.

1820
01:29:30,689 --> 01:29:32,247
That was impressive!

1821
01:29:32,248 --> 01:29:34,018
Luda has innate talents.

1822
01:29:34,019 --> 01:29:35,619
Maybe it's because she's light.

1823
01:29:35,928 --> 01:29:39,858
I was reminded of the days when I played on swings and poles.

1824
01:29:39,859 --> 01:29:41,928
It was easier than I thought.

1825
01:29:42,258 --> 01:29:43,399
I love it.

1826
01:29:45,998 --> 01:29:47,699
You spun really well.

1827
01:29:47,838 --> 01:29:48,869
Let me try it.

(EXY gives it a try.)

(EXY had actually volunteered to do it.)

(Even her grip looks confident.)

1835
01:30:02,388 --> 01:30:03,388

Where do you get the strength to spin?

Hang on it. You're not hanging on it.

Crouch and spin.

(It won't work for her.)

1852

What should I do?

1853

I want to do a good job.

(She looks like an elegant swan.)

I need to look good while performing.

What if I forced myself to do it,

This isn't just any stage.

It's because you keep landing.

EXY is timider than you think.

2068
01:44:52,763 --> 01:44:55,132
But I don't think any of the groups...

2069
01:44:55,303 --> 01:44:56,773
performed alongside their fans.

2070
01:44:56,943 --> 01:44:58,473
Hello.

2071
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:12,183
She's grown on me.

2072
01:45:12,723 --> 01:45:13,723
Let's go!

2073
01:45:21,992 --> 01:45:23,162
This is driving me crazy.

2074
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:28,172
This could be our last performance.

2075
01:45:29,803 --> 01:45:32,473
If we come last again, it'll be the end for us.

2076
01:45:35,313 --> 01:45:38,281
It was a traumatic experience to be announced last place...

2077
01:45:38,282 --> 01:45:39,613
in front of everyone.

2078
01:45:40,653 --> 01:45:41,912
We'll have to go home.

2079
01:45:43,553 --> 01:45:45,952
We'll probably go back to where we used to be.

2080
01:45:51,893 --> 01:45:55,292
They must've struggled a lot while preparing for this.

2081
01:45:59,433 --> 01:46:01,272
- Good work. - Good work.

2082
01:46:01,273 --> 01:46:02,773
- Good work. - Good work.

2083
01:46:43,343 --> 01:46:44,541
One, two, three.

2084
01:46:44,542 --> 01:46:46,882
(This is Bona's first interview.)

2085
01:46:47,613 --> 01:46:49,081
(Eunseo becomes mischievous and finds her target.)

2086
01:46:49,082 --> 01:46:50,582
Look at the producer while answering his questions.

2087
01:46:51,153 --> 01:46:53,251
- What? - You shouldn't look at the camera.

2088
01:46:53,252 --> 01:46:54,893
You have to look at him.

2089
01:46:55,093 --> 01:46:56,452
I'll teach you.

2090
01:46:57,193 --> 01:46:58,893
So this is how it is.

2091
01:46:59,893 --> 01:47:02,193
Feel free to ask me for help.

2092
01:47:03,332 --> 01:47:05,802
- Seriously. - I'm lost for words.

2093
01:47:05,803 --> 01:47:07,172
You can ask me.

2094
01:47:08,032 --> 01:47:10,371
Which part are you struggling with the most?

2095
01:47:10,372 --> 01:47:12,071
This part is hard.

2096
01:47:12,072 --> 01:47:13,402
And so is this part.

2097
01:47:13,403 --> 01:47:15,671
You've been acting for too long. Come here.

2098
01:47:15,672 --> 01:47:17,281
(She's straightforward.)

2099
01:47:17,282 --> 01:47:18,381
(Queendom 2 is always full of laughter.)

2100
01:47:18,382 --> 01:47:20,183
(See you next week.)
