Hi, everyone.

(Queendom 2 and "Street Woman Fighter")

966

(I wonder which amazing team will join me.)

967
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:48,358
- Yes and yes. - Yes!

968
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,798
(I feel like we're going to win.)

969

In 5, 6... Are you laughing?

970

Hey.

971
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:56,938
(You shouldn't be smiling.)

(It's been a while since I've felt like this.)

973
00:40:05,538 --> 00:40:08,779
LOONA, please take your pick.

974
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:11,849
Let's go.

975
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:14,147
- Good luck. - Go for it.

976
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:16,018
- Please take your time. - Take your time.

977

(LOONA is the first to pick a song.)

978

(The next member, Eunji, is already in a dilemma.)

979
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:22,759
Let's go.

980
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:25,328
The weather is so wonderful, without a clue of how we're feeling.

981
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:28,267
We were really concerned if we'd really get...

982
00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:29,997
the song that we want.

983
00:40:29,998 --> 00:40:31,739
We felt gloomy when we started off.

984
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:34,368
So we have to make our decision here.

985
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:35,807
(They have to make their decision as soon as they start off.)

986
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,208
Hold on. Where are the spots?

987
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,648
(Three signboards on a crossroad)

988

("Envious", "KA-BOOM!", "Purr")

989
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:48,017
This is hard.

990
00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:49,088
(They need to go to the song they want.)

991

(The four girls are in a dilemma.)

992
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:52,388
If you think about what they said earlier,

993
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:54,429
I think LOONA...

994
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:57,457
(We want to do something...)

995
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:59,368
(with an energetic and hip vibe.)

996
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:02,569
(Or we even want to try something trendy.)

997
00:41:03,398 --> 00:41:05,598
They might pick number three.

998
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,838
Number 3? I think they'll pick number 1.

999
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,839
- Really? I think they'll pick no.2. - I think LOONA...

1000
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:13,048
But we have to keep in mind...

1001
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:15,148
that we said we wanted to team up with Kep1er.

1002
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,318
(Kep1er showed a passionate and powerful performance.)

1003
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:21,747
Their team and ours have a similar style in performance.

1004
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,818
When we perform together,

1005
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:26,658
we felt like we could blend in...

1006
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:29,029
and show a good performance together.

1007
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,127
When they were talking earlier,

1008
00:41:31,128 --> 00:41:33,497
I felt like we had a connection with them.

1009
00:41:33,498 --> 00:41:35,298
- They looked like they wanted us. - Yes, they went along with us.

1010
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:37,599
(Xiaoting learned dance sports.)

1012
00:41:41,808 --> 00:41:44,107
(LOONA and Kep1er seemed to have a connection.)

1013
00:41:44,108 --> 00:41:45,308
We'll get along.

1014

(We'll get along.)

1015
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:48,179
(She's unbelievable.)

1016
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:50,449
- They might not pick "Envious". - Right.

1017
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:52,278
I don't think we should pick "Envious" either.

1018
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:54,517
It would be hard to show our strength with that song.

1019
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:57,288
So I was thinking of "Purr" or "KA-BOOM!".

1020
00:41:57,518 --> 00:42:00,589
(What will LOONA pick?)

1021
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:04,099
Oh, my gosh. I still haven't decided yet.

Hold on.

1026
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:15,569
What do I do?

1027
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,948
If I choose a song that would get a lot of votes,

1028
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:23,077
I feel like I'd lose confidence when I get pushed out.

1029
00:42:23,078 --> 00:42:25,618
I feel like I'd be choosing a leftover song,

1030
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:26,849
so I was in a dilemma.

1031

(She's filled with concerns as she goes on her way.)

1032

- Okay. - We're sorry.

I didn't know you'd pick that.

1043

I thought you'd pick number one.

1044

We might get pushed out.

1045

Shall we show with our fingers which number to pick?

1046

- Sure. - In 1, 2, 3.

We really thought hard between "KA-BOOM!"...

and "Purr".

1050

"Purr" had a hip hop vibe.

1051

If we could re-interpret the song...

1052

with our own style of isolation dance,

1053
00:43:22,878 --> 00:43:26,949
we thought it would bring out better results, so we chose this.

1054
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,049
What do I do?

1055
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:31,248
My goodness.

1056
00:43:32,078 --> 00:43:34,388
She has to decide all by herself.

1057
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:36,719
But even if I make my decision...

1058
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:38,589
Is it "KA-BOOM!" or "Envious"?

1059
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,828
I don't think I'll have any choice.

What do I do?

Wait a second.

I can't change now, can I?

1065
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,239
Should I go up?

(They didn't predict Eunji's choice.)

1069
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,017
She chose a safe way.

1070

I feel like other high-ranking teams...

Hello.

What if no one comes here because it's so far away?

I thought about it, but if I picked the other two songs,

I feel like I might get pushed out.

I agree.

do we have to impress them?

What should we do for them to come to us?

We should look at them with gleaming eyes.

01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:35,316
- We're Galaxy Embracing... - We're Galaxy Embracing...

1761
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:36,816
- the Universe. - the Universe.

1762
01:12:36,817 --> 01:12:38,287
- We made it. - Okay.

1763
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:42,486
- First of all, you... - Yes.

1764
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:45,057
Want to sing a touching ballad song.

1765
01:12:45,058 --> 01:12:46,897
- You're considering other options. - Yes, but...

1766
01:12:46,898 --> 01:12:48,326
- I like ballad songs too. - Ballad.

1767
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:50,366
I'm searching for songs.

1768
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:53,537
Songs like "SSFWL" by OH MY GIRL.

1769
01:12:53,997 --> 01:12:58,838
(Classic sound, modern electronic dance, and lyrical lyrics)

1770
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:00,707
Will it be weird to sing it slowly?

1771
01:13:00,777 --> 01:13:04,847
(You know, love can tell right away)

1772
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:07,446
(That's what people say)

1773
01:13:07,447 --> 01:13:09,088
There's cuteness in dance songs.

1774
01:13:10,218 --> 01:13:12,786
How about choosing songs that...

1775
01:13:12,787 --> 01:13:15,857
- are related to the galaxy? - Sounds good.

1776
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,757
- There are many songs like that. - Yes.

1777
01:13:17,758 --> 01:13:20,157
"Love in the Milky Way Café" is related too.

1778
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:21,727
This song is fine.

1779
01:13:21,728 --> 01:13:23,398
(How about this?)

1780
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:25,566
That's fine too.

1781
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,838
"Across the Universe" by Baek Ye Rin.

1782
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:33,777
(A song that combines lonely vocals and instrumental performance)

1783
01:13:34,108 --> 01:13:37,847
Our three voices suit the song.

1784
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:39,648
I think it'll be nice to sing.

1785
01:13:39,877 --> 01:13:42,647
Red Velvet has sentimental songs too.

1786
01:13:42,648 --> 01:13:43,887
BTS.

1787
01:13:43,888 --> 01:13:45,187
SEVENTEEN.

1788
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:46,416
"Twenty-Five, Twenty-One".

1789
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:48,326
Jung Seung Hwan's songs.

1790
01:13:48,327 --> 01:13:50,626
"You in My Arms" by Yoo Jae Ha.

1791
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:51,727
That'll be good too.

1792
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:54,026
But girl band songs...

1793
01:13:54,027 --> 01:13:56,298
We'll never be able to choose a song like this.

1794
01:13:56,497 --> 01:13:58,736
It took some time.

1795
01:13:58,737 --> 01:14:02,036
It's not that we had different opinions.

1796
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:03,607
We had to choose...

1797
01:14:03,608 --> 01:14:06,007
the best song for us.

1798
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,047
I think we're very careful.

1799
01:14:08,048 --> 01:14:09,977
- We want to do our best. - Want to perform the best.

1800
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:12,746
The songs that we found aren't satisfying enough.

1801
01:14:12,747 --> 01:14:16,447
I think it'll be better if we find a more suitable song for us.

1802
01:14:16,548 --> 01:14:19,057
Let's not fix our song yet.

1803
01:14:19,058 --> 01:14:21,057
But we can perform "Across the Universe"...

1804
01:14:21,058 --> 01:14:22,457
for our interim checkup.

1805
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:25,097
We all know "Across the Universe".

1806
01:14:25,098 --> 01:14:26,597
It's not for our final stage,

1807
01:14:26,598 --> 01:14:29,166
but our voice, harmony, and charms...

1808
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:31,236
can be shown using this song.

1809
01:14:31,237 --> 01:14:33,036
It's like a teaser. Like an appetizer.

1810
01:14:33,037 --> 01:14:34,838
- A strategy to confuse them. - Yes.

1811
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,407
Now, we...

1812
01:14:38,577 --> 01:14:41,076
chose partners. Our unit name...

1813
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:43,478
(What's the unit name of LOONA and Kep1er?)

1814
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:46,277
Who's good at making names?

1815
01:14:46,478 --> 01:14:48,348
(I don't think I am.)

1816
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,848
(Looking blankly)

1817
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:51,487
Just say whatever comes to mind.

1818
01:14:51,588 --> 01:14:52,688
Try it.

1819
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:54,957
Queen's Face.

1820
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,486
Queen's Face.

1821
01:14:56,487 --> 01:14:58,196
(Well...)

1822
01:14:58,197 --> 01:14:59,397
I'm sorry.

1823
01:14:59,398 --> 01:15:01,927
- It's too long. - We're the sun.

1824
01:15:01,928 --> 01:15:04,167
- The sun. - The sun.

1825
01:15:04,798 --> 01:15:09,608
(The two suns that are symbolic in Kep1er's world view)

1826
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,576
- The sun. - Sun and Moon.

1827
01:15:13,577 --> 01:15:15,747
- Sun and Moon? - Sun and Moon. I love it.

1828
01:15:17,048 --> 01:15:20,718
(The moon symbolizes LOONA.)

1829
01:15:21,018 --> 01:15:23,387
- Sun and Moon? - Sun and Moon. I love it.

1830
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:24,388
- Sun and Moon? - Yes.

1831
01:15:24,389 --> 01:15:26,156
If that's our name, how about our chant?

1832
01:15:26,157 --> 01:15:28,027
I won't eat you if you give me rice cake.

1833
01:15:28,327 --> 01:15:29,657
- Not bad. - That's nice.

1834
01:15:29,888 --> 01:15:31,526
- It's our chant. - Nice.

1835
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,557
I imagined us chanting it.

1836
01:15:34,558 --> 01:15:35,597
- In 2 and 3. - In a cute tone.

1837
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:37,066
- We won't eat you... - We won't eat you...

1838
01:15:37,067 --> 01:15:38,968
- if you give us a vote. - if you give us a vote.

1839
01:15:39,037 --> 01:15:40,736
(Growl)

1840
01:15:40,737 --> 01:15:41,767
And?

1841
01:15:41,768 --> 01:15:44,776
So it's Sun and Moon. And we have our chant.

1842
01:15:44,777 --> 01:15:47,608
Now, it's time to choose a song.

1843
01:15:47,838 --> 01:15:49,906
- What about "Don't Go" by EXO? - Right.

1844
01:15:49,907 --> 01:15:51,048
Let's listen to it.

1845
01:15:51,077 --> 01:15:56,148
(It's a song with a dreamlike melody about the feeling of young love .)

1846
01:15:56,787 --> 01:15:58,317
It's beautiful when it's sung in harmony.

1847
01:15:58,657 --> 01:16:00,688
- We can sing this part in harmony. - And this.

1848
01:16:01,388 --> 01:16:02,687
(Lead me.)

1849
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:03,688
Like this.

1850
01:16:03,858 --> 01:16:04,928
I got goosebumps.

1851
01:16:04,997 --> 01:16:08,026
The biggest difference is that we have many members.

1852
01:16:08,027 --> 01:16:09,696
We have six members,

1853
01:16:09,697 --> 01:16:11,968
so we can create various harmonies.

1854
01:16:12,398 --> 01:16:15,438
"Don't Go" is a perfect song for that.

1855
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:19,178
(They choose "Don't Go".)

1856
01:16:20,178 --> 01:16:25,246
(The members of Sun and Moon try singing the song in harmony.)

1857

Take me with you

1858

Please don’t vanish even when the morning comes

1860
01:16:34,117 --> 01:16:35,327
This is nice.

1861
01:16:35,558 --> 01:16:37,827
- It sounds good with our voices. - I think it's nice.

1862
01:16:37,928 --> 01:16:40,358
- It's like a teen drama. - I know.

1863
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:42,526
This is really good.

1864
01:16:42,527 --> 01:16:43,768
By the way...

1865
01:16:43,997 --> 01:16:46,066
I think there must be something...

1866
01:16:46,067 --> 01:16:48,837
that would work better for us.

1867
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:49,867
(Ha Seul is still not sure about the song.)

1868
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:53,037
Let's try singing "Downpour". What do you think?

1869
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,608
- Then we can decide. - Sure. It still won't be too late.

1870
01:16:55,978 --> 01:17:01,446
("Downpour" is a ballad song with a sad melody about parting.)

1871

It’s just a passing downpour

1874

I think "Downpour" is pretty good.

It’s just a passing downpour

1879
01:17:35,188 --> 01:17:37,718
- I think this is nice. - I loved it.

1880
01:17:37,817 --> 01:17:41,526
I got really emotional singing the song.

1881
01:17:41,527 --> 01:17:43,987
But I think "Don't Go" is a better choice for a live performance.

1882
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:46,898
But "Downpour" is...

1883
01:17:47,058 --> 01:17:48,697
- I like "Downpour". - You like the feeling.

1884
01:17:48,827 --> 01:17:51,838
I still think "Don't Go" is better.

BOL4's song earlier.

I don't know the song well.

When you chose this song,

were you...

thinking about me, by any chance?

1894

It wasn't like that, was it?

1895
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:24,398
I could completely...

1896
01:18:24,838 --> 01:18:27,737
relate to the song from the beginning.

It reminded me of when I had hard times.

It felt like the song was consoling me.

1901

I guess HYOLYN felt the same way.

1902

Maybe that's why she wanted...

to sing the song with me.

Which part do you think...

suits you best?

I told them to stand tall and be confident...

They gave our unit unique charms that we didn't have.

Harmonizing was a cakewalk for them.

It's over ten years.

2397
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:43,150
I can just look at your eyes...

2398
01:44:43,909 --> 01:44:46,720
and tell which one of you will be terrible dancers.

2399
01:44:47,449 --> 01:44:49,179
(They train intensely...)

2400
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:51,549
(for this new genre.)

2401
01:44:51,550 --> 01:44:52,550
Well done.

2402
01:44:52,551 --> 01:44:53,619
Kick.

2403
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:56,590
- Drink some water. - Okay.

2404
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:57,890
She's going to collapse.

2405
01:44:58,230 --> 01:44:59,529
No. Again.

2406
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:02,029
- Focus. - Okay.

2407
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:05,369
I'm sorry if you're here just for the sake of it.

2408
01:45:05,669 --> 01:45:07,239
But that's not why I'm here.

2409
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:08,470
Right.

2410
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,309
I haven't felt this way...

2411
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,510
- in a while. - Me neither.

2412
01:45:12,209 --> 01:45:13,810
I'm getting teary-eyed.

2413
01:45:15,779 --> 01:45:20,079
(The 3rd match finally begins.)

2414
01:45:20,619 --> 01:45:22,948
Let's begin the 3rd match, Round 1...

2415
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:25,619
that everyone has been anticipating.

2416
01:45:25,919 --> 01:45:28,359
- Run the world, Queendom 2! - Queendom 2!

2417
01:45:31,529 --> 01:45:33,430
Let's put on a beautiful show.

2418
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:37,300
(The Vocalist Units are determined to win.)

2419
01:45:38,130 --> 01:45:39,769
If I were to be honest and objective,

2420
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:41,599
you're the main vocalist of your group.

2421
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,770
But I don't think you had that many chances to shine.

2422
01:45:44,909 --> 01:45:48,640
The audience will hold their breaths throughout our stage.

2423
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:51,150
Not because we're terrific,

2424
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:55,150
but because they're caught off guard.

2425
01:46:36,959 --> 01:46:37,988
This is fate.

2426
01:46:37,989 --> 01:46:39,159
- Yes. - I love it.

2427
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,059
We thought long and hard before buying these slippers.

2428
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:43,869
- Really? - They're so cute!

2429
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:46,600
- We really needed slippers. - We did.

2430
01:46:47,239 --> 01:46:48,640
They're so comfortable.

2431
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:51,270
- They're really soft. - They look good.

2432
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,739
- How cute. - We want you to be comfortable.

2433
01:46:52,869 --> 01:46:54,840
- I love them. - They're so comfortable.

2434
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:56,749
- You look cute. - They're so comfortable.

2435
01:46:56,909 --> 01:46:58,249
This is ours.

2436
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:01,118
We cooked the cookies and the brownies ourselves.

2437
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:02,418
- Really? - Really?

2438
01:47:02,419 --> 01:47:05,619
(They're truly surprised.)

2439
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:07,118
(One day before going to the workshop)

2440
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:08,988
- Baking. - Cooking time.

2441
01:47:08,989 --> 01:47:11,288
She's good at baking, and she'll be helping us.

2442
01:47:11,289 --> 01:47:14,198
- Let's bake for our seniors! - Yes.

2443
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:15,529
(Huening Bahiyyih will help them with the baking.)

2444
01:47:15,999 --> 01:47:18,029
- We prepared this. - These are the ingredients.

2445
01:47:18,369 --> 01:47:19,568
It looks like snow.

2446
01:47:19,569 --> 01:47:21,699
(They sweeten the dough.)

2447
01:47:21,970 --> 01:47:23,969
(They use their tiny hands.)

2448
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,908
(They put in their effort.)

2449
01:47:26,909 --> 01:47:29,940
(They poured their love into the cookies.)

2450
01:47:30,779 --> 01:47:32,349
Gosh.

2451
01:47:32,350 --> 01:47:33,680
This is delicious.

2452
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:35,449
(She likes it.)

2453
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,049
(She gives a big reaction.)

2454
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:40,118
It's tasty.

2455
01:47:40,119 --> 01:47:41,760
(She's proud.)

2456
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:44,459
This is better than the store-bought ones.

2457
01:47:45,289 --> 01:47:48,060
Really. I love the store-bought ones and this is even better.

2458
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,930
- That's a relief. - That's a relief.

2459
01:47:50,069 --> 01:47:53,340
(Look forward to Episode 6 for more of their sweet chemistry.)
