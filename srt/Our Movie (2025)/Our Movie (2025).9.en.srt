7
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,837
You made the right call.

8
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,715
You know how hard it was
to make this happen, right?

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,842
It's our best chance
at getting back on our feet.

10
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,721
Okay, I'll call you when I get back.

11
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,515
Yeah, see you in Seoul.

12
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,184
But that woman…

13
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,109
I'll deal with her.

14
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,444
You should probably hurry.

15
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,613
Well, time will take care of it.

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,575
See you.

17
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:52,279
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY HURRY.
WELL… TIME WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

EPISODE 9

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,911
The sun went down too fast.

20
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,872
I know.

21
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,999
I came here to see the sunset,

22
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,460
but I can't even remember
what color it was.

23
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,254
The sun did set, right?

24
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,551
Mr. Lee.

25
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,389
Your head's all over the place,
it feels like you're dreaming,

26
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:23,226
and your heart keeps racing, right?
Like you've done something wrong.

27
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,145
How did you know that?

28
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,147
I can feel it all.

29
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,444
I kept pretending not to notice

30
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,821
the feelings I have for you.

31
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,407
I was scared.

32
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,785
So was I.

33
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,953
Hmm?

34
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,789
Are you still scared?

35
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,083
No, I've forgotten all that.

36
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,878
Watching you stay strong
and smile all the time,

37
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,048
even when I know
it's been way harder for you,

38
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,967
it makes all the fear I had
feel like nothing.

39
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,553
Fear is never nothing.

40
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,682
You don't know what it's like.

41
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,769
Dying of fear that you might die,
even though you're not dying.

42
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,525
That feeling of wondering if
it's okay to love someone who's dying?

43
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,443
I don't know it either.

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,155
When you came running to me earlier,

45
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,283
I felt like my heart would burst.

46
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,162
But at the same time, it sank.

47
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,541
All this joy I feel now,

48
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,085
I'll probably forget it soon.

49
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,297
And the one left behind
will remember me without me.

50
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,927
So I keep wondering
if I'm allowed to revel in all of this.

51
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,348
Of course you are.

52
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,936
Me, of all people,
when I'm going to die soon?

53
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,857
Is it really okay for me to like you?

54
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,833
Is it okay…

55
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,629
for someone like me to like you?

56
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,675
Yes.

57
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,927
Let's just…

58
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,555
live in this moment.

59
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,391
I've made my decision.

60
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,268
Then you're in trouble.

61
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,897
You're about to be really happy.

62
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,254
Wow, it looks delicious.

63
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,007
Enjoy, everyone.

64
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,634
- Enjoy.
- Bon appétit.

65
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,346
- This is definitely a hot place to eat.
- Hmm?

66
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,598
You haven't even tried the food.

67
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,937
I can tell without eating.

68
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,524
You can tell from the vibe
that it's a hot spot.

69
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,608
Can't wait to dig in.

70
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,987
How come the four of you were together?

71
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,781
Ah…

72
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,157
Well…

73
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,577
Ms. Jo burned a hole in my coat
with her cigarette,

74
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,666
so she bought this for me yesterday,
and I wanted to thank her--

75
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,335
For goodness' sake.
Talk about dragging it out.

76
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,756
We ran into these two downtown,
had coffee, and were on our way back.

77
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,341
Ah.

78
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,676
And how did you two…

79
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,181
What were you doing together?

80
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,976
Uh…

81
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,019
Well…

82
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,402
Location scouting.

83
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,737
You know, the sunset was so beautiful.

84
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,615
Thought it might be
a good spot to shoot later.

85
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,035
Yes, the sunset… Very beautiful.

86
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,495
Being pink and all.

87
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,456
It was obviously orange.

88
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,501
- W-Well, orange and…
- Orange…

89
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,587
- Orangish pink.
- Yeah.

90
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,422
Orangish pink, right.

91
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,257
Like this kind of color, you know?

92
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,602
Jeha, can I ask you a question?

93
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,728
No.

94
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,521
- Just one.
- No.

95
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,315
- Just one!
- I said no.

96
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,068
Remember what I said last time?

97
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,654
You don't mind things you normally hate--

98
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,739
Quiet.

99
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,533
And you don't even get tired.

100
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,993
I'm tired now. A lot.

101
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,495
Man, that's strange.

102
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,333
Your voice is cold,
but that look on your face is warm.

103
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,793
I've never seen that look on you before.

104
00:06:58,877 --> 00:06:59,919
Jeha,

105
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,129
why were you…

106
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,757
holding Daeum's hand?

107
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,931
You saw that?

108
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,017
Of course I did! I have eyes.

109
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,227
Are you seeing Daeum?

110
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,563
Can you do that?

111
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,566
Can't I?

112
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,237
You could've at least talked to me first.

113
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,658
I'm supposed to protect
my artist's rights, you know.

114
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,285
I'm Daeum's manager after all.

115
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,995
Protecting her rights?

116
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,789
Sounds good.

117
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,915
Huh?

118
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,423
What's this camcorder…

119
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,217
Gosh, Daeum.

120
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,719
This thing…

121
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:11,616
Hey, Gyoyeong!

122
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,952
<i>Would you look at that?</i>

123
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,912
<i>You little…</i>

124
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,749
Could you be any more obvious?
And stop leaving your things about.

125
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,836
- Leave what around?
- <i>Your camcorder.</i>

126
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,130
It's in my hands.
How much is it worth to you?

127
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,882
Oh, I must've left it behind.
Hey, don't touch that.

128
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,010
But why aren't you in it? You're the lead.

129
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,846
Wait, did you watch it already?

130
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,889
You should've asked
your manager to film you.

131
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,851
I did ask him to film me,

132
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,935
but he's no good.

133
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,605
Guess this pro should step in
and do it for you.

134
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,818
No. Don't even think
about coming down here because of me.

135
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,404
You're too busy to even take a vacation.

136
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,866
Well, the shoot's by the sea anyway.

137
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,325
And my friend is there.

138
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,119
Sounds like a vacation.

139
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,835
You know,
your voice sounds weirdly excited.

140
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:08,840
What? What do you mean,
I sound excited?

141
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,179
I mean, are you really curious?

142
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,263
What?

143
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,390
<i>Maybe I'll tell you</i>

144
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,393
next time I'm home or not.

145
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,478
What should I do?

146
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,939
Wait, are you serious? Huh?

147
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,984
It's not something
I can tell you that easily.

148
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,444
<i>Tell me right now or else!</i>

149
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,322
Well, what happened was…

150
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,783
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

151
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,749
Over there.

152
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,833
Okay.

153
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,150
Here.

154
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,614
I'll do it. That was me.

155
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,218
Cut! That's good to go.
Well done, everyone.

156
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,388
- Great work.
- Good job, everyone!

157
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,849
- Take some continuity shots.
- Great job!

158
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,309
I'm heading to Seoul now.

159
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,812
You're not thinking
of dying anymore, are you?

160
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,398
- You've been wearing that a lot.
- Hmm?

161
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,482
Oh.

162
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,360
Everyone says it looks good. Thanks again.

163
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,321
Why are you thanking me?
I said I'd buy it, so I did.

164
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,620
I thought maybe I should
shake Hyunsang's hand here.

165
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,331
Those two.

166
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,667
When do you think it started?

167
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,793
Mmm…

168
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,461
Not sure.

169
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,798
Let's go again
from "Thank you for pulling me out."

170
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,259
Wow, you're so oblivious.

171
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,387
How do you shoot so well
with that kind of awareness?

172
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,434
Well, I don't know
if I should be flattered or offended.

173
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,229
It was definitely since the team dinner.
My eyes are never wrong.

174
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,856
Just let it go.

175
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,399
What's the big deal?

176
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,943
People can catch feelings
when they work together.

177
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,446
That's a bit naive.

178
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,199
I just hope it doesn't blow up later.

179
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,583
Oh, Eunho, it's your last day, isn't it?

180
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,960
Yes.

181
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,087
Hang on. In that case…

182
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,215
do you want to shoot the final scene?

183
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,676
- I'll talk to Mr. Lee.
- Me?

184
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,303
Give it a go.

185
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,228
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

186
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,313
It's Eunho's last day today.

187
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,399
- Right.
- Could he shoot the last scene?

188
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,072
No, it's fine.

189
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,907
The production will relay it all.

190
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,033
Yeah.

191
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,120
Hello, everyone.

192
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,540
Yeah. Let me know
if there are any issues on set.

193
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,713
What brings you here?

194
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,591
Well, why haven't you done
anything about this?

195
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,678
You're the CEO here, Mr. Bu.

196
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,182
Why? What is it?

197
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,396
Planning to write up a scandal
about those two?

198
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,649
Man, that would be a disaster.

199
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,318
Production's barely just begun,

200
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,862
and the actress and the director
are caught up in a scandal!

201
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,823
Gosh, what a headache that would be!

202
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,200
The investors would all flip out over it.

203
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,287
Did you actually look at the photo?

204
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,872
That's a hospital. A university hospital.

205
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,875
There's plenty of room for interpretation.

206
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,629
Calm down. It's not like they were
in front of the OB-GYN or something.

207
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,549
Our medical consultant
is in that very hospital.

208
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,135
So the director and actress stopped by

209
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,929
to consult a big name in the industry.
What's the big deal?

210
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,306
Without her manager?

211
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,308
Just the two of them, asking for advice?

212
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,643
The manager could've waited in the car

213
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,603
or gone to the restroom.

214
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,814
What can you even prove with one photo?

215
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,941
It's way too vague.

216
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,777
And what were you doing at the hospital?

217
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,779
Well, I just…

218
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,073
Look at the <i>Terms of Jealousy</i> scandal.

219
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,451
That only sold more tickets for the movie.

220
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,785
Go ahead, break the story.

221
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,913
I really don't see how that'll hurt me.

222
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:57,920
Just stick to writing down
the tips you're fed, okay?

223
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,424
That's all you've ever done.
What's with the new act?

224
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,474
Does he take me for some kind of idiot?

225
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,190
<i>Sincerity.</i>

226
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,069
<i>I'm not asking</i>
<i>for something you don't have.</i>

227
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,654
We weren't always like this.

228
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,411
What happened to us?

229
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,874
Get some rest.

230
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,177
Yes?

231
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,061
Oh, man.

232
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,939
I couldn't last a month like I promised.

233
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,857
I'm heading to Seoul now.

234
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,568
You're not thinking
of dying anymore, are you?

235
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,696
Thank you for pulling me out.

236
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,573
You'd better be thankful.

237
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,619
There are so many things
you can only do when you're alive.

238
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,038
Take care of yourself.

239
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,290
I'll take care of myself too.

240
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,513
You make me want…

241
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,895
to keep living, Hyunsang.

242
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,527
<i>In your version of</i> Love in White…

243
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,988
does the ending…

244
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,158
stay the same?

245
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:54,829
No.

246
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,208
In the end…

247
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,005
In the end, she'll probably die.

248
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,387
- Cut.
- That's a cut.

249
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,973
Are we going with this?

250
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,099
Hang on a second.

251
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,064
THEN HOW ABOUT I…

252
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,161
Jungwoo, can I talk to you for a moment?

253
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,245
Sure, go ahead.

254
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:37,914
Uh…

255
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,667
What if Hyunsang stayed with Gyuwon

256
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,336
for just one more day?

257
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,546
Why? Would that mean much?

258
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,220
Isn't Hyunsang the kind of guy
who coldly walks away from a sick woman?

259
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,971
You're right. That's true, but…

260
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,016
I've been rethinking the ending.

261
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:02,104
Does that mean he loves her now,
like he did in the original?

262
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,858
Well, I'm on Team Original anyway.

263
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,193
I'll give it a try.

264
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:14,283
So you're thinking of leaving
the door open for Gyuwon and Hyunsang.

265
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,869
I'm still thinking about it.

266
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,872
I'm all for it.
That's what <i>Love in White</i> should be.

267
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:25,253
Then let's adjust the angle to make it
a bit more hopeful and beautiful.

268
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,130
You're scene's not over yet, Eunho.

269
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,716
Mr. Lee.

270
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,510
Yes?

271
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,307
- Go on.
- No, I'll tell you later.

272
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,060
Let's do it.

273
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,770
Thank you for pulling me out.

274
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,522
You'd better be thankful.

275
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,775
There are so many things
you can only do if you're alive.

276
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,486
Then how about I stay one more day?

277
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,030
Seems a shame to leave on this note.

278
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,409
I'd love that.

279
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,958
Cut! Okay.
That's good.

280
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,876
We're good to go!
That's it for today!

281
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,461
Great work, everyone!

282
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,131
- Well done, everyone.
- Great job.

283
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,883
- Good job.
- Great work!

284
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,468
- Great job!
- Well done!

285
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,928
Thank you.

286
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,889
Great work, everyone.

287
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,141
Great work.

288
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,644
Mr. Lee.

289
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,688
Great work today.

290
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,856
You did well too.

291
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,367
- You're going straight into another shoot?
- I take the work that comes in.

292
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,495
Guess I won't see you until spring.

293
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,331
Yeah.

294
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,793
I wanted to see
the cherry blossoms in Seoul with you.

295
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,379
But I know you wouldn't go with me.

296
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:53,924
I'm joking.

297
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,719
You know I can get clingy.

298
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,807
Eunho.

299
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,063
I'm glad I got to see you
one more time like this.

300
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,648
This won't be the last time.

301
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,651
You always act like it's the last time.
It hurts, you know.

302
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,698
Let's shake hands.

303
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,376
Take care of yourself, Eunho.

304
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,295
Take care of yourself, Daeum.

305
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,217
Ah. Why's your hand so cold?

306
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,655
He's gone, right?

307
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,906
Your first love.

308
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,784
Yes.

309
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,494
He's gone.

310
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,871
First love, long ago.

311
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,064
I feel at peace now that
my competition's out of the picture.

312
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,947
I'm a little worried, though.

313
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,117
What if you start acting
all petty and jealous?

314
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,036
Could you really be that type of guy?

315
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,330
All humans…

316
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,623
Well…

317
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,585
All men are the same.

318
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,171
Men?

319
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,339
Yes. Why? What?

320
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,343
Seriously, what's with you?

321
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,435
I don't know. Did I lose my mind?

322
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,562
That's cute.

323
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,856
Cute?

324
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,525
You acted jealous to make me laugh,
didn't you?

325
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,404
Yes, well…

326
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,740
I wanted to laugh too.

327
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,826
I think your laugh is funny.

328
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,081
You know, Mr. Lee…

329
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,920
Why did you change

330
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,172
that scene earlier?

331
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,508
I thought Hyunsang would feel different

332
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,303
when he looked at Gyuwon,
and would want to live now.

333
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,559
He'd want to stay by Gyuwon's side too.

334
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,812
Like you do?

335
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,525
Yes, like I do.

336
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,568
Looks like Gyuwon pulled it off.

337
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,646
Then…

338
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,899
do you think our movie's ending

339
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,777
could change as well?

340
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,407
I've been reading
my mother's original draft every day.

341
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,658
I keep wondering

342
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,994
why she chose that ending.

343
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,291
Even when she was dying
and her husband took her script,

344
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,169
why did she talk about love
as something beautiful?

345
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,715
That's why

346
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,969
I want to leave the ending of our movie
a little more open.

347
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,805
I want to take a deeper look at it.

348
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,807
Are you sure?

349
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,478
Will you help me?

350
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,357
We said we'd look for it together.

351
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:24,904
Yes, let's keep looking.

352
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,740
Together.

353
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,380
We've walked two laps already.

354
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,718
I used to do about 30
when I was in better shape.

355
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,972
And who did you walk 30 laps with?

356
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,850
Uh…

357
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,269
Shall we go for another lap?

358
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,855
We should head in.

359
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,941
You need your rest.

360
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,485
Mmm.

361
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,038
Well, I can't go unless you let go.

362
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,920
Oh, of course.

363
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,799
I don't want to let go.

364
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,054
Or let you go.

365
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,392
We'll see each other tomorrow.

366
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,646
- I'm going in.
- Okay.

367
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,090
Is this better?

368
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,174
Or this?

369
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:12,302
Hey, if you're not eating it,
stop messing with the food.

370
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,849
Mr. Bu said it was for consulting,

371
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:18,726
but you never know.

372
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,938
Why would a director and actress
be at a university hospital together?

373
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,399
If we spin this right,

374
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,317
it could really take off.

375
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,783
You should've just done what I said.

376
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,909
What is this crap?

377
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,038
Mr. Noh,

378
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,125
you think I lasted 20 years
in this industry by accident?

379
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,460
Pardon?

380
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,795
I've had it with scumbags

381
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,799
twisting disgusting stories
to screw over actresses.

382
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,343
It makes my skin crawl.

383
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:54,636
Got it?

384
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,015
CEOs, man. From the studio or the agency.

385
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,435
They only come crawling
when they need something.

386
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,105
Isn't that spicy?

387
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,402
Pour me a drink.

388
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,655
Just you wait.
I'm going to hit them where it hurts.

389
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,535
Beyond Entertainment's already a mess
with Chae Seoyoung likely leaving.

390
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,412
It's just a waste of time.

391
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,664
Always late to the story.

392
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,542
Ms. Go is never letting go
of Chae Seoyoung.

393
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,879
She's already desperate
to find "the next Chae Seoyoung."

394
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,216
I heard she even reached out to Nam Jaein.

395
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:37,471
What? Ms. Go just asked her questions
because she went to school with Lee Daeum.

396
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,975
Oh.

397
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,796
CHAE SEOYOUNG

398
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,800
You've been smiling a lot.
The mood on set is better than ever.

399
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,680
It's very surprising that someone
as tightly wound as you

400
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,057
could be so relaxed on set.

401
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,768
I just decided

402
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,020
to think differently.

403
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,689
Is that so?

404
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,399
I did too.

405
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,783
Did you think it was a compliment
when I said you looked good?

406
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:46,081
I told you that I won't support you
no matter what choice you make.

407
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,378
So what are you going to do? I mean…

408
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,507
What do you want to do?

409
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,684
Here.

410
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,232
It's past 11:00 p.m.,

411
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,444
and you're okay with drinking
high-fructose syrup?

412
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,155
Oh. Want me to get you something else?

413
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,366
No, it just threw me off.

414
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,368
You eat a ton of food too.

415
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,163
Doesn't the director say anything?

416
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,665
Like, "You're playing
a terminally ill character.

417
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,585
Shouldn't you be responsible
and watch what you eat?"

418
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,345
As long as I look fine, isn't that enough?

419
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,640
What are you trying to say is the problem?

420
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,141
Lee Daeum as a person.

421
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,684
Nam Jaein.

422
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,437
I just want to get along with you
like we used to.

423
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,730
Don't do this.

424
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,193
Did we ever get along?

425
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,946
You remember things differently.

426
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,533
Why are you so angry with me, hmm?

427
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,703
Just tell me. This is really frustrating.

428
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,914
I'm the one who's frustrated.

429
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,923
Wow. It's a lot bigger than my room.

430
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,591
Must be nice.

431
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,969
You're lucky.

432
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,971
Life must be so exciting.

433
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,908
What makes Daeum now so different
from who I was back then?

434
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,077
No.

435
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,205
Why is the Lee Jeha now
so different from the Lee Jeha then?

436
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,166
Your feelings for Daeum…

437
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,878
Are you absolutely sure
they're not cheap pity, but real love?

438
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,463
Yes.

439
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,840
I'm sure.

440
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:05,012
Seoyoung, I just…

441
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,931
decided to live in the moment.

442
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,183
And the one who made me think that way

443
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:11,977
was Daeum.

444
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,148
I'll understand whatever you choose to do.

445
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,567
I just hope it doesn't end up

446
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,945
circling back and hurting you.

447
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,492
You must be doing really well now,

448
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,746
to have the luxury of
poking at others' pain.

449
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,012
Hello?

450
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,432
Who is this?

Who is it?

454
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,471
Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Lim?

455
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,764
Are you okay?

456
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,599
Sorry? What do you mean?

457
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,975
You haven't seen it yet.

458
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,649
Have a nice day, everyone.

Hello, Mr. Bu.

463
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,177
You should come over.

464
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,651
- Hello!
- Hello.

465
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:25,944

What is it?

469
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,023
Are the checkup results out?

470
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,816
Is it bad?

471
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,860
I'll be on set

472
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,529
from now on.

473
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,794
Mr. Han?

474
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,546
Oh.

475
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,888
"The two relied on each other
through the grueling shoot."

476
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,891
"After filming was over,

477
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,977
Lee Daeum would always
go to her director's room.

478
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,313
On their day off,

479
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,649
they even went to the hospital together."

480
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,360
Open parenthesis, question mark,
close parenthesis.

481
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:51,905
Mr. Han.

482
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,409
You're not actually bothered
by a gossip piece like this, are you?

483
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:00,914
Of course not.

484
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:04,251
I've got way juicier stuff than this.

485
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,961
Exactly.

486
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,963
If anything, this is free buzz.

487
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,384
Mr. Han!

488
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,012
- What's with all the fuss?
- Mr. Han.

489
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,305
We have a situation.

490
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,565
What's this now?

491
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,567
LEE JEHA
AND LEE DAEUM DATING…

492
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,027
"GIRLFRIEND CASTING"
CONTROVERSY…

493
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:34,030
This isn't the kind of buzz we want.

494
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,284
A simple dating scandal is one thing,

495
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,662
but "fairness" and "equity"?

496
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,666
It's hitting the two issues the public
is hyper-sensitive about right now.

497
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,086
Noh Huitae, that bastard.

498
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,716
Two of my higher-ups
are already facing indictment

499
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,052
over rigged hiring
and preferential bidding.

500
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,806
I'm only throwing money at this movie
to clean up the crap they made.

501
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,975
And now the director rigged the audition?

502
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,020
I'll get a correction piece ready.

503
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,647
You think a correction's
going to fix this?

504
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,610
That article was too nasty.

505
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,486
You must've been so shocked.

506
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,656
Is going to the director's room
for a meeting a crime?

507
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,325
Even I've been in that room.

508
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,661
And with your acting skills,
how's that favoritism?

509
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,204
Mr. Lee's the one who got lucky.

510
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,707
Lee Jeha, that bastard.

511
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,251
I knew this would happen.

512
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,711
SO "THE LONELY PEOPLE"
WAS RIGGED TOO?

513
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,296
THE DIRECTOR FOUND
A LEAD AND A GIRLFRIEND

514
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,131
And Seoyoung?

515
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,591
I can't get a hold of her.

516
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,176
Can't reach Minhee either.

517
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,597
Get my car ready.
I'm going to Samcheok myself.

518
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,891
Hey.

519
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:47,979
You must've thought I was a pushover
because I smile all the time.

520
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,523
I'm sorry, Mr. Han.

521
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,526
How do you call yourself a CEO
when you can't even handle a reporter?

522
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,364
Forget the apologies.

523
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,949
Unless you want to cough up what we paid,

524
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,786
get the director and actors

525
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,413
to cry, beg, whatever it takes,
in front of the camera,

526
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,707
and change

527
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,251
the public's opinion.

528
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,711
Wait, Mr. Han…

529
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,756
I'll make sure to shut down
this favoritism scandal.

530
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,258
I'll call you right away, Mr. Han!

531
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,804
- Hello.
- Hello.

532
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,140
Hello!

533
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

534
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,941
Hello.

535
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,040
What's with all the chatter?
What, we can't go on with the shoot?

536
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,960
Just get back to work!

537
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,679
Hello.

538
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,305
Hello.

539
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,766
- Hello.
- Hello.

540
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,851
Hello.

541
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,314
"GIRLFRIEND CASTING" CONTROVERSY

542
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,942
It looks like
someone on set took that photo.

543
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,445
It does.

544
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,573
Could I talk alone
with Ms. Chae for a moment?

545
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,949
Yes, we're done.

546
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,285
Take your time, both of you.

547
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,120
- Let's go.
- Okay.

548
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,170
Isn't that reporter…

549
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,383
close with Ms. Go?

550
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,511
It wasn't Ms. Go.

551
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,890
She's not that kind of person.

552
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,190
Hello.

553
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,524
Hello, Mr. Kim.

554
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,235
Think you can focus?

555
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:04,032
Yes. I'll do my best
to love you again today.

556
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,037
Are you both ready?

557
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,706
Yes, we're all ready.

558
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,378
LEE GYUWON BOOKSTORE

559
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,505
Let's begin.

560
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,632
Ready.

561
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,135
Action!

562
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,726
<i>I'll understand whatever you choose to do.</i>

563
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,937
I just hope it doesn't end up

564
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,482
circling back and hurting you.

565
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,401
Great work today, Ms. Chae.

566
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,905
- You have one scene left?
- Yes.

567
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,408
Ms. Chae, didn't I tell you?

568
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,868
That girl's seriously weird.

569
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,328
"That girl"?

570
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,663
Lee Daeum.

571
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,666
How can she smile right now
like nothing's happened?

572
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,545
Acting all innocent while slipping
in and out of the director's room--

573
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,588
I've been to his room.

574
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,050
So have you.
And so have most of the actors here.

575
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:09,264
But someone took that photo in secret,
so it looked all sneaky and scandalous.

576
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,809
It was a scandal waiting to happen.

577
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,018
By the way,

578
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,187
weren't you two friends?

579
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,940
Why are you so hostile?

580
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,947
Wait, are you suspicious of me right now?

581
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,199
You think I took the photo and leaked it?

582
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,534
- You're here.
- Yes.

583
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,785
Come in.

584
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,123
<i>No.</i>

585
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,624
<i>I'm not just suspicious.</i>

586
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,460
I actually saw you take that photo.

587
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,089
Daeum's not the only one
who goes to that room.

588
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,174
Ms. Chae, you've got this all wrong. I--

589
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,760
Tearing someone down for your own gain

590
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,888
turns out to be meaningless.

591
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,098
Jaein.

592
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,600
I know it sounds preachy,

593
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,810
but trust me.

594
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,187
I figured that out recently myself.

595
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,621
What? Why aren't you at work?

596
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,708
I quit spectacularly.
Hence, I'm having lunch here.

597
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,668
Why you little…

598
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,004
Are you out of your mind?

599
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,966
What did I do to get a kid like you…

600
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,803
But poor Daeum. What should we do?

601
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,139
If that stuff starts spreading online,

602
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,099
her dad's going to see it too.

603
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,270
So we should

604
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,314
split up our duties.

605
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,608
You should go to Uncle Junghyo.

606
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,902
- What about you?
- Mom.

607
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,656
Not a lot in my life is going to change
by taking a break from work.

608
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:53,409
You know very well
that I'm still very young.

609
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,287
I have so much time to spare.

610
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,791
So if I'm not by Daeum's side right now,

611
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,126
I don't think I could handle it.

612
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,587
Of course.

613
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,423
That's exactly how I feel too,

614
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,717
but I was worried
you wouldn't feel the same.

615
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,178
I knew it! I'm your daughter after all.

616
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,429
We're so on the same page.

617
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,516
You're heading there today, right?

618
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,684
Yeah.

619
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:18,810
What do you need?

620
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,645
What should we pack first? Let me think.

621
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,815
- Give me everything you've got!
- All right!

622
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,566
Everything. Right away.

623
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,693
Got it.

624
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,080
Yes?

625
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,208
Well, hello.

626
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,544
Hello.

627
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,838
I came by because I was worried.

628
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,340
I know you're strong, but still.

629
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,927
I'm sorry.

630
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,263
I don't know what to say.

631
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,015
No, don't worry.

632
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,435
Gyoyeong takes such good care of Daeum.

633
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,479
Of course. She's better than me.

634
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:05,148
She always has been.

635
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:07,984
Lately,

636
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,654
I keep thinking
about when I first met Daeum.

637
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,371
My mom told me to bring you.

638
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,754
Here, ta-da!

639
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,048
Welcome, my valued guest.

640
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,257
Here.

641
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,467
Let's eat.

642
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,885
So, you don't have a mom?

643
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,304
Hey, Gwak Gyoyeong.

644
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:40,141
What? I don't have a dad either.

645
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,393
I just wanted to tell her that…

646
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,562
Man, you little…

647
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,397
Stop that. Quiet.

648
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,649
It's all right, darling.

649
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,903
At first, I thought she was a gloomy kid,
so I felt bad for her.

650
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:57,366
But I was wrong. She was always smiling
and always ate so well.

651
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,077
And after she got sick,

652
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,621
she smiled even more

653
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,706
so her father wouldn't be sad

654
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,792
and people wouldn't worry about her.

655
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,628
She never once showed she was in pain.

656
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,546
Yes, I know.

657
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,967
I'm not worthy of being her father.

658
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,136
No one's unworthy of being a parent.

659
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,930
Don't give up.

660
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:20,973
I know I shouldn't.

661
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,315
But no matter how much I try,
I don't see any hope ahead.

662
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,734
I keep losing faith.

663
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,075
It's time to think
about another kind of hope.

664
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,829
Not as a doctor, but as a father.

665
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,873
<i>Think about how lonely she must've been,</i>

666
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,251
<i>standing all alone back then</i>

667
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,754
in the middle of that schoolyard.

668
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,842
Think about what she really wants,
and try to enjoy that

669
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,261
in the time she has left, together.

670
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,307
I know, but it's not easy.

671
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,688
I'm actually terrified.

672
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,523
I know.

673
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,191
But still,

674
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,026
Dr. Lee,

675
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,445
you have to stay strong.

676
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,826
Thank you.

677
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,799
- Everyone, eat.
- Okay.

678
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,186
Figured you'd be more comfortable
sitting away from them today.

679
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,562
Let's eat.

680
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,689
Enjoy your meal.

681
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,359
Hey, Daeum!

682
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,404
Why aren't you eating?

683
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,572
Got no appetite?

684
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,328
Man, I came all the way
to Samcheok for a delivery.

685
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,496
Now give me my tip.

686
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,498
Gyo.

687
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,876
Hey, catering's not bad here.

688
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,421
My mom's lunch box
has some competition.

689
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,716
Why are you here? What about work?

690
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:23,930
I'm on leave.

691
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,265
On leave? Why would you do that?

692
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,895
This bond! This friendship!

693
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,231
What exactly is your relationship?

694
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,653
We love each other.

695
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,530
- Respect.
- Come on, dig in.

696
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,659
- You like it?
- It's so good!

697
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,593
Mr. Noh! Why weren't you picking up?

698
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,179
The article did better than I expected.

699
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,390
I got caught up writing a follow-up.

700
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,059
You're keeping me anonymous, right?
You promised.

701
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,561
Of course.
Trust is everything in this business.

702
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:15,398
And Ms. Go and Chae Seoyoung
can't know about this.

703
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,275
I mean it. It has to be a secret.

704
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,985
<i>I got it.</i>

705
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,951
You've got some pipes on you.

706
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,496
I bet this recording
came out crystal clear.

707
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,331
Easy now.

708
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,959
Would you look at that?

709
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,877
What the hell do you want?

710
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:43,134
You should use that brain of yours
and be more careful.

711
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,302
What?

712
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,890
Turn on the water first
so no one hears you, you crazy little…

713
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,688
"Thinking about when I'll die…"

714
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,655
Sit down.

715
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,013
You're the lead.

716
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,724
You fought like hell

717
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,226
to come all the way up here,

718
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,354
so stand tall and hold your ground.

719
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:42,860
I can't do this.

720
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,654
I just can't.

721
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,407
I can't keep pretending
to be nice and understanding.

722
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,535
I don't like you. I resent you.

723
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,914
But I can't figure out
why I feel that way.

724
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,625
I just can't hate you.
You've done nothing wrong.

725
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,877
You're just holding on

726
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,088
and trying your best.

727
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,348
Ms. Chae.

728
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:14,725
So I decided…

729
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,314
to stick it out
and finish this film with you.

730
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,608
If we keep going,

731
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,487
maybe I'll figure out
why I don't like you so much.

732
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,989
You just be the tragic lead.

733
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,784
I'll be the villain who gives her hell.

734
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,161
Let's finish this together.

735
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:38,666
Okay.

736
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,556
Sorry, give me a moment alone.

737
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,391
- Sure.
- Sorry about this.

738
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,393
Thank you.

739
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,866
First, Youngjin's caught
in a hiring scandal,

740
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,036
and now the film they invested in
is in this casting scandal.

741
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,290
They're threatening to pull their money.

742
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,959
And of course, they are. I would too.

743
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,211
But you know that's not true.

744
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,839
I'll release the audition tape

745
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,800
and the score sheets too.

746
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,469
Like anyone would believe those.

747
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,762
The public's already made up their minds,

748
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,639
and you're going to go out there

749
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,808
saying, "We were totally fair back then"?

750
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,770
Yes, even if they don't believe us.
Even if it's foolish. I want to do that.

751
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,316
Hold on. Let me think this through.

752
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,694
Daeum and I,
we don't have time to wait it out.

753
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,738
Don't be dramatic. You have time.

754
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,115
You can't just
rush into something like this.

755
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,950
You know what I mean.

756
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,285
Know what?

757
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,454
That Daeum's terminally ill.

758
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,668
Both you and Mr. Han
knew that from the beginning.

759
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,132
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

760
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,550
Hmm?

761
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,302
Oh, man. Hey--

762
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,100
<i>Some people might even find it boring.</i>

763
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,728
<i>But it'll never be boring to me.</i>

764
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,815
<i>When that "terminal illness" cliché</i>
<i>is your life,</i>

765
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,526
<i>every day feels like</i>
<i>the climax of a movie.</i>

766
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,737
<i>This will be real method acting.</i>

767
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,365
<i>I have one condition.</i>

768
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:36,784
<i>Don't die.</i>

769
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,747
They're practically filming a whole movie.

770
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,584
Can I be very blunt here?

771
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,671
If she dies during the shoot,
then it's a bust.

772
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,881
But if she dies after we wrap?

773
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,425
That's a jackpot.

774
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:54,635
I got chills.

775
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,346
That's exactly what I was thinking.

776
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,056
We're on the same wavelength, then.

777
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,766
It sure is amusing.

778
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,145
Will it be a bust or a jackpot?

779
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,690
Never thought I'd gamble on a movie.

780
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,695
Let's sign the contract.

781
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,615
- Hmm.
- Thank you, Mr. Han.

782
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,534
Thank you.

783
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:23,372
Let's not tell Mr. Lee
that we know about this, okay?

784
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,457
You drive me nuts.

785
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,085
You're a lunatic, you know that?

786
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,045
Okay, fine.

787
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,674
We can be totally honest
with each other now, right?

788
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,718
You want that payout?

789
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:39,221
Then we can't have
crap like this blowing up.

790
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:41,807
Yeah, I know you must've had a plan.

791
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:46,395
I sent you that tragedy I wrote
hoping you'd know how to sell it.

792
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,897
Man, that feels good.

793
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,733
Now we're actually talking.

794
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,651
But, Seungwon.

795
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:56,196
I know I'm a mess and a lunatic, but…

796
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:58,907
But…

797
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,618
I want to live

798
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,620
differently now.

799
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:03,787
Differently?

800
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,123
How will you live differently?

801
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,085
I'm really in love with Daeum.

802
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,212
You're actually insane.

803
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,673
"Really in love"?

804
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,303
Yes, I'm really in love with her now.

805
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,055
So help me, please.

806
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,142
Get a grip, you moron.

807
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,478
Don't you even understand what she is?

808
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,730
I do.

809
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,440
Yeah, at first…

810
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,695
I told myself
I didn't care if she lived or died.

811
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:37,863
But now,

812
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:39,948
just…

813
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,958
Just thinking about her pain
makes it hard to breathe.

814
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,464
The thought of her dying drives me insane.
So please, help me.

815
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,715
I'm running out of time.

816
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,261
I'm running out of time too.

817
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,848
Mr. Han wants
some big public apology stunt.

818
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,976
You know what, I'll handle that.

819
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,480
Just keep her illness under wraps.

820
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,691
This movie

821
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,360
is running on Mr. Han's money.

822
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:20,030
Mr. Han plans to use her illness
at the perfect moment.

823
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,822
What are you looking at?

824
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,371
You see those waves?

825
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:11,915
They break apart,

826
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,918
then come together again.

827
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,756
I wish my life could be like that too.

828
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,300
Breaking apart then coming together again.

829
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:25,304
Never having to think about the end.

830
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,980
Maybe everything that's happening now

831
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:37,441
started with me.

832
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,945
Your illness,

833
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:45,032
the footage of your second audition…

834
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,163
I leaked them
to Seungwon and Mr. Han on purpose

835
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,789
to secure the investment.

836
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,043
Don't let the camera bother you.

837
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,794
We won't use this footage for anything.

838
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:01,215
Relax, and talk how you normally do to me.

839
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,805
I'm off.

840
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:19,608
So what?

841
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,402
You're not the only one who used someone.

842
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,739
If we're being real,

843
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,910
a dying girl with six months left
and nothing to lose

844
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:33,539
cast a promising director
for her own purposes.

845
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,294
So don't be sorry.

846
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,715
We used each other.

847
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,721
And, you know…

848
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,056
Right now,

849
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,977
everything's going exactly how I wanted.

850
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,439
All I wanted was
to live like everyone else.

851
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,527
But besides dying,
I've never been like other people.

852
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,906
No uphill battles. No rough paths.

853
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,324
I was just a dying girl,

854
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,326
the subject of pity,

855
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,454
motherless, and all alone,

856
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,666
so everyone always tried to protect me.

857
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:19,418
But actually,

858
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,589
I never wanted to live
that kind of sheltered life.

859
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,508
Then how do you want to live?

860
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,595
I want more sadness.

861
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,308
I want to get hurt more.

862
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:39,229
Most people go through all that
just by living.

863
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:41,732
I never did.

864
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,193
I told you,

865
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,573
that kind of regret
makes you go a little crazy.

866
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,591
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

867
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,761
We each broke
the terms of this agreement once.

868
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,138
So it's pointless now.

869
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,308
Yes, that's right.

870
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:19,895
So…

871
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,190
this contract has been breached.

872
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,112
We wrote this

873
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,699
because we were both scared.

874
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,330
Scared of being caught and judged.

875
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,749
And scared of losing the movie.

876
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:43,669
But…

877
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,380
I'm not scared anymore.

878
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,676
Whatever happens from now on,

879
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,804
I'm going to go through it with you.

880
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,432
So will you be on my side?

881
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,229
We don't have a contract anymore.

882
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,650
But we still need each other, don't we?

883
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,660
Oh, excuse me.

884
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,705
Hello. Do you know where Lee Daeum is?

885
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,331
Who are you?

886
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,630
Hello, Mr. Han.

887
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,632
I was just about to call you.

888
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,677
I just came up with a good idea.

889
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,345
Excuse me?

890
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,681
Come to think of it,
we still need Lee Daeum.

891
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,391
She fits the concept.

892
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,936
Let's not create any fuss
and just drop Lee Jeha.

893
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,147
Drop? What do you…

894
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,233
How can we drop the director?

895
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,235
We save Lee Daeum, and the director…

896
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,280
Well,
"save" isn't the best word.

897
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,407
<i>How about it? Amusing, right?</i>

898
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,491
"Amusing"?

899
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,201
Replace the director,

900
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:00,245
and you can keep the investment.

901
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,913
- <i>Your choice.</i>
- Mr. Han! But--

902
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,316
Before we shoot the night scene,
I have something to say.

903
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,776
Please gather around.

904
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:50,504
I know the article this morning

905
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,589
made a lot of noise.

906
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,841
I'm sorry for causing trouble on set.

907
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,135
Oh, no need to apologize.

908
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,679
All kinds of things happen
when you're working.

909
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,224
Exactly. Don't beat yourself up.

910
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,728
Seems like there's been
some kind of misunderstanding.

911
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,897
Well, that misunderstanding is half true

912
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,441
and half false.

913
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,613
It's not true
that I held personal feelings

914
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,783
for Daeum during the audition process.

915
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,285
And the photo of her coming to my room,

916
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,329
that was for a work meeting,

917
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,331
just like all the other actors.

918
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,542
Right. We figured as much.

919
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,715
Also,

920
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,093
I do like Daeum.

921
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,144
That part is true.

922
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:03,952
I'm sorry!

923
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,168
You don't need to apologize like that.

924
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,635
Come on, Daeum.

925
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,139
It's not a crime to love someone.

926
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,028
Actually…

927
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,826
I wanted to make this movie before I died.

928
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,541
That's why I made it this far.

929
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,921
What does that mean?

930
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,024
I am…

931
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,362
terminally ill.

932
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,795
This movie

933
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:40,131
is the last movie I'll ever make.

934
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,843
I am an actual terminal patient

935
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:47,013
who is playing a terminally ill character.

936
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,433
And I

937
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,728
knew that she was terminally ill…

938
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,524
and cast her for this movie.

939
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,344
<i>There won't be anyone</i>
<i>left around you in the end.</i>

940
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,347
So if you don't want to die alone,
at least hold on to me.

941
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,435
I said, keep it under wraps.
Did you see the crew's faces?

942
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,145
That "you people are nuts" look?

943
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,982
<i>I hope you thought about the fallout</i>
<i>before pulling that stunt.</i>

944
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:07,153
<i>There are real people behind this film.</i>

945
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,697
<i>I didn't think Mr. Lee would ignore that.</i>

946
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,368
This is 100% going to fall apart.

947
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,744
Get out before it blows up.

948
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,455
I told him to drop you, Mr. Lee.

949
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:20,583
To save Lee Daeum
and replace the director.

950
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,046
She can't take it any longer.
The checkup results…

951
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:28,758
were not good.
