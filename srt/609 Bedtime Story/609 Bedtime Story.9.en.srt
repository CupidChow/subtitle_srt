Baby boy.

6
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:38,742
P'Mum.

7
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:41,820
It's okay.

8
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:45,877
I really miss you.

9
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:48,871
I do miss you, too.

10
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:50,886
I miss you so much.

11
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:00,040
Where have you been?

12
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,192
Will you come to see me again?

13
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:10,026
I will.

14
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,265
I must come.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,037
I will come here to help you.

16
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,361
I give you my word.

17
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,524
I know that you will always
keep your promise.

18
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,117
Speak now.

19
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,156
Why did you call me so late?

20
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:41,144
It is not "happen anywhere".

21
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,826
Huh? Wait!

22
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:44,695
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:47,871
About the thing that I crossed
to another dimension to meet Dew.

24
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:50,077
I have tried it here.

25
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:52,365
But I was not going anywhere.

26
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:56,478
Mum, I think you should get some sleep.

27
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:57,867
So you will recover from your injury soon.

28
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:00,497
I can't do that.

29
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,792
Dew doesn't have much time now.

30
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,671
If I don't go there...

31
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:05,510
Dew might...

32
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:29,465
Cancel everything.

33
00:03:33,684 --> 00:03:35,406
Is your nephew okay?

34
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,795
How is Dew?

35
00:03:37,895 --> 00:03:39,205
He is safe.

36
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,376
Thank you so much.

37
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:43,673
It's okay now.

38
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,202
I will take it from there.

39
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:47,720
Yes, sir.

00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:07,943
(Episode 9)
(On the first day we say goodbye)

42
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:08,609
What?

43
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:09,958
Why are you so surprised?

44
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,643
I just asked you to take me home.

45
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,654
I understand you, P'Mum.

46
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,426
But your doctor hasn't said

47
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:18,969
you could go home yet.

48
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:20,460
That means you asked me

49
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,660
to help you escape from the hospital.

50
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:23,719
But I am worried.

51
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,175
I don't know how it is going.

52
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:33,180
But you told me that

53
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:35,184
on the first day when you met him,

54
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:36,785
he was already shot.

55
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,791
He might not get shot yet.

56
00:05:40,388 --> 00:05:41,446
If I could come back to help him
just in time...

57
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,244
I do want to help you.

58
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:46,034
But you are not healed yet.

59
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:47,822
Mint is very serious about this.

60
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,167
You know your sister so well.

61
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:54,806
Whatever it takes,

62
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,017
I really want to meet Dew.

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,355
Dew?

64
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:00,299
Is his name Dew?

65
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,753
Yes.

66
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:06,187
Why?

67
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:08,164
Nothing.

68
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:10,004
I just feel a little strange.

69
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,890
Your boy from the other universe

70
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,823
and Mint's boyfriend have the same name.

71
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,422
Is her boyfriend's name Dew too?

72
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,305
Yes.

73
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:23,801
What does he look like?

74
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,111
Do you have his photo?

75
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:27,518
I have already sent you his photo.

76
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,524
Don't you remember?

77
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:30,370
Do you have dementia?

78
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,023
Huh?

79
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,070
Hey, Mum.

80
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,753
Here's the photo of your
future brother-in-law,

81
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:36,467
so you'll know what he looks like.

82
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,001
Yes, P'Vee.

83
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,975
Okay.

84
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,527
Yes, all right.

85
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,766
Yes.

86
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:59,488
I have to go and help P'Vee.

87
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:00,965
Can you stay alone here?

88
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:04,135
Yes, I can.

89
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:04,919
Are you sure?

90
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:07,191
Yes.

91
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:09,222
I will leave now.

92
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,322
(Games: Mum, Mint took a man here.
I took a picture of him for you.)

93
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:40,673
Wait.

94
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:43,106
What?

95
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:43,912
Are you serious about this guy?

96
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:45,662
Who?

97
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:46,766
Well...

98
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:48,278
I mean the brand's owner.

99
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:51,331
You look so happy with him.

100
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:53,085
It's nothing serious.

101
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:55,046
I always take good care of my clients.

102
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:02,784
Is your girlfriend calling?

103
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:05,798
Dew, you can pick up,

104
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:06,726
if you want to.

105
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:07,532
I can wait.

106
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:08,942
If I take this call,

107
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:10,783
will you feel sad?

108
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:12,177
I will.

109
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,843
I don't want to lie to her.

110
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:26,903
What's up?

111
00:08:27,164 --> 00:08:27,770
P'Games,

112
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,581
just promise me

113
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,753
that you won't tell anyone
that I will go to meet Dew.

114
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:35,211
Why's that?

115
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:37,630
You must promise me that.

116
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:39,882
All right.

117
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:41,318
I give you my word.

118
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:43,937
If you slip your tongue,

119
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,678
I will beat you.

120
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:47,357
Okay, I will not...

121
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:49,396
What the heck?

122
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:51,011
He just hung up on me like that.

123
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:04,206
Sorry that you have to wait so long.

124
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:05,217
P'Vee.

125
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,537
Are you really sure

126
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:09,756
that you want to do this?

127
00:09:12,157 --> 00:09:12,719
Yes.

128
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:19,900
Let's go.

129
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,352
Games and I are not in a relationship.

130
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:46,408
Well, I already knew

131
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:48,729
that you just wanted to get back to me.

132
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,354
Just like you and I
are not in a relationship too.

133
00:09:57,404 --> 00:09:58,519
Come on, Vee.

134
00:09:59,351 --> 00:09:59,986
Look,

135
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,430
we were together for 5 years.

136
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:05,185
We built this company,
and we shared a dream.

137
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,914
Do they really mean nothing to you?

138
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,418
That sounds familiar.

139
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:16,784
I said the same words to you,

140
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,644
when you asked me to let you go
so that you could get married.

141
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:25,068
What did you say that day?

142
00:10:29,048 --> 00:10:29,842
I have to do that.

143
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:33,668
Have to, right?

144
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,105
Now I know I was wrong.

145
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:40,538
Vee.

146
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:49,338
You should quit doing this.

147
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:55,655
From the way people look at us,
we've already had a bad reputation.

148
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,668
We don't need a complicated relationship
to make things worse.

149
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:04,965
I love you.

150
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,996
I do love you.

151
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:10,840
Vee.

152
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:22,590
You should go back and take
the responsibility of your choice.

153
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:27,536
I will never forget

154
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,773
how much I loved you.

155
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:35,312
But that was all in the past.

156
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,197
You have to let me go.

157
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:41,873
No.

158
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:43,702
Never.

159
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,464
What you're doing is such a burden to me.

160
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:57,181
I need my life back.

161
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:31,443
Here.

162
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:33,494
Your ice-cream.

163
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:36,473
After the battle,

164
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:37,482
you need to obtain some more energy.

165
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:38,637
Thanks.

166
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:40,629
Do you like it?

167
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:47,251
I do like ice cream.

168
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:52,340
But thank you for telling me
to confront the truth

169
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,580
in this case.

170
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,065
All right.

171
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,965
What you just did is so cool.

172
00:13:04,002 --> 00:13:04,633
Do you know that?

173
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:06,651
I do know that.

174
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:08,386
Wow!

175
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:11,414
You need to act a little bit humble.

176
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,947
I don't need to because I am a cool guy.

177
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:35,269
Is my face dirty?

178
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:36,621
Yes.

179
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:38,260
Is it clean now?

180
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:40,660
A little bit right.

181
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:42,183
- Right?
- There. Right there.

182
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,003
There.

183
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:43,993
Right here?

184
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:44,959
Yes.

185
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:45,800
It's on my right side

186
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,173
or your right side?

187
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:48,854
My right side.

188
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:49,618
Right.

189
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:50,667
My right side?

190
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,802
Can I go home tomorrow?

191
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,910
Easy, easy.

192
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:51,391
Are you okay?

193
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,156
Yes, I am.

194
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:53,468
- All right.
- It hurts.

195
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:54,553
You will go home soon.

196
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:58,031
If I did not miss the flight that day,

197
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,250
you wouldn't have to...

198
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,054
Look...

199
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:01,923
Don't think like that.

200
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:03,952
It's not what you think.

201
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,355
You knew who did that to me.

202
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:17,630
I feel

203
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,665
I am such a lousy brother.

204
00:15:22,482 --> 00:15:23,941
Don't think about yourself that way.

205
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,013
Huh?

206
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:29,657
If you ask me...

207
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:33,122
I have never seen anyone
love Mint as much as you do.

208
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:40,035
What should I do?

209
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:43,798
I am worried about that boy so badly.

210
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,188
If I could go back to that world,

211
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,472
I might help him catch the murderer
that killed him.

212
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:54,183
But I don't want to betray Mint.

213
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:54,939
Mum.

214
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:58,633
You always live your life
with your instinct.

215
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:01,231
And this time,

216
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:03,097
what does your instinct tell you?

217
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,073
Why did you bring so many things here?

218
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,119
They are your clothes.

219
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:30,063
I took them from your condo.

220
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:30,937
It should be enough for you.

221
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,395
Mint.

222
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,298
I will go back to my room.

223
00:16:38,817 --> 00:16:39,880
I am an adult now,

224
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,550
and I can take care of myself.

225
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,419
How can you do that?

226
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:46,204
Look at yourself now.

227
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,299
You'd better stay with me.

228
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:51,143
Why?

229
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:52,948
You don't want to sleep on my sofa?

230
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,080
My condo has two bedrooms.

231
00:16:59,431 --> 00:17:00,752
Why are you so headstrong?

232
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:04,671
Then you should not be so stubborn.

233
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,270
Once you fully recover,

234
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,781
I will let you go home.

235
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,936
Just not now.

236
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,136
Hey, let me tell you something.

237
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:18,834
If you do recover completely,

238
00:17:19,176 --> 00:17:21,043
I'll even let you ride your motorcycle.

239
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:27,488
But you need to wear this.

240
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:29,851
If your motorcycle collapses,

241
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:31,847
it will keep you safe and sound.

242
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:36,887
Here.

243
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:38,076
Is it nice?

244
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:50,030
P'Mum,

245
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:51,985
what's wrong?

246
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:53,270
P'Mum!

247
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,072
Nothing.

248
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,112
Hi. I thought we'd miss you.

249
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,052
Our staff said that
they will visit you at Mint's condo.

250
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:17,144
Hey, Mint.
You and I have the same mind.

251
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:19,462
What makes you think that?

252
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,024
This helmet.

253
00:18:23,196 --> 00:18:25,153
The old one has been damaged.

254
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,689
So, I bought a new one for you.

255
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:27,876
Do you like it?

256
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,204
Yes, that's right.

257
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:32,907
It matches that coat.

258
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:33,594
They look nice.

259
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:42,391
No!

260
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:29,201
(Mum's World)
(21 November 2022)

261
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:38,302
Are the medicines too strong for you?

262
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,880
You look so dull all day.

263
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:47,022
I think so.

264
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:48,956
It may be too strong for me.

265
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:52,189
Or...

266
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,588
Are you thinking about someone?

267
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:01,980
Just eat.

268
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:04,018
Come on.

269
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:14,270
Don't die before me.

270
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:17,731
What did you say?

271
00:20:18,822 --> 00:20:20,207
I am not dying.

272
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:20,862
Come on.

273
00:20:22,273 --> 00:20:23,781
If you are gone,

274
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:27,041
I can't stand living alone.

275
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:33,362
What makes you think of that?

276
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,431
Well,

277
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,661
when our parents passed away,

278
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:42,709
if you did not move from Khon Kaen
to stay with me,

279
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:45,357
I probably could not make it.

280
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,547
Who told you that?

281
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,959
I moved here,

282
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:54,805
Because I wanted to live in Bangkok.
I did not want to live in Khon Kaen.

283
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:57,438
Life is better here.

284
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:00,597
Really?

285
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:11,832
You have to stay with me.

286
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,278
When you stay by my side,

287
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:20,386
I just...

288
00:21:20,977 --> 00:21:22,896
I feel incredibly safe.

289
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,982
Because you...

290
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:27,058
you always protect me.

291
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:35,841
Give me your bag.

292
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,630
- No.
- Do you have money?

293
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,724
- Why are you being so stingy?
- Give it to me or you will get hurt.

294
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:39,335
Hey!

295
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:44,239
How dare you hurt my sister?

296
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,921
P'Mum.

297
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:47,538
- It's enough, Mum.
- Don't touch my sister.

298
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:49,391
Come on!

299
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:54,000
P'Mum, stop.

300
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,175
P'Mum!

301
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:09,893
P'Mum!

302
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:12,465
Stop this.

303
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:14,895
I don't want you to be in jail.

304
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:22,970
All right.

305
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:25,741
I will continue protecting you.

306
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:26,899
Do you know that?

307
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:27,876
Don't die.

308
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:28,618
I won't.

309
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,022
Eat now,
and then you can take medicines.

310
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:35,538
Okay.

311
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:37,472
Come on.

312
00:22:37,646 --> 00:22:39,630
I can't hurry. My arm hurts.

313
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,461
Cut the crap.

314
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:47,271
- Alright.
- Quick!

315
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,949
What will make me kill Dew?

316
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:08,413
I love you.

317
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:14,101
On the very first day

318
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:15,287
when I met Dew,

319
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,586
he acted so weirdly.

320
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:23,570
P'Mum.

321
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,164
What should I do?

322
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:29,999
What should I do?

323
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:32,513
The day before that day,

324
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:36,065
Dew seemed to have had an accident.

325
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:37,355
Dew?

326
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:39,592
Your boy from the other universe

327
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,386
and Mint's boyfriend have the same name.

328
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:43,119
If Dew is in a relationship with Mint,

329
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,915
the only reason

330
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:46,827
that I have to kill him...

331
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:48,393
If you ask me...

332
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,501
I have never seen anyone love
their sister as much as you love yours.

333
00:23:52,253 --> 00:23:53,211
That reason is...

334
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:56,829
When you stay by my side,

335
00:23:57,565 --> 00:23:58,669
I just...

336
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,086
I feel incredibly safe.

337
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:04,710
Have you ever loved me?

338
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:11,029
Dew is the reason behind Mint's death.

339
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:29,363
I have only one night left.

340
00:24:29,823 --> 00:24:30,853
If I don't go there,

341
00:24:31,073 --> 00:24:32,073
I might not see him anymore.

342
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:33,483
I'll hang up now.

343
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:39,933
P'Mum.

344
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:40,993
Where are you going?

345
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,583
Are you going back to your condo?

346
00:25:10,103 --> 00:25:11,063
I will wait for you.

347
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:27,913
All I ask is just tonight.

348
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:30,163
I won't ask you for anything anymore.

349
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:32,543
Will you come back?

350
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,043
Yes.

351
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:37,863
Promise me?

352
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:55,583
What should I do?

353
00:27:00,943 --> 00:27:02,423
You don't have to believe me, Dew.

354
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:06,453
But in the next 18 days,

355
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:08,433
you will be dead.

356
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:12,153
No.

357
00:27:15,243 --> 00:27:15,923
I know

358
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:17,623
that you don't know me.

359
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:19,913
Please believe me.

360
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:22,383
In the next 18 days...

361
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:24,803
I mean...

362
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:27,083
There will be another me

363
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,343
breaking in to kill you in this room.

364
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:31,993
It doesn't help.

365
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:38,723
You don't have to believe
what I'll tell you.

366
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:42,473
But could you please
remember everything?

367
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,303
He won't believe it for sure.

368
00:28:21,593 --> 00:28:23,393
Don't die before me.

369
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:53,733
Who is it?

370
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:01,983
Hey.

371
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:02,923
Baby boy.

372
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:06,313
I miss you so much.

373
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:09,023
I thought I won't see you anymore.

374
00:29:10,463 --> 00:29:11,103
Wait.

375
00:29:12,413 --> 00:29:13,283
Who are you?

376
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,383
How come you are in my room?

377
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:42,563
Brother...

378
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:43,433
Well...

379
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,003
I am not that...

380
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:48,623
I know.

381
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,953
I had that kind of feeling before.

382
00:31:56,423 --> 00:31:58,343
You don't have to believe
what I'll tell you.

383
00:32:02,243 --> 00:32:03,753
But could you please
remember everything?

384
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,043
All right, Dew?

385
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,713
Do you know my name too?

386
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:12,943
Dew.

387
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:16,043
About what is happening now,

388
00:32:17,473 --> 00:32:19,183
it's called the parallel universe.

389
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,183
What does it mean?

390
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:23,173
It means

391
00:32:24,453 --> 00:32:26,973
we both live in Room 609.

392
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:29,733
But we live in different
times and spaces.

393
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:32,333
How is that?

394
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:35,973
Today

395
00:32:36,473 --> 00:32:37,563
is the 6th, right?

396
00:32:39,863 --> 00:32:41,343
If it passes midnight,

397
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:42,843
then yes.

398
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:47,473
But in my world,

399
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:49,513
Today

400
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:50,833
is the 24th.

401
00:32:53,043 --> 00:32:53,883
It's the same month.

402
00:32:54,943 --> 00:32:55,783
And the same year.

403
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:59,213
Only the time is different.

404
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:01,933
Do you mean

405
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:04,923
that our time runs the opposite way?

406
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:07,093
Yes.

407
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:10,873
What I am about to tell you

408
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:13,733
is about what happened
the first day we met.

409
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:16,623
You were murdered.

410
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:20,063
The murderer

411
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:23,283
was me.

412
00:33:24,353 --> 00:33:25,513
Is this a kind of sick joke?

413
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:27,003
That's not funny at all.

414
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:27,973
Calm down.

415
00:33:29,013 --> 00:33:30,033
He is not me.

416
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:32,643
The person who did this is another me

417
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:34,313
from your universe.

418
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,293
Another you?

419
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:42,693
There is another Dew.

420
00:33:44,303 --> 00:33:45,633
There is also another Mint.

421
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:47,133
They are in my universe.

422
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:49,433
Do you know Mint too?

423
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:51,723
She is my sister.

424
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,113
Then,

425
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:00,323
why would you kill me?

426
00:34:02,873 --> 00:34:04,003
I really don't know.

427
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,073
Maybe

428
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:07,903
you are the reason behind Mint's death.

429
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,663
Mint would die
on the 23rd in your universe.

430
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:12,283
What?

431
00:34:12,863 --> 00:34:14,393
Is Mint going to die before me?

432
00:34:17,753 --> 00:34:18,413
Dew.

433
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:20,523
I don't have much time.

434
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:23,593
Listen to me.

435
00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:25,873
You must do whatever it takes

436
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:27,393
to prevent Mint from dying.

437
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:29,183
If she is alive,

438
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,113
I might not kill you.

439
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:35,893
What is it about?

440
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:42,623
Listen carefully.

441
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:46,153
I don't know if I will see you again.

442
00:34:47,803 --> 00:34:48,893
Remember that

443
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:51,063
I love you.

444
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:54,103
I will always love you.

445
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,193
On the 6th

446
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:40,003
of November 2022,

447
00:35:41,413 --> 00:35:42,633
someone...

448
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:44,653
came to give me bad news.

449
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:48,393
You must do whatever it takes

450
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,163
to prevent Mint from dying.

451
00:35:55,763 --> 00:35:57,783
Since the first day we met,

452
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:00,063
(Nov. 17th)
I've never thought that

453
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:02,893
that day would change my life

454
00:36:05,273 --> 00:36:06,963
drastically.

455
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:14,653
Can we

456
00:36:14,803 --> 00:36:17,243
(Nov. 21st)
change our destiny?

457
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:26,153
P'Mum.

458
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,083
(Nov. 22nd)

459
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:35,753
(Nov. 22nd)
Aun?

460
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,033
The clients that your father's company
introduced to me

461
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:54,243
are very easy to talk to.

462
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:55,523
Thanks so much.

463
00:36:56,123 --> 00:36:57,253
I don't want you to thank me.

464
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:58,693
Just treat me to one meal.

465
00:36:59,973 --> 00:37:01,923
I am not closing the deal yet.

466
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:04,033
(Nov. 22nd)
You are too stingy.

467
00:37:04,573 --> 00:37:05,653
I am just kidding.

468
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:07,893
We'll pay half-half then.

469
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:09,543
Deal.

470
00:37:09,663 --> 00:37:10,313
Okay.

471
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:17,043
(Dew)
Come and have a meal together.

472
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:21,303
Can you take care of Mint for me?

473
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:23,953
What did you just say?

474
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:27,673
I am asking you to take care of Mint
and keep her safe and sound

475
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:29,943
until the 23rd of November.

476
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:33,423
Why does it have to be the 23rd?

477
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:38,533
I think Mint is in great danger.

478
00:37:40,403 --> 00:37:41,853
I just can't give you more details.

479
00:37:42,523 --> 00:37:43,263
What are you talking about?

480
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,243
I know you love her.

481
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,673
The reason I came here to ask you

482
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:50,923
is that I believe

483
00:37:51,743 --> 00:37:53,213
that you can take care of her
better than me.

484
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:10,083
(Mint
11 missed calls)

485
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:22,463
We understood now.

486
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:24,893
So, we'll stick to the plan.

487
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:26,463
- Okay.
- Okay.

488
00:38:26,463 --> 00:38:27,323
Yes, Mr. Dew.

489
00:38:27,443 --> 00:38:28,133
All right.

490
00:38:30,973 --> 00:38:32,923
(Aun)

491
00:38:34,623 --> 00:38:36,243
So, you can have a break.

492
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:37,403
Oh.

493
00:38:37,843 --> 00:38:40,043
Okay, we will have a small break
and come back later.

494
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:41,523
Thank you.

495
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:42,653
All right.

496
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:03,073
- Hey.
- Hey.

497
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:05,733
Did your father have a heart attack

498
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,863
when you said
you will oversee this project?

499
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:11,503
He might have a heart attack
when I fail him.

500
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:14,163
This is strange.

501
00:39:14,763 --> 00:39:16,283
Suddenly, you want to work.

502
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:17,753
Why?

503
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:19,773
It was you

504
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:22,133
who told me to take care of
my family's business.

505
00:39:22,363 --> 00:39:23,573
That's right.

506
00:39:23,923 --> 00:39:24,893
That's why I was surprised

507
00:39:24,893 --> 00:39:27,043
that you called to ask me
to help with your business.

508
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:28,733
So?

509
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:29,893
Do you want to be my permanent staff?

510
00:39:36,703 --> 00:39:37,573
Miss Mint.

511
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:39,333
You forgot your documents.

512
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,043
Oh.

513
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:41,023
Those documents.

514
00:39:41,703 --> 00:39:42,783
I will go there and get it.

515
00:39:45,473 --> 00:39:46,053
Wait a second.

516
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:03,733
(Aun's calling)

517
00:40:04,893 --> 00:40:05,833
Hello? Aun.

518
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:07,573
Why are you calling?

519
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:08,843
Why don't you just text me?

520
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:10,433
It's okay. We can talk.

521
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:11,603
Mint got inside to get her documents.

522
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:13,223
All right the...

523
00:40:13,283 --> 00:40:15,493
What the heck?

524
00:40:15,493 --> 00:40:16,263
What's up, Aun?

525
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:18,233
Do you hate me that much, Dew?

526
00:40:19,913 --> 00:40:20,673
Mint!

527
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:23,853
It's not what you think at all.

528
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:26,303
Mint!

529
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:27,603
Hello, Mint?

530
00:40:55,493 --> 00:40:57,573
Mr. Dew, our team are back
from the break.

531
00:40:57,573 --> 00:40:58,753
Would you like to resume the meeting?

532
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:01,263
All right.

533
00:41:30,723 --> 00:41:31,673
Hello, Aun.

534
00:41:31,673 --> 00:41:33,233
Dew, I am sorry.

535
00:41:33,413 --> 00:41:36,253
Mint threatened to jump out of the car
if I don't tell her where you are.

536
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:39,523
Where are you now?

537
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:41,163
In the car.

538
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:42,863
Near your office.

539
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:45,583
You'd better come to see her.
She's waiting for you.

540
00:42:09,253 --> 00:42:10,473
So, you finally came to see me.

541
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:14,763
I am sorry.

542
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:19,613
Are you seeing someone else?

543
00:42:27,123 --> 00:42:27,993
Yes.

544
00:42:35,993 --> 00:42:37,433
When did you become a bad guy?

545
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:40,453
You can scold me whatever you want.

546
00:42:40,813 --> 00:42:42,853
Because what I did to you was bad.

547
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:47,173
But now...

548
00:42:47,743 --> 00:42:49,183
can you just go back?

549
00:42:51,453 --> 00:42:53,083
Because you want to
avoid me again, right?

550
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:54,783
It's not like that.

551
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,183
Well...

552
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,493
It's getting late.

553
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:03,723
It will be dangerous.

554
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:09,203
Stop lying to me, Dew.

555
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:11,803
Can't you just be honest with me?

556
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:16,643
Listen to me...

557
00:43:17,683 --> 00:43:19,163
Tomorrow, I will come
to see you at home.

558
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:22,713
I will tell you everything
you want to know.

559
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:24,893
Whatever you want to know,
I will tell you all.

560
00:43:33,793 --> 00:43:35,403
There is no tomorrow between us.

561
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:40,903
Mint! Mint!

562
00:43:41,983 --> 00:43:43,293
Can you just calm down?

563
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:46,653
All right.

564
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:48,573
Just wait here.

565
00:43:49,323 --> 00:43:51,533
I will call Aun to pick you up.

566
00:43:56,713 --> 00:43:58,893
Can you stop tossing me to someone else?

567
00:43:58,893 --> 00:44:00,253
I don't want to do that either.

568
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:03,103
I just have to do this.

569
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:05,143
Have to?

570
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,053
Can I just ask...

571
00:44:09,953 --> 00:44:11,183
in the past...

572
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:14,833
have you ever loved me?

573
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:24,213
Mint!

574
00:44:26,653 --> 00:44:27,333
Wait.

575
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:28,343
Let go of me.

576
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:31,243
Mint!

577
00:44:33,593 --> 00:44:35,353
(Dew's World)

578
00:44:35,593 --> 00:44:38,353
(Mum's World)

579
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,053
This is probably my last chance

580
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:43,403
to go there

581
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:45,823
and tell that boy the truth

582
00:44:47,303 --> 00:44:49,463
so that he can change his destiny.

583
00:44:51,673 --> 00:44:52,533
I really have to go there.

584
00:45:02,763 --> 00:45:04,843
It's good that you can do
whatever you want to do.

585
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,233
So you don't have to
always think about that.

586
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:15,243
You don't think I am crazy, right?

587
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:20,823
I believed everything you said to me.

588
00:45:27,033 --> 00:45:28,313
Thank you so much.

589
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:35,383
P'Mum.

590
00:45:37,823 --> 00:45:39,333
Do you actually think...

591
00:45:40,043 --> 00:45:41,113
that you...

592
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:44,393
can really help that boy?

593
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:54,013
Yes, I can.

594
00:45:57,193 --> 00:45:57,943
I really can.

595
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,553
Mint!

596
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:33,523
Dew!
