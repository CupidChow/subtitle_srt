The world that I grew up

5
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:02,454
gave me a valuable lesson.

6
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:06,431
To do thing step by step

7
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,613
is the safest way.

8
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,277
Especially

9
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:17,449
the step that

10
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:20,447
the only heir in the family like me

11
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,327
should do.

12
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,943
Being Mr. Yes man

13
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:31,950
would make things easier.

14
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:36,606
But why...

15
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:38,253
do I still feel

16
00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:40,262
so lonely?

17
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:47,991
I need to find someplace

18
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:49,473
to be my safe zone.

19
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:51,613
But what I do not know is...

20
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:56,697
I will meet someone

21
00:01:57,957 --> 00:01:59,430
at that place.

22
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:02,650
The person who will change my life

23
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:04,955
forever.

(Dew's World)
(4 November 2022)

27
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,015
Hello, Mr. Dew.

28
00:03:30,154 --> 00:03:30,777
Hello.

29
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:32,659
Hello.

30
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,371
May I come in?

31
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:51,553
Are those the documents
that I have requested?

32
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,740
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:55,692
Are you sure that you will do this?

34
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,435
I am certain.

35
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:59,104
Please arrange a team meeting.

36
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:00,090
Yes.

(Marketing Report)

38
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,152
What is it, Dew?

39
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,100
Why is the marketing report

40
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:13,736
not going anywhere?

41
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:15,751
Papa...

42
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:17,151
I am rushing it.

43
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:20,143
But I don't have access
to some customers' data.

44
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,474
When will you do it?

45
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:22,334
Do you know the reason why

46
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,662
we became the top-tier company
in the flooring material business?

47
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:29,945
Do you think

48
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,491
you can earn our customers' trust

49
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,569
by sitting in
an air-conditioning room like this?

50
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:37,149
I am trying, Papa.

51
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,904
Please give me one more chance.

52
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,573
If you are not my only son

53
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,008
and you don't have to
carry on my business,

54
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:49,735
I will expect nothing of you.

55
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:50,728
Brother,

56
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:52,423
please calm down.

57
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:54,015
Dew is still young.

58
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:55,333
Why do you always take his side?

59
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:56,666
You are his uncle.

60
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:58,761
You should lecture him.

61
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:00,826
You pampering him

62
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:02,312
made him a big baby now.

63
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:03,661
The way his mother raised him

64
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:04,575
was useless.

65
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,808
Come on, Brother.

66
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,955
It has to be done step by step.

67
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:12,795
One day, Dew will become
the chairman of this company.

68
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,566
Is that right?

69
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:19,147
I don't know that.

70
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,105
This generation...

71
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:24,383
They don't trust our way of management.

72
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:25,909
And they don't know
how to run a business.

73
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:31,698
- Let's talk about the Vietnamese project.
- OK.

74
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:36,181
You might get it by now.

75
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:39,173
This is not your expertise,

76
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,675
and you will find it difficult.

77
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:42,565
If you can't do it,

78
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:43,566
there is no need to force yourself.

79
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:46,055
Just go back to doing what you want to do.

80
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,440
I will do it, Uncle.

81
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,694
And I will make the best.

82
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,121
Good.

83
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,465
You are my brother's flesh and blood.

84
00:05:58,383 --> 00:05:59,731
Don't give up that easily.

85
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,905
I will give you a piece of advice.

86
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:21,853
If you want to be successful,

87
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:25,034
you need to concentrate only
on your work.

88
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,860
Do not get your hands on

89
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,442
other people's work.

90
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:30,980
Understand?

91
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:44,813
I am sorry.

92
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:47,489
I was arranging the meeting room

93
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,727
so I did not know
the Magnate came into your office.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,531
Is our team ready in the meeting room?

95
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:53,793
Yes.

96
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:01,823
This is very risky.

97
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:08,602
If what I am doing

98
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:09,803
can benefit our company,

99
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,063
it's worth trying.

100
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:13,969
Let me help.

101
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:15,169
It's all right.

102
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:31,136
My brother gets angry too easily.

103
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,268
I gave him some information,

104
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,723
and he was so angry about it.

105
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:39,165
I want you to see Dew's face
when he was scolded by his father.

106
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:40,677
Boss.

107
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:45,675
He ordered his staff to check
the past quarterly sales of our department.

108
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,384
They are now having a meeting.

109
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:52,258
He thought he was smart enough
to find our mistakes.

110
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:55,623
Did you clean everything?

111
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,741
Yes, Boss.

112
00:07:57,087 --> 00:08:00,804
I guarantee there is no evidence left
that they can link to you.

113
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,223
What is our next move?

114
00:08:58,932 --> 00:08:59,735
Hello, Mom?

115
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:01,361
Are you still awake?

116
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:03,024
My son...

117
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,349
How can I go to bed?

118
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:06,619
I couldn't contact you all day.

119
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,584
It took you so long to answer my call.

120
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:10,282
I almost got a heart attack.

121
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:12,978
I am sorry.

122
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:15,078
I was very busy with work.

123
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,177
So I turned off my mobile.

124
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:18,014
I heard that

125
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:19,970
Papa scolded you in your office.

126
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,000
It's nothing, Mom.

127
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:27,291
Your spy "Noon" works very well.

128
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,422
Don't be angry with Noon.

129
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:33,154
I asked her to do that.

130
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,381
Dew...

131
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:39,645
You do know what Papa did today

132
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:42,266
was because he loves you
and he did it for your good, right?

133
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,510
He just wants his only son

134
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:48,399
can manage his business
without any badmouthing.

135
00:09:49,752 --> 00:09:50,147
Yes.

136
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,951
I understand that clearly.

137
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:54,776
I will try my best.

138
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,456
I will not let both of you down.

139
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:00,719
You are the sweetest, my chubby baby.

140
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:02,754
I am on your team.

141
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:05,661
I know you can do anything.

142
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:10,696
Hey, you!

143
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,836
You should stop pampering him.

144
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:14,664
He is still your baby

145
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,535
because of this.

146
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:18,825
He is aimless.

147
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,330
You should not be too strict with him.

148
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,673
Don't you have pity on him?

149
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:25,467
Switch off the light.

150
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:27,235
I have to go to work early.

151
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:32,828
Dew, I will go to bed now.

152
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:33,996
You should go to sleep, too.

153
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,654
I will find time to see you
at your condo.

154
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:36,675
You!

155
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:38,856
Okay, I will hang up now.

156
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:39,912
Go to bed, baby.

157
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:43,194
Mom...

158
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:49,813
Good night.

159
00:10:51,163 --> 00:10:52,035
Good night.

160
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,167
You!

161
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:36,559
(Deal closed)
(Thank you for supporting our brand)

162
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,667
Your new collection looks good.

163
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,207
How is it?

164
00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:42,231
Do you think it will be a hit?

165
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:45,633
Do you think I can sell it?

166
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:47,046
Because...

167
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,347
I just posted some photos on my IG.

168
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,029
It's very good.

169
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,112
You don't have to worry.

170
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,409
You can do anything.

171
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,991
There are many things that I cannot do.

172
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:06,162
What is it?

173
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:09,468
No.

174
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:13,226
I am just proud of myself

175
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,906
for having not chosen the wrong person.

176
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,041
Hey!

177
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,034
Is this your trick?

178
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:20,902
That's right.

179
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,599
But I am very proud of you.

180
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:27,216
Thank you.

181
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:31,931
Well...

182
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,492
Have your parents come to visit?

183
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:42,804
Only my mother came.

184
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:45,319
My Papa...

185
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:49,396
He is probably busy.

186
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:02,278
Your brand will be famous.

187
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:05,467
Trust me.

188
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,714
(Outstagram)

189
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:34,614
Dew...

190
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:36,873
Your time to do what you love is up.

191
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,159
From now on,

192
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:41,820
you need to grow up.

193
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:47,088
Are you okay, Dew?

194
00:13:57,644 --> 00:13:58,185
Dew...

195
00:13:58,543 --> 00:13:59,506
You haven't answered my call
for too long.

196
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,436
I have my commission today.

197
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:05,686
Shall we go to eat Omakase?

198
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:06,534
My treat.

199
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:13,804
(Mile_Mint)

200
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,086
Three... Four.

201
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:22,650
The fly...

202
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,110
The fly...

203
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:25,644
The fly...

204
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,976
The fly... The fly...

205
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:28,480
The fly... The fly...

206
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:30,387
The fly... The fruit fly...

207
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:32,884
The fruit fly... The fruit fly...
The fruit fly...

208
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,129
The fruit fly... The fruit fly...
The fruit fly... I'm scared.

209
00:14:36,495 --> 00:14:38,721
Iguana... Iguana... Iguana

210
00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:41,978
Iguana... Iguana... Bamboo Worm...

211
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:44,372
Bamboo Worm... Bamboo Worm...
Bamboo Worm...

212
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:47,317
Bamboo Worm... Bamboo Worm...
Bamboo Worm... The fly...

213
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:53,198
You can sit down now.

214
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,680
We have joined
this activity for some time.

215
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,627
We believe that

216
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:57,885
everyone here

217
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,890
has known your friends well.

218
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,045
So, today,

219
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:02,922
I want everyone

220
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:06,141
to vote for a Class President
for Faculty of Business Administration.

221
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,934
Do you have anyone in mind?

222
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:10,839
I present Dew.

223
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:11,794
It's Dew.

224
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,179
I present Mint.

225
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,646
I also present Mint.

226
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,485
My friend is smart and beautiful.

227
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:18,420
- Dew... Dew... Dew...
- Mint... Mint... Mint...

228
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:22,732
- Dew... Dew... Dew... Dew
- Mint... Mint... Mint... Mint...

229
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:23,436
- Dew... Dew... Dew...
- Mint... Mint... Mint...

230
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:24,815
All right!

231
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:25,896
I would like to ask

232
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:27,112
Dew and Mint

233
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:28,130
to come forward.

234
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:37,338
Okay.

235
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:40,217
Before we vote for a Class President,

236
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:42,021
I have a question for Dew

237
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:43,275
and Mint.

238
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,052
If one of you

239
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:46,682
become a Class President,

240
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:49,211
what kind of method

241
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,327
do you want to use
to work for our faculty?

242
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,487
Dew, you answer first.

243
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:58,756
For me,

244
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,464
no job can be done by only one man.

245
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,107
We all should brainstorm,

246
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,443
and do it together.

247
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:06,879
We should solve problems

248
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:08,351
together.

249
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:10,254
Then all of our work can be a success.

250
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,013
Very good.

251
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,500
What is your answer, Mint?

252
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:20,420
For me,

253
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:23,727
I may not be born to be a leader,

254
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,110
so...

255
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,579
I want to be a team player.

256
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:30,659
If I want to vote for someone,

257
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,928
I will vote for Dew.

258
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:39,740
Dew...

259
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:41,969
You are the most suitable one.

260
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,141
What do you think?

261
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:47,173
Yes, we agree.

262
00:16:47,283 --> 00:16:48,148
Dew!

263
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,333
But...

264
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:53,791
we still need a Vice-president.

265
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,631
Do you have anyone in mind?

266
00:16:58,479 --> 00:16:58,981
Senior,

267
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:00,776
so...

268
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:02,381
I want to present Mint

269
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,638
to be a Class Vice-president.

270
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,218
What do you think, Mint?

271
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:15,660
Yes.

272
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:22,403
Then...

273
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:23,915
We will take some photos.

274
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:25,192
Take a photo now.

275
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:26,732
Get closer.

276
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:28,025
You... Get closer.

277
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:29,443
All right.

278
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,899
Everyone smiles.

279
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,000
Say "Hey"!

280
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:36,671
One... Two...

281
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:51,650
Hey!

282
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:53,629
What should I do?

283
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:56,115
I was the one who asked him.

284
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:00,685
You just have to hold yourself tight.

285
00:18:00,686 --> 00:18:02,621
(Mile_Mint)

286
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:04,527
His name is Dew.

287
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:20,964
Sorry.

288
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:22,233
The traffic is bad today.

289
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,504
When I saw your message,

290
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:25,012
I told my boss

291
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:26,701
and immediately came to see you.

292
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,297
Why did you tell him?

293
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:29,500
You are my friend.

294
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:31,662
And that is my dad's company.

295
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:33,308
All right.

296
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:35,755
I'm just following the protocol.

297
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,504
If I tell you to come right now,

298
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:38,665
it means you have to come right away.

299
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:43,368
Why are you so angry?

300
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,001
Have you seen the message?

301
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:57,628
Aun...

302
00:18:58,845 --> 00:18:59,502
I do know

303
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,005
that I don't have the right to say this.

304
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:03,177
As your friend,

305
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:06,095
I have to be honest.

306
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:07,479
A handsome guy like you,

307
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,691
you can easily get laid.

308
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,401
It doesn't have to be Mint.

309
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,040
But I want her.

310
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:20,112
I like Mint.

311
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:22,861
But Mint loves Dew.

312
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,362
You can see how Dew treats her.

313
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:27,630
I have to clear this thing up with him.

314
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:30,547
Clear this thing up with Dew?

315
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,045
How?

316
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,134
Dew has disappeared
from our group for a long time.

317
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:38,178
No one can contact him.

318
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:44,990
I feel bad for Mint.

319
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:49,553
What if...

320
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:53,186
I come to see him at his dad's company.

321
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:53,770
Uh...

322
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:55,122
I don't think it'll work.

323
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:56,412
Don't do that.

324
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:58,143
Call his office.

325
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,278
Do it now.

326
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:00,949
Aun.

327
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:02,751
I ask you to call him now.

328
00:20:03,294 --> 00:20:04,203
Just do it.

329
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,829
Do it now.

330
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:28,818
He is not in the office.

331
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:33,090
His secretary also told me that
he won't come back today.

332
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:34,861
Did you ask her where he is?

333
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:38,084
Aun, give me another color.

334
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:39,942
Okay.

335
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:43,569
Here it is, Mint.

336
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,514
There's a little color on your face now.

337
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,595
What's wrong with you?

338
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:50,812
I didn't mean to do that.

339
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:54,537
But I think it looks good on you.

340
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:55,996
Yes, I agree.

341
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:57,703
Do you want to look good like me?

342
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:58,439
I am your friend.

343
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,601
It's your business.

344
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:00,657
I will not help you.

345
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:02,437
- I will paint your face.
- Don't do that.

346
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:03,383
Enough. It's enough.

347
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,304
- Enough already.
- Another side.

348
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:06,419
Enough, you guys.

349
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:08,055
Hey, guys,

350
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:10,128
After you finish this,
we will go to celebrate.

351
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,270
My treat today.

352
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:12,663
Yes, let's go.

353
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,619
Let's go.

354
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:15,190
This is good.

355
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:24,226
We can do it like this.

356
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,503
Dew.

357
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:29,181
For you.

358
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:32,571
What is it?

359
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:37,573
It's love.

360
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:39,092
I'm giving you my love.

361
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:41,631
Will you be my boyfriend?

362
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:47,306
Please...

363
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:51,532
We'd better be friends.

364
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,264
You are my best friend.

365
00:21:56,841 --> 00:21:57,505
Everyone.

366
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,076
And this is

367
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:00,662
the 58th time that the same guy

368
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:02,591
broke her heart.

369
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,872
What's wrong with him?

370
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:22,907
I don't know.

371
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,358
Why are you following me?

372
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:54,427
You're just hiding here.

373
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:58,245
Just tell me what you want.

374
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:00,176
Why are you messing up with Mint?

375
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:02,407
I am not messing up with her.

376
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:04,036
I have other work to do.

377
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:05,145
What is it then?

378
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,607
I am asking you. What is it about?

379
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,930
It's my business.

380
00:23:36,736 --> 00:23:37,916
Mint chose you to be her boyfriend.

381
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:40,356
Why can't you just appreciate it?

382
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:45,116
This is not your business at all.

383
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:46,666
What do you mean?

384
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:51,036
I mean you should not cross the line.

385
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,126
You can do that with your family

386
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:55,396
or your subordinate.

387
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:56,956
But for some people,

388
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:58,636
- you don't have the right to do that.
- You know nothing.

389
00:23:58,636 --> 00:23:59,236
Are you messing up with me?

390
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:00,556
Calm down, both of you.

391
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:01,936
The security might ask us to leave.

392
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:02,536
Let go of me.

393
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:04,366
I'm warning you for the last time.

394
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:06,456
If you hurt Mint again,

395
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:08,506
I will not forgive you.

396
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:22,776
(Dew's World)
(8 November 2022)

397
00:24:39,236 --> 00:24:40,816
I've checked all the reports.

398
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:42,756
There are problems

399
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:44,236
with these purchase orders.

400
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:46,116
The person who signed the order

401
00:24:46,396 --> 00:24:47,016
is...

402
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:48,176
Mister...

403
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:49,816
We won't judge anything now.

404
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,466
These signatures

405
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:53,726
can be forged.

406
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:58,006
Um...

407
00:24:58,766 --> 00:24:59,626
Khun Dew...

408
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:02,906
If our investigation proves to be right,

409
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:05,086
what are you going to do next?

410
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:15,336
About your nephew,

411
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:18,616
I've ordered my people
to hide all the evidence.

412
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:20,436
That means it's not done yet.

413
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,126
If your way is slow,

414
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:30,306
why not use my way?

415
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:31,926
It will be fast.

416
00:25:45,366 --> 00:25:47,756
The number you just dialed
has no signal.

417
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,906
I knew that Aun came to see you.

418
00:25:51,996 --> 00:25:53,056
I am so sorry.

419
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:55,126
I didn't want this to happen.

420
00:25:57,226 --> 00:25:58,616
Please do not avoid us.

421
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:00,556
I am worried about you.

422
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:16,766
What happened?

423
00:26:18,046 --> 00:26:19,536
I want to talk to you.

424
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:21,866
Aun asked you to come, right?

425
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:24,506
You both are...

426
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:25,526
You both have never changed.

427
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:28,296
Can you contact Dew?

428
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:38,636
Shall we go to see him at the condo?

429
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:39,856
I will take you there.

430
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:42,476
You told me once

431
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:45,156
that Dew gave you the key card
to his room.

432
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:49,526
Yes.

433
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:51,436
I'd better not do that.

434
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:52,986
I don't want to cross the line.

435
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:57,026
You just keep hiding your feelings.

436
00:26:57,856 --> 00:27:00,206
But in your tweets,

437
00:27:00,546 --> 00:27:01,756
you complained about him.

438
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,166
You want him to read it.

439
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:07,106
It'll not make a difference
if you go to his room.

440
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:09,756
I...

441
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:12,876
When the right time comes,

442
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:15,466
I will go there myself.

443
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:17,956
And who will tell you
it's the right time?

444
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:19,516
Is it Dew?

445
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:24,886
You've just hit the nail on the head.

446
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,756
Well, are you still mad at Aun?

447
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:38,636
Don't be mad at him.

448
00:27:39,146 --> 00:27:40,016
He did that

449
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:41,556
for your good.

450
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:45,106
Then let me ask you.

451
00:27:45,756 --> 00:27:46,966
If Dew did something like him,

452
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,516
will you take his side?

453
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:52,826
I am not taking Aun's side.

454
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:54,466
You all are my friends.

455
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:57,546
I want everyone to be the same
as we were in university.

456
00:27:58,396 --> 00:27:59,656
I don't want to talk about this now.

457
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:01,496
Excuse me.

458
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:04,066
Are you done?

459
00:28:04,776 --> 00:28:05,476
You should go now.

460
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,336
I have a meeting with a client.

461
00:28:31,436 --> 00:28:35,006
(What are you doing?
Good night. Mint, I am sorry.)

462
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:47,126
Mint.

463
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,146
Can we talk?

464
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:52,786
What do you want to talk about?

465
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:57,196
I don't want to see all of your tweets

466
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,266
are about someone who threw you away.

467
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,656
I will set my account private then.

468
00:29:02,196 --> 00:29:02,986
So, you won't be able to read it.

469
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,206
Okay?

470
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:06,266
I don't mean that.

471
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:09,546
I met Tuu the other day.

472
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:11,766
He told me that there was gossip.

473
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:13,386
He asked me why you're dating Dew.

474
00:29:14,346 --> 00:29:16,716
Because Dew doesn't seem to like women.

475
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:20,416
Is that all?

476
00:29:21,456 --> 00:29:22,446
Mint, calm down.

477
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:24,916
I am worried about you.

478
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:27,306
I don't want you to get hurt

479
00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:29,876
because you love someone
who would never love you back.

480
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:36,286
Why are you saying something like that?

481
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:39,706
You knew

482
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:41,136
I and Dew are dating.

483
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:44,196
Okay.

484
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:46,396
I asked him to date me.

485
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:47,686
So what?

486
00:29:49,716 --> 00:29:51,146
I like Dew.

487
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:53,446
I like him for what he is.

488
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:56,096
And you,

489
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,376
since I met you,

490
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:01,126
Dew

491
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:04,146
has never spoken ill of you.

492
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:07,326
Mint.

493
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:08,466
Listen to me.

494
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:09,556
Mint.

495
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:18,766
Bottom-up!

496
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:31,406
Darn it!

497
00:30:31,816 --> 00:30:33,366
Am I a bad person?

498
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:37,246
What makes Dew so different from me?

499
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:38,546
Why Mint...

500
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:40,066
Hey!

501
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:45,346
We are the same group of friends.

502
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,856
I think Mint hasn't seen
his true color yet.

503
00:30:52,276 --> 00:30:53,586
If Dew didn't exist,

504
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:55,916
Mint wouldn't get hurt like this.

505
00:30:57,446 --> 00:30:58,106
And me and Mint...

506
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:58,946
Stop now.

507
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:03,936
You are so drunk.

508
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:05,966
I am not drunk.

509
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:13,526
Can you buy me some more beers?

510
00:31:14,646 --> 00:31:15,616
You've drunk too much already.

511
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:16,926
I am not drunk.

512
00:31:21,056 --> 00:31:21,986
Just buy me more beers.

513
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,306
Okay, okay. I'll buy it.

514
00:32:02,996 --> 00:32:03,646
Dew...

515
00:32:06,036 --> 00:32:06,676
Dew...

516
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:15,706
Aun...

517
00:32:16,856 --> 00:32:18,636
Why are you acting like a jerk?

518
00:32:20,226 --> 00:32:21,536
I once told you that

519
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:23,786
if you mistreat Mint again,

520
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:26,446
I will not forgive you.

521
00:32:28,086 --> 00:32:29,556
Do you have that much free time?

522
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:32,496
Why are you always putting your nose
into my business?

523
00:32:33,006 --> 00:32:33,996
Are you calling me bossy?

524
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:34,496
Hey!

525
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:36,016
Aun!

526
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:38,756
Do you need help?

527
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:41,716
It's okay.

528
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:43,646
He is my friend.

529
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:45,306
He is just a little bit drunk.

530
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:46,946
That's right.

531
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:49,346
We are best friends.

532
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,836
Please keep your voice down.

533
00:32:56,796 --> 00:32:57,396
Aun.

534
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:58,906
You should go home.

535
00:32:59,126 --> 00:32:59,926
I won't go.

536
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:02,006
Why don't you take care of Mint?

537
00:33:02,826 --> 00:33:03,896
About me and Mint,

538
00:33:04,386 --> 00:33:05,386
I will talk to her.

539
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:08,006
You don't know what I have been through.

540
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:08,996
Just go home.

541
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:09,696
I said I won't go.

542
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:13,176
I don't understand
why everyone always overrates you.

543
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,846
Dew is so good. Dew is so cool.

544
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:17,756
No one sees your true color.

545
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:21,066
Do you think being the person
everyone expected to be

546
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,426
is easy?

547
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:23,686
Do you think

548
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,936
being the person who tries so hard
without his efforts being seen

549
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:28,596
is easy?

550
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,186
If you don't exist,

551
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:38,416
Mint will see me.

552
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:40,536
She won't treat me like
I am nobody to her.

553
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:43,296
Darn you!

554
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:44,796
Aun, stop.

555
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:46,376
Joey, you let go of me.

556
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:47,876
- Joey.
- Calm down.

557
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:48,426
Let go of me.

558
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:48,906
Joey!

559
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:50,106
Pull yourself together!

560
00:33:54,146 --> 00:33:55,356
What happened? Sir?

561
00:34:09,696 --> 00:34:10,416
Joey.

562
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:12,626
Thank you.

563
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:17,446
No need to thank me.

564
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:19,666
You must remember now.

565
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:22,346
If you still hurt Mint,

566
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:23,686
next time,

567
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:25,406
the person who punches you

568
00:34:25,506 --> 00:34:26,226
will not be Aun.

569
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:28,346
It will be me.

570
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:53,766
(Dew's World)

571
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:06,266
Have you ever talked to Aun and Joey?

572
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:09,176
I haven't talked to them.
I've been busy with my work.

573
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:11,606
You too, right?

574
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:14,966
Your glass is empty.

575
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,766
What do you want to drink?
I'll order for you.

576
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:18,946
Blue Hawaii.

577
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:20,806
Thanks.

578
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:26,706
Hello, may I take your order?

579
00:35:26,826 --> 00:35:28,496
One blue Hawaii, please.

580
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:29,116
Yes, sir.

581
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:56,376
Dew!

582
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:11,196
Darn you.

583
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:12,226
Darn you.

584
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:12,826
Let go of me.

585
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:14,346
It's me. It's me.

586
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:16,216
Games!

587
00:36:17,116 --> 00:36:18,186
What the heck are you doing?

588
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:20,956
I am not doing anything.

589
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,016
Mint is here.

590
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:22,726
What?

591
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:27,476
Here is your drink.

592
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:30,956
How is your sale volume this month?

593
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:33,096
Oh, look at my face...

594
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:35,416
I worked so hard.

595
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:38,266
Can you buy me a drink tonight?

596
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:41,456
Yes, I can always do that.

597
00:36:43,616 --> 00:36:44,606
I am just kidding.

598
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:54,326
I think you...

599
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:55,646
Just go home.

600
00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:57,116
I'm trying to avoid a problem.

601
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,196
What about my clients?

602
00:37:00,416 --> 00:37:01,536
They might be a little bit unhappy,

603
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:02,106
but...

604
00:37:02,756 --> 00:37:03,406
It's all right.

605
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:06,266
I've hired someone
to surprise them already.

606
00:37:10,026 --> 00:37:10,996
It's up to you then.

607
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:12,156
I'll go now.

608
00:37:13,146 --> 00:37:13,836
See you.

609
00:37:14,706 --> 00:37:15,426
Hey, wait.

610
00:37:16,406 --> 00:37:17,466
Normally, when

611
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:19,296
we asked you to go home,

612
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:21,206
you always don't want to do that.

613
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,956
You'd end up making a scene.

614
00:37:24,006 --> 00:37:25,496
But today you...

615
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:29,866
What?

616
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,186
It's nothing.

617
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:33,116
What?

618
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:34,456
What's wrong with you?

619
00:37:34,676 --> 00:37:35,496
I don't understand what you're saying.

620
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:37,196
I will go now.

621
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:39,436
Such a waste of time.

622
00:37:39,776 --> 00:37:40,666
He kicked my back!

623
00:37:59,016 --> 00:37:59,706
Hey, Mum.

624
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:01,196
This man will soon be your
brother-in-law.

625
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:02,146
I've already sent his photo to you.

626
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:03,946
Mint's with him here.

627
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:06,146
Ping took a picture and sent it to me.

628
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:08,086
You should see him, so you'll know
what he looks like.

629
00:38:12,706 --> 00:38:13,136
What?

630
00:38:13,596 --> 00:38:14,196
You...

631
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:15,646
Why don't you take a look?

632
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:19,966
Your room will stay in the same place.

633
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:20,996
What's the rush?

634
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,306
What's wrong with you, P'Games?

635
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:51,916
Why do you look so tense?

636
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:53,766
No...

637
00:38:54,146 --> 00:38:54,766
I am just...

638
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:56,636
I am happy to meet Dream.

639
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:00,656
It's Dew.

640
00:39:01,236 --> 00:39:02,206
His name is Dew.

641
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:05,226
Dew.

642
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:06,126
It's Dew.

643
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:08,516
Dew...

644
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,636
May I ask you something?

645
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:11,476
Recently, have you

646
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:12,886
ever checked your horoscope

647
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:14,446
to see if you might get jinxed?

648
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:16,446
Why are you dating Mint?

649
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:18,256
P'Games!

650
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,216
Uh...

651
00:39:19,896 --> 00:39:21,126
Mint is my best friend.

652
00:39:21,836 --> 00:39:23,006
Oh, I see.

653
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,346
I like the vibe here.

654
00:39:31,146 --> 00:39:32,026
Who is the designer?

655
00:39:33,686 --> 00:39:35,226
My friend, Mum.

656
00:39:35,526 --> 00:39:36,456
He is also Mint's brother.

657
00:39:38,156 --> 00:39:39,416
He is sick today.

658
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:40,476
So, he couldn't come here.

659
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:45,756
He is a singer,

660
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:47,506
but he can also design.

661
00:39:47,876 --> 00:39:48,746
He is great.

662
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:50,166
I like it here.

663
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:51,446
It looks carefree.

664
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:52,536
But...

665
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:54,126
Its ambience is warm.

666
00:39:54,986 --> 00:39:55,716
Well...

667
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:56,696
We studied architecture.

668
00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:59,646
If Mum heard your compliments,

669
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:00,516
now

670
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:01,376
he would fly out

671
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:02,766
of the roof.

672
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:03,396
Mint...

673
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:05,036
Dew...

674
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,086
Make yourself at home.

675
00:40:06,086 --> 00:40:06,826
I have to excuse myself.

676
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:08,126
- Yes.
- Thank you.

677
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:13,936
I just knew that Mum
got an architecture degree.

678
00:40:14,096 --> 00:40:15,426
Mum moved to take care of Mint

679
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,546
after their parents died
in a car accident last year.

680
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:25,806
Mum loves his sister very much.

681
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:27,636
Yes.

682
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:30,836
But Mum always shows his love
in the opposite way.

683
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:34,726
Well...

684
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,466
Why...

685
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,406
does Mint look

686
00:40:38,476 --> 00:40:39,976
so obsessed with that Dew guy.

687
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:44,216
Cherry.

688
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:45,886
What is it?

689
00:40:46,786 --> 00:40:47,406
Well...

690
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,996
A woman who likes this type of man

691
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:51,366
is called Cherry.

692
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,086
You mean

693
00:40:53,596 --> 00:40:55,836
a woman likes a guy
who wears neat clothes

694
00:40:55,946 --> 00:40:58,206
and has metrosexual looks.

695
00:40:58,896 --> 00:40:59,706
Something like that.

696
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:00,896
Nowadays,

697
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:02,276
it's fluid.

698
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:06,086
That's true.

699
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:07,986
Even me.

700
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,146
I am fluid, too.

701
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:12,986
Well...

702
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:15,036
About what happened today...

703
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:16,146
I want to take a day off tomorrow.

704
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:20,246
You want to take a day off?

705
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,056
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

706
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:27,376
I am going to move out of my condo.

707
00:41:28,246 --> 00:41:29,126
I've told you already.

708
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:38,846
He just dumps me.

709
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:47,916
This is delicious.

710
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:49,616
Thank you.

711
00:41:53,036 --> 00:41:53,606
So...

712
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:55,306
How is your brand?

713
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:56,306
What are you going to do next?

714
00:41:56,966 --> 00:41:57,546
Well,

715
00:41:58,126 --> 00:42:00,136
I am planning to hire a brand presenter.

716
00:42:01,106 --> 00:42:02,486
But I don't want a movie star.

717
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:03,786
I want

718
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:06,476
an influencer or an internet idol.
Something like that.

719
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:08,296
Influencer?

720
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:11,686
How many followers do you need?

721
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,286
Maybe I can find the right one for you.

722
00:42:14,726 --> 00:42:15,216
Around...

723
00:42:16,686 --> 00:42:17,906
Twenty to thirty thousand followers
is okay.

724
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:19,636
I want three or four influencers.

725
00:42:26,856 --> 00:42:27,936
Why are you smiling like that?

726
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:29,386
Whom do you want to introduce to me?

727
00:42:50,076 --> 00:42:51,026
Am I going to die

728
00:42:51,496 --> 00:42:53,286
in two days, P'Mum?

729
00:42:57,526 --> 00:42:58,356
No!

730
00:43:29,626 --> 00:43:31,716
(Family Dew)

731
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:42,896
(Business Friends）

732
00:43:44,046 --> 00:43:48,676
(Pratin)

733
00:43:59,526 --> 00:44:08,296
(Girlfriend)

734
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:15,526
(Pratin)

735
00:44:17,296 --> 00:44:25,976
(Who killed Dew?)

736
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:34,776
Nook, come here.

737
00:44:34,926 --> 00:44:36,976
The food is ready.

738
00:44:37,286 --> 00:44:38,806
Is this our last order?

739
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:40,076
That's right.

740
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:41,316
Okay, just go.

741
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:42,606
Take it out.

742
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:46,616
I can rest now.

743
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:54,436
Hello, young man?

744
00:44:55,156 --> 00:44:55,926
What else do you need?

745
00:44:57,016 --> 00:44:58,096
Dew is not a ghost.

746
00:44:58,726 --> 00:44:59,466
I am sure.

747
00:45:01,236 --> 00:45:02,616
And I had a clue about the murderer.

748
00:45:03,816 --> 00:45:05,266
Wait. Are you still awake?

749
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:08,526
At Dew's place,

750
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,076
it's...

751
00:45:10,476 --> 00:45:12,036
definitely my own room.

752
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:14,096
It's just like

753
00:45:14,736 --> 00:45:15,816
we are in the same place

754
00:45:16,636 --> 00:45:18,066
but in a different universe.

755
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,166
The different universe...

756
00:45:21,396 --> 00:45:22,996
Wait! It's like...

757
00:45:23,146 --> 00:45:25,436
the parallel world theory or

758
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:27,016
the multiverse, right?
