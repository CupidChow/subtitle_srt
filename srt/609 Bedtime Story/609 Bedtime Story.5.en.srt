Nook, come here. watch on kisskh.me

6
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:24,394
The food is ready.

7
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:25,605
Yes, I am coming.

8
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:27,172
Is this our last order?

9
00:00:27,582 --> 00:00:28,573
That's right.

10
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:29,655
Okay, just go.

11
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:30,929
Take it out.

12
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,981
I can rest now.

13
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:42,745
Hello, young man.

14
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:44,350
What else do you need?

15
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:46,500
Dew is not a ghost.

16
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:47,755
I am sure.

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,340
And I had a clue about the murderer.

18
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:52,683
Wait.

19
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:53,660
Are you still awake?

20
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:56,971
At Dew's place,

21
00:00:58,044 --> 00:01:00,390
it's... definitely my own room.

22
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:02,480
It's just like...

23
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:04,293
we are in the same place

24
00:01:05,026 --> 00:01:06,496
but in a different universe.

25
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,519
The different universe...

26
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,285
Wait! It's like...

27
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:13,890
the parallel world theory or

28
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,298
the multiverse, right?

29
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,133
That's right!

30
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,151
I have to go now.

31
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:20,844
Wait! Mum, Mum.

32
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,233
He just hung up on me like that.

33
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:24,748
What is it, then?

34
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:26,618
It changed from a ghost story

35
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,675
to a sci-fi story?

36
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:30,910
I am confused now.

37
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:33,987
Please listen to the next song.

38
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:47,661
I...

39
00:01:47,802 --> 00:01:50,311
will order this, but make it two.

40
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:51,435
For Dew,

41
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,403
he likes sweet and sour tastes.

42
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:53,256
No alcohol.

43
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:56,121
I need the same drink, please.

44
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:56,785
Yes.

45
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:00,912
Then,

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,657
about the influencers,

47
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:03,668
I'm counting on you.

48
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:05,347
All right.

49
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:06,294
No problem.

50
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:07,719
I guarantee that

51
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:08,590
he will cause a sensation.

52
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:11,837
I do hope so.

53
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,457
I promised my Dad that

54
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,291
if the sales

55
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:16,631
do not meet the target,

56
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,737
I'll have to be a trainee
at his company.

57
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:21,342
Wow, that's a high stake.

58
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:22,946
That's right.

59
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:25,256
If the sales do hit the target,

60
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:26,797
I will treat
both you and that influencer

61
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,125
to a big meal.

62
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:30,831
Then,

63
00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:33,703
can I ask for something else?

64
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:35,965
Go ahead.

65
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:39,956
How about...

66
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:42,765
being my boyfriend?

67
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,640
Are you drunk?

68
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:48,724
No, I am not drunk.
I am serious.

69
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:52,418
I've tried to give other guys a chance.

70
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,838
But no one works for me.

71
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,562
You will not like me

72
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:00,449
'cause I will become a bad boyfriend.

73
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,317
How about giving it a try?

74
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:06,685
If you date me,

75
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,180
we'll have a 50-50 chance.

76
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:13,215
If not,
then there will be no chance at all.

77
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,108
You are a great salesperson.

78
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,961
I almost believed you.

79
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,803
If you don't believe me today,
it's fine.

80
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:23,467
I will continue to persuade you.

81
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:26,618
You are such a pursuer.

82
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:29,104
Then,

83
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:31,929
I want to ask you this seriously.

84
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,789
Can you be a single man forever?

85
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,328
From bottom of my heart,

86
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,559
I won't be able to take it at all,

87
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:47,698
if you date someone else.

88
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:53,018
How many drinks did you have tonight?

89
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:56,000
Enough already.

90
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,468
This will be the last round.

91
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,195
I am not drunk.

92
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:01,735
Are you sure?

93
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,251
According to string theory,

94
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:11,487
we believe that

95
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:13,208
there might be a parallel world

96
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:15,693
or another dimension.

97
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,271
In physics,

98
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:18,420
the word "dimension"

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,784
doesn't refers to the dimension
in the mysterious world

100
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,336
or the dimension in the wonderland.

101
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:23,980
It means physical dimension.

102
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:25,355
In mathematics,

103
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,169
you can have as many dimensions

104
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:28,744
as you want.

105
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:31,092
But the space that we are seeing now

106
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:32,872
has 3 dimensions.

107
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,527
When the object moves,

108
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,785
it not only depends on space,

109
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:38,617
but also on timing.

110
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:40,418
In mathematics,

111
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,845
that movement

112
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,543
will create another dimension.

113
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:45,101
It's called the fourth dimension,

114
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,693
or space-time.

115
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,358
It combines space and time.

116
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:07,132
The parallel world
has many interpretations.

117
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,301
The first one
is the quantum parallel universe.

118
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:11,160
Quantum parallel universe

119
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,108
was developed around

120
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:15,756
the year 1957

121
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,018
by a physicist

122
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:18,688
called Dr.Hugh Everett.

123
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:20,574
He used quantum theory

124
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,110
to solve the problem

125
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:23,552
by assuming that

126
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:24,713
the parallel world did exist.

127
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,071
To destroy the dimension

128
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,417
or make dimensions cross,
scientifically speaking,

129
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,780
we'd have to accelerate until
the power is strong enough

130
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:33,291
to expand into a special dimension.

131
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:35,112
The four dimensions that we've
mentioned before doesn't include this.

132
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,740
But that dimension can appear.

133
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:40,433
Just like a thin wire.

134
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,228
At first, we can see
that it's a one-dimension object.

135
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:43,501
But when we

136
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:45,864
use a magnifying glass

137
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:47,108
to look at that wire,

138
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:48,747
we'll see it in two dimensions.

139
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:51,499
The first day I travelled through time
to meet Dew...

140
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:53,431
What?

141
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:54,567
Mum.

142
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:57,091
Are you really here?

143
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,153
But in Dew's world,

144
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:03,481
it was the day that...

145
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:05,490
Yesterday, we met each other.

146
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,827
And it's the 21st.

147
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:08,669
But as far as I know,

148
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,369
it's the 7th.

149
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:14,733
So, the time in our universes
runs in the opposite direction.

150
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,761
=609 Bedtime Story=

151
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:30,977
（Episode 5）

152
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:11,719
Baby boy,

153
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:13,148
why are you sitting here?

154
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:14,726
Mum,

155
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:16,330
you came!

156
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,467
I missed you so much.

157
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:32,169
Look, Dew,

158
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:33,924
I already know

159
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,255
why I did not die
when I fell from the building.

160
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,367
Fell from the building?

161
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:40,116
Who fell from the building?

162
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,218
It was me.

163
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:43,220
I fell from the building yesterday.

164
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:49,143
Oh...

165
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:50,461
I am sorry.

166
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:52,321
My

167
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:53,300
yesterday

168
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:54,549
is not

169
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,783
your yesterday.

170
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,616
That's alright.

171
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:00,938
Well,

172
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:03,605
I have already been confused
about our time.

173
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:08,153
Actually, I've been confused
since the first day I met you.

174
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,016
All of the sudden,

175
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,432
you just appeared in front of me.

176
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,067
You talked and talked.

177
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:15,919
You also said that

178
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:17,429
you...

179
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:19,965
I...

180
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:22,401
What did I say?

181
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:26,464
It's nothing.

182
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:32,092
Look,

183
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:34,288
do you believe

184
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,559
the parallel world?

185
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:39,769
Well,

186
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:41,780
I have been searching for information.

187
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:45,785
Mum...

188
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:48,772
are you not feeling well?

189
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:50,680
You're having a fever.

190
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:52,702
I'm fine.

191
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:54,361
- Look...
- I think...

192
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,697
You should take some medicine
and go home.

193
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,301
Dew...

194
00:10:58,535 --> 00:10:59,939
I need to tell you this story.

195
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:01,441
Have you eaten yet?

196
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,967
I don't store food in my room.

197
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:19,480
So, I cooked you a simple dish.

198
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,070
I hope it's okay for you to eat.

199
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:29,966
It looks delicious.

200
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,660
Of course I can eat it.

201
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:32,719
I will eat it now.

202
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,500
Here.

203
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:51,085
What's wrong?

204
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:02,251
Thank you.

205
00:12:05,797 --> 00:12:06,898
For what?

206
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,786
Except for my sister,

207
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:14,794
you're the only one

208
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:17,416
who will eat with me in the room,

209
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:19,438
at the same table.

210
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:22,625
It made me feel a little bit weird.

211
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:25,270
Well,

212
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,516
do you feel uncomfortable?

213
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:29,211
Then,

214
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,279
I will sit over there.

215
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:32,801
Make yourself at home.

216
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:34,161
Dew.

217
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,353
Eat with me.

218
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:48,903
I will grab my chopsticks.

219
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:05,892
This is not a simple dish.

220
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:20,906
How is it?

221
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:25,279
It is nice.

222
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:29,652
Very good.

223
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:37,948
All right.

224
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:12,879
So,

225
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:14,849
what do you know?

226
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:16,329
You fell from the building
but you are still alive.

227
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:20,249
I thought you don't want
to know about this.

228
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,029
I do want to know.

229
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:29,679
I think

230
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,759
in the dimension
where we both are living now,

231
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:36,639
I am immortal.

232
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,649
Immortal?

233
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:50,929
Just look!

234
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,689
Watch carefully.

235
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:00,429
Don't even blink.

236
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,629
I will be back!

237
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,289
Mum!

238
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:40,089
Are you hurt?

239
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:42,509
I'm okay.

240
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,659
It's okay.

241
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,319
It's only a technical problem.

242
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:47,859
Let me try it one more time.

243
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,569
Enough. It's enough.

244
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:50,609
I believe you.

245
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,679
Or,

246
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:58,499
I'll have to jump off
the building like yesterday.

247
00:16:59,139 --> 00:16:59,679
What!

248
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,169
Jump off the building.

249
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:02,749
Mum!

250
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:03,189
Jump off the building?

251
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,799
It's not about the height.

252
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:07,649
It's about the time.

253
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,219
Normally,

254
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:16,149
you'd just appear in this room

255
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:17,479
at midnight.

256
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,549
And you'd leave at 1:05 a.m.

257
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:24,529
So,

258
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,509
how is it relevant to the fact that I
survived after I fell off the building?

259
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,409
According to what you explained to me,

260
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:33,639
I think

261
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:36,329
you fell off the building at the
exact time that you have to go back.

262
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:37,809
So you are still alive.

263
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:44,849
That means

264
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:46,779
the time gap between

265
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:48,179
the midnight

266
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:49,729
and 1:00 a.m.

267
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,939
There is a connecting dot
between the past day

268
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:54,389
and the present day.

269
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:57,339
This is also the time

270
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:59,809
that your universe's gate opens,
so you could come to meet me here.

271
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,119
But theoretically speaking,

272
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,669
the time must be 1:00 a.m.

273
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:08,879
What's the extra 5 minutes for?

274
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,369
You might remember it wrong.

275
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:12,799
It really is 1:05 a.m.

276
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,319
Then we need to prove it.

277
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,779
I have to go now.

278
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:02,019
Why?

279
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:03,609
Do you see that?

280
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:06,839
No!

281
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,039
Something must be wrong.

282
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,889
Can I go back to my universe?

283
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,009
Am I stuck here forever?

284
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:15,599
It's impossible!

285
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,059
I don't even get a chance
to say goodbye to everyone.

286
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:18,189
Mum.

287
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:18,749
What should I do?

288
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:19,639
Calm down.

289
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:22,189
Believe me. It must be 1:05 a.m.

290
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:27,049
That's bed!

291
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:29,039
When I was about to go back,

292
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:30,719
I slept.

293
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:32,379
I have to sleep.

294
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:34,289
Yes, Yes... I have to sleep.

295
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,029
Mum.

296
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,739
Please calm down.

297
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,339
Do you really want to go back that much?

298
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:57,769
So, you believe me now

299
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,399
that the exact time is 1:05 a.m.

300
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:00,629
Well,

301
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:02,919
what's the extra 5 minutes for?

302
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,269
Well,

303
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:05,469
it's extra.

304
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:07,209
But it's only 5 minutes.

305
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:10,819
It's a big 5 minutes.

306
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,649
For me, it is invaluable.

307
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,379
I can have a chance to be with you
in this extra 5 minutes,

308
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:22,399
before I go back to my old life.

309
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:28,269
Dew.

310
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,419
This is enough.

311
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:04,749
Five...

312
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:06,419
Four...

313
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:08,359
Three...

314
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:10,449
Two...

315
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:12,109
One...

316
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,229
Good night, Mum.

317
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:22,309
Oh!

318
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:27,629
Hey, Mini-Mum!

319
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:28,739
Stop it!

320
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:02,389
What did I do?

321
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,599
- Mum!
- Bravo!

322
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,909
I will be back with the next song.

323
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,229
Please stay tuned.

324
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:39,859
This is so good.

325
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:42,839
Mum sang very well.

326
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:44,339
Mum,

327
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:45,839
aren't you hurrying to go home today?

328
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,289
Are you really going on stage again?

329
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:49,469
Well...

330
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:50,939
I'm compensating for my sick leaves.

331
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,689
A compensation.

332
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:56,419
Hey, Ping!

333
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,009
What?

334
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,779
Mum is not hurrying to go home
to see his girlfriend?

335
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:03,299
What are you talking about?

336
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:04,829
If you have nothing to do,

337
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:06,489
go and take care of our customers.

338
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:45,209
One can of beer, please.

339
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:46,369
Okay.

340
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:48,209
Thank you.

341
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:54,139
Games,

342
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,359
you can post on the pub's Facebook

343
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:58,659
that I will be back in full force.

344
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:02,539
All right, I'll do that.

345
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:07,349
Well,

346
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:09,499
Vee is not here, right?

347
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:19,599
Games?

348
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:23,719
Games?

349
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,029
What the heck?

350
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:27,819
He kissed me,
but he acted as if nothing happened.

351
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:32,529
Oops!

352
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:34,329
Oh my god!

353
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:35,819
No, I am sorry.

354
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:42,249
Mum,

355
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:44,219
take care of the pub for me.

356
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:45,589
I will be back.

357
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:48,729
All right.

358
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:17,469
Vee,

359
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:18,909
please fill in the stock report for me.

360
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,219
I don't know how to do it.

361
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:22,869
Come in.

362
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,099
Please do it now.

363
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:32,889
Right now?

364
00:25:34,469 --> 00:25:35,079
Please...

365
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:36,469
I will sit with you.

366
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:37,829
Can't it be tomorrow?

367
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:39,879
I have a lot of things to pack.

368
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,679
Please do it. Please...

369
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:44,799
I will stay beside you.

370
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:48,569
Why are you so stubborn?

371
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:49,629
Hmm?

372
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:03,399
You are too heavy.

373
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:28,389
Vee.

374
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:32,319
May I ask you something?

375
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:37,269
We kissed yesterday,

376
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:39,799
It means nothing

377
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,739
to you, right?

378
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:48,429
Games, I am sorry.

379
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,209
No need to say sorry.

380
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:53,199
I was happy.

381
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,449
You already knew how I feel for you.

382
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:01,429
Yes, I do know.

383
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:07,489
So I think it's not entirely fair to you.

384
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:13,939
You deserve
to have a great relationship.

385
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:18,709
With my state right now, this is wrong.

386
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:25,099
Vee.

387
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:34,899
I have no idea
what you have been through,

388
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,939
but I do want to ask you

389
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:42,069
to remember

390
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:44,639
that I...

391
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:47,969
I am not him.

392
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:13,329
（All This
Pub & Restaurant）

393
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:15,959
A parallel world?

394
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,209
I am not so sure about this.

395
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:25,469
But I don't have another theory

396
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:27,879
to better explain how I met

397
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,899
that young man.

398
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:38,189
So, do you still want to find
the murderer who killed that young man?

399
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:40,529
I think

400
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,369
I won't meet him anymore.

401
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,079
What?

402
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:45,989
You have said that
you would go and help him.

403
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:51,419
I am scared.

404
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:54,339
Scared of what?

405
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:29,239
(I shouldn't go to see Dew again.)

406
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:35,219
I am scared.

407
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:36,999
Scared of what?

408
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:39,519
I don't know.

409
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:42,299
But

410
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:45,449
when I was with that boy,

411
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:48,609
I couldn't control myself.

412
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,639
You can't control yourself?

413
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:53,289
What do you mean?

414
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:54,219
You made me confused.

415
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,829
When I was there with him,

416
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:02,349
it...

417
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:04,749
made me lose control of myself.

418
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:08,569
It's just like...

419
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,199
I was there with him

420
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,519
and there was another me.

421
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,449
That "me" was telling me what to say

422
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:19,309
and how I felt.

423
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:23,009
I even did things that
I have never done before.

424
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:26,719
And,

425
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:29,379
when you were doing those things,

426
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,309
how did you feel?

427
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:33,429
What are you talking about?

428
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:36,219
I mean,

429
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:39,379
put reason aside,

430
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:40,479
what does it make you feel?

431
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,719
I am not into that guy.

432
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:56,229
Mum! Say it to yourself.

433
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:00,729
I will not go to meet Dew.

434
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,249
No!

435
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:06,429
Don't go.

436
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:19,289
(Mum's World)

437
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:22,389
(Dew's World)

438
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:29,009
Dew, sir.

439
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:30,639
Yes.

440
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:34,779
Our staff have already checked and
sent back Pratin's signature analysis.

441
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,559
(Purchase Order Year 2021)

442
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,199
Papa, I am sorry that
I have to call you so late.

443
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:27,359
May I come to
talk to you at home tomorrow?
