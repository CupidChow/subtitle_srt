I can.

00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:20,026
I can do it.

00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,472
(Episode 10)
(The End of the Parallel World)

16
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,845
And another idea about
the parallel world is

17
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:01,148
Inflation Multi-universes.

18
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:04,030
This idea was developed
from the studies

19
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:06,331
of the Cosmology,

20
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,820
or the studies of the birth

21
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,948
and the revolution of the universe.

22
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:12,533
About the birth of the universe,

23
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,393
someone said it started from
the Big Bang.

24
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,605
Andre Linde,

25
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:21,360
a physicist who proposed
the Bubble Theory,

26
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:25,372
in which we are the living creature
like this,

27
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,692
because we are lucky
to be born in the universe.

28
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:30,787
It has a constant value in physics
that it is supposed to be.

29
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:33,478
Most of the chemical reactions happened

30
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,871
due to the electric reaction

31
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:36,845
of electrons.

32
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:38,481
If the electric charge

33
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,596
has a different value instead of this,

34
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:41,828
the chemical bond

35
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,441
will rarely happen.

36
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:44,475
Therefore,

37
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,706
if you travel from our bubble universe
to another bubble universe,

38
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:49,620
you might find yourself dead.

39
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:51,147
So this is not very useful

40
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:52,700
to travel to another universe.

41
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:53,912
Because now,

42
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,146
we are in the right place.

43
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:47,243
Hey!

44
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,460
Do you want me to feed you?

45
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:53,645
Just leave it there.

46
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:54,591
I will eat soon.

47
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:55,783
No way.

48
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:57,746
Get up and eat now.

49
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,071
P'Mum.

50
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:21,375
Can you do me a favor?

51
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:23,533
About what?

52
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,148
Well,

53
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:27,720
I will arrange a birthday party
for my friend.

54
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,325
At our pub.

55
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:32,138
Would you help me?

56
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:34,791
No.

57
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,401
Oh, come on.

58
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,377
Your only sister is asking
for your help.

59
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:45,409
Please help me.
Please. Please.

60
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:51,816
Who is your friend?

61
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:52,619
Which one?

62
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,816
It's Dew.

63
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:57,720
He is the one

64
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:01,574
that you modeled
in his clothes on Instagram.

65
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,179
Please.

66
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:06,785
Just for fun.

67
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,252
Besides,

68
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:13,995
I still want to hear
you sing with your guitar.

69
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:19,764
So,

70
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:22,192
how long have you and Dew
been in a relationship?

71
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:28,267
We became friends when we were
still freshmen at our university.

72
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:31,399
If you're asking me how long
he's been my boyfriend,

73
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,541
I'd have to say none.

74
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:35,537
Zero?

75
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:37,409
What does that mean?

76
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,173
We haven't started to date yet.

77
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,184
I have asked him to be my boyfriend
for numerous times.

78
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:46,505
He didn't even fall into my traps once.

79
00:07:48,263 --> 00:07:49,664
So, are you helping or not?

80
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:52,116
No!

81
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:57,222
Whoa!

82
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:03,912
Hello, Mint?

83
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:05,622
He didn't say yes, P'Games.

84
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:07,437
Oh, his condition

85
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:08,760
is more serious than I thought.

86
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:10,827
That's right.

87
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:14,601
I don't want to see him so upset.

88
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,221
And I will mention this again later.

89
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:20,222
I have something else to do today.

90
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,317
All right. See you later, Mint.

91
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:41,271
I don't want your help now.

92
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:43,456
You are heartless.

93
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:44,382
Jeez!

94
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:53,742
Hey.

95
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,501
Oh!

96
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,734
I am so sorry.
How long have you been waiting?

97
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:57,595
Not at all.

98
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:01,184
I have ordered it for you.

99
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,743
Thank you.

100
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:06,358
I am not used to seeing you in a suit.

101
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:11,019
I am not used to dressing myself
like this either.

102
00:09:11,954 --> 00:09:15,661
So, your dad will let you manage
the company after your probation period.

103
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:16,619
Yes.

104
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,386
So, I cannot manage
my clothing brand now.

105
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:19,231
That's right.

106
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,423
This is unfortunate.

107
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:21,652
Your brand is going so well.

108
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:24,575
Oh,

109
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,993
why didn't you pick up my call?

110
00:09:28,622 --> 00:09:29,541
Did you call me?

111
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,408
I did not hear the ringtone.

112
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,254
I lost my phone.

113
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,861
- Did you lose your phone?
- May I borrow your phone?

114
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:38,617
Here.

115
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:00,275
Hello?

116
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:01,698
P'Mum?

117
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:04,538
Oh, Mint?

118
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,453
I forgot my phone in your room.

119
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:09,539
I was so panicky. I thought I lost it.

120
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:12,440
P'Mum, can you please bring me my phone?

121
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:13,557
No.

122
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,606
It's you who left it here, so you must
come to retrieve it yourself.

123
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,102
Please. Please. Please.

124
00:10:17,102 --> 00:10:19,236
Please bring it to me.
I have something to do here.

125
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:20,931
I will send you my location.

126
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:21,864
Please hurry.

127
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:22,847
- Mint.
- Thank you.

128
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:23,575
Mint.

129
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:30,301
I was so panicky.

130
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:31,750
Can you send the location to him?

131
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,000
I will send it.

132
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,032
P'Mum!

133
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:15,650
Are you P'Mum?

134
00:11:18,363 --> 00:11:18,981
Dew.

135
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:20,871
Do you remember me?

136
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:22,812
Yes, I do.

137
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,972
You are Mint's brother.

138
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,999
You also modeled for my clothing brand.

139
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:30,786
Please accept my
official gratitude again.

140
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,152
Oh!

141
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:35,424
It's all right, Baby boy.

142
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:38,473
Oh!

143
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:39,689
Dew.

144
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:44,077
Ah...

145
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:46,965
Where is Mint then?

146
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,157
She went to the restroom.

147
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,588
She will be back soon.

148
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:51,130
Will you wait for her?

149
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,457
Please sit down.

150
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,367
Dew, be careful.

151
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:24,498
Uh...

152
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:25,886
Thank you, P'Mum.

153
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:27,086
Sorry.

154
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:28,759
It's all right.

155
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:30,974
Then...

156
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:32,460
I...

157
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:35,743
will leave Mint's phone with you.

158
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:36,393
Uh...

159
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:38,588
Won't you wait and see her?

160
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:41,757
It's okay. I am in a hurry.

161
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:43,832
Please.

162
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:46,170
I will leave now.

163
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:47,310
Sure.

164
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:01,804
Oh?

165
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,477
Did P'Mum already come
and bring my phone here?

166
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,161
Uh...

167
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:08,027
Where is he now?

168
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,831
He returned your phone and then left.

169
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:12,687
What's wrong with him?

170
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:20,141
(Push)

171
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:21,648
(Bar)

172
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:22,328
What the heck?

173
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,525
Mum!

174
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,861
P'Mum!

175
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:29,335
- How come?
- Mum.

176
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:31,105
Hey, P'Ton. Mum is here.

177
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:33,825
- Oh, you brat!
- It took you so long to come back.

178
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:35,400
I thought you were dead.

179
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:37,358
Look at you now.

180
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,960
My money-maker is gone.

181
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:40,290
He is a money-maker now.

182
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,039
- You are all about the money.
- Ouch!

183
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,930
I mean

184
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,948
you always make money for our pub.

185
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:48,590
Hey, you finally come back.

186
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:50,210
Ton.

187
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,190
- Yes.
- Are you coming back to play music?

188
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,288
I really want to sing
and play the guitar with you.

189
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:57,291
That's true. I really miss
your singing voice.

190
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:59,282
I heard him singing every day.
It's so toxic.

191
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,607
- Oh, hey.
- I can't tell his singing from swearing.

192
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:02,780
What did you say?

193
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:03,977
Do you wanna sing a song?

194
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:08,295
Do you wanna sing some songs?

195

201
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,796
Is Mum rehearsing the song
that he will sing on Dew's birthday?

202
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:45,023
Yes, he is.

203
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:47,532
Mint asked him

204
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,769
to sing a song.

205
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:50,430
But

206
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,964
when I talked with Mint later today,

207
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:54,910
she said he refused to do that.

00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:32,866
This song is very good.

217
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:35,024
I really miss your voice.

218
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:45,858
Hello.

219
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,936
Is this Flora House?

220
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:51,844
I want to order some flowers.

221
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,421
I will send you
the design that I want.

222
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:05,331
(9 December 2022)

223
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,985
- Be careful, or it will explode.
- This is too big.

224
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,005
Hey, move back, you guys.

225
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:12,887
- Hey!
- Hey.

226
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,265
What's up with you?

227
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:18,359
Games.

228
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:19,078
Huh?

229
00:16:19,226 --> 00:16:19,819
Is this in the center?

230
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:20,695
Help me look at it.

231
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:23,961
Uh...

232
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,211
Move to the left a little bit.
Left, left.

233
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:26,903
Left.

234
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:27,841
No, no.

235
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:28,667
To my left.

236
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:29,597
- Oh... Oh.
- Yeah.

237
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:30,734
You didn't tell me.

238
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,740
- All right?
- Move to the right a little bit.

239
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:34,667
That's too much.
Move to the right a little bit.

240
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:36,366
Okay. Good.

241
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:38,163
(Happy Birthday, Dew)
Perfect.

242
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:40,343
How is it going?

243
00:16:40,343 --> 00:16:40,992
Oh, Mint.

244
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:42,671
Is it good?

245
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:44,391
It's beautiful.

246
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:46,742
You look extremely pretty today.

247
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,447
Is there anything special?

248
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,868
It's nothing, P'Vee. I am...

249
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:51,864
pretty as usual.

250
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:53,991
Oh, this is how pretty you usually are.

251
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:55,836
You don't get to trick me
to praise you again, alright?

252
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:56,936
It's just for today.

253
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,792
Haha...

254
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:03,852
P'Mum, turn it around, please.
I want to see it.

255
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:05,761
Here.

256
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:06,739
How is it?

257
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:07,857
I did it myself.

258
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:10,071
Oh...

259
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:10,836
I think...

260
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:13,265
We can put two...

261
00:17:13,352 --> 00:17:15,215
Yes, we can do that.
Just split it into two bunches.

262
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:30,598
Dew.

263
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:33,475
Hey,

264
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:35,649
Did you decorate the pub by yourself?

265
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,407
Where is everybody?

266
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:39,563
Oh,

267
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:41,192
they are at the back of the pub.

268
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:42,263
They are making preparations.

269
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:46,640
P'Mum.

270
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,649
You look different from that day.

271
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:51,032
Oh!

272
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:53,775
Do you mean...

273
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:54,916
this?

274
00:17:56,297 --> 00:17:57,314
You look so good.

275
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:03,184
Hey, I think

276
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:04,758
you should wait over there.

277
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:06,132
They will come out soon.

278
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,905
- Yes.
- Let's go.

279
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:09,087
Come.

280
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:10,290
Sit here.

281
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:12,156
I will get a drink for you.

282
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:14,703
Uh...

283
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,365
P'Mum...

284
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:17,567
I don't drink...

285
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:18,656
Alcohol, right?

286
00:18:19,286 --> 00:18:20,569
I have already known that.

287
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:22,721
There is no alcohol in this drink.

288
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:34,058
A lily flower.

289
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:39,017
This...

290
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,452
What is the name of this drink?

291
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:43,374
Lily in Paradise.

292
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:45,286
Lily in Paradise.

293
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:00,648
This is so delicious, P'Mum.

294
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:02,891
I like it a lot.

295
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:05,646
I have been looking for this taste
for a long time.

296
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,783
- Sweet and sour.
- Sweet and sour.

297
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:09,555
No alcohol.

298
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,419
How do you know I like this?

299
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:16,858
Dew.

300
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,557
You're already here.
Why didn't you call me?

301
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:23,389
I just met P'Mum.

302
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:30,954
You look so pretty today.

303
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:32,990
Certainly.

304
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:34,432
This is your party.

305
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,737
I have to be very pretty.

306
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:38,359
Make yourself comfortable,

307
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,244
I will be back.

308
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:40,659
Yes.

309
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:42,554
What are you drinking?

310
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:58,755
♪I used to spend my life♪

311
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,779
♪Just let time pass♪

312
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,101
P'Mum.

313
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:05,141
Mint.

314
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:07,384
Is Dew alone outside?

315
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,856
All of our friends are here.

316
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:10,583
Oh.

317
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:15,625
P'Mum.

318
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:17,937
Do I look good now?

319
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:21,103
Yes.

320
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:25,443
Give me a proper answer.
I am serious.

321
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:26,781
I am serious now.

322
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:28,683
Beautiful.

323
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:29,786
Great.

324
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:31,642
My sister is awesome.

325
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,543
Okay.

326
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:39,015
P'Mum.

327
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:42,498
Since the day that...

328
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:47,577
you told me about your travel
in another universe to help your lover,

329
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,217
I've been thinking about it,
and it inspires me.

330
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:02,301
So I will...

331
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:05,196
try it once more.

332
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,652
Try what?

333
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:17,356
I want to do what you have done,

334
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:22,416
before everything is too late.

335
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,073
I think...

336
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:29,248
I will ask Dew to be my boyfriend again.

337
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:31,434
Do you think it's a good idea?

338
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,598
Cheers!

339
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,669
Woo!

340
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,628
Is it good?

341
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:54,321
- It's very delicious.
- I think it's delicious, too.

342
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:56,189
Aren't you hungry?

343
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:57,630
I am not hungry.

344
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:58,642
Just sitting here.

345
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:01,125
Do you want to try it?

346
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:03,314
You serve it. What?

347
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:04,343
Do you want to serve it?

348
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:06,373
P...

349
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:07,558
P'Mum!

350
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:09,875
Shall we play now?

351
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,325
All right. Let's do this.

352
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:15,182
Let's do it now.

353
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:20,235
Hello.

354
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:27,408
Today,

355
00:22:28,131 --> 00:22:29,118
I will

356
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:31,973
sing a song requested

357
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,623
by someone.

358
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:36,963
This song is dedicated

359
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:38,412
to the birthday boy.

360
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:42,239

What is it?

386
00:26:04,218 --> 00:26:04,878
Dew.

387
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:10,698
Happy Birthday.

388
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:22,468
Dew.

389
00:26:23,318 --> 00:26:25,148
Today I want to tell you again

390
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,138
that I love you.

391
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:33,098
But,

392
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:35,548
I know you might reject me again.

393
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:38,088
I am okay with it.

394
00:26:42,658 --> 00:26:43,298
Okay.

395
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:45,908
You mean...

396
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:48,018
Well,

397
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:50,218
you're my girlfriend now.

398
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,258
Yeah.

399
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,428
What's up?

400
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:21,338
It's all right.

401
00:27:46,668 --> 00:27:47,808
Let's go home.

402
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:49,958
Everyone did a good job today.

403
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:50,768
Superb.

404
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:52,588
Come on.

405
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:54,328
So tired.

406
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:55,728
Ping, hurry up!

407
00:27:58,898 --> 00:27:59,728
Bye-bye.

408
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:01,358
- Do you want us to wait for you, P'Vee?
- Bye-bye.

409
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:02,258
It's all right.

410
00:28:02,358 --> 00:28:03,698
I will take care of everything here.
Bye.

411
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:06,358
- Then goodbye.
- Goodbye.

412
00:28:06,548 --> 00:28:07,518
Bye-bye.

413
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:28,328
P'Vee.

414
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:29,848
Will you come with me?

415
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:31,368
Where?

416
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:32,568
And this is late now.

417
00:28:32,568 --> 00:28:33,708
I won't tell you.

418
00:28:33,818 --> 00:28:35,378
Let's go. Get in the car. Come.

419
00:28:35,718 --> 00:28:36,828
Where are we going?

420
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:38,548
You will know soon. Let's go.

421
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:42,868
Games, is this place closed?

422
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:44,518
I just asked someone to do me a favor.

423
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:54,348
Mint was very good today.

424
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:56,008
Mum...

425
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:58,118
did so well to support his sister.

426
00:29:07,258 --> 00:29:07,968
P'Vee.

427
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:13,398
Why did you want to get married
at that time?

428
00:29:14,498 --> 00:29:15,238
It was

429
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:18,628
a ceremony to tell people that

430
00:29:19,388 --> 00:29:20,378
we will love

431
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:22,478
and be faithful to each other.

432
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,828
I think I am too old-fashioned.

433
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:32,398
I agree with you.

434
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:36,488
Even if you did that ceremony,

435
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:40,158
it is still unlawful.

436
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:43,298
That's right.

437
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:46,128
I really want same-sex marriage

438
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:49,208
to be legalized in our country.

439
00:29:50,378 --> 00:29:52,958
Because we are the group who'll never
get support from the government,

440
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:55,158
although we pay taxes like everybody.

441
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:58,688
This is so unfair.

442
00:29:59,228 --> 00:29:59,888
It's like

443
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:05,148
we can't live our life
like normal people.

444
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:07,788
That's true.

445
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:14,508
Even though the law doesn't support us,

446
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:18,688
do you still want to get married?

447
00:30:22,448 --> 00:30:23,198
Um...

448
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:26,428
Yes. I do want to get married.

449
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:32,348
P'Vee.

450
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:36,598
Will you marry me?

451
00:30:41,518 --> 00:30:43,248
Once you forget your ex-boyfriend,

452
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:45,888
and when you think

453
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:47,818
I am good enough for you,

454
00:30:50,078 --> 00:30:51,068
We can get married.

455
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:01,468
Will you marry me?

456
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:07,568
Games.

457
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:09,078
What are you playing?

458
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,708
Are you kidding me?

459
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:17,438
I am not kidding.

460
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:20,618
I am serious.

461
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:23,308
Won't you feel ashamed
when people know about this?

462
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:27,428
No.

463
00:31:29,578 --> 00:31:32,048
I will be more ashamed
if I don't ask you to marry me.

464
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:36,708
If you are...

465
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:37,968
still not okay,

466
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,128
that's all right.

467
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:42,258
I can wait.

468
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:15,558
Move back to Khon Kaen?

469
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:18,928
Why is this so sudden, P'Mum?

470
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,918
A senior that I respect
asked me to help him with his job.

471
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:23,188
So, do you have to go?

472
00:32:23,998 --> 00:32:25,208
Can't you just say no?

473
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,238
That's right. Don't go, P'Mum.

474
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:28,628
Ping can't handle it alone.

475
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:30,548
That's true. Please stay with us.

476
00:32:30,688 --> 00:32:31,468
Please don't go.

477
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:34,748
I can't.

478
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:40,358
How long will you go?

479
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:41,778
That's right.

480
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:43,938
For how long?

481
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:48,558
Well, for a while.

482
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:52,138
So, why don't you transfer
your share of this pub to me?

483
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:53,208
That's right.

484
00:32:57,028 --> 00:32:58,558
In case there are some documents,

485
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,588
so you can go and do them for me.

486
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:03,228
I think it's all right, Mint.

487
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:05,628
At least, if something happens,
you can sign those papers.

488
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:11,228
So, when will you go?

489
00:33:21,588 --> 00:33:22,818
I think I will move back to Khon Kaen.

490
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,378
What did you say?

491
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,508
Mint will be sad,

492
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:29,688
if you leave her like this.

493
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:34,848
So I came to beg you.

494
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:36,988
Please look after her for me.

495
00:33:38,128 --> 00:33:39,308
But I...

496
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:40,388
I believe

497
00:33:40,908 --> 00:33:42,998
that you will be
a good boyfriend for Mint.

498
00:33:47,428 --> 00:33:49,018
I will try my best for this promise.

499
00:33:51,248 --> 00:33:51,828
That's good.

500
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:03,668
(Khon Kaen)

501
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:05,508
Hello, everyone.

502
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:08,158
Today,

503
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:10,548
for those

504
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:12,288
who are lonely and sad,

505
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:14,758
we will listen to this song together.

506
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:17,098
And remove the burden together.

507
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:41,148
(Six months later)

508
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:42,858
Thank you for your applause.

509
00:35:43,648 --> 00:35:46,078
So, we will take a break.

510
00:35:46,598 --> 00:35:47,938
For those who won't go home,

511
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:49,618
we will come back with our songs.

512
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:51,688
Now our DJ will present
those songs for you.

513
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,018
Mum.

514
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:54,028
Mum.

515
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:55,288
Those ladies at that table

516
00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:56,528
asked me for your phone number.

517
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:01,858
I feel sorry for them,

518
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:02,828
because they've

519
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,328
come here several times.

520
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:13,668
Not yet.

521
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,628
Just do it as usual.

522
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:18,088
Okay, Bro.

523
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:19,318
I will do it.

524
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:20,568
Okay.

525
00:36:27,678 --> 00:36:29,608
(Games)

526
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:02,208
(Ton
Latest call: 11:50 PM)

527
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:03,378
Hello, Ton.

528
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:09,738
You didn't show up for so long,
so I called to check if you are dead.

529
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:12,208
I am fine.

530
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:15,358
Well, how are you?
Are you doing well?

531
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:16,888
It's okay over there, right?

532
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:21,088
Just as usual.
And we have a new problem with you.

533
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,628
Everyone here is worried about you.

534
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:24,698
We called numerous times,
but you picked up none of them.

535
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,568
I was busy.

536
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:27,728
So, I did not pick up those calls.

537
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:31,158
Well, I have to go now.

538
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:35,178
Tell those people who're eavesdropping
that I am fine and don't worry.

539
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:37,948
Ah... Umm... Umm...

540
00:37:39,348 --> 00:37:40,058
Okay.

541
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:55,128
This is strange.

542
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:58,418
Something must have happened to him.

543
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:02,778
I know he is an artist.

544
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:05,208
But I don't think
he would be like this for so long.

545
00:38:05,968 --> 00:38:07,218
Come on.

546
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,268
We've known that he is all right.
That is okay too.

547
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:10,538
That's true.

548
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:13,448
I just hope that he is fine
like he said.

549
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:57,538
May I marry Mint?

550
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:03,738
Why do you ask me?

551
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:05,548
You'd better ask Mint.

552
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:09,988
Mint told me to ask you first.

553
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:39,728
Congratulations.

554
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:50,248
Thank you, P'Mum.

555
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:56,818
Dew and Mint have been dating
for a while now.

556
00:39:57,848 --> 00:40:01,008
You both should move forward, right?

557
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:03,918
- Move forward?
- Umm...

558
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,158
Getting married.

559
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:13,208
Mom...

560
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:15,088
About this matter,

561
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:17,278
shouldn't you talk to Mint first?

562
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:18,118
Oh!

563
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:20,618
Do you have any problem?

564
00:40:27,418 --> 00:40:28,818
- Of course not.
- But I...

565
00:40:31,108 --> 00:40:32,238
How about Mint?

566
00:40:32,588 --> 00:40:33,538
Do you have any problem?

567
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:37,058
Yes.

568
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,588
This is such a big thing.

569
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:44,698
I can't make this decision by myself.

570
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:05,588
You must come to my wedding.

571
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:27,358
Joey.

572
00:41:29,078 --> 00:41:30,048
I can't stand it anymore.

573
00:41:31,798 --> 00:41:33,138
It's all right.

574
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:35,978
Why did Mint choose to love Dew?

575
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,158
Even if Mint chose someone else,

576
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:39,958
you still won't be okay, will you?

577
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,508
But she is getting married.

578
00:41:46,788 --> 00:41:47,798
Hey, Aun.

579
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:50,378
This is our friend's wedding.

580
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:52,238
You should be happy.

581
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:53,758
Why are you crying?

582
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:55,528
How can I be happy?

583
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:57,898
You knew how much I like her.

584
00:41:58,838 --> 00:41:59,788
Yes, I knew.

585
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:03,398
How about this?

586
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:05,328
You can do something
to get back to her.

587
00:42:06,008 --> 00:42:07,868
You can also have a wedding ceremony
to compete with her.

588
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:10,278
Whom do you want me to marry?

589
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:11,908
Me.

590
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:15,568
Are you crazy?

591
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:16,738
What the heck?

592
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:18,748
Hey, I am serious.

593
00:42:18,898 --> 00:42:19,948
What is wrong with you?

594
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:22,368
Hey, marry me.

595
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:25,768
No way. I don't like you. I like Mint.

596
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:28,438
Are you sure that you won't marry me?

597
00:42:28,578 --> 00:42:29,998
I am not good enough, right?

598
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:31,988
Joey, don't mock me.

599
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:35,008
Just grab me some beer.
We will drink beer.

600
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:35,688
Um...

601
00:42:36,438 --> 00:42:37,318
But this time,

602
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,348
don't you run away from me again.

603
00:42:42,138 --> 00:42:42,858
Okay?

604
00:42:43,658 --> 00:42:44,428
Yes.

605
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:45,478
All right.

606
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:48,708
Just grab me some beer.

607
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:50,878
- I will.
- I am too lazy to walk.

608
00:42:52,728 --> 00:42:53,378
Okay.

609
00:42:56,848 --> 00:42:57,988
Thank you very much.

610
00:42:58,128 --> 00:42:58,758
Umm.

611
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:14,428
Hello, Mint.

612
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:16,488
I am in P'Mum's room.

613
00:43:18,148 --> 00:43:21,068
I am so sorry that I had to bother you.

614
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:23,098
I've put it on sale for a long time.

615
00:43:23,598 --> 00:43:25,468
Suddenly, someone wants to see the room.

616
00:43:25,468 --> 00:43:26,718
But I am busy.

617
00:43:27,048 --> 00:43:27,888
Hey.

618
00:43:28,118 --> 00:43:29,258
I don't mind at all.

619
00:43:29,328 --> 00:43:30,338
This is not a big deal.

620
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:31,818
Well,

621
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:33,948
what time is it over there?

622
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:35,588
Almost noon.

623
00:43:35,668 --> 00:43:37,818
This country is 6 hours
slower than us, right?

624
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:41,138
Don't forget to put on thick clothes.

625
00:43:42,028 --> 00:43:43,208
It's cold over there, right?

626
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:45,018
Are you worried about me?

627
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:50,208
Then I will tell them to come
and see the room tomorrow morning.

628
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:50,978
Umm.

629
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,548
I won't stop cleaning this room
until it's extremely neat.

630
00:43:53,808 --> 00:43:55,038
Once the customers see it,

631
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:56,418
they will decide to buy it immediately.

632
00:43:57,578 --> 00:43:58,328
Thank you.

633
00:43:59,198 --> 00:44:00,228
Take care of yourself.

634
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:01,118
(CAUTION)

635
00:45:17,228 --> 00:45:18,848
(November 6th 2022 was
the first day that the boy appeared.)

636
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:19,598
November 6th

637
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:22,338
2022

638
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:24,608
was the first day

639
00:45:24,928 --> 00:45:26,068
that the boy appeared.

640
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:30,268
(November 24th 2022. Will I be able
to help my Baby boy?)

641
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:31,568
Will I be able to help my Baby boy?

642
00:45:32,278 --> 00:45:34,248
But at least I told him

643
00:45:34,438 --> 00:45:35,678
about the parallel universe.

644
00:45:37,418 --> 00:45:38,468
The parallel universe.

645
00:45:53,638 --> 00:45:54,278
Baby boy.

646
00:45:55,238 --> 00:45:56,978
What is happening right now

647
00:45:58,278 --> 00:45:59,608
is called the parallel universe.

648
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:00,488
We still have time.

649
00:46:00,488 --> 00:46:01,818
We need to find the murderer.

650
00:46:01,818 --> 00:46:02,808
You are such a Baby boy.

651
00:46:02,808 --> 00:46:03,738
Why do you have to face
so many problems?

652
00:46:03,738 --> 00:46:06,248
You were killed on the first day we met.

653
00:46:06,828 --> 00:46:07,838
I did not want to wake up.

654
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:09,198
- I will do anything
- I want to stay like this forever.

655
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:10,068
to make you remember...

656
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:11,058
- It's 1.00 am.
- I don't want

657
00:46:11,058 --> 00:46:11,438
to lose you again.

658
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,228
- Why are you crying? We will change it.
- Please remember

659
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,388
that I love you.

660
00:46:39,148 --> 00:46:39,778
Dew.

661
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:43,808
P'Mum.

662
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:45,228
Dew.

663
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:55,038
I miss you so much, Baby boy.

664
00:47:52,108 --> 00:47:52,668
Well,

665
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:55,748
when did you come back from Khon Khan?

666
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,628
You already read my diary,

667
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,828
but you still thought
that I came back from Khon Khan.

668
00:48:04,878 --> 00:48:06,738
Try to call the Mum in Khon Khan.

669
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:23,248
What's up, Dew?

670
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:25,518
What happened?

671
00:48:28,528 --> 00:48:29,298
Nothing.

672
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:31,618
I accidentally
hit your phone number on my phone.

673
00:48:31,698 --> 00:48:32,638
I am sorry.

674
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:40,948
Then,

675
00:48:41,908 --> 00:48:42,918
who are you actually?

676
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,448
Are you the P'Mum who shot me to death?

677
00:48:48,118 --> 00:48:48,788
No.

678
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:51,468
I am another Mum.

679
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:53,548
What?

680
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,348
In multiverse,

681
00:48:57,908 --> 00:48:59,808
there are multiple parallel universes

682
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:02,588
and many overlapping dimensions.

683
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:04,138
The multiverse.

684
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:06,368
At the right time,

685
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:09,698
the electron reaction will happen.

686
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:11,888
We might be able to see each other.

687
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:16,978
That means...

688
00:49:19,328 --> 00:49:20,478
there is another you...

689
00:49:22,308 --> 00:49:23,338
and me

690
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,758
in another universe, right?

691
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:29,248
Yes.

692
00:49:32,078 --> 00:49:33,138
But it is so strange,

693
00:49:34,698 --> 00:49:36,318
whatever the universe is.

694
00:49:37,818 --> 00:49:38,968
We both

695
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:41,358
will always meet each other
in this room.

696
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:47,238
In the Room No.609.

697
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:08,138
Dew.

698
00:50:09,778 --> 00:50:10,768
I am sorry

699
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:13,088
that I came back here again.

700
00:50:14,858 --> 00:50:16,568
I missed you so badly.

701
00:50:18,628 --> 00:50:19,358
But I...

702
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:22,758
I will not come to see you anymore.

703
00:50:24,748 --> 00:50:26,718
I will not meddle in your life anymore.

704
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:31,408
What do you mean?

705
00:50:35,608 --> 00:50:37,218
You should forget what happened today

706
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:41,238
and destroy that diary.

707
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:46,558
It is almost 1:05 AM soon,

708
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:48,688
and then I will disappear.

709
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:56,638
You came to me.

710
00:50:58,718 --> 00:50:59,978
You did that to me.

711
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:03,638
And then you will leave me.

712
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:09,848
Do you want me to harbor
that feeling alone?

713
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,418
I am sorry, Dew.

714
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:18,338
I am sorry.

715
00:51:25,018 --> 00:51:25,808
I am sorry.

716
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:38,858
Listen to me,

717
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,138
the way we met each other

718
00:51:42,818 --> 00:51:43,988
is so strange.

719
00:51:47,218 --> 00:51:48,278
But this is not even

720
00:51:49,068 --> 00:51:50,518
supposed to happen.

721
00:51:54,018 --> 00:51:55,878
Just sell this room.

722
00:51:57,088 --> 00:51:58,648
You should get back to your life.

723
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:00,878
I am sorry.

724
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:03,008
I am really sorry.

725
00:52:04,128 --> 00:52:05,198
Please forgive me.

726
00:52:05,418 --> 00:52:05,898
Please.

727
00:52:06,328 --> 00:52:07,168
No, P'Mum.

728
00:52:07,768 --> 00:52:09,728
You can't leave me just like this, P'Mum.

729
00:52:12,118 --> 00:52:13,048
In my life,

730
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,318
to be able to meet you in this room

731
00:52:18,288 --> 00:52:20,688
is the most precious thing.

732
00:52:24,678 --> 00:52:25,678
I love you.

733
00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:30,748
You will always be in my heart.
