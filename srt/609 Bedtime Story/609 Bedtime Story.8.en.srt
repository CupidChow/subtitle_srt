5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,231
P'Mum!

6
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:32,807
What are you doing?

7
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:35,492
It smells go good.

8
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:36,981
I am hungry.

9
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:38,012
Can I eat now?

10
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:41,160
Just wait a minute.

11
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:49,747
P'Mum.

12
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:50,623
What are you doing?

13
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:51,461
It will spill out.

14
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:53,952
It looks so yummy.

15
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:55,916
I cannot hold myself.

16
00:00:57,403 --> 00:00:58,073
Let me see.

17
00:00:58,978 --> 00:00:59,937
What did you cook?

18
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:02,104
Rice porridge with shrimp.

19
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,217
Taste it, please.

20
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:14,202
Wait.

21
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:15,624
So...

22
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:17,369
you taste it for me,

23
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,442
if it's delicious.

24
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:23,958
How is it?

25
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:25,662
It's delicious.

26
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:26,809
All right.

27
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:28,532
You try it now.

28
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:45,589
P'Mum.

29
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:47,328
What are you doing?

30
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:49,382
I'm tasting your rice porridge
with shrimp.

31
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:50,863
It's so good.

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,017
Can you cook it for me forever?

33
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,380
Then you should not disappear.

34
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:01,428
Stay with me and let me
cook it for you.

35
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:04,774
Will you promise?

36
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:08,589
I promise you.

37
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:52,678
(Mum's World)

38
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:20,051
I will check on him and call you back.

39
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:21,137
Stay still, please.

40
00:03:58,417 --> 00:03:59,272
P'Mum.

41
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:05,762
How bad is his injury?

42
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,879
We don't know yet.
Are you his relative?

43
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,084
I am his sister.

44
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,379
Get into the ambulance, please.

45
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:20,626
You will be fine.

46
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:34,328
Mum.

47
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:38,287
Don't leave me.

48
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:39,777
Understand?

49
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:41,953
Answer me.

50
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:45,760
Stay with me, P'Mum.

51
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:47,646
Please.

52
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:38,791
Gampong.

53
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:41,626
Will P'Mum come to see me again?

54
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:12,320
(November 17, 2022)

(Episode 8)

57
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:50,634
What did you do?

58
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,187
Why did our clients
cancel our orders like this?

59
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,047
I didn't do anything except for
what you and uncle told me to.

60
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:58,360
Then, what happened?

61
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,280
Huh?

62
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:01,823
We've already lost billions of Baht.

63
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,627
I am checking on it now.

64
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:04,532
Checking?

65
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:06,374
Will our clients come back?

66
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,234
I will do my best for this.

67
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,096
I will fix this problem
as soon as possible.

68
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:12,711
You'd better do what you said.

69
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,902
You know what? Now...

70
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,758
I don't have high expectations of you.

71
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:39,731
I checked with Pratin's secretary.

72
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,396
I think your suspicion is right.

73
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,572
I have hired a private detective

74
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:46,136
to follow up on this case.

75
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:18,899
(Mint is calling)

76
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:55,502
Noon,

77
00:10:55,961 --> 00:10:57,330
please find out some details for me.

78
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,748
For the clients who canceled our orders,

79
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:01,198
where do they get the products?

80
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,327
The view from here is beautiful.

81
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:12,034
I think it is good for you
to leave our house.

82
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:15,708
Yes.

83
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,227
When I am tired,

84
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:20,849
I always enjoy the view here.

85
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:24,768
Dew,

86
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:26,915
do you know

87
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:30,458
when I just married your father,

88
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:34,335
I also helped him at the company?

89
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,673
I know it has never been easy,

90
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:41,738
as I came from a Thai family
and married him.

91
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:45,710
So you decided to quit the job,

92
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:47,277
after I was born.

93
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:54,042
You are the one who saved me from that.

94
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:57,192
Without you,

95
00:11:58,278 --> 00:11:59,646
I would lose my patience.

96
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:01,752
I might run away from that family.

97
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,285
Are you okay, Mom?

98
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:16,604
I don't want my happy son
to be miserable like this.

99
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,861
We can give up
and just go somewhere else...

100
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,585
I cannot leave Daddy.

101
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:29,430
Seeing him in this situation

102
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:31,399
makes me worry about him.

103
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,152
Those people are trying to harm you.

104
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,741
Noon told me everything.

105
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:55,553
Those people would never
think about families.

106
00:12:58,663 --> 00:13:00,795
They are too greedy.

107
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,353
Our important clients
have already canceled their orders.

108
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:10,123
As a result, this has done
some serious damage to our company.

109
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,839
We're losing profits.

110
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,198
Our share price in the stock market
is plummeting.

111
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:15,895
Huh,

112
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:17,553
if we let this keep happening,

113
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:21,113
our shareholders will sell their shares.

114
00:13:21,272 --> 00:13:23,352
We're planning to invest
in a new project.

115
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:24,482
What should we do?

116
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:27,748
Well, we can borrow some loans
from the banks,

117
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:30,804
they are okay with us.

118
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:32,022
But,

119
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,768
if our company
continues to be like this,

120
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:35,115
the bank might not be okay anymore.

121
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:38,284
I think we need a Plan B

122
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:40,954
to save our company's image.

123
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,411
Well,

124
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,226
does anyone have any suggestions?

125
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,335
Some directors of the board

126
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:01,706
have asked me to suggest that

127
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:04,921
we need to change the Marketing Manager.

128
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,274
Dew is too young to take
such a great responsibility.

129
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,253
As everyone may know, our clients

130
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,022
are aware of our image

131
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:21,260
and our credibility.

132
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,223
During the last three months,

133
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:25,362
it has already proved that

134
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,175
the Marketing Manager

135
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:29,115
is not doing a good job.

136
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,184
Now that Mr. Thawat, son of Mr. Wut,

137
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:38,709
has just graduated in marketing
from the USA.

138
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,780
He is now very popular.

139
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,958
We might offer him this position.

140
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:55,178
May I speak?

141
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:01,163
Before we make any decisions,

142
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,876
I just want to say I am also
one of the directors of the board here.

143
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,039
I have some questions.

144
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:10,116
Go ahead.

145
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,582
Everyone is now
just focusing on a marginal reason.

146
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,450
Don't you all want to know
the predominant reason?

147
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,696
We all discussed it, Prin.

148
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:21,296
You were just not able
to grab the fact that

149
00:15:21,368 --> 00:15:24,381
the real damage of this company

150
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:26,373
came from the mistakes
your department made

151
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:29,478
and how incompetent you are.

152
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:30,711
I think you're jumping to conclusions,

153
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,621
Mr. Pratin.

154
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:38,796
Mr. Chairman.

155
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,884
Directors of the board.

156
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:43,876
After we found this problem,

157
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,640
I did not sit on it.

158
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,134
I've already visited these four clients

159
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:50,898
and we had a meeting.

160
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:53,040
Three out of those four

161
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,658
have agreed to make a new deal with us.

162
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:57,001
As for the last one,

163
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,467
that company will consider my new offer

164
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,342
and will give the answer within today.

165
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:03,598
There is a very high chance
that this company will say yes.

166
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,098
As for the additional details,

167
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,137
my secretary will email them

168
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,072
to everyone.

169
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,595
How did you do that, Prin?

170
00:16:27,224 --> 00:16:28,726
Why didn't you say that just now?

171
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:30,567
You should have done that before.

172
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,886
Because before that,

173
00:16:34,004 --> 00:16:36,289
I could not personally contact
or meet them.

174
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,206
Someone was spreading bad news,

175
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,351
and made our clients think that

176
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:43,370
I was an unreliable person.

177
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:44,880
Who did that?

178
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,895
Do you know
who was the person behind this?

179
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:48,585
Is it our rival company?

180
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:50,201
It came from our company.

181
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,816
You can't blame us
without any evidence.

182
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,513
I do have proof.

183
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,941
If everyone wants to see it,

184
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,221
I'll be glad to reveal it.

185
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,592
All right.

186
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:20,984
Well, about that...

187
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:22,513
we can talk later.

188
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,173
I think it should be all right.

189
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:27,015
It's good to know that

190
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,335
the clients came back to us
and made a new deal with us.

191
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:31,618
As for how to save our image,

192
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,197
we will use a public relation strategy

193
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,382
to save our image
both internally and externally.

194
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,929
I hope this will make everyone

195
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,305
gain more confidence in our company.

196
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:43,476
Today's meeting is over now.

197
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:44,790
Thank you, everyone.

198
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,720
(Mr. Prisan Suwanatri Neo Contacted Confirmed
Mr. Panya Deelerd ODC Group Confirmed)

199
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:06,925
What are you trying to do?

200
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,314
I just did what you taught me.

201
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:13,168
Thank you

202
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,545
for giving me lessons all along.

203
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:29,321
Do it.

204
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:31,554
You have to shut him up forever.

205
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:05,144
You should have some lunch.

206
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:06,814
I know.

207
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,674
But I am not hungry.

208
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:10,384
You can take my lunch away.

209
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:15,174
About Pratin,

210
00:19:15,414 --> 00:19:17,124
are you sure that you want to do that?

211
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:23,874
You already saw

212
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,234
what he did to me.

213
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:27,064
But Pratin

214
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:29,284
is your uncle.
He's your flesh and blood.

215
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:32,434
You are family but you have animosity
towards each other like this.

216
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:35,544
It may affect our credibility.

217
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:04,214
Gampong,

218
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:06,554
if P'Mum was in this situation,

219
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,994
what would he do?

220
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:18,284
(Dew's World)

221
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:21,324
(Mum's World)

222
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:35,964
P'Mum.

223
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:38,414
How are you feeling?

224
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:42,504
Mint?

225
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:44,314
Are you thirsty?

226
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,394
Drink some water.

227
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:16,344
You have a bone fracture
in your left arm.

228
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:18,474
You have a lot of bruises.

229
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,814
The doctor has put your arm
in soft splints.

230
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:25,484
Mint,

231
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:29,104
I know that

232
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,284
you were scared.

233
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,734
You don't really know how I feel.

234
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:38,314
You don't even know

235
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,914
how scared I was.

236
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:47,724
You're the only one I have now.

237
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:50,234
If you are gone,

238
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:53,094
what shall I do?

239
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:55,384
Huh?

240
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,964
I...

241
00:22:15,264 --> 00:22:16,314
I am sorry.

242
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,494
I was careless.

243
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:22,444
I am sorry.

244
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:27,094
Don't leave me.

245
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:30,874
Don't leave me like our parents.

246
00:22:31,924 --> 00:22:32,894
Don't do that.

247
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:36,054
I can't live without you.

248
00:22:47,744 --> 00:22:49,334
If I know who they are,

249
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:50,884
I will kill them.

250
00:22:53,824 --> 00:22:55,034
I am with you this time.

251
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:57,754
They intended to kill Mum.

252
00:22:58,214 --> 00:22:59,524
They cut his brake cable.

253
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:05,884
Wait.

254
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:08,184
Play the clip backward.

255
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:11,364
That's it.

256
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:21,734
I think I remember this bold guy.

257
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,004
Why did you throw water on me?

258
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:52,544
Are you...

259
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,734
Yes, it's us!

260
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:58,134
What's up with you?

261
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:00,464
Did you two attack my bro?

262
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:01,584
You!

263
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,864
How dare you?

264
00:24:03,864 --> 00:24:04,894
You!

265
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:07,674
Don't punch the girl, idiot!

266
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:08,964
- Come on!
- Hello? Lieutenant?

267
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:10,034
Please hurry.

268
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,474
Before we beat them badly.

269
00:24:12,474 --> 00:24:14,124
You asked for it.

270
00:24:14,124 --> 00:24:16,054
Come on.

271
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,764
I won't spare you!

272
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:20,324
That's it. Good!

273
00:24:28,244 --> 00:24:29,734
I am sorry.

274
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:31,664
It's okay.

275
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:34,224
If you need help, just press the button.

276
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:36,014
Yes.

277
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:37,324
How do you feel today?

278
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:42,104
I can move a little bit.

279
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:44,864
You are very strong.

280
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:47,264
Your recovery is quite fast.

281
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:51,894
So, when...

282
00:24:52,054 --> 00:24:53,664
When can I go home?

283
00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:55,494
We have to do a CT scan

284
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,164
and an overall check-up
to see the result.

285
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,294
I promise you

286
00:25:02,404 --> 00:25:03,574
that tomorrow night,

287
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:06,424
I will rush back to help you
investigate this matter.

288
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:07,764
But your tomorrow...

289
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:09,794
is my yesterday.

290
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:12,434
How could I remember our promise?

291
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,594
Don't you worry.

292
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:16,524
I will do everything I can

293
00:25:16,664 --> 00:25:18,644
to make you remember my promise.

294
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:20,434
Wait for me, Dew.

295
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:22,604
We have to make it.

296
00:25:23,264 --> 00:25:24,874
I won't lose you again.

297
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:43,884
Where are you going?

298
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:48,004
Are you okay?

299
00:25:53,794 --> 00:25:54,774
You get bored.

300
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:56,684
That's why you want to go outside.

301
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:01,414
When can I go home, Mint?

302
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,864
In the next three days.

303
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:05,024
I've already talked to your doctor.

304
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:06,074
Three days!

305
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,594
Only three days.

306
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:10,234
This is fast enough.

307
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:11,784
Why do you want to go home so badly?

308
00:26:13,144 --> 00:26:13,934
You...

309
00:26:14,994 --> 00:26:17,564
Are you worried about the pub or...

310
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:19,354
Are you worried about that person?

311
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:22,964
I am worried about the pub

312
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:24,504
and

313
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:26,674
my room.

314
00:26:27,514 --> 00:26:28,634
Your room?

315
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:37,424
Worried about your room, huh?

316
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:39,994
What are you mumbling about?

317
00:26:41,594 --> 00:26:42,284
Well...

318
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:44,784
Nook once told me

319
00:26:44,924 --> 00:26:46,014
that you'd just

320
00:26:46,134 --> 00:26:47,214
live in your condo temporarily.

321
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:48,144
What?

322
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:50,074
That's not temporary.

323
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:51,544
No!

324
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:53,384
That's not true.

325
00:26:54,354 --> 00:26:55,684
It's just a room.

326
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:57,894
No need to worry.

327
00:26:59,104 --> 00:27:00,354
As for the pub,

328
00:27:00,644 --> 00:27:02,054
you can relax now.

329
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:04,834
P'Games, P'Vee and your staff
can take care of it.

330
00:27:18,284 --> 00:27:19,134
Hello?

331
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:20,404
How is going, P'Games?

332
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:22,354
I am at the hospital.

333
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:25,474
Pardon me?

334
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:28,294
I'm sure that reconciliation
isn't gonna happen for you guys now.

335
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:29,494
Follow me to the police station.

336
00:27:29,674 --> 00:27:32,314
- Ouch!
- What? What is it?

337
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:35,314
- Calm down.
- Just calm down.

338
00:27:35,314 --> 00:27:36,224
Okay then.

339
00:27:36,674 --> 00:27:37,754
I am calm enough to talk.

340
00:27:44,554 --> 00:27:46,054
Do you really want my brother to die?

341
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:49,534
Speak!

342
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,254
- Stop, stop it!
- Calm down!

343
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,214
- Stop it!
- Why don't you try to stop her?

344
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,934
How can I stop her?

345
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:57,534
Well, we will stop her like this...

346
00:27:57,534 --> 00:27:59,474
Go for it. Don't spare them.

347
00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:01,974
If you dare! Come on.

348
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,494
Punch them! Kick them!

349
00:28:03,494 --> 00:28:05,394
- Stop. Stop.
- Punch them!

350
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:07,694
Stop it now!

351
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:11,354
Well, I don't know.

352
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:12,914
Once I saw them,

353
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:14,044
I couldn't think about anything.

354
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:16,424
So, I just kicked them.

355
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:17,904
Just say I am really angry.

356
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:21,614
You guys are cool.

357
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:24,334
But next time,

358
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:26,674
don't be a tough girl.

359
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:28,644
Once I've fully recovered,

360
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:30,254
I will get back to them myself.

361
00:28:30,564 --> 00:28:31,724
All right.

362
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:33,044
I already knew.

363
00:28:38,564 --> 00:28:39,354
Lily.

364
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:43,464
White lilies.

365
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:44,684
Mom and I like them.

366
00:28:45,444 --> 00:28:46,164
Aren't they beautiful?

367
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:52,104
A purple lily.

368
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:53,144
Do you like this?

369
00:28:55,004 --> 00:28:55,594
Yes.

370
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:56,934
This is my favourite flower.

371
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:03,324
It's beautiful.

372
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:06,514
I will go to work now.

373
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:09,694
P'Games and P'Vee will come
to visit you this afternoon.

374
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:11,904
I will see you in the evening.

375
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:18,964
Take your pills on time.

376
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:20,944
Understand?

377
00:29:21,904 --> 00:29:22,644
Yes, Madam.

378
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:23,944
I am leaving now.

379
00:30:40,584 --> 00:30:41,614
When will you pay your debt?

380
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:43,714
Tonight.

381
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:57,554
This tastes good.

382
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:07,264
Now we have extra eight customers.

383
00:31:07,384 --> 00:31:10,104
And we will present our product to them.

384
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:12,284
Furthermore,

385
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,754
I've already prepared the information

386
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,204
that you asked me to find.

387
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:16,134
Yes.

388
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:17,894
Today,

389
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:19,784
Miss Mint sent you some snacks.

390
00:31:21,454 --> 00:31:22,384
Thank you.

391
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:24,334
Mr. Dew, please help us.

392
00:31:24,994 --> 00:31:25,854
What happened, Ms. Eve?

393
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,034
The school just called us to tell us

394
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:29,464
that Miss Da had an accident.

395
00:31:29,464 --> 00:31:32,804
I cannot get in touch with
Mr. Pratin and Mrs. Pa.

396
00:31:34,774 --> 00:31:36,244
I will take care of Da.

397
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:39,034
You keep calling my uncle.

398
00:31:39,794 --> 00:31:40,694
All right.

399
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:46,964
Can you contact them, Ms. Noon?

400
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,104
I am at the hospital now.

401
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:52,094
Okay.

402
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:56,964
Nurse.

403
00:31:57,574 --> 00:31:58,664
How is Da?

404
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:00,934
She lost a lot of blood
and needs an operation now.

405
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:03,204
Are you the patient's relative?

406
00:32:03,604 --> 00:32:04,914
I am Da's brother.

407
00:32:05,104 --> 00:32:06,424
We are cousins.

408
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,674
We share the last name.

409
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:11,084
This is good. Could you please
sign the permission for operation here?

410
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:17,554
Excuse me.

411
00:32:17,554 --> 00:32:18,754
May I know your blood type?

412
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:21,324
We need type AB blood.

413
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:22,944
My blood type is AB.

414
00:32:23,184 --> 00:32:24,224
We share the blood type.

415
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:26,794
Okay. Please follow me.

416
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:48,964
(Operating Room)

417
00:32:56,514 --> 00:32:57,064
Dew.

418
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:01,214
How is Da?

419
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:03,694
She's having an operation now.

420
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:05,464
She will be safe.

421
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:19,824
Da is a good girl.

422
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:21,484
She will be fine.

423
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:29,744
How is it then?

424
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:32,314
You are always at work.

425
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:34,014
You don't care about your daughter
and me.

426
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:34,844
What about you?

427
00:33:34,864 --> 00:33:36,024
Do you care about your daughter?

428
00:33:36,324 --> 00:33:38,704
Did you go to your social club
and leave my daughter unattended?

429
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:42,424
Here's some water for you.

430
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,004
Thanks.

431
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:47,774
Thanks, Dew.

432
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:01,294
The nurse

433
00:34:01,364 --> 00:34:02,814
just told me that

434
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,084
we are lucky.

435
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:05,964
Dew's blood type

436
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:08,104
matches with Da

437
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:11,914
so that she can get an operation
in time.

438
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:18,924
Doctor?

439
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:20,624
Are you her relatives?

440
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:21,684
Yes.

441
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:23,524
The patient is out of danger.

442
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:25,934
We need her admitted to the hospital
to check on her.

443
00:34:26,394 --> 00:34:27,504
Thank you.

444
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,944
I will excuse myself now.

445
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:32,024
Nurse.

446
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:33,754
May I visit my daughter?

447
00:34:33,754 --> 00:34:35,714
Yes, you can, but not for long.

448
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:46,744
Thank you so much, Dew,
for saving her life.

449
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:48,514
Thank you very much.

450
00:34:50,874 --> 00:34:52,094
It's all right, Uncle.

451
00:34:52,664 --> 00:34:54,064
We are family after all.

452
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:07,824
Uncle,

453
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,614
could you quit gambling?

454
00:35:13,104 --> 00:35:15,264
I'm sorry that I happened to know that.

455
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:17,444
But Uncle,

456
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:19,914
if you can quit gambling,

457
00:35:20,254 --> 00:35:21,384
I promise...

458
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:24,044
I promise that I will find a way

459
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:26,084
to find the money to pay your debt.

460
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,404
So you don't have to do
that kind of thing.

461
00:35:48,534 --> 00:35:49,334
Dew.

462
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:03,374
I will send all the evidence to you.

463
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,824
So we can start over.

464
00:36:11,944 --> 00:36:12,784
Cancel.

465
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:14,294
Cancel everything.

466
00:36:14,764 --> 00:36:15,774
What are you saying, Boss?

467
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,034
Tell him now

468
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:18,454
I order to cancel everything.

469
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:19,664
Okay.

470
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:37,984
Hello, Mint?

471
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:40,464
Dew?

472
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:43,154
Have you eaten the sweets
that I sent to you?

473
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:45,854
Not yet.

474
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:47,854
All right.

475
00:36:47,994 --> 00:36:49,464
I will tell you immediately
after I eat them.

476
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:50,934
Really?

477
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:53,284
Okay.

478
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,054
- Dew?
- Mint?

479
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:57,394
I have to hang up now. I am driving.

480
00:36:57,654 --> 00:36:58,844
I will call you tomorrow.

481
00:36:59,944 --> 00:37:01,104
Okay then.
