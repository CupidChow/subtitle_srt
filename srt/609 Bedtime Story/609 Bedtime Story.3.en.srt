It's beautiful, isn't it?

7
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:47,965
I have never seen a meteor shower

Then...

10
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:57,002
I will make a wish.

11
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:04,428
I am so scared

12
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:05,869
that you will disappear.

13
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:16,509
If it's possible,

14
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,404
I would like to make a wish.

15
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:19,886
Ouch!

16
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,448
Is there anything that does not exist
in P'Mum's world?

It's you, Dew.

20

Oh...

21
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:32,412
Oh...

22
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,353
Hello, P'Ton...

23
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:54,537
Did you hear my voice?

24
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:02,700
That's relieved.

25
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:08,235
It's nothing.

26
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,321
I just had a nightmare.

27
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,321
I dreamed about that boy again.

28
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:32,720
In the next two days,

29
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,448
I have to die, right?

30
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,791
The first day I met him,

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,196
he was shot to death.

32
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:37,135
Oh...

33
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,198
Then,

34
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,348
I met him again last night.

35
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:41,973
His shirt had a blood stain on it.

36
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,185
But it was not caused by the bullet shot.

37
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:46,274
It's just like the movies,

38
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:49,055
when the events reversed back
in loops of time.

39
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,989
Like when the ghost asked for help

40
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,531
to find the truth about how he died.

41
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:10,505
Dew,

42
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,235
do you hear me?

43
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:14,364
I don't know

44
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:16,823
whether you are a ghost who was trapped
in that place,

45
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,101
or you are a ghost
who was trapped here.

46
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,363
Just come out and tell me.

It's enough.

84
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:12,528

I checked it, and I think it surpassed
our target by more than a half.

do you remember
the day we visited Mum?

108
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:39,132
And he was sleep-talking.

109
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,385
He looked so happy.
Don't you think?

110
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:46,865
Yes, it's true.

111
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,324
Didn't know whom he was with.

112
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,423
I don't know if he was
with that ghost boy.

Well...

115
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:03,380
Do you think he's a real ghost

116
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,074
or just someone in Mum's dream?

117
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:08,942
I don't know about that.

118

119
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:12,668
my friend, Mum... looked so happy.

120
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:15,386
I think

121
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:20,861
if we can spend time
with our beloved ones,

122

it'll be the best time.

00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:56,424
Finally, you called me back.

176
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:58,436
I am so sorry that I lost touch.

177
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,910
I am now busy with my collection.

178
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:03,080
I can guess.

179
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,970
When you did not call me,

180
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:07,133
it means you keep yourself
busy with your new collection.

181
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:08,829
Has it finished yet?

182
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,370
Yes, I had a tailor-made order.

183
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:13,504
After the fashion shoot,
I can put them on sale.

184
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:15,415
It's cool.

185
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,442
So, as for the display,

186
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:18,896
I will help you again. Is that okay?

187
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,058
I like it.

188
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,751
Do you like arranging the display?

189
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,073
I like the brand's owner.

190
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,325
I told you that

191
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,662
you are my best friend.

192
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,044
If we were in a relationship,

193
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:37,356
our relationship would end badly

194
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,433
after we broke up.

195
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:42,452
You just refused me again.

196
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:45,049
Can't I just flirt with you?

197
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:47,851
So, tonight

198
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:49,133
would you like to hang out?

199
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:50,259
Tonight?

200
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:53,561
Okay.

201
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:54,718
Which pub?

202
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:58,123
No, we don't have such a thing.

203
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:01,060
Is this the condo's secret?

204
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:03,106
Please tell me.

205
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:05,435
I promise

206
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:06,576
I won't tell anyone.
Please tell me.

207
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:19,653
Here's the money.

208
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,651
I heard some hearsay.

209
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:27,993
But it was a long time ago.

210
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:29,289
I can't remember it.

211
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:32,534
It was too long and...

212
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:35,591
I can't recall.

213
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:38,407
Here...

214
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,572
Baht 1,000.

215
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:44,359
I remember it now!

216
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,515
But...

217
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,287
don't tell anyone

218
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:49,618
that you know it from me.

219
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:50,371
Yes.

220
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:52,781
When this condo was under construction,

221
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,963
there were foreign workers

222
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:56,976
who fell to death.

223
00:16:58,361 --> 00:16:59,890
Foreign workers?

224
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:00,447
Yes.

225
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:01,300
Excuse me.

226
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:09,539
You can't just randomly

227
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:10,275
ask about any ghost story.

228
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:12,538
Our residents will be frightened.

229
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:14,546
I am sorry.

230
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,315
I just want to know

231
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,828
if there was a man.

232
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,293
He's about...

233
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:21,528
this height. Not too tall.

234
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:24,007
And

235
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:25,125
he looks...

236
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:25,936
Cute.

237
00:17:26,476 --> 00:17:27,297
He is a pretty boy.

238
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:29,570
Did he

239
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,934
die in this condo?

240
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:31,666
Nobody

241
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,658
died here.

242
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:35,637
You can check our condo's history.

243
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:38,160
I have checked everything.

244
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:39,447
There is none.

245
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,911
I think the data might be erased.

246
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:44,891
So, I have to ask someone

247
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:45,884
who's been here longer than me.

248
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:47,546
Please tell me.

249
00:17:50,374 --> 00:17:51,538
I still insist

250
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,891
no one died

251
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,343
in this condo.

252
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:58,929
Is it clear now?

253
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,256
Yes.

254
00:18:01,787 --> 00:18:03,070
Don't you ever

255
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:04,959
tell about the ghost story.

256
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,132
Okay.

257
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,702
Thank you very much.

258
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:40,023
(Why don't you bring your
mobile phone with you?)

259
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:18,042
(Don't forget to take medicines,
and you will get better soon.)

260
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:26,554
(I have prepared food for you.
Check all the food boxes.)

261
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,357
I gave up...

262
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,450
I gave up.

263
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,339
Wait. Hold on.

264
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,022
Don't just give up.

265
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:29,156
If we met in this reverse time,

266
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:32,741
I might be able to travel back
to your past.

267
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,126
You just tell me.

268
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,202
Who caused your trouble?

269
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:40,944
I might fix it
in this loop of time.

270
00:20:58,568 --> 00:20:59,558
You just tell me.

271
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:01,638
Who caused your trouble?

272
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,378
I might fix it
in this loop of time.

273
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,528
I've checked those reports.

274
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:11,668
There are problems

275
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:12,608
in these purchase orders.

276
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:14,118
The person who signed

277
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:15,048
for approval

278
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,788
was...

279
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:18,098
This job was not
your responsibility.

280
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:19,628
Don't touch it. Understand?

281
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:21,818
What you did was very risky.

282
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:22,638
You son of...

283
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,078
Aun,

284
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,398
don't!

285
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:26,128
Get a grip!

286
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:27,488
The next time,

287
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:28,288
Aun won't be the one who punches you.

288
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,318
It'll be me.

289
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:32,698
Or...

290
00:21:33,128 --> 00:21:33,668
Dew

291
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:36,448
does exist in the parallel world.

292
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,548
(Dew is Ghost?)

293
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:14,948
P'A.

294
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:16,288
Vee.

295
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:24,828
Please go.

296
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:28,528
Your new room looks nice.

297
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:32,148
Look,

298
00:22:32,328 --> 00:22:34,438
I will buy some plants.
They will make a good view here.

299
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:36,698
You always like it.

300
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:38,918
There is no need.

301
00:22:42,338 --> 00:22:44,088
Vee, please relax.

302
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:47,718
As for the mortgage,

303
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:49,948
I can share it with you.

304
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:55,618
Let's go shopping

305
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:57,618
and buy some things
to decorate our new home.

306
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,208
Stop acting like this.

307
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:07,858
Don't pretend nothing happened.

308
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:14,738
I love you, Vee.

309
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,498
So?

310
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:24,298
You knew I was forced to do that.

311
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:26,188
I am the only son in the family.

312
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:28,878
And I agree with that.

313
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:32,618
I walked out from your life.

314
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:35,408
I did not want to lose you.

315
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:41,378
Don't be so greedy.

316
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:44,928
Please go back to your wife and kid.

317
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:49,558
Vee...

318
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,718
We promised to stay together.

319
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:57,288
No, we promised we would get married.

320
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:00,378
I do understand.

321
00:24:01,368 --> 00:24:02,798
Your friends,

322
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:04,248
even you...

323
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:08,498
No one ever thought we would love
each other and get married for real.

324
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:21,978
I cannot do this.

325
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:26,828
I know

326
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:28,368
you cannot do this, too.

327
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:30,048
Right?

328
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:34,858
P'A,

329
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:38,528
get off me.

330
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:40,778
You go now.

331
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:42,128
Vee.

332
00:24:43,238 --> 00:24:44,348
Vee, listen to me.

333
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:45,878
Just get out, P'A.

334
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:46,338
Hey!

335
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:48,998
P'Vee told you to get out.

336
00:24:49,148 --> 00:24:49,988
Don't you understand?

337
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:50,958
Games.

338
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:54,728
P'Vee.

339
00:24:57,428 --> 00:24:58,268
Who is this guy?

340
00:25:00,888 --> 00:25:01,538
This is Games.

341
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:02,878
My new boyfriend.

342
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:07,488
A new boyfriend?

343
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:17,318
He is the pub's owner,
I am working with him.

344
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,238
I am sorry, Games.

345
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:22,888
I could not pick you up
from downstairs.

346
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:25,498
It's okay.

347
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:26,908
Not angry?

348
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:27,688
Not at all.

349
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:31,898
Vee.

350
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:35,888
Are you fooling me

351
00:25:36,338 --> 00:25:37,158
with this guy?

352
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:38,708
It looks fake.

353
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:41,508
I hug him like this,
and you still don't believe it.

354
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:44,838
I also hug him like this,

355
00:25:46,748 --> 00:25:47,608
and you still don't believe it.

356
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:50,718
Everyone can hug.

357
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,428
Vee is not the type of person

358
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:57,518
to have this kind of lousy boyfriend.

359
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:03,308
Enough already, Vee.
Don't pretend anymore.

360
00:26:04,578 --> 00:26:06,418
Let's talk about us.

361
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:07,348
What do you want to talk about?

362
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,608
P'Vee, don't talk to him.

363
00:26:49,438 --> 00:26:50,258
Do you believe it now?

364
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,998
You know that
I don't randomly kiss a guy.

365
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:09,598
Ouch!

366
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:10,588
You punched me.

367
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,098
P'A. Stop!

368
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:12,998
Come on!

369
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,248
P'A. Stop!

370
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:14,758
Enough, both of you!

371
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:17,868
I want to report to the police, P'Vee.

372
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:25,948
Vee, you would never break up with me.

373
00:27:28,478 --> 00:27:30,008
It'll always be like that.

374
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:30,808
You just like this kind of views.

375
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:32,888
It's so beautiful there.

376
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:34,168
And also beautiful there.

377
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:37,168
But I want a selfie.
Let's make a selfie.

378
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:38,168
Okay.

379
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:43,778
I need a full portrait photo
and another one with the sky.

380
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:45,638
There is no one else helping us.

381
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:48,448
May I ask him to help?

382
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:51,358
Excuse me.

383
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,338
Can you take photos for us?

384
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:54,738
Is that OK?

385
00:28:55,548 --> 00:28:57,748
One with a full portrait
and another with the sky.

386
00:28:59,078 --> 00:28:59,638
Yes, I can.

387
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:04,868
Ready?

388
00:29:10,888 --> 00:29:11,378
Counting...

389
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,818
One, two, three.

390
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:20,398
Does it look okay?

391
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,098
Wow, it looks beautiful.

392
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:23,258
It looks so good.
Thank you very much.

393
00:29:23,258 --> 00:29:24,038
Thank you.

394
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:24,748
It's all right.

395
00:29:25,578 --> 00:29:27,978
I think we can see
a meteor shower from this side.

396
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,378
He is excited. He wants to
see a meteor shower.

397
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:33,748
What if you can't see it
from our condo?

398
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:38,238
Of course, you can.

399
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:40,488
You can see it clearly.

400
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:41,888
Yes.

401
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:43,398
Can we take more photos over there?

402
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:44,378
Let's go.

403
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:45,908
Thank you again.

404
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,098
Nook! It hurts.

405
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:17,248
Be gentle!

406
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:22,298
There is a kind of person

407
00:30:22,638 --> 00:30:24,638
who'd be so brave
in front of someone he likes

408
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:30,008
even when his mouth got hit.

409
00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:32,218
But when he is in front of me,

410
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:35,878
he'd cry out loud, even if I was only
applying medicines over his wound.

411
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,018
Oh...

412
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:39,208
You applied it so hard.

413
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:42,028
Is this a hand or a foot?

414
00:30:42,268 --> 00:30:43,058
You're not gentle at all.

415
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:45,268
Do it yourself then.

416
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:48,038
P'Games.

417
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:48,628
What?

418
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:50,868
Will P'Vee come to work today?

419
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:53,088
He said he will come here later.

420
00:30:57,828 --> 00:30:58,438
P'Vee, look at this.

421
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:02,028
Many girls posted on our web page.

422
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:03,768
They will wait for P' Mum.

423
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:04,798
What should we do?

424
00:31:05,788 --> 00:31:06,428
Look!

425
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,898
I don't know if he's recovered.

426
00:31:11,218 --> 00:31:12,608
If he is still sick,

427
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:14,198
and Mint comes to the pub...

428
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:15,178
I...

429
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:16,798
I'll be killed by her.

430
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:20,278
Will both of you

431
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:21,948
prepare to die with me?

432
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:27,758
I will not.

433
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:29,518
No.

434
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,108
Well,

435
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:32,348
P'Mint...

436
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,338
She has two hands and two legs.

437
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:37,968
But people in P'Mum's fan club

438
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:41,228
have about a hundred hands and legs.

439
00:31:42,698 --> 00:31:44,198
That is too many.

440
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:56,478
Hello?

441
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:57,688
How are you?

442
00:31:59,428 --> 00:32:00,048
Well...

443
00:32:00,598 --> 00:32:01,308
I'm fine.

444
00:32:01,748 --> 00:32:02,708
Are you sure?

445
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,248
I said so.

446
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:06,688
I am bored, too.

447
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:08,178
Okay, it's good.

448
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:11,278
So, you aren't obsessed
with your dream.

449
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:13,718
I'm not obsessed with it.
Watch your mouth!

450
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:16,668
All right. If you said so.

451
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:19,238
But I am truly afraid of Mint.

452
00:32:19,528 --> 00:32:22,008
If she knows you come to work,
she might come and make a scene.

453
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:26,188
So, don't post any stories

454
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:27,418
or IG.

455
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,078
That's all. The problem is solved.

456
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:30,228
Don't ever do that.

457
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:31,808
Okay.

458
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:33,278
I will ask everyone
not to post anything.

459
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:34,408
You don't have to be worried.

460
00:32:34,678 --> 00:32:35,198
Okay.

461
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:36,928
I will be there in 10 minutes.

462
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:38,838
Okay. Hurry.

463
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:41,158
All right. I'll hang up now.
It's wasting time.

464
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:57,208
Games.

465
00:32:57,788 --> 00:32:58,988
Is Mum still sick?

466
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:00,708
Why did you call him
and ask him to come here?

467
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:04,858
P'Vee,

468
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:06,878
You should see our message inbox.

469
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:17,228
That's too many!

470
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:19,988
P'Vee,

471
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:24,388
as for what happened today,

472
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:27,428
did we already...

473
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:32,428
Games, don't go to my condo anymore.

474
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,108
Why?

475
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:37,618
What did I do wrong?

476
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,078
No.

477
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:42,748
I will move out soon.

478
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,618
What?

479
00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:44,668
Why?

480
00:33:45,928 --> 00:33:47,278
Are you afraid of that...

481
00:33:47,548 --> 00:33:48,318
son of...

482
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:51,928
Is your ex-boyfriend stalking you?

483
00:33:52,668 --> 00:33:54,388
So, you have to keep moving out
to avoid him.

484
00:33:54,748 --> 00:33:56,508
Will you change your job too?

485
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,228
You can't do that now.

486
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:00,198
We are almost a great team.

487
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:01,318
I won't accept your resignation.

488
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:03,078
Games, calm down.

489
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,068
I won't quit this job, okay?

490
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:09,018
It's not easy to find a job.
Why would I quit?

491
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:16,238
Games, look at that.

492
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:22,678
It's Mint!

493
00:34:26,028 --> 00:34:27,168
Oh, my god!

494
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:28,898
Why am I so unlucky?

495
00:34:33,428 --> 00:34:34,008
Mint.

496
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:36,788
I will get you a table.

497
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:43,378
This table is available.

498
00:34:45,138 --> 00:34:47,248
Why is here so lively tonight?

499
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:48,678
Who is the guest singer tonight?

500
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,478
No. Everything is normal.

501
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:53,818
This is a weekend night.

502
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:55,868
So, many people come here
to enjoy themselves.

503
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:58,558
Oh, yes. It's the weekend.

504
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:03,428
Well, Mint...

505
00:35:05,608 --> 00:35:06,628
Has Mum recovered now?

506
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:10,118
I think I will ask Mum... you know...

507
00:35:10,118 --> 00:35:12,258
To take a rest for one more day, right?

508
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:14,788
It's good.
So he will fully recover.

509
00:35:14,918 --> 00:35:16,148
You have made the right decision.

510
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:23,618
Yes, sure.

511
00:35:23,978 --> 00:35:24,488
Is that right?

512
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:25,638
I think so, too.

513
00:35:25,878 --> 00:35:26,718
Right, P'Vee?

514
00:35:32,988 --> 00:35:34,358
I will be right back.

515
00:35:34,778 --> 00:35:35,088
Yes.

516
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:35,428
Okay.

517
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:36,188
My friend has arrived.

518
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:37,778
Go ahead.

519
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,008
What should we do?

520
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:49,418
Mum is on the way.

521
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:55,618
I will wait for him outside.

522
00:35:56,428 --> 00:35:57,378
Wait a second.

523
00:35:57,538 --> 00:35:58,028
Let me think.

524
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:00,488
P'Vee.

525
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:02,038
P'Mint brought her boyfriend
to the pub.

526
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:04,588
Ping.

527
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:05,148
Yes.

528
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:06,518
Get the gun from my room.

529
00:36:07,148 --> 00:36:07,938
Will you shoot him?

530
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:08,948
No. I'm gonna shoot myself.

531
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:12,308
Oh, my god.

532
00:36:12,528 --> 00:36:14,468
I can't believe
this is really happening!

533
00:36:15,118 --> 00:36:16,898
Mum will arrive here soon.

534
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:18,668
Here he is.

535
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:26,458
Everyone...

536
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:27,958
This is my friend.

537
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:36,068
Hello.

538
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:37,538
Hi.

539
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:38,118
Hello.

540
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:40,188
Games.

541
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:40,918
Ping.

542
00:36:40,928 --> 00:36:41,338
Yes.

543
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,238
Get back to work now.

544
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,668
Go now.

545
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:47,918
Make yourself at home.

546
00:36:48,548 --> 00:36:50,028
I am busy here. The pub is packed.

547
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:54,118
Well, what's your name again?

548
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:55,118
It's Dew.

549
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:56,348
Okay, Dew...

550
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:57,798
You just sit here.

551
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:58,868
All right.

552
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:00,438
Okay.

553
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:02,028
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

554
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:03,738
Mint and Dew.

555
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:05,598
All right.

556
00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:07,998
I will excuse myself
and get back to work.

557
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:08,638
Okay?

558
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:09,498
The pub is packed.

559
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,708
All right.

560
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:15,868
They are so nice.

561
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:17,298
They acted so weirdly.

562
00:37:42,768 --> 00:37:44,308
Have you talked to Aun and Joey lately?

563
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:47,118
Not at all. I am so busy with work.

564
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:49,518
You too, right?

565
00:37:52,308 --> 00:37:53,038
Your glass is empty.

566
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:54,648
What do you need?
I'll order it for you.

567
00:37:55,588 --> 00:37:57,188
Blue Hawaii, please.

568
00:37:58,178 --> 00:37:58,788
Thanks.

569
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:04,728
Hello, what do you need?

570
00:38:04,938 --> 00:38:06,438
Blue Hawaii, please.

571
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:07,108
Okay.

572
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:08,628
(All this)

573
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:10,508
(Push)

574
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:17,308
If it's possible,

575
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:22,198
my wish is
to meet Dew like this forever.
