Yes?

00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:14,475
Is there anything I can help with?

Your car's engine has been on
for some time.

00:01:17,604 --> 00:01:18,550
It's okay.

11
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,001
I was looking for something in the car.

12
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:21,980
All right.

No.

00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,403
Say it again?

Don't be so surprised.

28
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:34,764
I just told you guys

29
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,807
that I will go on stage for only
one round every night.

What about me?

32

You will go on stage for two rounds.

00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:40,694
Just me?

34
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:41,292
Yes.

00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:42,051
Again?

Hey!

37
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:47,962
You two.

38
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:48,964
I can't do it.

39
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,339
I can't sing.

40
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:51,986
Losers!

41
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,588
How about this?

42
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,941
You hire a new singer.

43
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:58,990
As for the expense,

44
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,217
you can deduct from my salary.

45
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:02,967
Are you sure?

46
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,045
Yes.

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:09,073
Ton,

49
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:11,848
I will help you prep in the kitchen.

50
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:16,032
All right.

51
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:16,797
Okay.

52
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:17,789

What should I say?

He's already made up his mind.

Why do you guys look so serious?

Are you ready, P'Mum?

59
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,433
Whose brother is this?

60
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:54,971
He looks so handsome.

61
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:58,939
I don't want more make-up.

62
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:01,325
Just apply some more.

63
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:02,831
You will look good.

64
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,034
Enough now.

65
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:10,461
It looks good.

66
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:12,144
Really?

67
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:14,209
You're not lying to me, right?

68
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:19,777
Your model is here.

69
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,338
I will update his photo.

70
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,385
She is serious now.

71
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:34,880
What?

72
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:37,178
You swear now that

73
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,263
you're forcing me
to do things like this

74
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:41,752
just for your work.

75
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:43,848
That's right.

76
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,317
It's all about work.

77
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:47,700
Really?

78
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:50,906
What is that?

79
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,204
Don't you all have things to do?

80
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:54,676
Hmm, P'Ton?

81
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:57,381
You always ask Nook to chop up
vegetables in the kitchen.

82
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:58,421
She is good at that.

83
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:01,518
Go now! Get back to work.

84
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:03,637
Just go!

85
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:05,998
Go!

86
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,171
Don't smile.

87
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,789
Go and change your clothes.

88
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:10,567
Yes, Miss.

89
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,337
Go now! Just go, everyone!

90
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:15,366
Okay. Get back to work.

91
00:07:26,103 --> 00:07:28,025
Nice. One more shot.

92
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,082
One... Two... Three.

93
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:31,375
You look so good.

94
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:33,981
He looks handsome.

95
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:35,950
This shirt suits him.

96
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,046
That makes him even more handsome.

97
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:40,188
Wait.

98
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,114
Don't you think I am already handsome?

99
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,828
Nope.

100
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:45,154
That's bad.

101
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:46,942
Let me see.

102
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:49,409
Turn this way.

103
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,665
Let's see your fingernails.

104
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,127
What is it?

105
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:06,336
You cut your nails,

106
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,055
and even polished them.

107
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,338
Who did that for you?

108
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:29,067
Tell me who did that.

109
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:30,540
Do I know that person?

110
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:35,840
Let's take some more photos.

111
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:37,574
Or, I will go home to sleep.

112
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:40,046
All right.

113
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:40,908
Let's take some more photos.

114
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,026
Sir.

115
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:44,273
Can you please take more photos of him?

116
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,014
All right, then...

117
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,828
Please do the same pose,

118
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,866
and I need you to be relaxed
and be yourself.

119
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:52,242
I am always myself.

120
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:53,277
Oh!

121
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:55,746
He is such a show-off.

122
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,971
Okay. Ready?
One, two, three.

123
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,302
- Good timing.
- One, two, three.

124
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:09,762
We are leaving now.

125
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:12,121
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

126
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,151
I am leaving too.

127
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:16,150
I will show these photos
to the brand's owner.

128
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:18,385
Wait.

129
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:20,650
What is it?

130
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:22,932
Are you serious about this guy?

131
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:24,809
Who?

132
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,629
I mean that brand's owner.

133
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:32,090
Obviously, you care too much
about this client.

134
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,005
It's nothing.

135
00:09:38,006 --> 00:09:40,052
I always take good care of my clients.

136
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:45,974
I just feel sad for this guy.

137
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:48,193
He's so unlucky to have you
to be his girlfriend.

138
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,652
Watch your mouth!

139
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,818
The one who cut your nails is unlucky.

140
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,621
That person is very unlucky
to love a guy like you.

141
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,066
That person is a lucky one.

142
00:09:58,452 --> 00:09:59,238
I am leaving now.

143
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:01,089
Drive carefully.

144
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:01,903
Okay.

145
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:08,358
(All This Pub & Restaurant)

146
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,329
Nook. Come on.
The sour soup is done.

147
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:14,330
Come quickly!

148
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:16,122
I am leaving now.

149
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:18,194
Why do you use this exit?

150
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,755
I don't want to meet the customers
outside the front door.

151
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:27,217
P'Ton.

152
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:29,586
Thank you.

153
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:40,573
I am coming!

154
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,331
Which dish?

155
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:43,716
The sour soup is ready to serve.

156
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:44,540
It looks good.

157
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,313
Yes. Don't serve the wrong table.

158
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,660
Yes.

159
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:12,281
P'Mum!

160
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,181
I miss you so much.

161
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,070
Is your girlfriend calling?

162
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,069
It seems so.

163
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,189
You should take this call.

164
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:44,907
It's okay. I can wait.

165
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:47,695
Well...

166
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:50,751
If I take this call,

167
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:52,360
will you be sad?

168
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:58,223
Actually,

169
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:00,108
I will be sad.

170
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:02,549
It's like...

171
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:04,408
It reminds me that

172
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:07,890
I love someone
who has already been taken.

173
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:13,616
P'Mum...

174
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,864
I have already asked myself

175
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:17,788
for so many times.

176
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:21,410
And I still got the same answer.

177
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,497
The answer is I love you.

178
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,070
I don't want to lie.

179
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:39,559
Do you like to eat that?

180
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,157
Yes.

181
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:42,738
How is it?

182
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:46,454
It's

183
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:48,151
a little sweet

184
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,415
and sour.

185
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:51,071
It can intoxicate me a little.

186
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,009
So, is this good or not?

187
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:56,634
Actually,

188
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:58,597
I like it because

189
00:13:58,607 --> 00:13:59,654
it is not too sweet.

190
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:00,835
It's a little sour

191
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:02,287
and has no alcohol.

192
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:05,000
I haven't found the drink
that I like the most yet.

193
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:08,520
It's too bad

194
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,410
that you can't come to my world.

195
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:11,691
Because

196
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,886
I will make a special cocktail for you.

197
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,496
I agree.

198
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,196
On the day I died,

199
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,804
what was the last sentence

200
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:37,170
that I said to you?

201
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:43,519
I...

202
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,227
love you,

203
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:47,260
P'Mum.

204
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,723
At that time,

205
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,235
I was shocked.

206
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:55,888
Because I just met you for the first time.

207
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,900
Then I kissed...

208
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,126
That young man.

209
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:03,932
Right.

210
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:06,445
The first time I met you,

211
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:08,161
you also kissed me.

212
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:10,868
Really?

213
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:22,277
I was very happy.

214
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,865
At least on that day,

215
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:28,295
I was brave enough
to express my feelings

216
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:30,149
to the one I loved

217
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,084
before I died.

218
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:04,758
You told me that

219
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:06,275
the very first day that you met me

220
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:08,131
was the 6th of November, right?

221
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,994
You also told me that

222
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:12,781
my last day

223
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:14,273
was the 24th of November.

224
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:16,671
But the first day that I met you

225
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,302
was the 6th of November.

226
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,529
But it was in my world.

227
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,914
But in my world, it was the 24th.

228
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:24,591
That means

229
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:27,862
the time in our world

230
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:30,060
was in reverse parallel.

231
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:31,598
We can see each other between the 6th

232
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,483
and the 24th.

233
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:37,466
We won't see each other after that.

234
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:41,062
Hey, Dew.

235
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:42,240
Listen to me.

236
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,974
We still have time.

237
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,533
We have to find the murderer.

238
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:48,843
If we find him,

239
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:51,073
we might change our destiny.

240
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:53,211
What if you are safe

241
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,375
on the 24th?

242
00:16:57,846 --> 00:16:58,639
Perhaps

243
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,433
we still can meet each other that day.

244
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,041
This is so good.

245
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,861
But

246
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,511
if we change our destiny,

247
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,013
what will happen to the people around us
in our world?

248
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,283
I think

249
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,513
they will be affected a little.

250
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:22,136
Like

251
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:24,127
Pratin, your uncle.

252
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:25,584
He might be in jail.

253
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:28,290
But you will still be alive.

254
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:32,988
Did I tell you about my uncle?

255
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:34,606
Yes.

256
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:37,713
According to what you told me,

257
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:40,364
the most suspicious person

258
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:42,754
is your uncle, Pratin.

259
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:47,918
He might be corrupting the company.

260
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,325
But he is surely not a murderer.

261
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:53,876
So, we will have to prove that.

262
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:55,904
We can start with your uncle,

263
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,301
and find out if he is the murderer.
If he is not,

264
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:58,967
then we will investigate someone else.

265
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:01,681
How can we prove that?

266
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:04,124
How long does it take

267
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:05,759
to go to your uncle's house from here?

268
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,512
About 20 minutes.

269
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:12,426
Just 20 minutes.

270
00:18:13,336 --> 00:18:15,823
So, we have only one hour per day.

271
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,143
You need to take me
to your uncle's home.

272
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,147
What did you say?

273
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:25,633
Since no one can see me in your world,

274
00:18:26,174 --> 00:18:27,633
the only person
who can investigate this case

275
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:28,816
is me.

276
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,059
I will go to his house

277
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,231
and try to get evidence
of his wrongdoings.

278
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,420
Whatever I can find,

279
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,293
I'll give it to you.

280
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:40,981
Hey.

281
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:58,786
I will go to his house

282
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,966
and try to get the evidence
for his wrongdoings.

283
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,156
Whatever I can find,

284
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,026
I'll give it to you.

285
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:05,716
Hey.

286
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,166
Yes, Sir.

287
00:19:10,186 --> 00:19:11,076
Have you finished your work?

288
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:12,366
It's already done, Sir.

289
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:14,626
I've got another thing for you.

290
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:18,796
If your uncle intends to kill you,

291
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:21,136
you must

292
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,216
take him legally.

293
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:28,476
I don't have much time,

294
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,206
because I have to go back.

295
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:31,926
But I promise you,

296
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:33,806
that tomorrow night,

297
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:36,706
I will come back to help you
investigate this case.

298
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,466
But your tomorrow

299
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:41,406
is my yesterday.

300
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:44,866
How can I remember our promise then?

301
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:47,176
Don't worry, Dew.

302
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:49,406
I will do everything

303
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,446
to make you remember my promise.

304
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:56,476
Just wait for me.

305
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:58,756
We can make it.

306
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:06,546
I don't want to lose you again.

307
00:20:54,816 --> 00:21:00,156
(Group Line:
I won't go to the pub tomorrow.)

308
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:04,606
(Group Line:
I have an important thing to do.)

309
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:15,356
Hey!

310
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,906
What's wrong with you, Aun?

311
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:25,156
Where did you go?

312
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:28,676
Were you with Dew again?

313
00:21:29,716 --> 00:21:31,526
Why do you look so terrible?

314
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:34,106
I was

315
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:35,446
worried about you.

316
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:36,636
What?

317
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:38,266
I was worried about you.

318
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,926
Turn your voice down.

319
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:42,046
I don't want all the security guys
to come here.

320
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:43,966
Who cares!

321
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:46,786
You are drunk.

322
00:21:48,116 --> 00:21:49,046
Just go home.

323
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:52,646
Hug me.

324
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,216
What's wrong with you?

325
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:56,626
Can you do it for me?

326
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,766
I will drive you home.

327
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:00,806
Come on.

328
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:18,876
You just sleep here.

329
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:20,066
Where is Mint?

330
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:24,046
Mint...

331
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:36,406
He is always like that when he is drunk.

332
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:39,176
Hey, Mint.

333
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:41,236
Why are you so tough like this?

334
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:42,836
You mean, with him?

335
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:43,666
Yes.

336
00:22:45,266 --> 00:22:47,316
He really likes you.

337
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:49,986
I know.

338
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,176
Did you know

339
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,806
why he failed in every relationship?

340
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,566
Because he is a womanizer.

341
00:22:57,786 --> 00:22:58,546
Is that right?

342
00:22:59,496 --> 00:23:00,206
No.

343
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:02,456
No girl can put up with him.

344
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:04,576
When he was drunk,

345
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:06,366
he would be babbling about you.

346
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:08,496
He would always come to see you.

347
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:15,886
Actually,

348
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:18,186
Aun is a very good friend.

349
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,126
I just don't like him that way.

350
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:24,816
What about you and Dew?

351
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:28,076
Dew always rejects you.

352
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:29,836
Why do you still love him?

353
00:23:33,076 --> 00:23:34,026
I don't know.

354
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:37,736
Normally in all matters,

355
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,636
I make the decision with my brain.

356
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:42,746
But for Dew,

357
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:45,016
I use my feelings.

358
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:47,416
No.

359
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:48,576
It's not true.

360
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,196
You must have a reason.

361
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:51,516
I mean you...

362
00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:54,076
You must have a reason like

363
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,396
a feeling-reason.

364
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:57,906
A feeling-reason?

365
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,116
Are you a Shakespeare now?

366
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:05,986
You already knew that

367
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:09,326
Dew is always a nice guy.

368
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:12,776
I was his fan girl
since we studied together.

369
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:16,916
Do you understand a fan girl's feelings?

370
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:19,676
Whatever our idol does,

371
00:24:21,116 --> 00:24:22,486
I'll always think it's good.

372
00:24:25,776 --> 00:24:27,956
I don't care how many times
he has rejected me.

373
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:32,566
I will be waiting for him.

374
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:38,586
It's a fan girl's life.

375
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:41,946
Your idol is God.

376
00:24:46,056 --> 00:24:46,926
Hey...

377
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:48,656
If one day

378
00:24:48,826 --> 00:24:50,866
Dew really loves someone else,

379
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:53,436
will you be okay with that?

380
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:09,586
You are always on your mobile.

381
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:11,146
Do you see the outside world?

382
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:14,276
It's my business and this is my world.

383
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,396
Your imagination world.

384
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:20,076
This is my private life and my space,
and I can do whatever I want.

385
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:21,666
So, don't trip over then.

386
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:24,286
- Yes, don't bug me anymore.
- Hey!

387
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:27,886
Why can't you two stop arguing?

388
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:29,416
You made me look bad.

389
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,486
Ping, did you check the back of the pub?

390
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:32,986
Yes.

391
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:34,266
Nook, what about the front pub?

392
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:35,526
I did that.

393
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:36,236
Okay.

394
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:37,396
I am leaving now.

395
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,306
All right.

396
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:39,096
Goodbye.

397
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:44,046
Hey, P'Ton.

398
00:25:44,046 --> 00:25:44,336
Huh?

399
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:44,856
Have you finished your job?

400
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:45,906
Yes.

401
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:47,996
What is it?

402
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:49,656
I want to pay for your airline ticket.

403
00:25:49,656 --> 00:25:51,276
No. There is no need.

404
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,166
- Well...
- I have already purchased the ticket.

405
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:54,436
I will go there

406
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,706
and transfer the land's ownership.
I will fly back tomorrow.

407
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:57,946
I will come back to work.
Don't worry.

408
00:25:57,946 --> 00:25:59,706
No, I insist.

409
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,216
No!

410
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:02,206
- I insist, too.
- You've been helping me so much.

411
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:03,446
I felt that I owed you.

412
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:04,406
Because I could not pay you a lot.

413
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:05,026
No, no.

414
00:26:05,026 --> 00:26:06,776
Mum and you are my brothers.

415
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:08,416
Money is not a problem.

416
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:09,226
I am leaving now.

417
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:10,076
Come on!

418
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:12,416
No, no. I can't take it.
It's okay.

419
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:13,906
Games, this is enough.

420
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,716
I will be back tomorrow for sure.
I will go now. See you later.

421
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:19,646
Good luck.

422
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:20,586
Yep.

423
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:36,546
What...

424
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:38,236
Why were you sneaky like that?

425
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:40,516
Your car is very old.

426
00:26:40,706 --> 00:26:42,156
I don't think it can be fixed.

427
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:43,396
You'd better buy a new car.

428
00:26:44,446 --> 00:26:45,746
It's easy for you to say.

429
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:47,296
You are a pub owner.

430
00:26:49,266 --> 00:26:51,276
Whatever is broken,

431
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,836
it can't be fixed.

432
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:56,016
It's easier to just get over it.

433
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:03,436
It's okay.

434
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:04,846
Let me do it.

435
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:07,866
Then,

436
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,656
I will park my car here.

437
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,656
Tomorrow, I will call a tow truck
to take it to the repair shop.

438
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:15,636
Okay, then.

439
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:25,826
What are you doing?

440
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:28,336
I will grab a taxi.

441
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:30,376
Normally,

442
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:32,446
how much will it cost for the taxi
to drive you home?

443
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:34,946
Around 120 Baht.

444
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:36,616
Here.

445
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:39,226
What?

446
00:27:39,606 --> 00:27:41,246
Pay me, and I will drive you home.

447
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:44,596
No, I will grab a taxi.

448
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:47,656
Let's go. Stop using your mobile phone.
Come on.

449
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:50,566
No.

450
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:52,866
Don't be so stubborn.

451
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:55,606
Get in the car, please.

452
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:12,926
Here, 120 Baht.

453
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:16,676
I think you are too serious.

454
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:17,886
I don't want your money.

455
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:19,816
Just take it.

456
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,606
Thank you for driving me home.

457
00:28:28,906 --> 00:28:29,866
Good night then.

458
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:31,176
Wait!

459
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:32,476
What?

460
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:35,766
Hey.

461
00:28:36,726 --> 00:28:38,586
Finish your drink and get some rest.

462
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:40,596
You can go home
when you are fully awake.

463
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:44,696
You are not only handsome

464
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:46,426
but also very kind.

465
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:48,916
I am not a kind person.

466
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:51,766
I can't let you drive when you are
sleepy. You might have an accident.

467
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:55,086
Why are you laughing?

468
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:01,166
Seriously,

469
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:03,846
I like it when you scold me.

470
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:05,676
It's lovely.

471
00:29:06,306 --> 00:29:08,646
No one wants to get scolded.

472
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:12,576
I don't know.

473
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:15,256
When you scold me,

474
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:17,596
it makes me feel like...

475
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:19,796
there is someone
who's looking out for me.

476
00:29:20,786 --> 00:29:21,976
Someone who cares for me.

477
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,486
Stop it.

478
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,766
You always flirt with lots of women.

479
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:28,146
That was true.

480
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:33,186
But no one made me feel...

481
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,206
they really cared for me.

482
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:41,366
I feel a bit sticky.

483
00:29:42,056 --> 00:29:43,256
I'll take a shower.

484
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:45,226
I'll bathe with you.

485
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:46,626
That's sassy.

486
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:48,286
I mean

487
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:50,036
after you finish, I will take a bath.

488
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:53,296
Let go of me.

489
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,756
P'Vee, please be quick.

490
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:04,696
I might want to pee.

491
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:12,346
It's refreshing.

492
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:16,486
P'Vee, are you done?

493
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:19,286
Almost done. Just wait.

494
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:22,706
Come on.

495
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:31,346
Why are you naked?

496
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:32,596
I want to take a bath.

497
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:43,266
Hey!

498
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:47,816
Can I borrow your towel?

499
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:49,486
Hey!

500
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:15,246
What kind of cream is that?

501
00:31:15,296 --> 00:31:16,166
It smells nice.

502
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,356
What?

503
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:20,856
P'Vee.

504
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,036
Are you sleepy?

505
00:31:23,886 --> 00:31:24,786
Why do you ask?

506
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:26,756
Well,

507
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,096
we can sleep together.

508
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:32,896
I mean we will get some sleep together.

509
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:35,836
I can't sleep.

510
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:40,586
I promise,

511
00:31:40,686 --> 00:31:42,156
I will not touch you,

512
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:44,006
if you don't want.

513
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:45,846
Games!

514
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:48,436
Come on, I am just joking.

515
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,696
It was a joke.
Come on, let's sleep.

516
00:31:58,566 --> 00:31:59,906
What is it now?

517
00:32:17,786 --> 00:32:19,056
I am closing my eyes,

518
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:22,946
because I want to restrain myself.

519
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:27,286
I am afraid if I open my eyes,

520
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:29,306
I can't hold myself back.

521
00:32:32,426 --> 00:32:34,306
Are you sure that
we should not do that?

522
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:37,016
No.

523
00:32:38,316 --> 00:32:39,246
How about a good night kiss?

524
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:43,456
Not on the mouth.

525
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:45,766
Just a peck on the cheek.

526
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:50,936
May I have that peck?

527
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:50,396
(Mint's calling)

528
00:33:57,606 --> 00:33:58,906
Hello? P'Mum.

529
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:00,536
What's up, Mint?

530
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:02,806
Have you seen the IG yet?

531
00:34:02,946 --> 00:34:04,706
Your "likes" are soaring.

532
00:34:04,826 --> 00:34:06,506
Many girls have left their comments.

533
00:34:07,766 --> 00:34:08,536
It's great.

534
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:10,946
The brand's owner said thank you to you.

535
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:12,656
He wants to treat you to a meal.

536
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:15,426
You two just go.

537
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:18,146
I don't want to be a third wheel.

538
00:34:18,646 --> 00:34:19,416
Hey.

539
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:20,946
Don't do that.

540
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:22,476
I want you to meet him.

541
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:26,136
No, I will hang up now.
I am busy.

542
00:34:27,186 --> 00:34:28,196
Okay.

543
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:30,786
All right, then. Bye.

544
00:34:31,996 --> 00:34:32,676
All right.

545
00:35:06,826 --> 00:35:07,656
P'Games.

546
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:09,216
Have you looked at your mobile phone?

547
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,136
What? No, I forgot.

548
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:14,956
I turned it off yesterday.
What happened?

549
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:16,646
P'Ton missed the flight.

550
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:17,726
What?

551
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,086
That's terrible.

552
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:20,636
Then,

553
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:21,816
did P'Ton tell you

554
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:22,676
when he will arrive?

555
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:23,066
Yes.

556
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:23,846
He did.

557
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:26,286
He told us that he will be
back around 10 to 11 p.m.

558
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:27,176
10 to 11 p.m.

559
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:29,626
He can't make it on time
to open our pub.

560
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:30,656
What should we do?

561
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,516
Tell us.

562
00:35:34,586 --> 00:35:36,476
He is a great chef, and it's not easy
to find a replacement.

563
00:35:36,896 --> 00:35:37,666
Who else

564
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:39,226
can cook as well as him?

565
00:35:39,546 --> 00:35:41,496
And he must come here now.
It's now or never.

566
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:43,716
It's P'Mum!

567
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:06,556
But I promise you

568
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:08,556
that tomorrow night,

569
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:10,266
I will come back to help you

570
00:36:10,306 --> 00:36:11,626
investigate this case.

571
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:25,176
Nook! Shrimp in fish sauce is ready.

572
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,356
Wow!

573
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:29,956
That's quick. You are doing great.
Next dish, please.

574
00:36:30,046 --> 00:36:30,776
Quick.

575
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:31,996
Come on.

576
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:20,626
Oh, you!

577
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:21,866
Did you take the order yourself?

578
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:23,716
It is very busy outside.

579
00:37:23,856 --> 00:37:25,196
These are new orders.

580
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:27,996
Too many orders.

581
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:29,846
Hey, Mum. Calm down.

582
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:31,926
You know, the customer is God.

583
00:37:32,056 --> 00:37:33,796
My God does not eat shrimp in fish.

584
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:35,406
Calm down, please.

585
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,936
- Sorry, I am so sorry.
- Hey, Ton!

586
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:38,466
Yes.

587
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,666
- You take it from here. I am leaving.
- Okay. Okay.

588
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,446
You just go. Quick.

589
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,676
Mum, thank you so much.

590
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:55,526
Wait for me, Dew.

591
00:37:56,236 --> 00:37:57,856
I don't want to lose you ever again.
