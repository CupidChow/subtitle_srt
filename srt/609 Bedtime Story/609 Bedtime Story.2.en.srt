(to people, places,

4
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:21,284
I love you.

5
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,006
Hey!

6
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:48,373
(The telephone is ringing.)

7
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:56,448
Hello. Mint.

8
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:58,189
Are you sure that you are in your room?

9
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:00,398
Didn't you go out?

10
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:01,842
Yes.

11
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:04,068
I'm not sleeping
with anyone else here either.

12
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,340
I just...

13
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:07,667
What?

14
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:10,688
Nothing.

15
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:11,955
Nothing.

16
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,030
I just had a dream.

17
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:15,926
It's like my real life.

18
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:18,610
It's because you are sick.

19
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,496
When you sleep, you dream.

20
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:22,788
I think so.

21
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:25,595
Well, go back to sleep.

22
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:27,320
I'm sorry for interrupting you.

23
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,277
Wait! Mint!

24
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:30,150
What are you calling me?

25
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:32,056
It's so late.
Why haven't you gone to bed?

26
00:01:32,814 --> 00:01:34,807
Not getting enough sleep
will make you sick like me.

27
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:38,449
I'm working.

28
00:01:38,783 --> 00:01:39,838
I think I will go to bed.

29
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,228
Um. Go to bed.

30
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:11,362
(Episode 2)
(The Changing World)

31
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:20,371
It's true.

32
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:21,780
It's...

33
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,249
like my real life.

34
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,254
What is it?

35
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:27,620
When that man took his shot,

36
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:30,943
my date died at once.

37
00:03:31,316 --> 00:03:33,143
It's so real.

38
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:36,362
Then...

39
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:39,081
Is your date's skin

40
00:03:40,464 --> 00:03:41,323
soft?

41
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,005
I think

42
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:46,048
it's soft.

43
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,190
The skin is really smooth.

44
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,306
It fits my hands.

45
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:53,513
Stop messing around.

46
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:54,588
I'm serious.

47
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:55,629
Okay!

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,237
Wait! Wait!

49
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,725
The date that you told us.

50
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,109
Did you have a date with a man?

51
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:02,786
Yes.

52
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:05,852
Yes.

53
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:12,630
Hey!

54
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,345
Don't look at me.

55
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:16,557
I'll punch you.

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,327
I didn't mean anything.

57
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,700
I'm just asking.

58
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:22,007
How is it?

59
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:23,617
How do you feel

60
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:25,202
when you're with him?

61
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:26,849
Do you like it?

62
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,356
or not?

63
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:32,007
I like it.

64
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:34,245
No!

65
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:35,752
I don't like it.

66
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,905
You don't like it?
Really?

67
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:41,345
Let's assume you don't like it.
Then how do you feel?

68
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:43,946
I think you...

69
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,765
you're too serious.

70
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,065
I will ask...

71
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:48,302
What year is it now?

72
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:50,298
- It's 22.
- The year 2022.

73
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:53,575
That's right.

74
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:54,627
Yes.

75
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:56,844
I think

76
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:59,063
it doesn't matter which gender you like.

77
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:00,588
It's normal.

78
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:02,055
Look at me.

79
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:03,265
In the past,

80
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:05,591
I only like women.

81
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,016
But now

82
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:08,967
I can't look at other people

83
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:10,061
except

84
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:12,048
this man.

85
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:14,780
Yucky!

86
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:17,261
Mum.

87
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:19,762
I think you are sick.

88
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,573
That's right.

89
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:24,965
Are you feeling better now?

90
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,548
This is boiled rice with fish.
It's from another sick person.

91
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,699
Eat it. Mum, my beloved brother.

92
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:48,802
Eat it.

93
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,179
Thank you so much.

94
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:57,629
If I don't have you,

95
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,108
I think

96
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:01,283
our shop is going to close.

97
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,157
How can you do it?

98
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:06,120
You make every dish by yourself.

99
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:08,719
And your customers praise you.

100
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,437
It's not like that.

101
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:15,205
Ouch!

102
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:20,874
Why don't you eat it?

103
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:22,539
Let me try it.

104
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,025
Do you know what I forgot to add?

105
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:28,543
Or, am I worse at cooking?

106
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:30,560
No. it isn't.

107
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,716
I'm not hungry now.

108
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:33,266
Um!

109
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:38,526
P'Tom.

110
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:41,083
Why

111
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:44,555
was he shot in front of me?

112
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:49,686
And why do I feel familiar

113
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,716
with him so much?

114
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:03,052
It's so real.

115
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,926
I can still remember that feeling.

116
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,787
I don't know.

117
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:28,571
I don't believe that it happened

118
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,028
by accident.

119
00:07:33,908 --> 00:07:34,987
Maybe

120
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,750
things happen for a reason.

121
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:45,982
That's all.

122
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,484
Are you following me?

123
00:07:57,848 --> 00:07:59,589
Don't you think I'll let people rob you?

124
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:01,719
I'm afraid of being robbed.

125
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,682
But if P'Vee wants to rob me,

126
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:04,705
you don't need to do it,

127
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:05,848
because I'll

128
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:07,585
give it to you myself.

129
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:09,409
Are you having enough fun?

130
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:16,100
I'm not having fun.

131
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,162
You're teasing my feelings.

132
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:23,646
P'Vee! P'Vee! Wait.

133
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:25,094
Um.

134
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,095
Why are you teasing me?

135
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:29,186
I'll go to work.
Let me go.

136
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:31,621
I...

137
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:34,603
I'm not teasing with

138
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:36,939
your feelings.

139
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:40,893
But if things I did

140
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:44,306
made you worry,

141
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:47,546
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,625
I will be responsible for it,

143
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:01,160
if you're okay with this.

144
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:14,054
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:15,731
Continue.

146
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:17,915
I'll mop there.

147
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:37,361
P'Mum.

148
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,907
What's up? Sister.

149
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:52,812
P'Mum.

150
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,630
Okay. I'll handle it.

151
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,610
Do you feel better?

152
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:57,243
Hey!

153
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:58,432
It's not a big deal.

154
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,613
I think you should take some medicines.

155
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,320
Here...

156
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,870
Here is your drink. P'Mum.

157
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:06,862
The girl at that table
bought this for you.

158
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:11,421
Do you want to try that mix?

159
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,444
Medicine and alcohol.

160
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,348
Nook.

161
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:21,718
Please give my words to that girl.

162
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:23,261
Recently

163
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:24,880
P'Mum is in rehab.

164
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:27,351
He is trying to quit alcohol.

165
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:31,862
In rehab.

166
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:34,299
Hey! Why did you say that?

167
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,224
Why don't you love yourself more?

168
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,910
We only have each other now.

169
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:45,004
Do you want to die before me?

170
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:46,828
Mint. Mint.

171
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,016
Please calm down.

172
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,632
If you keep being so loud,
you'll scare our customers.

173
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:51,510
Be quiet!

174
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,353
No.

175
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,437
You have to come back and relax now.

176
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:57,030
If you sleep late,

177
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,060
you'll be worse.

178
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:01,052
Take your hand out.

179
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:03,300
Calm down. Calm down.

180
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,360
If customers think you're my wife
by mistake, it'll cost me later.

181
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:08,093
Take care of yourself first.

182
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:12,767
P'Mum. It's time for our show.

183
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,344
Okay. Let's go.

184
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:16,139
No way.

185
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:21,293
P'Vee.

186
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,843
Games.

187
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:28,084
Mint. I'm begging you.

188
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:29,299
Today, all the tables are fully booked.

189
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:30,131
Please! Please!

190
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:31,723
Please! Mint.

191
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:36,268
Let me go first.

192
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:37,741
I understand.

193
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,887
Okay.

194
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:47,798
I'll let you perform only one song.

195
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:49,119
If not, you die.

196
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:52,319
Do you understand?

197
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:55,474
Okay.

198
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:11,108
P'Vee.

199
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,864
How do you feel?

200
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,305
Do you like it or not?

201
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:33,440
You.

202
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:36,532
P'Mum.

203
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:48,583
Um.

204
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:54,516
You aren't...

205
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:57,119
P'Mum.

206
00:14:58,204 --> 00:14:59,480
What should I do?

207
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,287
What should I do?

208
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:07,188
You.

209
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:09,877
What happened?

210
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:11,807
P'Mum.

211
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,717
I

212
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,548
I

213
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:03,942
Hey! What happened?

214
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,091
Ouch! What happened?

215
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:34,763
Manow.

216
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:51,896
Hey!

217
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:53,648
Do you miss me, P'Mum?

218
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,480
What's wrong with you?

219
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,620
Hurry up and make love to me.

220
00:16:57,778 --> 00:16:59,069
I don't have much time.

221
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:22,599
P'Mum, what's wrong with you?

222
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,749
Um. Stop this now.

223
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,060
You aren't good at having sex
as other people told me.

224
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:29,804
Wait, Manow.

225
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:32,859
I'll show you.

226
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:35,255
How is the tiger hunting its prey?

227
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:52,358
Who told you that you're a tiger?

228
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:54,318
You're so cute.

229
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:55,689
You're like a cat.

230
00:17:58,642 --> 00:17:59,251
Manow.

231
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:00,436
I'm so sorry.

232
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,092
I don't know what's wrong with me today.

233
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:03,568
I can't do it anymore.

234
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:04,642
I'm sorry.

235
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:09,303
I'm in a bad mood now.

236
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,031
What a waste of my life!

237
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,304
Manow!

238
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:17,253
Jerk!

239
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:16,849
(Sexual orientation changing
from a straight man to a gay.)

240
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:26,862
I'm crazy.

241
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:28,518
I'm so crazy.

242
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:31,571
What should I do?

243
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:32,990
I'm straight.

244
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:56,209
I missed you so much.

245
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:02,581
Hey! Brother.

246
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:07,997
Why

247
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:11,501
was he shot in front of me?

248
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,569
It's so real.

249
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:17,208
I can still remember that feeling.

250
00:21:19,138 --> 00:21:20,013
Remember. Mum.

251
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:21,921
Nothing in the world happens
without its reason.

252
00:21:32,568 --> 00:21:33,562
Maybe

253
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:36,735
someone meets us by destiny

254
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,947
to make our heart

255
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,282
change forever.

256
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:53,248
Ghost.

257
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:55,356
No matter what I think, it's a ghost.

258
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:56,628
I'm sure about it.

259
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,180
I think so.

260
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:00,575
P'Ton. What do you think?

261
00:22:01,976 --> 00:22:03,092
I think

262
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,322
you should pay attention to your work.

263
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:07,568
We're cooking for people.

264
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:08,954
Please do it carefully.

265
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,192
Huh!

266
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:12,681
Okay. Chef.

267
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:17,105
But why?

268
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:19,230
When I met him...

269
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,190
- Your wife?
- When I met him...

270
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,470
You told me that ...

271
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,560
when you two first met...

272
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,150
you had sex with him.

273
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,760
No. Nook.

274
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,150
You'll be punished. No.

275
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,740
Ouch!

276
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:32,454
Well,

277
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:34,476
when I first met him...

278
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,045
he had already been dead
because of that shot.

279
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:40,200
But when I met him last night...

280
00:22:41,622 --> 00:22:42,870
There was a dried blood spot
on his shirt.

281
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:45,838
But it's like a shot.

282
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:50,535
This story sounds familiar.

283
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,341
It's like a movie

284
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,772
that a scene is in flashback.

285
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:56,580
And a ghost is trying to tell some clues

286
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,709
to make you help investigate
the cause of his death.

287
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,044
This theory is possible.

288
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:02,894
I think so. Mum.

289
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:05,344
I think you should have another dream.

290
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,562
If the events are shown
in a series of flashbacks,

291
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:09,392
I think what we thought before is true.

292
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:12,993
Is it true, P'Ton?

293
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,956
I don't want to know
whether it's true or not.

294
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:16,460
I only want to know

295
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,940
if I can open my restaurant today.

296
00:23:18,103 --> 00:23:19,580
Hurry up!

297
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:21,786
You hurry up!

298
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,087
The head chef is complaining.

299
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:27,927
Hey! Wait.

300
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:30,755
If Mum needs to have a dream tonight,

301
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,872
he can't sing on stage today.

302
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:35,422
Yes. It's true.

303
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,105
Crap!

304
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:38,431
Do it like this.

305
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:40,660
I have an idea.

306
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:42,230
We'll take that ghost

307
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,860
here, and then

308
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:45,467
we can talk to each other.

309
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,609
I know all the information.

310
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:52,414
How are you going to do that?

311
00:23:57,963 --> 00:24:01,538
Look at this.

312
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:03,056
Wait.

313
00:24:03,306 --> 00:24:04,452
Where did you get an ouija board?

314
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:05,359
Did you buy it?

315
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,442
No, I didn't buy it.

316
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:08,562
I found it at the back of the restaurant.

317
00:24:09,218 --> 00:24:09,698
Uh!

318
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:11,709
Why is there

319
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:13,519
an ouija board in our restaurant?

320
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:18,110
Did our restaurant have a ghost
like P'Mum's room?

321
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,389
Hey!

322
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:21,832
Stop saying that.
There is no ghost in P'Mum's room.

323
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:24,986
It belongs to my nephew from
Khon Khan province. He forgot it.

324
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:27,354
He said it's only a prop
for his short movie.

325
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:32,081
So, it won't work.

326
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:33,618
Mum.

327
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,064
I think you should have another dream.

328
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:38,741
And ask that ghost what he wants.

329
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:42,197
Yes. I think it's more useful.

330
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:45,400
Okay.

331
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,986
So, that's all for today.
Go and do your own work.

332
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:50,788
Wait.

333
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,398
If you don't have a try,
you won't know if it works.

334
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:57,833
Mum. You also want to know it, right?

335
00:24:58,636 --> 00:24:59,758
Do you want to try it?

336
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:10,624
I agree.

337
00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:12,705
We'll know the truth.

338
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,767
What does that ghost want?

339
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:17,608
Okay.

340
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,609
For P'Mum.

341
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,128
- For P'Mum.
- For P'Mum.

342
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:22,192
We have to help each other.

343
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:24,723
- Okay? Don't think of yourself.
- Okay.

344
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:26,300
First, P'Ton.

345
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:28,943
P'Ton. Please help us.

346
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,255
What do I have to do?

347
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,481
Mum. Pass me the joss stick.

348
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:51,880
Ohm! Ohm! Ohm! Ohm!

349
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,610
Hey!

350
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,082
It's too long.

351
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,943
We're inviting the soul in room No.609

352
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:03,628
to come into this cup.

353
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:06,068
Into this cup

354
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:10,847
to explain everything to us.

355
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,257
Come! Come!

356
00:26:21,356 --> 00:26:21,917
Come!

357
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:28,410
Has it started?

358
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,083
I'm not sure, either.

359
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:34,050
You can try to ask something.
It'll move if the soul has come.

360
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:39,805
Vee.

361
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:41,587
I don't think it's working.

362
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:43,191
We should continue to

363
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,346
prepare for our restaurant.

364
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:45,151
Wait.

365
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:49,429
It's moving.

366
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:50,991
It's real.

367
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:08,026
It's moving.

368
00:27:08,546 --> 00:27:09,446
It's real.

369
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:10,691
The cup's moving.

370
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:12,866
Well,

371
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:16,737
Mum. I think you should ask this soul.

372
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:19,316
Okay.

373
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,056
Are you

374
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:24,771
the person who lives in room No.609?

375
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,548
Yes.

376
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:37,491
It's right.

377
00:27:40,796 --> 00:27:42,314
I think he wants to talk to Mum.

378
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:44,086
Mum. You should talk to him.

379
00:27:44,086 --> 00:27:44,916
Okay!

380
00:27:45,086 --> 00:27:45,576
Uh!

381
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:46,626
I can't.

382
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:47,656
You.

383
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:49,186
What do you want?

384
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:50,606
Tell me.

385
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:52,146
If I am able to do it,

386
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:53,216
I'll do it.

387
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:54,976
But you can't come to me again.

388
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:00,556
I.

389
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:03,466
I.

390
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:04,386
I.

391
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:07,386
L.

392
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:10,956
I.

393
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:13,636
K. E.

394
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:15,326
Like.

395
00:28:15,886 --> 00:28:17,006
Like.

396
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:20,946
B.

397
00:28:22,906 --> 00:28:23,556
I.

398
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:27,336
G.

399
00:28:28,696 --> 00:28:29,566
Bro.

400
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:32,686
T. H.

401
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:34,546
E. R.

402
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:35,756
I like you. Big brother.

403
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,306
Games.

404
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:51,066
Did you push it?

405
00:28:51,366 --> 00:28:51,986
Ouch!

406
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:52,886
You.

407
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,886
You hurt my head.

408
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:56,196
You hit me so hard.

409
00:28:59,176 --> 00:29:00,106
I just see

410
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:01,176
you were looking so serious.

411
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:03,266
So I entertained you.

412
00:29:03,356 --> 00:29:04,086
Oh?

413
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:04,996
Is it right, P'Vee?

414
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,246
Is it time to play?

415
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,616
Everyone is serious.

416
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:10,436
Yes. You almost gave me a heart attack.

417
00:29:11,956 --> 00:29:13,256
P'Vee. Punish him.

418
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:14,496
I've already been hurt.

419
00:29:14,946 --> 00:29:15,486
Huh!

420
00:29:16,926 --> 00:29:17,466
Really.

421
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:19,996
What does that little brother want?

422
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:52,966
Why are you here?

423
00:29:55,676 --> 00:29:56,336
Please sit.

424
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:58,416
I used to sit.

425
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:00,016
What's wrong with you?

426
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:04,456
Do you think there is a ghost?

427
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,356
I just don't understand

428
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:10,696
why that little brother ghost

429
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:13,036
would do something like this to me.

430
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:15,136
Hey!

431
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:18,976
Just trust your feelings.

432
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,146
You don't need to care
whether it's right or not.

433
00:30:22,736 --> 00:30:23,786
I don't know

434
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:25,726
what you met.

435
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:28,846
Only you and your heart will know.

436
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:42,406
Body and heart?

437
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:48,586
Nook.

438
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:50,656
Nook. Stop playing.

439
00:30:51,186 --> 00:30:52,416
Customers are coming in.

440
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:54,646
Hey!

441
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,036
Oho!

442
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:58,666
I really want to watch this.
It's so beautiful.

443
00:30:59,346 --> 00:31:00,016
What?

444
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:03,886
Watch it on the group line.
P'Vee. Look at your phone.

445
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:05,466
Hurry up.

446
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:07,036
It said that

447
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:09,826
on the night of 22nd, Nov.,

448
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,866
there will be a meteor shower.

449
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:12,936
At Bangkok,

450
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:16,096
this one will be the clearest in decades.

451
00:31:16,786 --> 00:31:19,026
Why are you so excited?

452
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:20,966
Ouch! This uncle.

453
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:23,246
If you see a meteor shower,

454
00:31:23,326 --> 00:31:25,036
close your eyes and make a wish.

455
00:31:25,136 --> 00:31:26,846
It'll come true.

456
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:29,506
Really?

457
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:31,986
You're going to do something like that.

458
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:35,176
Yes. So, I'll take a day off that night.

459
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:37,766
I'll pray for a handsome man

460
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:38,906
to be mine.

461
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:40,906
Eh! You.

462
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:44,206
You can pray that your ex and you
would get back together again.

463
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:46,016
Do you want to come with me?

464
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:48,036
Who will take a day off?

465
00:31:48,096 --> 00:31:49,466
I'll cut that person's salary.

466
00:31:50,246 --> 00:31:51,146
Serve your right.

467
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:54,196
But

468
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:57,026
tonight is just the 7th.

469
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,666
I feel

470
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,456
I want it to be tonight.

471
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:03,116
I'll make a wish, too.

472
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,576
I want someone

473
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:08,986
to return my love

474
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,336
and forget about his ex.

475
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:14,906
Mum.

476
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,556
It's time for our show.

477
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,106
Games.

478
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:27,806
Yes.

479
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:30,696
I don't think Mum is ready to perform.

480
00:32:30,746 --> 00:32:31,726
He's sick.

481
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:37,066
He's okay.

482
00:32:37,326 --> 00:32:38,316
Who is he?

483
00:32:38,636 --> 00:32:39,836
He's Mum.

484
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:41,846
He's so tough.

485
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:44,306
(P'Mum.)

486
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:48,946
Games.

487
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,276
I think Mum should only sing one song.

488
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:54,506
I think so.

489
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:19,296
I think Mum should have another dream.

490
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:21,606
If the events happen
in a series of flashbacks,

491
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:23,476
I think it'll be sure.

492
00:34:37,436 --> 00:34:37,916
Okay.

493
00:34:43,586 --> 00:34:44,206
I'm Dew.

494
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:45,386
What?

495
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:47,286
My name's Dew.

496
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:51,536
Dew.

497
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:53,446
I thought...

498
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:55,266
I have to call you "Baby Boy" forever.

499
00:34:58,416 --> 00:34:59,396
If it is possible,

500
00:35:00,386 --> 00:35:02,476
I want to be your Baby Boy forever.

501
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:05,856
It means that...

502
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:06,966
How?

503
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:09,396
It means Dew...

504
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:12,396
will be a ghost and haunt me forever.

505
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:16,506
Haunted ghost?

506
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:17,476
Yes.

507
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,966
Are you a ghost in my room?

508
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:24,426
This is my room.

509
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:27,146
You come to me yourself.

510
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,136
This is the view of my room.

511
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:56,766
And

512
00:35:57,336 --> 00:35:57,976
this room is...

513
00:35:58,856 --> 00:35:59,866
room No.609.

514
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,406
I don't know what happened.

515
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:08,626
Normally,

516
00:36:09,596 --> 00:36:10,876
I'll be on that bed.

517
00:36:17,196 --> 00:36:18,256
And we met yesterday.

518
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:18,936
What was yesterday?

519
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:21,666
It was the 21st.

520
00:36:24,096 --> 00:36:24,636
Wait.

521
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:27,816
Is today the 22nd of November?

522
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:34,976
But yesterday...

523
00:36:35,646 --> 00:36:36,506
is the 7th.

524
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,346
It means...

525
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:40,306
our meeting...

526
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:42,866
is a series of flashbacks.

527
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:46,926
I think it's true.

528
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:49,426
Because the first time I met you,

529
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:50,706
you called my name.

530
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:53,356
You said a lot of things.

531
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:55,656
But the next day

532
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:57,876
you can't remember
what happened yesterday.

533
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:00,686
It means...

534
00:37:02,106 --> 00:37:03,456
you can't remember...

535
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:06,086
we met two days ago

536
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:08,446
and what happened to you?

537
00:37:14,076 --> 00:37:15,226
What happened to me?

538
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:20,616
Nothing.

539
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:56,866
Someday I'll die for my work.

540
00:37:58,546 --> 00:38:00,456
P Mum. Have you eaten anything?

541
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:02,316
I'll find something for you.

542
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:20,376
P'Mum.

543
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:21,786
What are you doing?

544
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:25,136
Mo.

545
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:27,786
When I stay in the room, I'm so bored.

546
00:38:28,326 --> 00:38:29,816
Mo. Let's go out.

547
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:30,876
Here it is.

548
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:33,536
But...

549
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:37,196
Believe me.

550
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:38,696
Let's go.

551
00:38:45,936 --> 00:38:46,416
P'Mum.

552
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,366
Watch.

553
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:51,426
I told you there is nothing.

554
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:53,756
There is nothing to be afraid of.

555
00:38:56,826 --> 00:38:57,366
Hey!

556
00:38:57,846 --> 00:38:59,366
Is it the 22nd?

557
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:01,706
Yes.

558
00:39:07,216 --> 00:39:07,816
What do you want?

559
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:10,626
Nothing.

560
00:39:11,636 --> 00:39:12,196
Nothing.

561
00:39:13,326 --> 00:39:17,126
I'm just looking around to see

562
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:20,996
if there is anything that is not
the same as your world.

563
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:23,236
And...

564
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:25,536
Is there anything that is not in your world?

565
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:31,776
It's you.

566
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,546
There isn't Dew in my world.

567
00:39:59,546 --> 00:40:01,036
I want to go to your world.

568
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:04,206
Really?

569
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:05,606
Why?

570
00:40:08,246 --> 00:40:08,696
Eh!

571
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:11,416
It seems that you aren't afraid of anything.

572
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:14,956
Do you know...

573
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:17,656
When you open the door
and get out of my room,

574
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:19,866
I'm very scared.

575
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,066
Are you scared?

576
00:40:23,536 --> 00:40:24,146
What are you afraid of?

577
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:30,146
I'm afraid that you'll be missing.

578
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:34,036
You...

579
00:40:34,636 --> 00:40:35,476
are so brave.

580
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:43,636
You spend your life...

581
00:40:44,116 --> 00:40:45,706
as if there were no tomorrow.

582
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:50,386
What?

583
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:54,446
It's my sister's scolding.

584
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:57,176
When Dew speaks,

585
00:40:57,886 --> 00:40:59,146
I think of her speech.

586
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:07,956
Hey!

587
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:09,756
There it is.

588
00:41:17,286 --> 00:41:18,526
He's right.

589
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:25,366
How beautiful it is!

590
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:32,696
Since I was born,

591
00:41:33,596 --> 00:41:35,656
I haven't seen a meteor shower
so close before.

592
00:41:39,286 --> 00:41:40,476
Hey! Dew.

593
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:42,276
Hurry up and make a wish.

594
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:44,366
People said...

595
00:41:44,986 --> 00:41:46,546
if you make a wish
when you see the meteor shower,

596
00:41:46,866 --> 00:41:47,996
everything you wished for will come true.

597
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,056
Why?

598
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:58,346
Nothing.

599
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:02,786
Why are you looking at me?

600
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:05,056
So...

601
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:06,346
I'll make a wish.

602
00:42:26,886 --> 00:42:27,456
A few minutes ago,

603
00:42:28,406 --> 00:42:29,886
Mum is like a kind bear.

604
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:31,486
What?

605
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:45,676
P'Mum. What did you wish for?

606
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:49,106
I wish you were safe.

607
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,026
Why did you make a wish like that?

608
00:42:59,226 --> 00:42:59,906
Do you know...

609
00:43:00,726 --> 00:43:01,856
the first day we met,

610
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,586
Dew had already been shot dead.

611
00:43:07,746 --> 00:43:08,896
But the next day,

612
00:43:09,776 --> 00:43:10,676
I met you again.

613
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:13,486
And you were alive.

614
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:16,106
But there was some blood on your shirt.

615
00:43:18,606 --> 00:43:19,016
Dew.

616
00:43:19,816 --> 00:43:20,586
I'm asking you...

617
00:43:21,886 --> 00:43:23,966
Do you have any trouble with anyone?

618
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:29,746
Eh!

619
00:43:31,376 --> 00:43:32,176
In the next two days,

620
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:35,846
will I have to die, P'Mum?

621
00:43:38,126 --> 00:43:38,576
Hey!

622
00:43:39,776 --> 00:43:40,406
Dew.

623
00:43:41,126 --> 00:43:42,146
Wait!

624
00:43:42,836 --> 00:43:43,786
Don't cry.

625
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:49,336
It'll be okay.

626
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:56,776
I know.

627
00:43:57,376 --> 00:43:59,646
This story sounds strange.

628
00:44:01,436 --> 00:44:03,836
But the fact that
we met each other is weirder.

629
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:07,736
I have already given in.

630
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:10,686
I have already given in.

631
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:11,726
Wait! Wait!

632
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:14,386
Don't give in that easily.

633
00:44:16,706 --> 00:44:20,576
Maybe we met in a series of flashbacks.

634
00:44:21,756 --> 00:44:24,156
I may be led to your past continuously.

635
00:44:25,506 --> 00:44:26,586
You just need to tell me...

636
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,746
Whom do you have trouble with?

637
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,386
I may be able to change your destiny.

638
00:44:38,466 --> 00:44:39,636
Mum. Mum.

639
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:41,326
Why can't I contact him now?

640
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,316
Why didn't you tell me

641
00:44:43,446 --> 00:44:44,676
that P'Mum hasn't gotten well

642
00:44:45,656 --> 00:44:47,236
and that you couldn't contact him?

643
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:49,956
Mint. Please calm down.

644
00:44:50,346 --> 00:44:51,556
I think Mum is safe.

645
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:52,426
Now...

646
00:44:52,836 --> 00:44:54,046
We should drive to find Mum.

647
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:55,146
And...

648
00:44:55,716 --> 00:44:56,326
Yes.

649
00:44:56,756 --> 00:44:57,246
Let's go.

650
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:02,746
As you told me,

651
00:45:03,506 --> 00:45:05,696
Jake sucks a lot.

652
00:45:06,576 --> 00:45:08,466
He even cheated on
his own family's company.

653
00:45:09,996 --> 00:45:10,886
And that bad friend...

654
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,196
has pried into your business a lot.

655
00:45:14,016 --> 00:45:16,976
I do think you are in trouble.

656
00:45:17,866 --> 00:45:19,276
Calm down.

657
00:45:20,296 --> 00:45:21,006
I can't.

658
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:24,386
I think you have to fight back.

659
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:26,656
I'll fight back.

660
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:30,036
Let's go.

661
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:31,836
Let's say...

662
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:34,406
Those are your enemies.

663
00:45:35,676 --> 00:45:37,106
Okay. Scold them.

664
00:45:39,496 --> 00:45:40,376
I won't do it. P'Mum.

665
00:45:40,726 --> 00:45:42,216
I need you to scold them. Scold them.

666
00:45:48,886 --> 00:45:49,826
Have you checked there?

667
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:52,126
I told you he was sleeping there.

668
00:45:55,216 --> 00:45:57,016
Do you see that?
He's sleeping like a log.

669
00:46:11,366 --> 00:46:12,386
All of you are jerks.

670
00:46:13,566 --> 00:46:14,196
Hey!

671
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:15,876
Dew.

672
00:46:16,886 --> 00:46:18,496
Scold.

673
00:46:18,696 --> 00:46:19,786
I just scolded.

674
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:24,566
Dew.

675
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:26,066
Repeat after me.

676
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:26,936
Do you understand?

677
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:32,266
Go to hell, man!

678
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:35,526
Okay! Scold.

679
00:46:38,816 --> 00:46:39,916
Go to hell, man!

680
00:46:40,816 --> 00:46:41,346
Again, harder!

681
00:46:42,196 --> 00:46:43,266
What the heck!

682
00:46:43,506 --> 00:46:44,216
You.

683
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:48,376
Go away! Don't butt in on my life.

684
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:49,356
What the heck!

685
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:53,586
Okay! Like this.

686
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:57,796
But talk to that way.
Don't turn this way.

687
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:01,166
Good. Let's go.

688
00:47:02,126 --> 00:47:04,686
Crap! Go to hell.

689
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:05,876
You jerk!

690
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:08,016
Are you scolding me?

691
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:09,196
Go away!

692
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:11,986
Mint. He...

693
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:13,596
Is he scolding or talking in his sleep?

694
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:16,076
Are you scolding me?

695
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,996
Get lost! Don't butt in on my life anymore.

696
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:19,386
- Um!
- Mint!

697
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:21,136
Wait! Wait! Calm down.

698
00:47:21,856 --> 00:47:22,806
Calm down. Calm down.

699
00:47:23,856 --> 00:47:24,786
I think he's talking in his sleep.

700
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,496
Don't butt in on my life anymore.

701
00:47:26,926 --> 00:47:27,766
What the heck!

702
00:47:34,406 --> 00:47:36,776
I think we should come back later.

703
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:39,276
He'll scold until the next morning.

704
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:41,806
Let's go.

705
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:44,196
I'll talk to you next time.

706
00:47:44,266 --> 00:47:45,296
Calm down.

707
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,666
What the heck!

708
00:47:57,626 --> 00:47:59,406
Yes. Like this.

709
00:48:01,456 --> 00:48:02,126
How do you feel now?

710
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:03,666
Do you relieve a bit?

711
00:48:05,336 --> 00:48:07,846
I didn't think something like this
would make me so comfortable before.

712
00:48:08,476 --> 00:48:09,496
I have told you.

713
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:12,636
P'Mum.

714
00:48:15,966 --> 00:48:18,746
It's so late.
Who's yelling now?

715
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:24,196
Be careful!

716
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:26,716
It doesn't seem to me
that he's gonna find me, Dew.

717
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:29,746
Hey!

718
00:48:31,446 --> 00:48:32,086
Who are you?

719
00:48:43,606 --> 00:48:45,116
There is no one.

720
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:48,456
He can't see me.

721
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:51,126
P'Mum.

722
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,906
Ha! Ha!

723
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:14,816
Oh!

724
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:16,426
It's bad.

725
00:49:16,906 --> 00:49:18,086
I think a ghost's haunting me.

726
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:19,536
I'm sorry.

727
00:49:19,876 --> 00:49:21,726
I'm just on my duty.

728
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:23,286
You can take your time.

729
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:24,906
Oh!

730
00:49:30,486 --> 00:49:30,966
Dew.

731
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:32,706
Come out.

732
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:34,346
The security guard has gone.

733
00:49:34,626 --> 00:49:35,146
Hurry up!

734
00:49:37,876 --> 00:49:39,946
No one can see me in your world

735
00:49:39,996 --> 00:49:40,806
except you.

736
00:49:47,536 --> 00:49:48,256
P'Mum.

737
00:49:50,356 --> 00:49:52,256
P'Mum. Come down.
It's very dangerous.

738
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:55,156
It's okay.
It's not a big deal.

739
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:56,846
Please come down.

740
00:49:57,196 --> 00:49:58,966
I'll stand on it.

741
00:50:00,536 --> 00:50:01,216
Hey!

742
00:50:04,716 --> 00:50:05,526
P'Mum.

743
00:50:06,246 --> 00:50:07,096
P'Mum.

744
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:12,106
P'Mum.
