5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,650
The way we met each other

6
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,050
is quite strange.

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,670
But it was not something that...

8
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,700
that was not supposed to happen.

9
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,450
Please sell this room.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,080
Hello, Mint.

11
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,570
How's it going, Dew?

12
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,410
Did you finish packing?

13
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,430
Um...

14
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,880
So far so good.

15
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,240
I am packing things now.

16
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,390
How about you?

17
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,630
Have you finished your errand?

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,240
It's almost done.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,060
Mint.

20
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,820
So...

21
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,530
when you come back,

22
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,220
I will pick you up.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,930
I have something to talk to you about.

24
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,710
See you then.

26
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,160
(Episode 11.2
Wake Up)

27
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,580
- Hey.
- He is here.

28
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,150
P'Mum!

29
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,550
- Mum looks good from all angles.
- Bring it on!

30
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,820
Woo!

31
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,190
Table Five for six people.

32
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,930
How do you guys get here?

33
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,990
On foot, maybe.
From Bangkok to Khon-Kaen.

34
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,940
It was easy.

35
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,380
It is very close.

36
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,910
Are you kidding me?

37
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,850
Uh, how are you anyway?
Long time no see. How are you doing?

38
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,610
I am fine.

39
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,530
I just take it easy.

40
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,400
Is the pub closed today?

41
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,690
Because everyone is here.

42
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,870
It's out of business.

43
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,490
What?

44
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,390
Just kidding.

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,950
Since you stopped going to the pub

46
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,290
and singing to the women at the pub,

47
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,790
the customers came less and less.
Just look at P'Vee.

48
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,270
He looks very old now.

49
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,160
Come on!

50
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,690
What? He looks good.

51
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,210
Look, he is handsome.

52
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,250
Yes, P'Mum.

53
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,460
When you were not at the pub,

54
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,770
all the women

55
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,000
were asking for you.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,370
I think our pub's situation is terrible.

57
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,690
If we let it be like this,
it will be out of business for sure.

58
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,100
Do you mismanage it, Games?

59
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,190
Stop it,
or I will punch you in your mouth.

60
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,010
Yes.

61
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,370
Because I am stupid.

62
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,850
Oh, well... It's...

63
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,110
It's not that bad.

64
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,240
Yes, it's not that bad.

65
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,590
- Yes.
- What are you talking about?

66
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,520
You thought that up yourself.

67
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,790
Hey, Mum.

68
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,340
Have you ever

69
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,050
thought about coming back

70
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,840
and helping our pub
get out of this situation?

71
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,680
That's true.

72
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,660
I agree.

73
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,340
Don't think too much.

74
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,510
It has come so far.

75
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,640
It must be you.

76
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,210
We need you.

77
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,170
I almost sell this room.

78
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,940
I am so glad

79
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,150
that you came back.

80
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,120
Hey, you kept my room so tidy.

81
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,140
I did not do that.

82
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,870
It was Dew.

83
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,180
How is it?

84
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,760
It is so bland.

85
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,110
Before we sing the next song,

86
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,820
I want to have a soundcheck, everyone.

87
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,020
I want to hear you all in All This.

88
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,190
This is lovely.

89
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,680
Let's listen to the next song.

90
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,900
Once we announced on our page
that Mum would come back and sing,

91
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,540
our pub is packed.

92
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,640
This is so good.

93
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,590
You are laughing.

94
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,740
Are you laughing because of me?

95
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,350
Come on.

96
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,390
You're laughing
because you think I am so cute now.

97
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,570
You are narcissistic.

98
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,130
I am just happy.

99
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,500
Our pub is packed.

100
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,440
So, I don't have to look for a new job.

101
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,090
Ou, same as usual.

102
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,520
Here you go.

103
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,640
Okay. Thanks so much.

104
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,770
Hello, P'Mum.

105
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,240
Dew.

106
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,260
Did you come to see Mint?

107
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,390
No.

108
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,250
Mint already told me
that she wouldn't come here tonight.

109
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,800
I...

110
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,640
just want to get some drinks.

111
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,460
It's good.

112
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,650
Have a seat.

113
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,710
One Orange Sunset, please.

114
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,700
How are you, P'Mum?

115
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,980
I am good.

116
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,510
How about you?

117
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,780
Well,

118
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,760
I am a little bit busy.

119
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh.

120
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,200
With your company?

121
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,730
Yes.

122
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,190
What should I say to him?

123
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,320
Um...

124
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,150
Dew.

125
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,620
About...

126
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,940
the wedding.

127
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,850
I think

128
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,770
if you keep postponing it,

129
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,980
it will not do any good.

130
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,430
I...

131
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,370
I care about Mint's feelings.

132
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,710
P'Mum.

133
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,800
Well...

134
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,790
Mint and I...

135
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,910
We agreed to just be friends.

136
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,390
What?

137
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,780
You two are just friends now.

138
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,250
What do you mean?

139
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,110
Uh...

140
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,790
Well...

141
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,290
Dew.

142
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,010
Do you have something to tell me?

143
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,940
So, you called me.

144
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,430
What is wrong with you?

145
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,280
Mint.

146
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,440
I think...

147
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,160
What?

148
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,490
Can we be friends again?
Just like we were before.

149
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,350
I've already thought about it.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
I knew this day would come.

151
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,720
So, I am not so surprised.

152
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:11,820
Mint.

153
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,700
I am sorry.

154
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,860
I am the one
who should apologize to you.

155
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,920
It was me
who kept asking you to be my boyfriend.

156
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,250
Although, you actually

157
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,310
made it very clear to me.

158
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,830
However, I...

159
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,410
I agreed to be your boyfriend.

160
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,540
I've come so far.
I even proposed to you.

161
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,710
You should not feel guilty.

162
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,940
It is understandable.

163
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,010
You don't have to be afraid
that I would be humiliated.

164
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,280
Can we still be friends like before?

165
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,400
But I do understand you,

166
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,380
- if you hate...
- We can.

167
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,660
Whatever happens,

168
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,950
you are an important person in my life.

169
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,740
I won't let you go easily.

170
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,390
I have to go now.

171
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,020
So,

172
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,110
won't you be singing on stage tonight?

173
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,980
I already did.

174
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,660
It is a shame.

175
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,720
I came here to listen to your song.

176
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,540
Then,

177
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,730
I shall leave now.

178
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,110
I...

179
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,290
have something to do tomorrow morning.

180
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,480
Dew.

181
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,190
Drive home safely.

182
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,270
I came here by taxi.

183
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,130
At first,

184
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,630
I was afraid that I might get drunk
and could not drive back home.

185
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,620
Goodbye.

186
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,830
So,

187
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,330
you just let him go like this.

188
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,520
Yes, right.

189
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,900
Hey, what are you waiting for?

190
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,830
Just go now.

192
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,250
You can't just go home.

193
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,540
Come and stay inside then.

P'Mum.

200
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,520
Why do you bring it here?

201
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,560
I want to give it to you.

202
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,550
Oh.

203
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,270
Hey, Mint.

204
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,360
Yesterday,

205
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,830
Dew came to the pub.

206
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,750
Umm...

207
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,320
I knew that.

208
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,710
You knew about what happened
between me and Dew, right?

209
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,340
So, are you okay?

210
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,610
I have made up my mind a long time ago.

211
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,010
I think...

212
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,800
Dew and I...

213
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,020
We'd better be friends.

214
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,550
Why did you ask?

215
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,420
Mint.

216
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,160
Do you

217
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,690
remember the parallel world
that I once told you about?

218
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,620
About you and...

219
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,910
that boy

220
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,150
who appeared in your room, right?

221
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,260
That boy...

222
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,690
is Dew.

223
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,830
Why didn't you tell me
about that before?

224
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,850
Because you were so enthusiastic

225
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,270
about confessing your love to Dew
on his birthday.

226
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,940
What should I do?

227
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,360
So, you just acted like a hero.

228
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,640
Yes.

229
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,190
I was made for this role.

230
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,510
Thank you

231
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,310
for being honest and telling me this.

232
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,600
This time,

233
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,060
you don't have to do it for anyone.

234
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,810
You should do it for yourself.

235
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,100
Go!

236
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,190
Let's pursue Dew.

237
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,750
I failed on that,

238
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,970
so you should make it happen.

239
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,020
Mint.

240
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:34,940
Thanks.

241
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,780
Keep fighting!

242
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,080
Please come inside.

243
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,130
Hey, Dew.

244
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,900
P'Vee.

245
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,470
- Hello.
- Come in now.

246
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,640
Well,

247
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,920
I'm here to meet Mint.

248
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,670
Mint has already reserved a table.

249
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,190
But I haven't seen her yet.

250
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,140
Just come in and have a seat first.

251
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,080
All right.

252
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,630
Come in.

253
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,770
Thank you.

254
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,580
Just sit here.

255
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,730
Have you eaten yet?

256
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,770
Not yet.

257
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,620
Okay.

258
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,210
I will bring a menu for you.

259
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,830
Thank you.

260
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,080
Hey, Mum?

261
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,220
I will fetch a menu then.

262
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,620
Yes.

263
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,390
Here you go.

264
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,220
Thank you, P'Mum.

265
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,270
Haha.

266
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,970
Cheers.

267
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,970
The target is in position. Over.

268
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,920
Roger.

269
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,570
The food is ready. Over.

270
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,250
The food is ready, P'Dew.

271
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,020
Look!

272
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,270
They look so yummy.

273
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,550
The fish is big...

274
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,550
and spicy.

275
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,170
I haven't ordered the food yet.

276
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,110
P'Mint ordered them for you.

277
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,160
Oh...

278
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,810
Yes, that's right.

279
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,540
This is very delicious.

280
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,670
Thank you.

281
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,520
She is a good salesperson.

282
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,320
It's done. Next step.

283
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,190
Bring it on!

284
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,890
This pub.

285
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,020
There are many women coming to see him.

286
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,740
Mum.

287
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,470
It's time to go on stage and sing.

288
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,760
I will take over here.

289
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,950
All right.

290
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,470
It's time.

291
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,580
Don't worry about me.

292
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,630
Just listen to my song.

293
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,560
Baby boy.

294
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,080
Yes.

295
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,710
The target is in position.

296
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,640
Are you ready outside?

297
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,240
All done.

298
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,610
I am sorry, Dew.

299
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,660
I've got things to do, so I can't come.

300
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,450
♪Just you and me♪

301
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,590

Dew.

305
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:10,990
Yes?

306
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,520
Are you drunk?

307
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:15,900
Are you all right?

308
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,360
Yes, I am.

309
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,160
Your face is red now.

310
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:24,720
Hey,

311
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,680
did Mint send you a massage?

312
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
She's caught up with something.

313
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,140
Yes.

314
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,740
Mint sent a message to me.

315
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,490
Then...

316
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,540
Then I shall go home.

317
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,470
You are very good at singing.

318
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,790
Oh! Uh...

319
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,210
You are staggering.

320
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,360
Are you all right?

321
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,050
I am all right.

322
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,220
I don't think so.

323
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,460
Go!

324
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:29,969
Go!

325
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:33,219
Do you want me to drive you home?

326
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:36,449
It's all right, P'Mum.

327
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,509
Do you dislike me?

328
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,399
Of course not.

329
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:42,779
I don't dislike you.

330
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,109
But, well...

331
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:44,899
There is no but.

332
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:46,589
If you don't dislike me,

333
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:47,569
I will take you home.

334
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:49,279
Let's go.

335
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,479
Sorry.

336
00:24:59,079 --> 00:24:59,779
Thank you.

337
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:00,429
It's fine.

338
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:04,789
Are you okay?

339
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:05,619
Okay.

340
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:13,969
Here.

341
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,219
What?

342
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:21,379
Huh...

343
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:25,329
The tire has already been flat.

344
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:27,489
Oh,

345
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:28,449
it's all right.

346
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:29,439
So,

347
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:31,489
I will ask Ping to fix it.

348
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,249
You can come home with me.

349
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:34,569
Okay?

350
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:39,289
But...

351
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,839
Hey, it's all right.

352
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:52,179
Quick!

353
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:57,119
Okay?

354
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:57,989
Yes.

355
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:03,579
Why do you sit so far away?

356
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:04,609
Just move closer.

357
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:06,559
Yes.

358
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:08,169
A little bit closer.

359
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:12,839
Like this.

360
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:15,059
Here.

361
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:16,949
Okay?

362
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,369
Dew.

363
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:31,939
Yes?

364
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,589
Have you ever ridden a motorcycle?

365
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:36,839
What did you say?

366
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,169
I'm asking you.

367
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,349
Have you ever ridden a motorcycle?

368
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:45,299
No.

369
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:49,979
Are you afraid?

370
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:51,679
You sit too tight.

371
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:55,099
Just a little bit.

372
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,219
Don't be afraid.

373
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,189
You are safe with me.

374
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:01,249
Hold me tight.

375
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:10,369
Thank you for helping me with my car.

376
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:11,049
It's okay.

377
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:12,179
No problem at all.

378
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:15,529
And so,

379
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:17,779
how many people
have you asked to come here?

380
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:22,039
So...

381
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,839
there is

382
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:25,349
P'Mum.

383
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:28,659
P'Mum.

384
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:30,029
P'Mum.

385
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:31,399
P'Mum.

386
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:33,239
And P'Mum.

387
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,489
There are four Mums.

388
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,059
Wow,

389
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:39,339
there are too many,

390
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:40,639
too many P'Mums.

391
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:42,809
So we are not lonely.

392
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:48,719
So,

393
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:50,449
I saw you

394
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,819
running a clothing brand before.

395
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:53,989
Did you quit?

396
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:55,339
Well,

397
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:58,969
since I went back to work
at my father's company,

398
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:00,809
I don't have time for that anymore.

399
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,339
So, I stopped doing it.

400
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,149
You don't want to work
at your family's company, right?

401
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:06,609
Not at all.

402
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:07,949
I can do it.

403
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:12,599
But I miss my clothing designs.

404
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,659
Actually,

405
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:17,059
I was preparing
to launch my new collection.

406
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:21,059
You almost modeled
for my new clothing design once more.

407
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:22,329
Hey.

408
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:23,229
Really?

409
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:26,219
It's a shame

410
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:27,349
that I could not model for you.

411
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:29,839
But, once I can work more efficiently

412
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:32,279
at my father's company,

413
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:34,659
I will go back to work on
my clothing brand.

414
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:37,279
Then,

415
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:40,389
I'm waiting to wear your design again.

416
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:42,689
Does a guy like you

417
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,369
actually like my design?

418
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:47,599
I do like it.

419
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:52,359
Whatever comes from you,

420
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,279
I like all of them.

421
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:05,119
Do I make you feel nervous?

422
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:08,179
No.

423
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,289
I am just not used to it.

424
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:12,979
Not used to it.

425
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:15,299
What if

426
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:18,149
we meet each other more often?

427
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,289
So, you will get used to it.

428
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:21,379
Is that good?

429
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,669
We will eat together tomorrow.

430
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:42,229
(Have a good night, Baby boy.)
Have a good night, Baby boy.

431
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:06,869
I don't care

432
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:09,079
how people look at me.

433
00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:10,869
I just know that

434
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:12,509
I love you,

435
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:13,879
Baby boy.

436
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:29,979
Are you still awake?

437
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:35,549
Thank you.

438
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,539
How time flies, right?

439
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:52,399
In the blink of an eye,

440
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:54,479
you are a grown-up now.

441
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:01,149
Your father and I

442
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,659
are so proud of you.

443
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:13,949
Mom.

444
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:15,249
Hmm?

445
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,289
If I am not the person
that you once thought I am,

446
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:23,089
will you still love me?

447
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:25,859
What kind of person are you then?

448
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:32,189
The kind of person that

449
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,159
you may not be proud of.

450
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,569
I have never been not proud of you.

451
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:43,949
Then...

452
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:51,899
What if I like a boy?

453
00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:56,079
Will you regret it?

454
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,019
I do regret it.

455
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,159
I regret that you'd think that I won't
love you just because of this.

456
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:20,509
I do love you.

457
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:31,689
Mom...

458
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:40,869
Um...

459
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,069
Do you know

460
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:54,829
that the best we can do in our life
is to know who we are

461
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:56,759
and what we want?

462
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,249
The important thing is

463
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,149
we must be brave enough

464
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,849
to do whatever we want to,

465
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,929
or live whatever life you want to live.

466
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,959
You must have courage.

467
00:33:13,879 --> 00:33:14,689
Yes, Mom.

468
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:37,629
Sir.

469
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,279
Is your car broken?

470
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:42,909
Yes, yes.

471
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:44,409
I have called the repairman.

472
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,579
But they haven't come yet.

473
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:50,409
If you are in a hurry,

474
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,669
I can take you to your place.

475
00:33:58,299 --> 00:33:59,009
Is that so?

476
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,049
Thank you, son.

477
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,589
If it wasn't for you.
I wouldn't make it,

478
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:13,879
Don't worry, Uncle.

479
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:15,619
Papa.

480
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:17,039
Oh, Dew.

481
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:21,989
P'Mum!

482
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:25,099
Your Papa?

483
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:26,099
Oh!

484
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,199
Do you know each other?

485
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,149
What the heck!

486
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:31,899
It's Dew's Papa. I'm not kidding.

487
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:32,939
Yes...

488
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:33,979
I knew.

489
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,309
Have you met
your future father-in-law already?

490
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:38,329
Yeah, right.

491
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:40,599
But he met me in this style.

492
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:42,679
I don't know what he would say.

493
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:44,419
Hey, I don't think
he would say anything.

494
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:45,759
You look good.

495
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,769
What does looking good mean?

496
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,089
It just means looking good.

497
00:34:49,979 --> 00:34:51,929
But he did not say anything, right?

498
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:53,939
I think it's not a problem.

499
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:01,899
Hey...

500
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:03,629
Dew sent a text to me.

501
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:07,949
What?

502
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:09,449
What! What's happening?

503
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:11,979
Dew's father is asking me
to come and meet him.

504
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,139
What the heck!

505
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:18,469
Considered this a thank-you treat
for taking me to my company yesterday.

506
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:20,659
Actually, it was not a big deal, Sir.

507
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:22,829
Sir what?

508
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:25,399
No need to say anything.

509
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:26,179
Here.

510
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:27,549
Are you Mum?

511
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:30,289
Yes, I am.

512
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:34,529
This is such a small world.

513
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:36,169
That's right.

514
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:38,519
Well,

515
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:40,989
if you need anything or need any help,

516
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:41,979
you can just tell me.

517
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:50,779
Actually...

518
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:51,739
Tell me.

519
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,379
I like Dew.

520
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:57,749
P'Mum!

521
00:35:58,609 --> 00:35:59,629
What did you say?

522
00:36:00,209 --> 00:36:01,419
My son is a man.

523
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,069
How can you like my son?

524
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:03,629
You...

525
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:04,579
I am serious.

526
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:05,759
I am not joking at all.

527
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:09,289
P'Mum. Enough already.

528
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:11,929
Dew.

529
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,519
I will not do
whatever people expect me to.

530
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:17,549
I like you.

531
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:19,369
I've liked you for a long time.

532
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:21,599
But I don't...

533
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:24,129
Before you give me the answer,

534
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:27,219
you should ask your heart.

535
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:28,899
So you can be sure

536
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:31,209
if this is what you'll really choose.

537
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:35,149
What is this all about, Dew?

538
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:36,599
You...

539
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:39,649
You'd better listen
until Mum finishes what he wants to say.

540
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,069
Go on, Mum.

541
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:44,769
Yes.

542
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:47,559
Father,

543
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,449
I want you to give Dew a chance

544
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,029
to choose what he likes

545
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:53,959
and what he desires to do.

546
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:56,239
It's not only about me,

547
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:58,099
but also everything.

548
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:01,359
Can you let him choose his own path?

549
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:14,359
Life is ours, Dew.

550
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:18,999
P'Mum.

551
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:24,249
And then what?

552
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,309
He told me to get out.

553
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:36,009
So, we all were excited about nothing.

554
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:38,269
P'Mum, you are awesome,

555
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:39,589
because you dared to say.

556
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:41,329
This is not awesome at all.

557
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:42,789
I haven't eaten yet,

558
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:43,559
and he told me to get out.

559
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:49,859
Calm down, my friend.

560
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:51,339
You should have some confidence.

561
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:54,969
Dew's father and mother

562
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,689
are not mean persons.

563
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,479
You should do it next time.

564
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:02,949
It means you have to try again.

565
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:05,779
Well, we all get back to work.

566
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:06,449
Come on.

567
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:08,129
Let's work.

568
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:10,419
Dew?

569
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:24,129
Hello.

570
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:37,169
I don't think I will meet you here, too.

571
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:40,799
I help my brother here
when I have some free time.

572
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:42,889
So,

573
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:44,049
do you

574
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,069
want to eat something?

575
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,379
You can order the food for us.

576
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:50,459
And Papa...

577
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,549
Dew told us a lot

578
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,999
about what a good singer you are.

579
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:58,669
Yes.

580
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:03,179
So, I came to listen and see

581
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:04,999
if it is exaggerated.

582
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,219
But I...

583
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:11,759
won't go on stage until it's quite late.

584
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:12,579
Papa, Sir.

585
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,729
So, you want to ask me to go home first?

586
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:44,279
Hello.

587
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:52,269
Today...

588
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:54,189
Since

589
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:55,639
I have everyone with me here,

590
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,569
I want to take this opportunity

591
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:00,389
to speak to someone.

592
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:04,639
Someone who made me happy every time

593
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:07,899
when I was with him.

594
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:10,459
I just could not be myself every time,

595
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:12,789
when I was with him.

596
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,859
It is quite strange, isn't it?

597
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,949
The same person

598
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:21,759
could have our hearts fluttered

599
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:24,519
and make us happy.

600
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:27,699
Whatever this universe

601
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,439
would bring to us,

602
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:32,229
we...

603
00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:34,589
are still us.

604
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,609
We always have a choice.

605
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,179
And today,

606
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:46,569
I want to choose

607
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:50,159
to have him in my life

608
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:52,229
and let him be happy.

609
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,919
We will be fluttered together.

610
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:58,749
I don't know
what will happen in the future.

611
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:03,249
No one would know that.

612
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:10,949
But for now,

613
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:13,899
here,

614
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:16,629
at this moment,

615
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:21,199
I really want to tell him that

616
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:28,069
I love you, Dew.

00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:38,449
You can make your own choice.

635
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:41,309
As for whom you want to
give this bouquet to,

636
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,809
you have to choose for yourself.

637
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:51,949
Because this is your life.

638
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:10,589
When we walk out of the box

639
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:12,799
that other people and I
have thought about,

640
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,289
it is more difficult
than I initially thought.

641
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:21,159
But it also makes me realize that

642
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:22,359
whom

643
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,439
I should value

644
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,139
and who

645
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:31,589
is worthy of

646
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,469
taking this risk.

647
00:44:36,129 --> 00:44:37,879
Whatever will happen ahead of us,

648
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:41,579
it is not important, right?

649
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:46,189
Because at least,

650
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:50,079
it is what our hearts desire.

651
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:56,869

664
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:38,969
No one would come here anymore, right?

00:46:40,379 --> 00:46:41,209
Probably not.
