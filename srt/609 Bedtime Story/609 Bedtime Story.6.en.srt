5
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:40,766
Aun!

6
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:42,452
Are you cheating on her?

7
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:45,478
Are you drunk?

8
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,123
You can't drunk driving.

9
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:50,599
Don't prentend that you care for me.

10
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:51,718
I don't care for you.

11
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:53,749
I care people on the road.

12
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:55,192
You might cause an accident.

13
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:56,276
I said I am not drunk!

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,774
You wait here.

15
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:04,057
I will call Joey to come and pick you up.

16
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:06,903
Are you cheating on her? Just answer me!

17
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:08,752
Mint is just your toy, right?

18
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:10,373
So you can dump her anytime you want.

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,237
Huh?

20
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,449
Let go off me.

21
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,424
Let me go!

22
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:16,909
You just admit it.

23
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:18,259
You already have someone else.

24
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:20,411
I...

25
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:28,767
I am not dating anyone.

26
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:35,565
My father's company has some problem

27
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:37,318
that I have to work on it.

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,248
Work?

29
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:42,207
And you are too busy to find time
to call or see Mint?

30
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:43,712
Have you ever

31
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,692
woken in the morning
with too many works to do.

32
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:49,314
But at the end of the day,
you haven't finished even half of them.

33
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,854
My working time and your free time,

34
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:53,903
is not equal.

35
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:55,895
Everyone has something to do anyway.

36
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,355
This is just your excuse.

37
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:00,901
If we love someone enough,

38
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:04,553
we will always find time for her.

39
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,448
Why did you do that to her?

40
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,071
How did she see good things in you?

41
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:27,809
Okay.

42
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:29,334
I give up.

43
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:31,414
Mint is yours.

44
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:35,410
I will give you one last chance.

45
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:38,755
You must take care of her
better than this.

46
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:42,186
If you make her sad again,

47
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:44,252
or you do bad things to her,

48
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:45,359
or you have someone else.

49
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:47,519
This time,

50
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:48,971
I will kill you.

(Episode 6
The missing piece)

53
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:40,651
Mint,

54
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:42,630
where are you now?

55
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:45,703
I have been waiting for you
at the restaurant.

56
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:48,082
Come here quick!

57
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:07,840
Sir.

58
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:09,175
Sir.

59
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,354
Our restaurant will be closed soon.

60
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,148
What?

61
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:16,057
Huh?

62
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,736
Bring me one more bottle of wine.

63
00:05:18,926 --> 00:05:19,477
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:33,503
How come you look so horrible?

65
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:36,707
I told you I was busy at work.
You don't have to wait for me.

66
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:40,942
Hey, are you all right?
Is everything okay?

67
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:42,769
What's wrong with you?

68
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,766
I am okay.

69
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,286
You are the one who is not okay.

70
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:49,621
I am okay.

71
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:51,499
Okay.

72
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,659
If you are okay, why did you post
that kind of meassage?

73
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:57,619
Don't assume anything.

74
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,067
My message was random.

75
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:01,553
It did not mean anything.

76
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:04,634
You...

77
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:06,625
Did you go

78
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:09,180
pestering Dew again?

79
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,098
Dew treated you so bad,

80
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:13,504
why do you still care for him?

81
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:15,087
Aun!

82
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,410
Hey, are you blind?

83
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:18,642
Can't you see where are you going?

84
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:20,714
Watch your mouth!

85
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:23,737
You bumped me first but you blamed me.

86
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:26,483
Are you messing up with me?

87
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:29,050
Stop barking!

88
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:30,357
You stop barking.

89
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,190
Hey, calm down.

90
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,159
I apologize for him.

91
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,447
No need to apologize.

92
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,556
I didn't do anything wrong. Why apologize?

93
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:40,745
You schmuck!

94
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,248
Your girl took the blame for you.

95
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:45,936
What did you say?

96
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,024
Hey, Aun!

97
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:50,044
Say again, you schmuck!

98
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:52,306
Did you say I'm schmuck!

99
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:54,507
Calm down.

100
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:57,287
You don't want to do this.

101
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,266
Let it go.

102
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:10,450
Give me your gun.

103
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,177
Hello? What's up?

104
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:36,120
What?

105
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:37,786
Aun tried to shoot a stranger?

106
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:40,540
Sne me a location, I will go now.

107
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:49,586
Please tell the owner
that I am sorry about this.

108
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,063
Everything is clear now.

109
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,972
Okay, I will

110
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:53,880
inform him about this.

111
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,058
I am sorry again.

112
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:55,654
Okay.

113
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:56,917
All right.

114
00:08:05,282 --> 00:08:05,663
You,

115
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:07,320
don't be mad at him.

116
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,453
Whatever he did,

117
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:09,816
it was because he cared about you.

118
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:11,575
You...

119
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:13,778
I think Aun

120
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,188
needs to seek help from psychologist.

121
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:18,393
I am not saying that he is lunatic.

122
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:20,768
I just think he needs psychologist.

123
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:23,428
It's not that bad.

124
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:26,441
He almost killed someone.

125
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,747
I will talk to him.

126
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,528
You''d better take him to your home.

127
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:39,999
His parents should not see him
in this state.

128
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,867
You are very strong.

129
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:46,597
You keep helping people.

130
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:48,185
But once it comes to Dew,

131
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,132
you just don't do anything.

132
00:08:59,272 --> 00:08:59,756
Mint,

133
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,312
may I ask you this?

134
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,666
You are too good to him.

135
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:06,423
But has he ever

136
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,050
done good things for you

137
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:10,305
as you did to him?

138
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,560
（Joey）

139
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,040
（Dew）

140
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,412
You just admit it.

141
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,523
You already have someone else.

142
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:02,316
P'Mum doesn't come here today.

143
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,048
Is he in trouble?

144
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:18,640
Does Aun come to bother you today?

145
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,335
Are you okay?

146
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:21,860
If you need anything, just call me.

147
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,479
When I was in your age,

148
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:27,908
your grandfather

149
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:30,037
asked me

150
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:31,701
to meet our clients.

151
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,760
I went to Macau, Hong Kong...

152
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:34,605
Malaysia.

153
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:36,327
I was very exciting at first.

154
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:37,315
I was afarid I couldn't do that.

155
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:40,038
I was not good in English at that time.

156
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,204
How did you do?

157
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,355
I just

158
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,201
did whatever I could.

159
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,378
Because I knew that some day,

160
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:48,435
I would be

161
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,039
the chairman of our company.

162
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:52,763
You are too, Dew.

163
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,335
You must persist and patient.

164
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,053
You have to prove that

165
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:58,144
you can do it.

166
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:00,511
Yes, Papa.

167
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,748
I will try my best.

168
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:04,093
Papa always push forward you,

169
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,028
I told him that you can do it.

170
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:08,729
You would never disappoint us.

171
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,083
But Papa still complains
that he is worried about you.

172
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:13,720
Well,

173
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,903
I was not worried that much.

174
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:24,128
And about your girlfriend,

175
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:25,763
you must be careful.

176
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:27,276
You are now an executive,

177
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:29,568
you must choose a good girl.

178
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:30,553
Someone who is clever

179
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,160
and can support your work.

180
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,961
Yes, Papa.

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,246
Blow the candles.

187
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:12,886
All right.

188
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:15,361
I will take care of it, Noon.

189
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:16,759
Okay.

190
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:17,876
Bye.

191
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:23,912
Do you still have to work
on your birthday's party?

192
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:26,234
It's done now.

193
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:27,719
Thanks.

194
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:39,576
Dew.

195
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:43,678
Can we give it a try?

196
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:47,688
Why did you talk about this again?

197
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,223
How many glasses have you drank?

198
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:51,930
I am serious.

199
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:54,822
I know what I am talking about.

200
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,243
I tried dating someone else,

201
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,791
it did not work.

202
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:04,449
For me

203
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:08,317
the only guy that I want
dating with is you.

204
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:15,457
But...

205
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:17,510
You are not dating someone, right?

206
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:22,133
That's true.

207
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:24,950
Then...

208
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:27,087
can you give it a try?

209
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,352
It's all up to you.

210
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:32,193
I have no expectation.

211
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,342
No expectation, really?

212
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:39,621
It's all up to you.

213
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:43,624
So...

214
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,022
we will give it a try.

215
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:56,579
Dew, place your glass on the table.

216
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,243
It's true now.

217
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:12,767
Our decision

218
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,481
always determines our path.

219
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,044
I should not let this happened.

220
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:19,358
Mint is always good to me.

221
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:21,597
I admit

222
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:23,453
that I like her a lot.

223
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:26,252
But there is no passion.

224
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:31,979
What's worse...

225
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,563
Since you have come into my life,

226
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:41,121
my true feeling

227
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:43,504
is...

228
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:53,940
Hi.

229
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:54,611
Baby boy.

230
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:57,214
I thought I wouldn't seen you anymore.

231
00:16:58,892 --> 00:16:59,364
Wait!

232
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:01,525
Who are you?

233
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,382
How come you get into this room?

234
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,076
Do we still have chance to meet again?

235
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:16,078

(Dew
Who killed Dew?)

241
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:08,303
He is so hyped.

242
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:13,234
He is so hyper today.

243
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:14,256
You are a hyper one.

244
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:16,574
I think he looks strange.

245
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:17,977
Like, he tries to run away from something.

246
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:18,818
Run away from people?

247
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:20,286
Run away from you.

248
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,881
Hey.

249
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,920
Your show was so cool.

250
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:29,244
Really?

251
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,333
Yes, it was so good.

252
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:33,060
Why?

253
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:34,761
Don't you believe me?

254
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:38,280
I believe you, then.

255
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:41,066
How is it?

256
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:42,915
Vee's new condo.

257
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:44,779
It's good.

258
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:46,386
But I think it won't work.

259
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:48,297
It won't work?

260
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:49,541
- Umm...
- Why?

261
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:50,996
Is the room bad?

262
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:52,992
Or the environmental is bad?

263
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,125
I mean it won't work

264
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:57,787
when you try to run away.

265
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,522
If Vee chooses to run away everytime

266
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:01,746
that guy comes back to him.

267
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,537
I think... it won't work, right?

268
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:08,732
Perhaps,

269
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:11,492
when you choose
not to confront the problem,

270
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,504
it might be a good solution.

271
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:17,249
I do understand Vee.

272
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:18,400
Really?

273
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,582
But I think...

274
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:22,210
I want him

275
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:24,305
sort out this problem

276
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:27,234
by confronting the truth.

277
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:33,860
Well,

278
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,243
it's time for my second round.

279
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:36,922
I will go preapre.

280
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:39,262
All right.

281
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:39,811
Talk later.

282
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:44,617
Vee,

283
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,029
do you see Ping?

284
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:47,091
What?

285
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,485
He is not with you?

286
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:51,067
It's almost showtime,
I am going to get him.

287
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:53,910
He might be hanging nearby.

288
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:55,937
I will check the restroom.

289
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:57,211
Okay, just go.

290
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:58,203
Give me more time.

291
00:19:58,336 --> 00:19:58,843
Go!

292
00:19:58,843 --> 00:19:59,242
Okay.

293
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:07,403
Ping!

294
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:10,628
Ton!

295
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:11,019
What?

296
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:12,707
Did you see Ping?

297
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:15,408
Oh, sorry. I am very busy
so I don't see him.

298
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:17,253
Perhaps he went to the back alley.

299
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:17,922
Really?

300
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:19,233
You go and look for him there.

301
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,665
All right, thanks.

302
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:22,662
Hey, you are good.

303
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,723
You stop seeing that boy for days now.

304
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,720
Nice!

305
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:36,790
Wait!

306
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,081
Why did you ask me to eat with you?

307
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:41,562
Why?

308
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:43,534
Can't I eat from your bowl?

309
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,504
It's mine.

310
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:45,258
All right.

311
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:48,279
Then you give me back
my money that you borrowed.

312
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:50,707
So, I won't eat with you.

313
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:52,359
Oh...

314
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:55,239
Well,

315
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:57,547
I still have more noodles in my bowl.

316
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:00,065
We can share.

317
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:03,624
You quickly changed your mind.

318
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:06,757
P'Mum, have you eaten yet?

319
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:15,713
Only you

320
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,313
who eat with me in my room,

321
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:19,119
on this table.

322
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:23,470
Only 5 minutes.

323
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:25,885
No, it's 5 minutes.

324
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:28,854
For me, it worths everything.

325
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:31,412
It's 5 minutes.

326
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:36,879
P'Mum!

327
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:38,997
Wait, P'Mum!

328
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,668
P'Mum!

329
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:45,151
What?

330
00:21:45,943 --> 00:21:47,286
Oh, no. Mum!

331
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:49,602
Mum!

332
00:21:50,218 --> 00:21:50,561
Mum!

333
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,773
Where are you going?

334
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:52,898
He went outside?

335
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:53,534
I am sorry, Games.

336
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:54,318
I have to go.

337
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:55,283
Don't go.

338
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:57,509
I posted on facebook page
that you will sing tonight.

339
00:21:57,729 --> 00:21:58,107
Games,

340
00:21:58,794 --> 00:22:00,713
can you stop youself
once you fall in love?

341
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:03,652
What are you talking about?

342
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:05,623
I think

343
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,281
I know where my heart is.

344
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:08,409
I have to go.

345
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:09,002
Okay.

346
00:22:15,724 --> 00:22:16,989
Mum, drive carefully.

347
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,932
Games, where is he going?

348
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:23,583
He just

349
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:26,070
wants to follow his heart.

350
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,320
(Mum's world)

351
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,960
(Dew's world)

352
00:23:11,197 --> 00:23:12,204
Mint is just your toy, right?

353
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:13,760
So you can dump her anytime you want.

354
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:35,997
Hello, Dew.

355
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:38,822
Dew.

356
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:41,714
Hello?

357
00:23:41,932 --> 00:23:42,540
Dew.

358
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:44,874
Dew.

359
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:02,376
Dew.

360
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:05,266
Hello?

361
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,096
Dew.

362
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:08,426
Dew.

363
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:17,356
P'Mum!

364
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:20,406
Dew.

365
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:21,306
Dew.

366
00:24:34,356 --> 00:24:35,556
I thought I would never see you again.

367
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:47,816
I can't fool myself anymore.

368
00:24:50,186 --> 00:24:50,936
I love you, Dew.

369
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:53,676
P'Mum.

370
00:24:56,446 --> 00:24:57,306
Do you love me?

371
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:02,046
I...

372
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:04,496
It's okay, Dew.

373
00:25:05,616 --> 00:25:06,096
I know

374
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,086
this is hard to accept.

375
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,926
But now...

376
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,386
I can tell you how I feel,

377
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:14,206
and that is enough.

378
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:18,936
I...

379
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,126
I love you too, P'Mum.

380
00:25:28,646 --> 00:25:29,316
Dew.

381
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:34,836
This is wonderful.

382
00:25:35,756 --> 00:25:36,566
My feeling now...

383
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,136
Thank you.

384
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:39,756
Thanks.

385
00:25:41,026 --> 00:25:41,566
Dew.

386
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:46,186
Okay.

387
00:25:56,116 --> 00:25:56,896
I am sorry

388
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:59,006
that I've disappeared for many days.

389
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:02,096
I was stupid.

390
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:04,376
It won't happen again, Dew.

391
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:06,986
I won't do that ever again.

392
00:26:08,006 --> 00:26:08,676
I promise.

393
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,356
Oh.

394
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:54,296
Pour the wine now.

395
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:54,996
Ready.

396
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:56,696
Slowly, please.

397
00:26:57,976 --> 00:26:58,516
Another one.

398
00:27:04,546 --> 00:27:05,126
To P'Mum.

399
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:05,736
Yes.

400
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:07,866
So...

401
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:08,946
Cheers.

402
00:27:18,256 --> 00:27:19,956
I want to drink it in another way.

403
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,076
Oh, you have to do that.

404
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:44,036
You are useless.

405
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:45,416
It has to be me again.

406
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,066
Okay.

407
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:48,356
A bit higher.

408
00:27:49,606 --> 00:27:50,726
I can't reach it.

409
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:52,096
What should we do?

410
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:53,866
All right.

411
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:54,796
Hold it for me.

412
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:56,906
I will lift you.

413
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:57,696
One, two, three.

414
00:27:57,696 --> 00:27:58,476
Okay!

415
00:28:00,716 --> 00:28:01,726
- Wait!
- Can you do that?

416
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:04,806
Okay.

417
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:05,886
It's been hung up now.

418
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:11,916
That ingrown nail.

419
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:28,336
Pong,

420
00:28:30,496 --> 00:28:31,226
are you hungry?

421
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:37,036
Do you want to eat?

422
00:28:42,396 --> 00:28:43,216
Or, you are not hungry.

423
00:28:49,766 --> 00:28:50,996
Can you talk to the fish?

424
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:53,406
Yes, I can.

425
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:54,436
I talk to him every day.

426
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:57,396
I've never heard

427
00:28:57,526 --> 00:28:58,886
that fish can eat rice.

428
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:00,606
Oh!

429
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:01,786
Oh, you mean fish food.

430
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,296
Yes, it is.

431
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:09,016
He eats a lot.
You've taken good care of him.

432
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:24,266
A purple lily.

433
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:26,426
This is special.

434
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:28,126
Normally,

435
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:30,016
we don't see a purple lily often.

436
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:31,566
Do you like it?

437
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:33,936
Yes.

438
00:29:34,716 --> 00:29:35,546
This is my favorite flower.

439
00:29:38,706 --> 00:29:39,556
You like it

440
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:41,436
because someone gave it to you, right?

441
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:44,666
Yes.

442
00:29:50,036 --> 00:29:50,506
Well,

443
00:29:51,676 --> 00:29:53,036
I bought it for myself.

444
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:56,906
Really?

445
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,476
Yeah.

446
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:06,896
So,

447
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:08,866
does it mean something?

448
00:30:09,456 --> 00:30:09,946
This flower?

449
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:13,136
It means success.

450
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,696
Uniqueness.

451
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:19,116
It also means honesty.

452
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:23,416
I like...

453
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:25,546
You mean the flower?

454
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:27,816
Both you

455
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:28,926
and the flower.

456
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:36,626
P'Mum.

457
00:30:37,466 --> 00:30:38,166
- Come on.
- Enough.

458
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:39,736
Enough.

459
00:30:42,356 --> 00:30:43,616
I just want to hold you.

460
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:55,596
I don't want to wake up.

461
00:30:56,656 --> 00:30:57,106
I want

462
00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:58,996
to stay like this forever.

463
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:02,836
Me too.

464
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:05,096
Do you know that

465
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:07,586
even though it's just one hour
that we spend together,

466
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:10,076
it still means a great deal to me?

467
00:31:12,796 --> 00:31:14,076
I know.

468
00:31:14,646 --> 00:31:15,336
Me too.

469
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:22,096
Do you know

470
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:24,766
what do I regret the most?

471
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:28,966
I regret

472
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:32,066
that I can't bring my guitar with me.

473
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:34,726
Why is that?

474
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:38,026
Why do you think I want my guitar?

475
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:39,276
Silly boy.

476
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:43,586
Enough, please.

477
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:45,136
My hair is messy now.

478
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:47,026
Your hair is so soft.

479
00:31:56,136 --> 00:31:56,746
Dew...

480
00:31:58,506 --> 00:31:58,986
I...

481
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:01,996
May I have another round?

482
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:05,196
It's enough.

483
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:06,976
It's time for you to go back.

484
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:10,726
Well,

485
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:13,506
I want to look into your eyes

486
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:15,396
until my time is up.

487
00:32:58,906 --> 00:32:59,396
Mint.

488
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,666
Are you okay, Dew?

489
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:09,736
You suddenly hung up on me.

490
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:13,106
My battery died.

491
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:16,166
That's a relief.

492
00:33:17,466 --> 00:33:18,426
I thought there was
something wrong with you.

493
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:20,326
Well,

494
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,016
how did you come into this building?

495
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:24,246
I have this.

496
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,026
A spare key card.

497
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:27,636
You gave it to me.

498
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:29,986
That's right.

499
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:32,866
Thank you for coming.

500
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:35,266
I think it's quite late,

501
00:33:35,886 --> 00:33:37,016
and you should go home.

502
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:55,116
Did someone come to visit you?

503
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:05,496
Normally, you don't let anyone
come into your room.

504
00:34:06,526 --> 00:34:08,066
Even though I have your key card,

505
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:10,746
I rarely visit you.

506
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:14,306
It's not that.

507
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:18,006
Aun and Joey came another day.

508
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,206
You also knew it.

509
00:34:20,086 --> 00:34:20,886
How about today?

510
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,036
Who came here?

511
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:26,986
It's just my staff.

512
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:28,756
Well,

513
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:30,966
I asked them to come here for a meeting.

514
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:32,756
They just went home.

515
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:34,846
I think

516
00:34:35,816 --> 00:34:36,986
this is quite late.

517
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:38,856
It's dangerous when you drive
when you're sleepy.

518
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:43,516
Are you seeing someone else?

519
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:47,996
I am not seeing anyone.

520
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,826
Don't think too much.

521
00:34:50,366 --> 00:34:51,396
Don't think too much?

522
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:54,006
I am sorry

523
00:34:54,356 --> 00:34:56,176
that I didn't get in touch with you
before you misunderstood.

524
00:34:57,476 --> 00:34:57,976
Well,

525
00:34:58,526 --> 00:35:00,126
I am under a lot of pressure
with my work.

526
00:35:00,686 --> 00:35:01,956
And what I am doing right now

527
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:03,146
is very risky.

528
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:05,336
I don't want you
to take the risk with me.

529
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:09,716
If the risk is so high,
then I should know.

530
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,486
I might help you.

531
00:35:14,776 --> 00:35:16,066
Just tell me.

532
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:20,686
Unless this is not about work.

533
00:35:22,176 --> 00:35:22,716
Mint.

534
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:27,586
What kind of person exactly
do you think I am?

535
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,716
Do you still love me?

536
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:39,096
If you are seeing someone else,

537
00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:40,806
you can tell me now.

538
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:43,556
I can accept it.

539
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:48,006
Just don't lie to me.

540
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:06,096
Do you have only one staff?

541
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:19,456
What does it mean?

542
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:20,856
Mint.

543
00:36:21,586 --> 00:36:22,596
Calm down.

544
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:25,176
You want me to calm down?

545
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,156
Are you seeing someone else?

546
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:29,546
Tell me.

547
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,456
Please go back.

548
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,336
We'll talk about it when you are calm.

549
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:35,586
I won't go.

550
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:38,256
I need the truth.

551
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:42,646
Mint.

552
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:44,916
Tell me now.

553
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:47,396
Are you seeing someone else?

554
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:47,786
Mint!

555
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:49,206
Keep your voice down.

556
00:36:49,406 --> 00:36:50,426
You might bother the neighbors.

557
00:36:51,236 --> 00:36:52,336
Just tell me.

558
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:53,986
You're really seeing someone else,
aren't you?

559
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:54,856
Tell me!

560
00:36:54,856 --> 00:36:55,316
Mint!

561
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:56,566
Stop it!

562
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:06,676
Hey, Mint.

563
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,006
Leave it to me.

564
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:08,926
It's heavy.

565
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:15,166
I can do it.

566
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:21,376
Dew,

567
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:26,526
did you move out like this

568
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:29,016
to live with someone else?

569
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:30,346
Hey...

570
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:31,466
You are too dramatic.

571
00:37:31,756 --> 00:37:32,496
I have no one else.

572
00:37:33,246 --> 00:37:35,376
I thought this place is near my office.

573
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:37,826
I don't want to wake up too early.

574
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:39,456
Besides,

575
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:41,086
I don't want to live with my Papa.

576
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:43,096
Are you sure
that these are the only reasons?

577
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:44,456
Why?

578
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:45,776
Don't you trust me?

579
00:37:46,796 --> 00:37:47,416
Nothing.

580
00:37:48,486 --> 00:37:50,206
Normally, I am not a jealous type.

581
00:37:51,826 --> 00:37:52,726
What if this is not normal?

582
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:53,996
Well,

583
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:55,216
I don't feel a thing.

584
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:00,616
Mint.

585
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:02,536
Give me your hand.

586
00:38:20,136 --> 00:38:21,156
This is my room's key card.

587
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:23,186
So, you can feel at ease.

588
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:32,006
I am happy now.

589
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:35,476
Dew.

590
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,996
If you want to end our relationship,

591
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:41,246
just be honest and tell me.

592
00:38:42,776 --> 00:38:44,056
I don't want to hear it
from someone else.

593
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:45,996
Can you promise me that?

594
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:49,496
Yes.

595
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:51,066
This is not a big deal.

596
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:55,266
In the past,

597
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:57,816
I didn't think much about love.

598
00:38:59,596 --> 00:39:00,596
So, I didn't open my heart.

599
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:04,256
But once I gave you my promise

600
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:05,676
and a chance,

601
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:07,626
I won't cheat on you.

602
00:39:10,496 --> 00:39:11,166
Thank you.

603
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:17,156
Let's unpack your stuff.

604
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:43,296
Come and sleep on the bed.

605
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:44,206
I am okay.

606
00:40:49,056 --> 00:40:49,916
You are so heavy.

607
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:50,886
Mint,

608
00:40:51,846 --> 00:40:52,736
where are you?

609
00:40:54,906 --> 00:40:55,646
Mint?

610
00:40:57,806 --> 00:40:58,416
Where are you?

611
00:41:01,146 --> 00:41:01,836
Where is Mint?

612
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:06,746
You've drunk too much.

613
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:35,936
Where is it?

614
00:41:40,516 --> 00:41:43,996
(Joey's calling)

615
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:07,206
It's the 17th,

616
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:08,366
November.

617
00:42:10,076 --> 00:42:12,376
I thought I might not see you again.

618
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:15,366
P'Mum,

619
00:42:17,846 --> 00:42:18,586
I admit

620
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:21,306
that I was very happy tonight.

621
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:27,626
However, after I came back
to my old world,

622
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:29,686
I feel terrible.

623
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:33,326
Because I dare not tell Mint

624
00:42:35,646 --> 00:42:36,556
that I...

625
00:42:38,296 --> 00:42:40,446
I am not the person that
she wants me to be.
