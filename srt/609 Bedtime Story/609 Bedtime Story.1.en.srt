(Don't Think Twice
It's All Right)

2
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:52,736
I used to wonder
whether you could be the one to decide

3
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:55,480
what the world would bring you.

4
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:07,173
I did whatever I pleased.

5
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:22,909
It was quite strange.

6
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:26,531
When I met someone,

7
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:32,800
I was totally changed.

8
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,866
I'm not that guy who did not
believe in anything anymore.

9
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:57,536
That special someone dragged me

10
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,570
out of my dark and gloomy world

11
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:02,121
and brought me to this beautiful world.

12
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:04,618
More importantly,

13
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,779
he taught me how to understand love.

14
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:12,376
He changed my whole world

15
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,927
and brought me to the parallel world.

16
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,683
(The Beginning of
the Parallel World)

19
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,225
Are you Nong Mo?

20
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,771
Okay.
The reserved table is there.

21
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:43,281
Follow me.

22
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:44,824
Please sit.

23
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,461
The waiter will take
your order very soon.

24
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:54,703
Would you like to order more?

25
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:05,540
Oh!

26
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:06,635
Games! Where is Mum?

27
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,136
It's almost showtime.

28
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:11,519
What if Mum does not show up?

29
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,387
Our pub is packed with customers.
They would be furious.

30
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:16,392
Oh, calm down, Mr. Manager.

31
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:20,110
Mum is always like that.

32
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:21,486
He will show up on time.

33
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:23,603
Just trust him.

34
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:25,243
I know you are his friend.

35
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:27,870
But you can't spoil him like this.

36
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:29,539
Come on, P'Vee.

37
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,916
When it's showtime,
Mum will be on stage.

38
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:33,874
I'm sure.

39
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,465
He acts more like the real boss!

40
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:54,877
Are you sure?

41
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:56,432
Your boyfriend will be okay with this?

42
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,281
Today,

43
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,176
I am available.

44
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:13,621
Did you see Mum?

45
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,113
Not at all.

46
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:33,890
How is it going?

47
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:34,819
Did you find him?
Ping, Nook?

48
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:36,144
I didn't find him.

49
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,138
I am sure he is in the pub.

50
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:39,957
You two try to find him again.

51
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:43,443
Wait!

52
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:45,943
Don't tell me

53
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:47,127
you can't find Mum anywhere.

54
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,550
No...

55
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:51,181
I found him.

56
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:52,542
I just told Ping

57
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,403
to prepare the songs
requested by customers.

58
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,541
It's okay.

59
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:57,697
P'Games!

60
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,463
What's up, Nook?

61
00:04:58,494 --> 00:04:59,533
At the back of the pub.

62
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:00,493
Did you find Mum?

63
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:03,092
No, we have a problem.
Go now!

64
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:06,851
Why did you hook up with him?

65
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:08,414
You know I hate him.

66
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:09,420
We have broken up.

67
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,501
It's none of your business.

68
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:11,863
You idiot!

69
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:13,420
I didn't break up with you.

70
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,343
Who told you?

71
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,464
Come here.

72
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:17,484
- Come with me.
- Let go of me.

73
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,985
I won't come with you.

74
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:21,110
Let go of me.

75
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,027
You jerk!

76
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:24,700
- Ouch!
- Please, stop... stop.

77
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:26,729
Calm down. No need to use violence.

78
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:28,615
Please.

79
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,332
Don't beat her.

80
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,523
Who the heck are you?

81
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,488
P'Vee.

82
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:35,235
How dare you punch him!

83
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,418
Ah!

84
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:38,716
Games!

85
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,684
I'm okay.

86
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,127
Come on.

87
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:45,033
Get this!

88
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,426
What the heck!

89
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:48,787
Come on!

90
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:52,124
Stand back.

91
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,406
P'Vee, calm down.

92
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,386
Come on!

93
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,316
Calm down.

94
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:56,449
Come on!

95
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:57,697
You!

96
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:58,911
Let's go!

97
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:01,822
Hey!

98
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:02,683
- Get out of the way.
- What the hell?

99
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:04,316
Come here.

100
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:05,392
- Stand back.
- Calm down.

101
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:07,524
Things are out of control now.

102
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:09,485
- Get Mum, quick!
- Okay.

103
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,060
P'Mum, we got a problem!

104
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:27,953
P'Mum! Stop that thing now!

105
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,220
What is it, Nook?

106
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:33,485
Someone is beating up
P'Games and P'Vee.

107
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:36,612
Come out now.

108
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:38,879
Hurry!

109
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:49,916
Did you beat up my friends?

110
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:07,911
Watch out!

111
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:25,105
Mum!

112
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:25,705
Let me go!

113
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,564
Come on!

114
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:25,633
Are you all right?

115
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:28,949
I am all right.

116
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:31,293
Thank you, P'Mum.

117
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:33,742
Okay.

118
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:46,400
Thank you

119
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,692
for what happened back there...

120
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,421
I know you are bold.

121
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,211
But next time,

122
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:11,580
ask me before doing such things.

123
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:13,102
You should know

124
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:14,296
I am worried about you.

The reservation is full.

136
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:21,096
Woo!

137
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,352
It's been fully booked
to the next two weeks.

138
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:24,626
Wow!

139
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:26,131
Really.

140
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:26,921
Hmm.

141
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:29,399
- Let me see.
- Come and have a look.

142
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,933
Do you see that?

143
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:34,002
People are lining up
to reserve a table here.

144
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,353
Hmm. I know.

145
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:48,572
I forgot.

146
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:02,091
Oh!

147
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:03,400
Mum!

148
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:04,399
Mum!

149
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:06,523
Mum! I said we should have a meeting.

150
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:08,595
You go. I have other things to do.

151
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:09,969
What things?

152
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:11,626
Mum!

153
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:13,710
Mum! You jerk!

154
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:16,011
You're doing this again!

155
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,427
Your things are all about love.
That's it.

156
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:29,182
Hello?

157
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,896
Are you awake?

158
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,182
Why are you calling so early?

159
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,652
This is not early.

160
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,602
It's late.

161
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,800
P'Mum, are you happy?

162
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:41,966
Do you need it one more time?

163
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:44,719
Whose voice is that?

164
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,250
Don't tell me
you got laid again.

165
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:51,376
Who is it now?

166
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,106
Are you dating her?

167
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:57,160
You always pick up random girls.

168
00:12:58,106 --> 00:12:59,932
There is no one.

169
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:01,622
Tone down your voice, Mint.

170
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:03,272
Is she your wife?

171
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:06,147
You said you are not in a relationship.

172
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,173
She's not my wife.

173
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:11,522
She's my Mom.

174
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,270
I am not your Mom.

175
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:14,537
Who is she?

176
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:16,386
P'Mum!

177
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,069
P'Mum!

178
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:21,859
P'Mum!

179
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,667
P'Mum! Jerk!

180
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,493
Mum, you are useless.

181
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,369
You can fight with everyone,

182
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,004
but you can't win your sister.

183
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:43,511
I am not afraid of her.

184
00:13:44,065 --> 00:13:45,178
I just don't want to bother her.

185
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:48,198
My sister is very fierce.

186
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:51,558
If she is fierce,

187
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:54,323
you are also fierce.
Because you are her brother.

188
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:57,229
Then you are fierce, too.

189
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,323
You are my closest friend, Games.

190
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:00,642
I have nothing to do with this.

191
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:05,272
Here you go.

192
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:07,258
I signed it.

193
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:10,811
It looks fine.

194
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:14,895
I'll take it to P'Vee.

195
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,568
Wow, you used me

196
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:21,337
as an excuse to see P'Vee.

197
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,490
No, I just...

198
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:26,746
this is my work, as usual.

199
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,994
Your work...

200
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:30,529
Not at all...

201
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:32,140
This is unusual.

202
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,729
Look...

203
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:35,456
When you like someone,

204
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,486
- you should always take initiative.
- Umm...

205
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:40,215
Are you sure about this?

206
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:41,564
Is P'Vee the one for you?

207
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,841
What do you mean?

208
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:48,465
Usually, you always

209
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:50,957
date the girls.

210
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:53,022
Is that right?

211
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:55,259
I see.

212
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:57,991
Look, Mum.

213
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:00,452
I don't care about

214
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:01,762
the gender

215
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:03,586
when I fall in love with someone.

216
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:05,679
I just know

217
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:06,598
I like him.

218
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,452
That's it.

219
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:11,100
Why?
Do you have a problem accepting this?

220
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,442
Not at all.

221
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:14,061
I can accept you,
because you are my friend.

222
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:15,500
What if I am not your friend?

223
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:17,068
You won't accept this, will you?

224
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,551
Not at all.

225
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:22,290
For me... this is a new thing.

226
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,338
I need time to accept this.

227
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:25,622
Just give me some time.

228
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:27,511
Oh my!

229
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,293
If I can kick you now, I will.

230
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,524
You are so fake.

231
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,744
Why are you acting
as if this disgusts you?

232
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,057
I will curse you.

233
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:38,611
You will fall in love with a man.

234
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:40,182
Please give Mum a pretty boy.

235
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:42,108
Whao, whao. Hey!

236
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:43,557
No way.

237
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,230
I will definitely
not date a man.

238
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:49,394
Enough already.

239
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:53,514
Can I buy it?

240
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:55,421
Your confidence.
I want to buy it.

241
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:02,919
Are you Khun Mint?

242
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,683
Yes.

243
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:05,937
These flowers are for you.

244
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:07,495
Thank you.

245
00:16:16,282 --> 00:16:17,995
Don't be late, P'Mum.

246
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:20,113
I have a meeting with clients.

247
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,945
Okay. I will go now.

248
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,581
Drive carefully, okay?

249
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:27,007
Yep.

250
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:50,477
What the heck?

251
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:55,087
Ouch!

252
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:56,877
Oh my god!

253
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,517
Are you okay?

254
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,727
I will call an emergency ambulance.

255
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:03,747
No need!

256
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,967
But you are hurt.

257
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,757
I don't want it to be a big deal.

258
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:09,887
Just give me money to see a doctor.

259
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:12,287
Baht 10,000 - 20,000
is enough.

260
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,457
No, no... you stay here.

261
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,607
I will take full responsibility.

262
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:24,027
Don't worry.

263
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,207
Before I got out of my car,

264
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:26,567
I have already called the police.

265
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,797
They will arrive soon.

266
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:31,057
There is no need to call the police.

267
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,787
Just give me money...

268
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,947
Baht 4-5,000 is enough.

269
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:37,237
Why are you asking for less money?

270
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,207
Wait for the police to arrive,
and then we can talk.

271
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:41,307
Baht 300. That's all.

272
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:47,357
See, the police are coming.

273
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:56,847
He is an undercover policeman.

274
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:06,777
What happened, Miss?

275
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:07,647
Tell me all details.

276
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:08,617
Well...

277
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:10,467
I was driving,

278
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:11,417
and this guy just jumped
from nowhere.

279
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,037
and hit my car.

280
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:14,427
Your car hit me.

281
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,877
I did not do that.

282
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,377
Enough, both of you.

283
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:21,227
Miss,

284
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:22,807
does your car have a camera?

285
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:24,367
I want to take a look.

286
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:26,627
And you,

287
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:27,927
where is your injury?

288
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:28,997
Just show me.

289
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,757
I will take you to the hospital.

290
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:33,787
If this lady is wrong,

291
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:35,557
I will catch her myself.

292
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:39,167
We can check the camera to see
which one is at fault.

293
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:40,797
I don't need your money now.

294
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,107
It's wasting my time.

295
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,777
What? Are you okay now?

296
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:47,487
No, I am still hurt.

297
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:49,617
Enough already,

298
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:51,107
go to the police station with me.

299
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:52,317
Don't touch me.

300
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:53,097
Get off me.

301
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,547
Come on.

302
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,427
- Don't mess with me.
- Don't ever do that again.

303
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,357
What's wrong with him?

304
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:11,567
That was a close call.

305
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:21,657
P' Mum.

306
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:23,607
Come on now.

307
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:42,187
Lily flowers.

308
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:44,737
(Father Anuwat Chaipunha
/ Mother Pattra Chaipunha)

309
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,277
Mom and Mint like this flower.

310
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:49,157
This year... is another year
that I can get P'Mum to pay you respect.

311
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:51,137
Am I good?

312
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,247
We both...

313
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,207
miss you very much.

314
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,547
Don't worry about us.

315
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:07,957
We are doing fine...

316
00:20:08,347 --> 00:20:09,367
Ah, P'Mum!

317
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:11,927
Turn your phone to silent mode.

318
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:13,637
This is family time.

319
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:14,917
Who's texting you?

320
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:22,927
It's nothing.

321
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,727
Silent mode now.

322
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:26,747
You go on.

323
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:30,367
P'Mum, tonight

324
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:33,127
my boyfriend is going out of town.

325
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:35,667
Shall we meet?

326
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,347
Hey!

327
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:39,137
Calm down, Mint.

328
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:40,967
Don't be angry with me.

329
00:20:41,317 --> 00:20:42,557
We're standing in front of
our parents.

330
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:44,667
Yes, that's right!

331
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:47,807
In front of our parents,
you're still talking about dirty things.

332
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,417
When will you stop being
a womanizer?

333
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:53,627
Dad, Mom...

334
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,597
look at him.

335
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:56,307
Ouch!

336
00:20:56,497 --> 00:20:57,447
- Mint!
- Come on!

337
00:20:58,637 --> 00:20:59,337
Are you crazy?

338
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:00,767
Dad, Mom...
she is crazy now.

339
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:02,717
I have to go.

340
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:03,877
If I stay here any longer,

341
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:05,687
my brutal sister would kill me.

342
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:08,827
Don't go, P'Mum.

343
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:11,617
Today is our parents' memorial day.

344
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:13,847
Don't you have anything
to tell them?

345
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:17,667
Make it quick.

346
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:33,437
Daddy, Mommy.

347
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,157
I miss you so much.

348
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:43,307
How's that?

349
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:46,097
See you.

350
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:48,287
Where are you going?

351
00:21:49,037 --> 00:21:49,797
P'Mum, P'Mum.

352
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:54,347
P'Mum.

353
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,767
What's the rush?

354
00:21:58,177 --> 00:21:59,177
Wait for me.

355
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:06,117
Can you cool down a bit? Okay?

356
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:07,457
You are too sassy.

357
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:09,547
That's why

358
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:11,627
you don't have a boyfriend.

359
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:14,677
You are wrong.

360
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:15,857
I'm getting close to having a boyfriend.

361
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:18,297
Don't look down on me.

362
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:22,657
Who is he?

363
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:25,257
Such an unlucky guy.

364
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:27,207
Be careful with your words.

365
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,437
He is lucky.

366
00:22:30,327 --> 00:22:31,317
You should

367
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:32,937
stop being a womanizer.

368
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:34,987
So you can meet a great girl.

369
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,517
I don't talk to girls.

370
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:41,317
So, I don't see one.

371
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:46,997
Look at this.

372
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:48,877
You don't have enough rest.

373
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:50,647
It's affecting your health.

374
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:53,577
Don't go to work tonight.

375
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:55,747
Go back home and get some sleep.

376
00:22:56,337 --> 00:22:57,867
No way.

377
00:22:58,657 --> 00:22:59,577
If I don't go to work,

378
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:01,887
P'Vee and Games will get mad.

379
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:03,547
Let me see.

380
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:07,897
You're having a fever.

381
00:23:08,507 --> 00:23:10,207
Get back and get some sleep now.

382
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:12,747
I'll explain this to P'Vee and P'Games.

383
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:14,627
- You have some medicines, right?
- Yep.

384
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:21,337
Okay, I will go now.

385
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,077
I have a meeting with clients.

386
00:23:25,477 --> 00:23:26,627
Don't forget.

387
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,627
Get some rest.

388
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:31,317
If I know you go to work at the pub.

389
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:33,417
You die!

390
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:40,017
I'm really leaving now.

391
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:04,857
You could get the messenger
to deliver this.

392
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,247
These are very important documents.

393
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:08,897
I'd rather send them myself.

394
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:13,747
Um...

395
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:16,137
Can I use your restroom?

396
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:30,657
Do you know the accounting report
is such a mess?

397
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:33,297
Your former manager
did it all wrong.

398
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:38,287
Wow, deep-fried dough stick.

399
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:40,437
Because we are couples.

400
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:43,437
Don't change the subject.

401
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:44,537
Look...

402
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:46,287
Nook's already told me

403
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:47,697
you did all accounting reports
in the past.

404
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:48,787
Oops!

405
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:52,587
Well...

406
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:55,247
Could you please help me with this?

407
00:24:56,257 --> 00:24:56,787
Please. Please.

408
00:24:59,887 --> 00:25:00,957
Okay, I will try.

409
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:07,067
P'Vee,

410
00:25:09,177 --> 00:25:10,777
the document that
I and Mum signed.

411
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,507
Was it correct?

412
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:17,387
From what I see,

413
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:18,957
I think it's correct.

414
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:21,627
I will recheck it.

415
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:23,399
Mmm.

416
00:25:30,927 --> 00:25:32,427
(A's calling)

417
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:43,977
Games...

418
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:46,407
invoices and balances
are not matched.

419
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:49,127
I think we need to
dig up more documents.

420
00:25:50,297 --> 00:25:52,127
Otherwise, I will have a
big problem with Revenue Dept.

421
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:53,967
- Really?
- Hm...

422
00:25:59,117 --> 00:25:59,737
This one... Okay.

423
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,247
Hey, stop.

424
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:14,297
- Stop.
- What's wrong?

425
00:26:14,297 --> 00:26:14,827
Mum...

426
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:16,577
You look sick.

427
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:17,537
Yes.

428
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:20,377
I saw him coughing.
He is surely sick.

429
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:21,567
Nonsense.

430
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:23,787
I am not sick.
Are you crazy?

431
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:25,227
I am definitely not sick.

432
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:26,867
I think today

433
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:28,397
you should go home and get some rest.

434
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:29,537
Yes, it's true.

435
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:31,437
Today we're fully booked.

436
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:33,697
Huh?

437
00:26:34,077 --> 00:26:34,867
If I don't show up,

438
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:35,677
- who will take responsibility?
- Yes.

439
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:37,097
But I think...

440
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,027
Enough! Don't ever tell my sister.

441
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:41,257
Otherwise,

442
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:42,887
I'll kill you all.

443
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:44,737
Yes.

444
00:26:47,577 --> 00:26:48,127
Come on.

445
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:49,207
Are you really okay?

446
00:26:49,337 --> 00:26:50,687
Yes. You should get back to work.

447
00:26:57,987 --> 00:26:58,497
P'Vee,

448
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:00,987
what should we do?

449
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:02,077
Mum doesn't look good.
Can he really perform?

450
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:05,377
I don't think he can.

451
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:07,327
If he keeps making himself
to rehearse like that,

452
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:09,317
he will get worse.

453
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:11,867
What if he spread the virus
to the whole pub?

454
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:13,557
Look,

455
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:15,137
he refused when I asked him
to go home.

456
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:16,237
What could we do now?

457
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,487
I think there is a way.

458
00:27:21,697 --> 00:27:23,297
But I need time to think.

459
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:25,467
Now...can you just

460
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:28,027
take your hands off my shoulder.

461
00:27:29,827 --> 00:27:30,487
Oops!

462
00:27:32,337 --> 00:27:34,277
I must be careless.
I don't know.

463
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:56,717
What!

464
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:57,867
How come is she here?

465
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:00,937
What did you say to her?

466
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:02,427
Who knows?

467
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:04,967
I don't know.
I am on stage with you.

468
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:05,877
Just go down there.

469
00:28:22,297 --> 00:28:23,007
Next, our D.J.

470
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,867
will take over...

471
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:25,967
from now.

472
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:27,167
Games, you betrayed me.

473
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:30,007
I did not do anything.
Your sister just came.

474
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:33,767
P'Vee. It must be you.

475
00:28:33,907 --> 00:28:35,807
Not me.

476
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:36,737
I just posted a story.
I don't know how Mint got here.

477
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:41,047
I'll count to five.

478
00:28:43,337 --> 00:28:43,937
One.

479
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:45,767
Two.

480
00:28:47,357 --> 00:28:48,137
Three...

481
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:49,247
Four. Five.

482
00:28:49,537 --> 00:28:50,417
All right.

483
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:51,087
I'll go.

484
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:52,907
I'll go.
I will get back to you both.

485
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:53,987
Be careful!

486
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:55,047
Just go, P'Mum.

487
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:55,917
I know now.

488
00:28:56,077 --> 00:28:57,107
Go home!

489
00:28:57,477 --> 00:28:58,597
- Okay.
- Good luck, my friend.

490
00:28:58,597 --> 00:28:59,777
Don't forget to get back to us.

491
00:30:35,247 --> 00:30:37,547
(Are you at home now?
I checked the front desk.)

492
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:39,577
(Get a medicine, don't forget...)

493
00:31:32,277 --> 00:31:33,047
Don't forget

494
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:34,577
to get some sleep.

495
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:49,137
What?

496
00:32:00,257 --> 00:32:01,037
You...

497
00:32:01,977 --> 00:32:02,847
Who are you?

498
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:13,997
You...

499
00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:14,867
Wait...

500
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:19,657
Do you know me?

501
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:23,537
I miss you so much, P'Mum.

502
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:17,537
Why am I still in the dream?

503
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:35,067
P'Mum...

504
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:40,667
Uh...

505
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:44,877
I am sorry.

506
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:13,677
I love you.

507
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:35,717
No!

508
00:36:30,297 --> 00:36:37,027
