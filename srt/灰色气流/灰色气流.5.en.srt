Wait for me.

187
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,430
Gosh.

188
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,600
What?

189
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,240
Even your menu choice is predictable.

190
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,990
You said it was up to me.

191
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,280
Wanna drink?

192
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,950
Drinks?

193
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,330
A bottle of soju, please.

194
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,910
I want to drink.

195
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,200
You like drinking?

196
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,050
I didn't know.

197
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,260
How's your dad?

198
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,160
Is he getting remarried?

199
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,840
I don't know

200
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,770
and I don't care.

201
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,810
Is that all you wanna know about me?

202
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,600
Then what should I ask?

203
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,820
He'll probably remarry.

204
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,200
I said he was dead

205
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,820
because he is dead to me.

206
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,470
I didn't mean anything else.

207
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,910
I didn't plan to lie to you.

208
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,210
I know.

209
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:48,920
Darn it.

210
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,130
Gosh.

211
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,330
It's sweet.

212
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,550
Then stop frowning.

213
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,630
I said the soju's sweet.

214
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,870
I moved out completely.

215
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,190
If I don't move out,

216
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,520
I doubt I can live a normal life.

217
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,950
What's a normal life to you?

218
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,780
Not living like this.

219
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,450
Well...

220
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,900
Fitting into society...

221
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,250
Gosh, I don't know.
Do you?

222
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,880
To me,

223
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,710
it's to have a place to go back to.

224
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,470
That's a normal life to me.

225
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,100
It's important to have a home.

226
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,180
Hey.

227
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
Flip the meat or it'll be burnt.

228
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,190
Give me the tongs.

229
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,610
You're so high-maintenance.

230
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,910
Having someone

231
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,950
to share a meal and go home together.

232
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,710
That's a normal life to me.

233
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,850
Are you a size 270?

234
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,180
Your shoe size.

235
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,730
Was it 275?

236
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,690
270.

237
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,890
Why?

238
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
I bought shoes that are too small for me.

239
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,360
You can have them.

240
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,730
You didn't have to buy it for me.

241
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,490
I told you they don't fit me.

242
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,950
I didn't buy it for you.

243
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,390
I have something for you too.

244
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,670
Let's stop by the convenience store.

245
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,960
I want some ice cream after all that alcohol.

246
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,630
Yoondae.

247
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,880
Don't call me.

248
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,440
You seldom call my name.

249
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,319
This is all I can give you.

250
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,730
At least rent a place.

251
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,740
Is this why you bought me dinner?

252
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,660
Just pretend the meal didn't happen.

253
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,680
You said it's up to me.

254
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,960
So you

255
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,710
chose to shoo me away

256
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,470
with this money?

257
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,960
Because I'm going around

258
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,200
begging for money without planning for a future?

259
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,390
Am I still a child to you?

260
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,680
Yes.

261
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,640
So I'm confused.

262
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,870
You need someone by your side.

263
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,940
And?

264
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,370
You can stay by my side.

265
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,170
Why is everything so complicated to you?

266
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,160
Just...

267
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,750
Focus on me.

268
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,930
I'll live well like everyone else.

269
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,640
Then all's good, no?

270
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,140
Just stay by my side and focus on me.

271
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,260
Yeah?

272
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,730
Don't focus on the situation.

273
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,150
Just focus on me.

274
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,440
I can't do it.

275
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,650
I can't.

276
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,160
You said it'd be easier
to just think simply.

277
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,320
That's why I tried.

278
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,170
But for me,

279
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,890
you're the hardest to deal with.

280
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,720
I've been through a lot,

281
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,050
but I

282
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,510
don't know how to handle

283
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,590
you and this situation.

284
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,430
What should I do?

285
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,060
What's so difficult about it?

286
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
That I'm your home.

287
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
Fine.

288
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,750
If I find another home,

289
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,220
can I call you?

290
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,180
Will you not avoid me then?

291
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,490
I'll take that as a yes.

292
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,540
Are you asleep?

293
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,000
No.

294
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,630
I have something to ask you.

295
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,360
Will we be okay
if we get together again?

296
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,720
It'd at least be better than this.

297
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,650
Do me a favor.

298
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,610
From now on, pretend to be asleep.

299
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,720
Hello.

300
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,060
I have something to tell you.

301
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,480
Do you have plans for dinner?

302
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,830
If not, let's eat together.

303
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,980
My treat.

304
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,730
I get off work at six.

305
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,230
See you after work.

306
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,710
Hey.

307
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,040
Are you listening?

308
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,590
Okay.

309
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,580
I'll wait.

310
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,680
[Gray Shelter]
