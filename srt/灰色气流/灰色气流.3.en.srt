But I didn't know

186
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,070
it was a single failure in your life.

187
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,800
That's right. It's a single failure.

188
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,670
But I have to keep cleaning up your mess. That's why I don't understand you.

189
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,070
So the way you came up with

190
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,350
is to get rid of me from your life?

191
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,460
You brat.

192
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,970
Have you ever said

193
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,510
"Dad, I'm tired. Stop living like that." to me?

194
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,550
No!

195
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,470
I grew up watching them.

196
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,950
That's the root of the problem.

197
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,060
I've been having a hard time, but I just act like

198
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,780
I'm doing fine in front of you, Mom, and everyone else.

199
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,740
What will change if I do as you say?

200
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,110
Every time you drink, you call me and say you have no money.

201
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,530
When you were arrested, so I paid the fine too.

202
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,910
But you keep doing this.

203
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,400
Are you going to live like this forever?

204
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,680
Can't you think that was just

205
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,920
a single mistake I made too?

206
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,760
Soohyuk, what you did was not a mistake.

207
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,300
It was a failure.

208
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,440
Sir.

209
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,730
Sir!

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,290
Hey.

211
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,010
I said I'm leaving.

212
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,250
Hello?

213
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,850
[Cha Soohyuk]

214
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,920
Who... are you?

215
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,820
I paid.

216
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,780
Okay, you can go now.

217
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,740
Get up.

218
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,270
How did you know I'm here?

219
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,380
If you have somewhere to go, just go.

220
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,670
I'll take care of it myself.

221
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,670
Take care of what?

222
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,880
Let's go.

223
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,610
What's the problem?

224
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,170
Will it get easier?

225
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,230
If I just die and disappear?

226
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,590
It's easy if you think it's easy.

227
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,170
It's cold. Think of it at home.

228
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,100
It's okay.

229
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,520
Hey.

230
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,800
Just say it if you're tired.

231
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,470
If you want to act like you're okay, then act like it.

232
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,210
I can tell from your face.

233
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,210
Actually, I'm not doing well.

234
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,020
I'm very tired.

235
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,560
Okay.

236
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,470
Well done.

237
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,640
I'll be home early.

238
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,090
I'll buy you dinner when I get back.

239
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,650
I got a call from Yoondae's father.

240
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,910
I heard he's getting remarried.

241
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,440
Shit. Why are you still so selfish?

242
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,940
You didn't have a department dinner, did you?

243
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,700
What am I to you?

244
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,600
We're strangers anyway.
