Is he a burden?

Or do you pity him?

150
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,710
Or does he make you anxious?

You even drank.

165
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,320
A work dinner.

Until now?

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,770
Yeah.

It wasn't a work dinner, right?

173
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,200
Enough.

Then kick me out.

Don't act like you didn't ask me to wait for you.

180

Then what about you?

Are you serious...

188
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,980
Yeah, darn it, what about that?

189
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,840
So what if that jerk's alive?

190
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,010
Is it because he'd have dealt with me, so you don't have to?

191
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,320
What exactly am I to you?

192
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,940
You're just making me carry your burden for you.

193
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,940
Don't be mistaken.

194
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,780
I'm not really your brother.

195
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,330
I've never thought that way.

196
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,320
Then why?

197
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,410
Why did you lie to stay here?

198
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,200
You don't know?

199
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,140
How could you not know?

200
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,580
Yeah, I don't, damn it!

201
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,960
If I piss you off,

202
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,800
why can't you just kick me out?

203
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,170
Hey.

204
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,050
Is this how you live?

205
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,470
Like this?

206
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,480
Making others feel bad for you to mooch off them?

207
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,190
Don't blame me now.

208
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,320
You asked me to come.

209
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,850
And you lied.

210
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,730
Hey.

211
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,390
We're strangers anyway.

212
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,090
All I said was he's dead,
and you asked me to come.

213
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,200
You did.

214
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,610
So what if I lied?

215
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,580
What does his death have to do with you?

216
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,040
Fine, I was confused.

217
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,890
What about you?

218
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,700
Why did you come then?

219
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,670
You could've just dismissed me as an idiot and not come...

220
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,619
Because I don't wanna say goodbye.

221
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,750
