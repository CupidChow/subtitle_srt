I'm sorry.

193
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,720
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,470
I'm really sorry.

195
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,320
I hate you.

196
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,590
What's that smell?

197
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,760
[Ulsan West Detention Center: Please give this to Cha Joongyong.]

198
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,640
Detention center?

199
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,040
[Male students all get money... I think all helpers do]

200
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,190
[So how much is it?]

201
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:20,840
[About 300,000 won a month]

202
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,520
What is it?

203
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,190
Let's go home.

204
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,690
Get lost.

205
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,740
Move your hands.

206
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,570
Why?

207
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,370
Did my dad ask you to come get me, so he can beat me up?

208
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,040
I'm not going back.

209
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,830
What about school?

210
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,750
I have my ways.

211
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,630
Wear my shoes.

212
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,600
You have school.

213
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,300
Hurry.

214
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,350
Crappy shoes.

215
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,230
Sleep in my room from now on.

216
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,790
He wouldn't hit you

217
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,120
in front of me.

218
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,290
Why are you so nice to me?

219
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,920
If you were me,

220
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,670
you'd do the same.

221
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,430
Hey.

222
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
It's cold. I wanna go home.

223
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,900
Can you walk faster?

224
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,770
You're so slow.

225
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,570
Hey.

226
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,320
Don't you hate me?

227
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,330
So?

228
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,940
Then why did you come get me?

229
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,340
Wait.

230
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,510
What is this?

231
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,840
Apply it.

232
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,930
It's just a scratch.

233
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,850
Do you need my help?

234
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
I'll do it myself.

235
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,110
You can't see it.

236
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,390
Are you done?

237
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,970
No.

238
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,770
You're handsome.

239
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,150
Suddenly?

240
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,660
Yeah.

241
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,670
Pororo bandage? Seriously?

242
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,260
Hey, I'm wearing your shoes.

243
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,010
Why?

244
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,020
I have nothing to wear.

245
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,700
Didn't you say they're crappy?

246
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,560
Mine are too. Happy?

247
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,610
Okay, wear them.

248
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,860
I'm gonna throw mine away anyway. Wear them if you want.

249
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,890
Do you take after your dad?

250
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,990
No.

251
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,760
You don't take after your dad either.

252
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,560
Our relationship's worse than that of strangers.

253
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,150
How I've been?

254
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,430
You go first.

255
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,860
You ran away.

256
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,820
Has Yoondae's dad contacted you?

257
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,570
