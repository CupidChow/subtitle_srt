3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,320
It can't be him.

4
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,400
What's wrong, Ke?

5
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,159
Nothing.

6
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,159
I haven't devoured
such an easy dream in a long time.

7
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,480
Shen Nan did well
by showing Luo Xinyao the truth.

8
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
Otherwise, it would have taken me
some effort to solve her problem

9
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,959
with "A Dream of Millet".

10
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,439
Why?

11
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,480
"A Dream of Millet"

12
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,439
is made with one's lifeblood

13
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,480
and fueled by the soul.

14
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,000
Naturally, it would require some effort

15
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,359
to devour the dream it creates.

16
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,079
Ke.

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
I see my lantern there.

18
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,800
It must be tough for you.

19
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,719
Don't say that.

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
It's my duty.

21
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,800
Have you ever thought about leaving?

22
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,479
I've promised

23
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,400
to stay here forever for someone.

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,319
I won't go back on my word.

25
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,840
Is that person very important to you?

26
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,439
I would assume.

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,080
I can't remember.

28
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,080
Why?

29
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,199
On the day I became
the guardian of Wangchuan,

30
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,599
my memories were taken away.

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,039
I've been cultivating diligently,

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
hoping that one day
I can mend my own dream.

33
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,560
It's just a pity

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,599
that after hundreds of years,

35
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,800
I can only recall some vague images.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,159
Perhaps I haven't tried hard enough.

37
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,520
Ke, don't be sad.

38
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,599
Rest early.

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,560
We're meeting with Mr. Mo tomorrow.

40
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
I've sent someone to turn him down.

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
We have rules here.

42
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,719
If someone needs help,
they should visit in person.

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,479
They expect me to go to them?

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,960
You just said
you weren't trying hard enough.

45
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,560
How come you're putting on airs

46
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,719
to a guest now?

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,639
People come in person to seek help.

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,439
I never make house calls.

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,199
Ke, where are you going?

50
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,879
Just taking a walk. Don't worry.

51
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,319
It is said getting drunk
dispels a thousand worries.

52
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,680
But why does the wine
taste more and more bitter?

53
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
What's wrong?

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,399
You wished for immortality as a kid.

55
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,560
Your wish has come true.

56
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,879
Are you happy?

57
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,600
Suffer centuries of loneliness

58
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,759
for someone I'll never meet again.

59
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,399
Ridiculous.

60
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,199
It's really ridiculous.

61
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,000
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

62
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,079
- Let's come again.
- Nice booze.

63
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,800
- So pretty.
- Go take a look.

64
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,079
Miss, are you alone?

65
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,560
Join us for some fun.

66
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,360
Let's have fun.

67
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,279
Get lost.

68
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,360
She's got a temper.

69
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,279
Interesting.

70
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,839

72
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,600
She's a tough one.

73
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,160
Knock it off.

74
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,879
Come on.

75
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,439
Shen Nan.

76
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm sorry.

77
