=Episode 12=

3
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,280
Fine.

4
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,680
I am that woman.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,840
I am the one who saved you 15 years ago.

6
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,920
I am the monster that never ages.

7
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,799
Are you happy now?

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,239
Since you've admitted to it...

9
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,280
You are injured.

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,120
I won't let you push me away.

11
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,480
Why are you so enthralled?

12
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,840
Who's going to push you away?

13
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,280
Lu Ren, I have a question for you.

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,640
There is something you can't figure out?

15
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,719
Let's hear it.

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,319
What does it feel like to like someone?

17
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,640
Am I hallucinating?

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,359
Is it even real?

19
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,840
You're actually troubled by love.

20
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,920
This is so rare.

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,439
Let's be serious.

22
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,800
Usually,

23
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,680
when a man falls in love with someone,

24
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,680
he will unconsciously
set his gaze upon her

25
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,240
to observe every expression on her face

26
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,520
and every move she makes.

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,599
He will want to know
everything about her,

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,159
guess her thoughts,

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,439
and strive to get closer to her.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,360
Also,

31
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,960
you will develop a possessive desire,

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,240
hoping she only
behaves differently in front of you.

33
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,479
How differently?

34
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,960
You want her to be cold to others

35
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,240
but warm to you.

36
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,159
Young master.

37
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm right by your side.

38
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,120
I won't go anywhere.

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,400
Impressive, young master.

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,879
You're really amazing.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,719
Does it hurt?

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,479
There is an easy way to find out.

43
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,800
Right now,

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,000
the lady you have in mind

45
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
is the one you fancy.

46
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,919
Whoever she is, try to win her over.

47
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,719
There are so many bachelors in Jiangzhou

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
and so few pretty girls.

49
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,919
Why is Officer Shen
holding onto a handkerchief?

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,879
Is it the evidence on a case?

51
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,599
The molestation or the murder?

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,680
Can we join the investigation?

53
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,439
Neither of those.

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,560
It's probably a burglary
with mutual consent.

55
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,400
Forget it.

56
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,879
It has nothing to do with us.

57
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,159
Better to figure out
what to have for lunch.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,280
(Why did that dead tree come to life?)

59
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,319
(What happened?)

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
I said it's almost the full moon.

61
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,199
We don't receive guests.

62
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,560
Why did you come?

63
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,280
I'm not here to talk business.

64
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,360
I'm here...

65
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,120
I am Mo Yunxi.

66
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,360
Sorry for disturbing you.

67
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Wangchuan Inn
is not hosting guests today.

68
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,800
Don't listen to him, Mr. Mo.

69
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,600
I know why you've come.

70
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,279
Please go home first.

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
At the "Hai" hour tonight,

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,000
I will visit you.

73
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,480
Miss Ke, didn't you say that

74
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,519
guests must visit in person

75
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,279
and you never make house calls?

76
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
There are exceptions.

77
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,519
Then I truly appreciate it, Miss.

78
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,600
Shen Nan, let go. Stop acting crazy!

79
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,879
You'll lose all your powers.

80
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,399
Why did you agree to help him

81
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,519
under the full moon?

82
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,519
I know what I'm doing.

83
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,920
Mind your own business.

84
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,600
Do you?

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Do you know how worried

86
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,199
I was last night?

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,439
What kind of magic does Mo Yunxi have

88
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,279
to make you go to such lengths for him?

89
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,759
Is it him?

90
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,399
The one you're waiting for?

91
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,600
The one you love?

92
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,480
Is it him?

93
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,240
You spoke in your dreams last night.

94
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,720
You said you could do anything
for someone

95
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,399
you could never meet again.

96
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,399
Is that Mo Yunxi?

97
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,399
Or did it

98
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,160
happen in his past life?

99
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,839
Answer me.

100
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,519
It's none of your business.

101
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,240
But I want it to be my business

102
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,399
sooner or later,

103
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,839
even if not now.

104
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:11,959
Shen Nan.

105
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,319
This case has nothing to do with you.

106
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,879
Nor does my past.

107
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,480

Where are you?

(Having gone through)

121

(all the vicissitudes of life,)

Nan.

136
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:42,879
What...

137
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,200
What's wrong?

138
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,320
You look beside yourself.

139
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,600
Your confession failed?

140
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,519
Lu Ren, do you know
someone named Mo Yunxi?

141
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,320
Oh.

142
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,519
The Mo family in the west of the city.

143
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,279
It's a business family

144
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,559
which is wealthy

145
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,759
but not so respected.

146
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,840
The family leader
wanted to pursue officialdom.

147
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,559
One of the two young masters

148
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,000
ranks first in the martial arts exam.

149
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,879
That's Mo Yunxi's
younger brother, Mo Xingze.

150
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,879
Mo Xingze?

151
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,679
Commander of Jiangzhou?

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,960
He takes charge of the local army,
garrison, training, and equipment.

153
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,399
That's right.

154
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,960
He's only an eighth-rank official.

155
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,519
But it has changed the Mo family's fate

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,679
and made it a prestigious family.

157
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,279
In other words,

158
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,639
the elder son Mo Yunxi

159
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,480
couldn't achieve much
due to health reasons

160
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,639
and remained the valueless young master.

161
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,879
So that's why he went to see Ke.

162
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,120
Does that sickly man really think
the dream is the solution?

163
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,720
It seems you have
a big problem with Mo Yunxi.

164
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,200
Because of a lady?

165
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,039
Jealousy is the first step to downfall.

166
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,559
Good luck to you.

167
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,000
But then again,

168
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,519
apart from being a bit unwell,

169
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,679
Mo Yunxi makes a perfect husband.

170
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:07,960
(This Mo Yunxi seems utterly useless.)

171
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,960
(What kind of magic does he have)

172
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,279
(to make her go all out for him?)

173
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,720
At the "Hai" hour tonight,

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
I will visit you.

175
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,720
Keep patrolling.

176
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,600
I have things to do.

177
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,120
Leaving me alone again?

178
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,720
What kind of friend are you?

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,279
