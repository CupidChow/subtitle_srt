=Fate's Crossing Nan & Ke=

2
00:00:48,578 --> 00:00:51,126
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,119
I said that you'd be my only one

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,840
when we got married.

5
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,079
What if you break your vow?

6
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,399
If I break my vow,

7
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,240
may thunder strike me.

8
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:02,640
Xinyao.

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
All other men

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,040
have concubines or lovers.

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,400
I'm the only one

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,760
who has no one else but you.

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,599
My mother

14
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,400
has indeed been somewhat harsh on you

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
and done some wrongs.

16
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,079
But you also have faults, more or less.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,680
So...

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,519
Let's get divorced.

19
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:27,680
Xinyao.

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,439
Xinyao.

21
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:29,959
Xinyao.

22
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,599
What on earth do you want?

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,439
Have you gone mad?

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,640
Why would you divorce me?

25
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,840
Luo Xinyao.

26
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,599
I've been tolerating you for ten years.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,280
You can't serve my mother

28
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,439
or take care of Heng.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,040
You're mediocre with house chores.

30
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,719
I haven't kept a score on those.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,120
You've been jealous.

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
And I only find you overly dependent.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,079
But now,

34
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,680
you want to divorce me
over some household trivialities.

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,359
I wanted to leave you some dignity.

36
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,920
But you don't want it.

37
00:01:59,239 --> 00:01:59,840
So forget it.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,599
What is this?

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,079
My fellows.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,359
Come and see.

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,800
Our scholar, Pei Shaoqing,

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,159
wants to divorce his wife
to remarry a courtesan.

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,319
He even made a written vow
to marry the courtesan.

44
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,599
Dear Yanhong, may you be well.

45
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,039
I haven't seen you for days.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,680
Thinking of you drives me mad.

47
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,360
I...

48
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,159
No way.

49
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,039
It's a love letter
between Yanhong and me.

50
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,039
How would she give it to you?

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,719
How I obtained this
is none of your business.

52
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,879
But you wrote it yourself,

53
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,759
promising to marry her.

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,719
If you really love me,

55
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,479
divorce her and marry me.

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,000
After all, you promised to redeem me.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,240
It's not the time yet.

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,680
Heng is still young.

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,039
My mother needs to be served.

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,639
You have never done any chores
with those pretty hands of yours.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
You can't handle it.

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
Besides,

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,919
how could I bear to let you
do such dirty and tiring work?

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,479
Right.

65
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,280
Mr. Lu said he'd write

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,960
a letter of recommendation

67
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,039
to make me an advisor in Shengjing.

68
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,400
Once I get promoted,
I will surely divorce her

69
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,800
and marry you.

70
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,800
Spoken words hold no proof.

71
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,439
Write it down.

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,199
Of course, I'll write it down.

73
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,919
Pei Shaoqing.

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,360
We met when we were young.

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,800
We have supported each other
for ten years

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,599
even if you've lost your love for me.

77
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,199
But I never expected you
to be so cunning.

78
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,599
You wanted me as nothing but a servant.

79
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,120
You disgust me.

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,879
Luo Xinyao.

81
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,319
What are you looking at?

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Get lost.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,560
Xinyao.

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,840
Xinyao.

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,680
Xinyao.

86
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,120
Xinyao.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,919
Xinyao.

88
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,919
That written pledge means nothing.

89
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,840
I wrote it in a moment of confusion.

90
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,599
I have never considered
divorcing you all these years.

91
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,439
I have always been loyal to you.

92
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,000
No more nonsense about being loyal.

93
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,520
You haven't divorced me
or taken any concubines

94
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,159
not because you loved me,

95
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,919
but because you couldn't find

96
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
another fool who would
serve your family wholeheartedly.

97
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,160
I have submitted the evidence
and petition to Officer Shen.

98
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,519
Let's see how the court rules on this.

99
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,279
Luo Xinyao.

100
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,800
Luo Xinyao.

101
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,800
If you were of no use,

102
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,399
why would I marry you?

103
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,079
You are but a talentless orphan girl.

104
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,480
I may not be known,

105
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,279
but I've passed the imperial exam.

106
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,879
You've obviously
married above your status

107
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,279
as a commoner.

108
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,399
If you couldn't even accept
managing household affairs

109
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,759
and taking care of us,

110
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,759
why would I choose to be with you?

111
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,399
Huh?

112
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,279
Is that what you thought
when you married me?

113
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,600
Beauty fades

114
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,879
and youth withers away.

115
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,279
You're not as pretty
as you were ten years ago.

116
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,800
Why should I remain faithful to you?

117
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,279
In that case,

118
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,560
let me tell you something.

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,439
Go ahead.

120
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,439
Mr. Lu told me to inform you

121
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,399
not to visit him again.

122
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,000
What did you say?

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,079
You may get promoted one day

124
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,360
with his support.

125
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,319
Unfortunately,

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,839
everyone knows your true color now

127
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,920
and can't wait to sever ties with you.

128
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,560
Everyone has to bear the consequences
of their own choices.

129
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,519
You're leaving in such a hurry.

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,000
I haven't prepared anything for you.

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,079
Officer Shen advised me to leave tonight

132
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,839
to avoid any retaliation
from the Pei family.

133
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,079
Rest assured.

134
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,040
Once I settle down,

135
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,360
I will write to you.

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,720
Thank you.

137
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,079
You've given me the most precious thing.

138
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,800
Don't you remember?

139
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,079
That's true.

140
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,800
The Wangchuan Inn
never engages in unprofitable business.

141
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,720
It's finally over.

142
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,240
Can we settle the bet now?

143
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,279
Bet?

144
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,279
What bet?

145
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,600
As an official,

146
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,600
you shouldn't get involved in betting.

147
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,120
You're backing out?

148
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,319
Don't trust a woman too easily.

149
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,600
Don't you remember?

150
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160
Pretty women tend to be more deceitful.

151
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,639
You drugged Yanhong
at the Baihua House to obtain

152
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,639
the written vow.

153
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,480
I can take you to court.

154
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,600
Alright.

155
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,800
Then you are an accomplice.

156
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,040
I will surely mention your name.

157
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:49,839
Young master.

158
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,680
I'm right by your side.

159
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,759
I won't go anywhere.

160
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,319
Impressive, young master.

161
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,439
You're really amazing.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,120
Young master, why did you barge

163
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,920
into my Wangchuan Inn?

164
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,879
Pretty women tend to be more deceitful.

165
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,079
Which one

166
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
is the real you?

167
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,399
Officer Shen.

168
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,240
Tailing someone is a serious crime.

169
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,799
I can take you to court.

170
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,879
I have something for you.

171
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,960
You saved me when I was a kid.

172
00:08:59,399 --> 00:08:59,960
Remember?

173
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,039
I didn't expect you
to have such a special hobby.

174
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,879
This handkerchief looks quite old.

175
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,080
I wonder who made it.

176
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,919
The pattern looks quite familiar...

177
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,240
Why won't you admit

178
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,240
that you were the person I met?

179
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,000
What if I admit it?

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
And what if I don't?

181
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,279
Does it matter whether you've seen me

182
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,919
as a child?

183
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,480
Yes, it does.

184
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,919
Because that day changed my life.

185
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,759
Officer Shen.

186
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,679
You got the wrong person.

187
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,440
Miss Ke.

188
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,960
Please do me a favor

189
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,720
and grant me a dream.

190
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,759
Remember.

191
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,840
When the Lingxi Pendants light up,

192
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,039
the old friend returns.

193
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,639
(Old friend?)

194
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,120
I am Head Constable Shen Nan,

195
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,240
here to investigate the assault
on the steamed bun shop owners.

196
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,039
Please work with me, Miss Ke.

197
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,679
Don't let me

198
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,519
catch you harming the people.

199
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,039
You don't know spells
for immortality, do you?

200
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,279
Don't tell me you were that woman

201
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,399
I met 15 years ago.

202
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,639
No.

203
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,440
It can't be him.
