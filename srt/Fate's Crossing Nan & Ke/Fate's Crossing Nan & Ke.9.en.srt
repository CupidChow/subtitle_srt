=Episode 9=

3
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,000
What happened?

4
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,320
Get a physician.

5
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,000
Excuse me.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,840
I am a physician.

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,200
Hurry!

8
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,560
Officer Shen, thank you
for being so concerned.

9
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,120
She brought us
into a dream with a weird spell

10
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,200
and passed out.

11
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,359
I was worried she might be in danger.

12
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,719
The world is full of wonders.

13
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,280
You'd better stay in awe
of things you do not understand.

14
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,560
Officer Shen.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,159
Show some respect.

16
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,680
Do not speak rashly.

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,000
Now,

18
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,159
you have seen her dream.

19
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,359
Will you take this petition?

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,959
Miss Luo, you must accept a beating
to sue your mother-in-law

21
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,400
even if you win in the end.

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,760
Are you still doing this?

23
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,120
No...

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,680
Let me think it over.

25
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,840
Why are you scared?

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,799
I have a way around it.

27
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,359
My husband and I are deeply bonded.

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
And we have Heng.

29
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,439
I really do not wish

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,479
to take his mother to court.

31
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,360
Don't be silly.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,479
What kind of bond is that?

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,639
You do the laundry and cook for him
while he does nothing.

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,439
He's cheating on you

35
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,800
and letting his mother bully you.

36
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,759
Besides,

37
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,639
your foolish child
who grows in height but not in mind

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,319
has been educated by the Pei family

39
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,520
into an ungrateful loser.

40
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,120
You...

41
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,240
So silly.

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,039
Ke.

43
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:33,960
Ke.

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,840
Are you okay?

45
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,120
Mind your business.

46
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,879
How can a young lady have such a temper?

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,199
Let's go. I'll carry you.

48
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,199
Wuyue must be waiting.

49
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,199
Don't be so cocky.

50
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,719
You may be scared
if I tell you my real age.

51
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,000
You don't know spells
for immortality, do you?

52
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,680
Don't tell me you were that woman

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,319

I'm sending her back to Wangchuan Inn.

69
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,759
I have looked into the case.

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,920
You were right.

71
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,199
Okay, I see.

72
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,120
Go back first.

73
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,839
What were you right about?

74
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,439
It's about a case. No comments.

75
00:05:05,617 --> 00:05:10,080
(Wangchuan)

76
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:13,519
(Wangchuan)

77
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,480
It's said that the Wangchuan Inn
helps people erase their regrets.

78
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,120
But is it possible

79
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,759
through merely a dream?

80
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,519
It may not be enough
for you, Officer Shen.

81
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,639
But for many people,

82
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:27,879
it is.

83
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,920
However, sometimes
being too sober isn't a blessing.

84
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,879
People need to learn
to reconcile with the past.

85
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,800
At this point, please stop

86
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,319
speaking in riddles with me.

87
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
Tell me. Who are you?

88
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,319
I'm Ke.

89
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,600
I have told you.

90
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,920
Your appearance
hasn't changed in 15 years.

91
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,800
Don't inquire about
a lady's age so casually.

92
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,240
Otherwise, you may be in danger.

93
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,240
Let's make a bet.

94
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,439
You can't afford
to match my bet, Officer Shen.

95
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,319
You want Luo Xinyao
to see Pei Shaoqing's true nature.

96
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,639
I can do that.

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,680
What do you want to bet on?

98
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,839
A secret from 15 years ago.

99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,120
(Ke once said)

100
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,040
(that the Wangchuan Inn)

101
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,959
(shall never leave
the guests' nightmares unresolved.)

102
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
(I must help Miss Luo
let go of her past)

103
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,279
(and leave the Pei family.)

104
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,439
Be careful.

105
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,079
Miss...

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
What happened?

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,959
Miss Luo, excuse me.

108
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,839
Shen Nan.

109
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,160
Shen Nan.

110
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,199
(Baihua House)
Where are you taking my guest?

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,399
(Baihua House)
Yanhong.

112
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,680
Yanhong.

113
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,279
Come on.

114
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,959
You know where we are, right?

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,560
Yes, I do.

116
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,120
You know that Pei Shaoqing
comes here at least twice a month.

117
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,480
Right?

118
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,360
Yes, I do.

119
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
So what are you afraid of?

120
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,040
Breaking the false image
of a harmonious marriage?

121
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,079
Or seeing how bleak love becomes

122
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,959
once it's ruined by life?

123
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,240
Do you really want to suffer

124
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,519
for the rest of your life?

125
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,079
Wake up.

126
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,360
Pei Shaoqing doesn't love you anymore.

127
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,839
He's just using you

128
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,120
as his servant.

129
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,759
He wasn't looking for you
out of concern.

130
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,920
He knew that his mother
had broken the law

131
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,360
and he feared that you'd

132
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,399
drag everyone down with you.

133
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:26,272
(Baihua House)

134
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,360
What are you trying to do?

135
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,679
She has to face it
sooner or later, doesn't she?

136
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
I don't have your patience.

137
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,080
Dreams can't solve the problem.

138
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,440
She must open her eyes

139
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,039
to see it.

140
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,919
This is the reality.

141
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:56,192
(Baihua House)

142
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Xinyao.

143
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,559
Xinyao.

144
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,080
You're finally back.

145
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,440
Mother took Heng to play soccer.

146
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,240
I heard you reported me missing.

147
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,879
I guess you're the only one
who cares about me in this family.

148
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,039
Yeah.

149
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,960
Although the magistrate heard about it,

150
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,000
which made my family a bit embarrassing,

151
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,240
it was all worth it.

152
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,519
Xinyao.

153
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,159
Your safety matters more than anything.

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,919
Xinyao, promise me.

155
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,480
Don't be so willful ever again, okay?

156
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,960
Promise me, okay?

157
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,399
Can I ask you three questions?

158
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,519
Are you still mad at me?

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,559
Alright, go ahead.

160
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960
Do you love me?

161
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,759
Of course, I love you.

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,480
Only me?

163
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,559
That's right.

164
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,120
I said that you'd be my only one

165
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,879
when we got married.

166
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
What if you break your vow?

167
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,440
If I break my vow,

168
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,159
