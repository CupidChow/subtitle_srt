=Episode 21=

3
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,799
Shen Nan.

4
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,560
I've given up my own memories

5
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,879
and exchanged my own love,

6
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,799
staying at the Wangchuan Inn forever.

7
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,519
Haven't I done that to make
my husband safe?

8
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,519
If you want your husband
to continue to be safe

9
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,519
and the contract to remain in effect,

10
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,799
don't forget our agreement.

11
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,560
(Shen Nan.)

12
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,408
(It turns out, from beginning to end,)

13
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,079
(it was you all along,)

14
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,519
(only you.)

15
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,159
(Because it's you,)

16
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,159
(after so long,)

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,920
(we would still meet.)

18
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,159
(Sorry,)

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
(I forgot our past)

20
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,800
(and hurt you over and over again.)

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,479
Shen Nan, constable of Jiangzhou.

22
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,879
To investigate the attack
on the steamed bun shop owner.

23
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,080
Please work with me, Miss Ke.

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,360
Do you have the secret to immortality?

25
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Don't tell me you were that woman

26
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,879
I met fifteen years ago.

27
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,639
Who are you?

28
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,120
My name

29
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,439
is Ke,

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,719
Ke, like in 'The Dream of Nanke'.

♪Slowly converging into love♪

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,656
Ke.

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,360
Are you calling me, young master?

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,639
Please don't mind me.

35
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,599
I'm not afraid.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,719
I was defenseless

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
and got you implicated.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,280
Does it hurt?

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,432
Young master.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,120
I'm right by your side.

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,319
I won't go anywhere.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,400
(The person you saw)

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,319
(was nothing but an illusion.)

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,280
(She has long been buried
with that dream in Yongning Village)

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,096
(and will never come back.)

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,879
Take a close look.

47
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,960
I'm not Meng.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
I am Ke.

The one you're waiting for?

56
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,000
The one you love?

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,159
Is it him?

58
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,919
It's none of your business.

59
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,159
But I want it to be my business

60
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,759
sooner or later,

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,120
even if not now.

62
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,280
What are you to me?

63
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,368
Why should I understand you?

64
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,479
I like you.

65
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,919
What nonsense are you talking about?

66
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,520
I said,

67
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,879
I like you.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,000
(If you really want to marry Mo Yunxi,
give me a straight answer,)

69
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,360
let me give up,

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,840
and tell me you like him
and won't give anyone else a chance.

71
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,120
At least,

72
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:11,199
I won't do these stupid things anymore.

73
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,319
(I don't need anyone.)

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,664
Nor will I fall in love with anyone.

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,800
(Whether it's you)

76
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
(or Mo Yunxi.)

77
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,120
This is my answer.

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,879
I will never

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,920
love you.

80
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,319
I designed the wedding dress myself.

81
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,240
I thought

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,079
you would like it.

83
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,920
Turns out it was all just
my wishful thinking.

84
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,720
(I'm sorry.)

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,360
(I thought I could protect you.)

86
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,600
(But in the end)

87
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,279
(it was me who hurt you.)

88
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,759
If you fall in love again,

89
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,720
the contract will be gone.

90
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,240
If anything happens then,

91
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,984
don't blame me for not having warned
you beforehand.

92
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:11,439
Where is Shen Nan?

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,759
Where is he?

94
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,439
What game are you playing now?

95
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,279
You just threw away the wedding dress.

96
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,984
Now you want to tease him again?

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
You really don't tire of this.

98
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
I have something urgent with him.

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,639
You've already made Nan lose face
in front of everyone.

100
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,800
Don't torment him anymore. Okay?

101
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,879
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,639
I know it's too late to say anything.

103
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,199
But Shen Nan is in danger now.

104
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,000
In danger?

105
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,680
Tell me where he is.

106
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,279
I have no idea where he went.

107
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,879
I only know he headed to the south.

108
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,920
South of the city.

109
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,480
I got it.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,920
(You were not meant to live
in this world.)

111
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,079
(It's time to return)

112
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
(your lifespan stolen.)

113
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,639
Shen Nan.

114
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,000
Shen Nan.

115
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,759
Shen Nan, wake up.

116
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,192
Shen Nan.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Shen Nan, wake up.

118
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,399
Don't worry.

119
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,664
I won't let anything happen to you.

120
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,120
How could he have become like this?

121
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,400
What are you making him take?

122
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,680
I wouldn't hurt him.

123
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,439
There's something I need
to trouble Officer Lu with.

124
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,120
Please go to the Mo's Residence
immediately

125
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,439
to check on Mo Yunxi.

126
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,319
It's a matter of life and death, please.

127
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,920
Ke, what are you doing?

128
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,399
His soul is currently
in a state of disarray.

129
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,240
If I don't stabilize his heart meridian,
he'll soon become a living dead.

130
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:43,560
But this is just a temporary measure.

131
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,720
(If anything happens then,)

132
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,624
(don't blame me for not having warned
you beforehand.)

133
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,720
I know you can hear me.

134
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,639
Don't you always love to pry
into everything here?

135
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,959
Come out.

136
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,480
Come out!

137
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,008
Fine.

138
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,680
You're hiding from me.

139
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,600
Then I'll uproot every flower and plant

140
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,639
in Wangchuan,

141
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,319
so that the Mengxi Creek
will run dry and

142
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,000
there will be no lanterns anymore.

143
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,360
Stupid.

144
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,319
You finally came.

145
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,639
So what if you've found me?

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
The contract is broken.

147
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,616
The fate of Shen Nan and Mo Yunxi will
eventually return to the right track.

148
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:33,759
There must be something
you can do, right?

149
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:37,840
The flowers and plants of Wangchuan Inn
are connected to your soul.

150
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:39,440
If you continue to harm yourself,

151
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,696
I'm afraid even the only chance
to save him will be gone.

152
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,080
My dear.

153
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,639
I told you I would save you.

154
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,759
I'll never break my promise.

155
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,424
(Do you really want to exchange
your life for Officer Shen's life?)

156
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,600
(What if that person was lying to you?)

157
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:03,759
(He wouldn't lie to me.)

158
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,360
(If this method works,)

159
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,760
(I'll be able to save Shen Nan.)

160
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
If it doesn't work,

161
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,720
I'll die with him.

162
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,039
(It would also be fulfillment.)

163
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
(I've told you before)

164
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,120
(that I owe Mo Yunxi)

165
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,279
(because of the deal I made back then.)

166
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,120
(I took his fortune)

167
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,039
(and gave it to my husband.)

168
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,480
(Is that man)

169
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,519
(Officer Shen?)

170
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:51,919
(Yes.)

171
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,320
(Shen Nan)

172
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,000
is my husband from my past life.

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,440
(I bled myself to save Mo Yunxi)

174
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,399
(out of guilt)

175
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,416
(and also for the sake of the contract.)

176
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,759
But now,

177
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,759
the contract is void.

178
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,559
Mo Yunxi will recover soon.

179
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,679
But Shen Nan

180
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,320
(will die.)

181
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,240
(Shen Nan.)

182
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,120
(Wake up.)

183
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
(Wake up.)

184
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,000
Where are we going?

185
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,000
It's so dark. I'm scared.

186
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,759
Don't be afraid.

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
