00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:53,280
(The Mo's Textile Shop)

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,719
Please look around.

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,000
Fabric, ready-made clothes,
rouge, and jewelry.

6
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,439
What would you like?

7
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,599
This dress is so pretty.

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,000
Madam, you have a good taste.

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,840
It's a pattern from Shengjing.

10
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,159
We are the only ones
who have it in Jiangzhou.

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,640
All the ladies are fond of it.

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,280
But would I look good in this?

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,719
Madam, you are so modest.

14
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,439
You're such a natural beauty.

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,359
This brocade will match you perfectly.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,319
To be honest.

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,920
My little boy specifically
told his mother

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,640
to pick him up after school
in this brocade dress

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,120
to look good in front of others.

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
(If I wear this to pick up Shuheng,)

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,040
(he should be happy, too.)

22
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,239
(But this dress
costs five taels of silver.)

23
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,000
(Well, just this once.)

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,840
Sir.

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,640
I'll take this dress.

26
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,560
I sent you to get groceries.

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,640
And what happened?

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,280
You bought yourself a dress.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,120
What's the point
of dressing up every day?

30
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,159
Who do you think you are?

31
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,040
You don't deserve
to spend my son's money!

32
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,239
I made embroidery samples
for the tailor shop to make money.

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,359
I didn't use Shaoqing's wages.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,039
You're quite something now.

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,159
You're saving money on your own?

36
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm telling you.

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,479
Each and every penny

38
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,400
spent at our place

39
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:17,000
comes from Shaoqing and no one else.

40
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,759
If you're making extra money,

41
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,680
then tell me,

42
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,759
why didn't you buy me
the gold-plated hairpin

43
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,319
I fancied the other day?

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,599
You dare to buy a dress for yourself?

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,520
How dare you?

46
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,439
Mother.

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,199
Mother.

48
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,199
Mother.

49
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,960
How dare you rebel against me?

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,319
No.

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,919
How dare you push me?

52
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,000
I-I didn't.

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
I'll teach you a good lesson.

54
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,080
Mother.

55
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:42,759
Mother.

56
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:44,639
Mother.

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,520
Mother.

58
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:45,919
Mother.

59
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,879
How dare you?

60
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,840
Mother, please don't.

61
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,919
Don't cut my dress.

62
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,240
How dare you?

63
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,080
Don't.

64
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,280
That's the whole story.

65
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,960
There is evidence

66
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,759
that she held a sharp weapon
against Xinyao.

67
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,319
You're upright and just, Officer Shen.

68
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,159
I'm sure you'll look into it.

69
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,560
Right?

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,039
I can't rely solely on your words

71
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,319
to solve the case.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,360
Listen.

73
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,159
Mrs. Pei, I think you should
come to county office

74
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,879
and confront your mother-in-law
in person.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,400
How imposing, Officer Shen.

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,599
First,

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,879
please call her Miss Luo.

78
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,520
She has a name,

79
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,879
not Mrs. Pei

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,039
or an accessory.

81
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,439
Secondly,

82
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,840
if you want to know what happened,

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,000
I have my way.

84
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,840
Like what?

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,759
The Wangchuan Inn uses special incense
to guide guests into dreams.

86
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,439
The one you used was called
"A Dream of Millet".

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,479
The guest controls the dream.

88
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,120
This one is called
"Endless Worldly Concerns".

89
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,400
It can take you to Luo Xinyao's past

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,960
to show you

91
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,840
everything she has been through.

92
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,680
How do I know if that's true?

93
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,199
You've been through this, Officer Shen.

94
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,240
Do I still need to prove it?

95
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
You're injured.

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,759
Don't be afraid.

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,759
Just fall asleep.

98
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,199
Did we meet 15 years ago?

99
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,720
Officer Shen.

100
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,399
Focus on the case, okay?

101
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,199
This is Luo Xinyao?

102
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,759
She looks like
a different person, doesn't she?

103
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,639
Back then she was so lively,

104
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,199
nothing like how dull
and lifeless she looks now.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,920
Hey, pretty.

106
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,560
You look so lovely.

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,720
Come on, let's have a good time.

108
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,279
Let go of me.

109
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,439
"Endless Worldly Concerns"
can only reproduce the scenes.

110
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
Others can't see you.

111
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,800
Nor can you affect them.

112
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,519
Let go of me!

113
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,399
Let go of me!

114
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,360
What do you want?

115
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,399
Under His Majesty's reign,

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,800
how dare you be so presumptuous?

117
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,480
What's up, pretty boy?
Fancy sticking your nose in?

118
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
I'll make you pick your teeth up

119
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,800
off the ground!

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,639
I've passed the imperial exam.

121
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,920
You'd be violating the laws

122
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,439
if you dared lay a finger on me.

123
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,240
And you'll surely end up in prison.

124
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,639
Think carefully.

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,480
Fine.

126
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
You win.

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,560
It's him.

128
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,240
Miss, are you alright?

129
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,959
Thank you for your timely rescue.

130
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
I have no way to repay you.

131
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,079
I hope you won't disdain
this small token of gratitude.

132
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,360
They had a sweet story back in the day.

133
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,199
He saved her once.

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,319
And this foolish girl thought

135
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
that he would protect her
from all the harm in the future.

136
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,600
Little did she know
that all the harm would come from him.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,120
Mother, why did you call for me

138
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,120
so late at night?

139
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,480
On your knees.

140
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,720
Did you beat Heng
with a rattan just now?

141
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,319
Mother.

142
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,040
Heng is not a kid anymore.

143
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,680
He should learn manners.

144
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,600
He keeps acting domineering

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,079
and bullying others.

146
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,920
I did it to teach him a lesson...

147
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,279
Oh, my.

148
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,560
Since when does an outsider

149
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,040
get to discipline
a child of our Pei family?

150
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,920
You found a nice excuse.

151
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,399
But I know exactly what you're thinking.

152
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,920
You've been harboring resentment

153
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
against me

154
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,120
for doting on Heng.

155
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,560
Now you're beating him

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,120
to intimidate me, aren't you?

157
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,839
I have no such intention.

158
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,319
I was reckless on this matter.

159
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,839
Please forgive me.

160
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,720
Forgive you?

161
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,360
Kneel for four hours.

162
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,839
Don't get up
no matter who pleads for mercy.

163
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:26,720
On your knees.

164
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,839
Yes.

165
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,680
Shaoqing is back.

166
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,360
Cheers.

167
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,519
Keep drinking.

168
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,600
Cheers.

169
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,600
Honey.

170
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,720
Honey.

171
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,600
Weren't you teaching young master Hu'er?

172
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Who did you drink with?

173
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,000
Yanhong.

174
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,120
The lipstick marks on his neck...

175
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,840
He calls himself a scholar?

176
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,720
Yanhong.

177
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,399
(On your knees.)

178
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,480
(Who do you think you are?)

179
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,080
(You don't deserve it.
How dare you rebel against me?)

180
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,159
Oh no.

181
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,279
She's too upset.
