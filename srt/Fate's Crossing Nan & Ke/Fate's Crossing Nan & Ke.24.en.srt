=Episode 24=

3
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,439
After drinking this cup of wine,

4
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,640
from now on,

5
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,719
you'll be my husband.

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,319
Since the case of Yongning Village,

7
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,680
I've been in love with you.

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,359
Now, my wishes have come true.

9
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,936
We'll be together
even if our hair turns grey.

10
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm right by your side.

11
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,640
I won't go anywhere.

12
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,824
Together even if our hair turns grey?

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Do you not wish for this?

14
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,560
Have I done something wrong?

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,519
No, you are very good.

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,480
Everything before our eyes

17
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,280
is very good.

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,959
But what I want

19
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,840
is only Ke.

20
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,520
Zhuang Zhou becomes a butterfly,
a dream of Nanke.

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,112
It's time to wake up.

22
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,280
I don't know

23
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,599
since when you've become so clever.

24
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,400
Haven't you said it?

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,280
That person is just an illusion.

26
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,000
She has long been buried
with that dream in Yongning Village.

27
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,560
Right?

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,960
(How can you take a dream seriously?)

29
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,639
The person you saw

30
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,759
was nothing but an illusion.

31
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,230
She has long been buried with that dream
in Yongning Village

32
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,528
and will never come back.

33
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,520
Why did you do this?

34
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,319
Wuyue helped me give all the guests
a good dream.

35
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,199
So I thought

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,479
to repay you for that dream.

37
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:27,360
The parents are in good health.

38
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:32,672
A lovely wife and a beautiful family.

39
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,400
How wonderful.

40
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,319
Then I fall into this illusion,

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,719
yet you die alone.

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,000
I won't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

43
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,680
I have seen too many scenes
of parting in life and death.

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,599
I never liked them.

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,256
Then you underestimate me too much.

46
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,599
In my life,

47
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
I've bled much,

48
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,280
but have never shed tears.

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,800
No matter it's a beautiful dream

50
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,839
or a nightmare,

51
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,439
I must face reality once waking up.

52
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,120
Then I'll be relieved.

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,839
Promise me.

54
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,879
No crying.

55
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:57,959
Ke.

56
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,120
What kind of person was I
in my past life?

57
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,800
You could read,

58
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,120
paint,

59
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,279
and recite many poems.

60
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,800
What were you like then

61
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,519
in the past life?

62
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,680
I can't remember.

63
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,839
Probably like Meng,

64
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,279
accompanied her husband

65
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,079
by reading

66
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,040
painting,

67
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,560
playing the guqin,

68
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,519
and writing.

69
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,279
If there were a chance to do it over,

70
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:37,279
would you make the same choice?

71
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,240
Of course.

72
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,720
But I don't want you to be so silly.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,600
Didn't you promise me

74
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,199
that you wouldn't cry?

75
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,096
I didn't cry.

76
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,000
Then I'll give you a gift.

If this continues, even if not dead,
he'll lose half of his life.

What did you say?

145
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,720
Ke's soul is connected to the flowers
and trees of Wangchuan.

146
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,879
That day, I saw a ray of red light
over the Western Hills.

147
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,159
I could feel

148
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
that was Ke's spirit gathering.

149
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,200
If you want her to come back to life,

150
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,519
you must nurture the same flower
with Spirit Essence Stones.

151
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
As for when they can be cultivated,

152
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm not sure.

153
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,639
Spirit Essence Stones.

154
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:19,080
You are deceiving him.

155
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,240
Life is long.

156
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,039
Despair is hope itself.

157
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,120
Having some hope is always good.

158
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,799
The sunshine is very good today.

Let's stay outside a bit longer then.

161
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,960
A few days ago,
there was a strange tale in Jiangzhou.

162
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,784
The Wangchuan Inn at Baihua Lane
disappeared overnight

163
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,519
as if it had never existed.

164
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,720
I guess Wuyue got tired of it
and wanted to find another place.

165
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,600
Although I don't know
where she will settle down,

166
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,799
the Wangchuan Inn is always there.

167

fifty years, or one hundred years,
