=Episode 16=

3
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:56,736
(Mo's Residence)

4
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,719
(I was the one who wronged you.)

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,159
(This time,)

6
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,239
(no matter what, I must help you.)

7
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,359
(Stop trying to be tough.)

8
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,079
(Leave the martial arts competition
to me.)

9
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,319
(Dad asked you to rest well.)

10
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,519
(Don't worry about checking
the account books.)

11
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,439
(I've got it.)

12
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,200
What are these?

13
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,680
Your nightmares.

14
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,480
Your obsessions will haunt you
in your dreams

15
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,879
day and night, relentlessly until death.

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,439
And my duty

17
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,040
is to resolve them for you.

18
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,159
Open this door,

19
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,319
and you will see the truth.

20
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,360
The truth?

21
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,199
Don't you want to know

22
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,400
what your parents

23
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,479
and your brother Mo Xingze

24
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,240
think of you?

25
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,888
(Mo's Residence)

26
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,759
(Then, who is Mo Yunxi to you?)

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,520
(Is he worthy of your all-out efforts?)

28
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,360
(He and you are)

29
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,479
(not the same.)

30
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,080
You're right.

31
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,520
He really isn't the same.

32
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,839
The doctor said

33
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,759
if the fever doesn't subside
in these two days,

34
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,000
he might suffer from hysteria
in the future.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,839
It's all your fault.

36
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,800
You always say the eldest son
should bring glory to the family.

37
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,079
Otherwise, he wouldn't have ignored
his own health

38
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,480
and studied day and night.

39
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,399
If anything happens to my son,

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,279
what should I do?

41
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,480
Grandfather's greatest wish
before he passed away

42
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,519
was for someone from our family
to become an official.

43
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,720
Yunxi is my eldest son.

44
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,079
Of course, I've been a bit harsh on him.

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,759
But I never thought
it would come to this.

46
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,639
Is Xingze not our son?

47
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,959
You don't just have Yunxi
as the only son.

48
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,759
Father, Mother.

49
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,000
Is Yunxi feeling better?

50
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,280
Xingze,

51
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,360
do you want your brother
to get better soon?

52
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,560
If he encounters difficulties,

53
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,240
will you be willing
to sacrifice yourself to protect him?

54
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:23,904
Okay.

55
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,000
Then, starting today,

56
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,879
you must shoulder the responsibility
of the eldest son of the Mo family.

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,939
What he is unwilling to do,

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,680
what he can't do,

59
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,319
you must do it in his stead.

60
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,120
You must strive to stand out

61
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,519
to protect this family

62
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,680
and your brother in the future.

63
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,600
Let him have a life of peace and safety.

64
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:39,959
Can you do that?

65
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,864
Yes.

66
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,270
You can't even memorize this.

67
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,839
How will you achieve scholarly honors
in the future?

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,480
Your hand.

69
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,399
Stretch out your hand.

70
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,819
How will you achieve scholarly honors
in the future?

71
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,399
How will you support our family?

72
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,480
How will you protect your brother?

73
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,600
I must protect my brother.

74
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,560
I must support our family.

75
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,439
I can't let Father down.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,040
Stop trying to be tough.

77
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,680
Leave the martial arts competition
to me.

78
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,480
Didn't Father ask

79
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,160
you to rest well?

80
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,600
Don't worry about checking
the account books.

81
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:39,328
(Accounts)

82
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,040
I've got it.

83
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,920
Drink it while it's warm.

84
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,000
It's windy outside.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,160
And you're not in good health.

86
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,920
Don't always go outside.

87
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,079
You shouldn't read
the account books either.

88
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,680
Leave everything to your brother.

89
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,879
You should focus on recuperating.

90
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,040
Your brother's insomnia
never seems to improve.

91
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,800
His body has always been frail.

92
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,000
Now his vital energy has been damaged.

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,079
What should we do about it?

94
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't just stand there.

95
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,920
Try to come up with a solution.

96
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,839
Got it.

97
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,160
See?

98
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,519
You've always been loved

99
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,600
by your father and mother,

100
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,360
especially your brother, Mo Xingze.

101
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,879
You think he took away the glory
that belonged to the eldest son.

102
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,920
But you don't know

103
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,839
he has borne countless pressures
and responsibilities for you.

104
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,519
What reason do you have for self-pity?

105
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,759
They have never disdained you.

106
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,839
They've all been trying their best
to love you.

107
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,000
Mo Yunxi.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Wake up.

109
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,079
The ones who love you
are waiting for you to come home.

110
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,519
Ke.

111
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,000
You're awake.

112
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,920
What's wrong with you?

113
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,200
Is it because of me?

114
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,440
I'm just a bit tired.

115
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,559
Please take me back to the inn.

116
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:09,639
(Mo's Residence)

117
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,279
Where is Ke?

118
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,399
Why didn't she come out all night?

119
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,519
What happened?

120
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,159
Move, where did you come from?

121
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,200
Stop snooping around here.

122
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,639
I'm asking you where Ke is.

123
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,399
With your look, you still fancy Miss Ke?

124
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,320
Tell you what.

125
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,519
Our master said

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,159
Miss Ke cured
young master Yunxi's illness

127
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,039
and they were in love with each other,

128
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,879
so he would let young master Yunxi
propose to her soon.

129
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

130
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,200
What are you going to do?

131
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,200
Nan, Nan.

132
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,088
Nan.

133
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,159
Nan.

134
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,100
You've been suspended.
Why haven't you earned your lesson?

135
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,639
The Mo family is not someone
we can afford to offend.

136
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,720
Don't be so impulsive again.

137
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,280
I just want to ask her
for an explanation.
