00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:50,784
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,439
Has Ke already discovered
that she can't taste anything?

4
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,648
Thanks for telling me the truth.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,560
I can't just watch Ke die.

6
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:03,936
We have to find the man in black
as soon as possible.

7
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:05,840
There are so many mountains
outside the city.

8
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,680
It's not easy to find his place.

9
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,239
Take this.

10
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,599
It might help you find him.

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,519
This is?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
The token of the man in black.

13
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,840
You are quite interesting.

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,560
Despite only having half
of Boqi's bloodline,

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,744
you can still create dreams.

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,480
How about this?

17
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,640
After she dies,

18
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,200
you can inherit

19
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,760
this Wangchuan Inn.

20
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,656
How is it?

21
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:35,000
No.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,920
Ke won't die.

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,600
Wuyue.

24
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,840
Take it.

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,536
Consider it as helping me.

26
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:45,719
Please take care of Ke for me.

27
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:47,808
Even if it's like finding a needle
in a haystack,

28
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,319
I must find him within three days.

29
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,359
Also, the Mo family has sent
their visiting card several times.

30
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,200
No matter what,
we'll have to give them an answer.

31
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,959
Although these stories

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,719
sound a bit absurd,

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,920
Wangchuan Inn itself is
an extraordinary place.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,719
So, you should be able
to understand, right?

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,599
So this is the reason she rejected me.

36
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,520
She has never had
romantic feelings for me.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,960
From beginning to end,
it was all my misunderstanding.

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,768
Officer Shen, what are you doing?

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
As a couple, we've disrupted your fate.

40
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:29,984
We should apologize to you.

41
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,840
Couple?

42
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,120
Ke and I are already betrothed.

43
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,280
If you don't mind,

44
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,919
on the sixth of this month,
please come to our wedding.

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,719
In that case,
congratulations to the both of you.

46
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:12,672
(Mo's Residence)

47
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,400
This token has the aura
of the man in black.

48
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,479
Follow the direction
in which the token glows,

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,128
and you should be able to find him.

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,400
Come out!

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,840
I didn't expect you to find this place.

52
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,280
But so what?

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,879
In order to save you,

54
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,968
that girl forced me to show up
with a do-or-die approach.

55
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,960
Yet it still didn't change
the inevitable outcome.

56
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,919
You're lying.

57
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,960
If Ke could trade her life for mine,
there must be a way to save her.

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,479
You know it's a life for a life.

59
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,759
Can you take back
what has been given away?

60
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,800
Young man,

61
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,959
there's no such thing
as best of both worlds.

62
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,759
Giving you some time to be together

63
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,959
was me being generous.

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,399
Given the time spent,

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,680
her five senses

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,079
should have already faded away.

67
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,720
Please, save Ke.

68
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,560
As long as you can save her,
I'd rather face my own death.

69
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,360
Face your death?

70
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,600
Your life was saved
through her utmost effort.

71
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,839
You want to die?

72
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,879
It's not up to you.

73
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,879
Is Ke truly doomed?

74
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,279
It's fate.

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,560
You can't force it.

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,879
What if I insist on forcing it?

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,720
That's what Ke asked me once.

78
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,920
My response today remains the same.

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,560
The price of forcing it is very painful,

80
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,480
not something ordinary people can bear.

81
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,519
She has the God-given powers
of the Boqi clan.

82
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,192
Yet she couldn't get away unscathed.

83
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:26,000
You're just a mortal. What can you do?

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,519
Now that we've met,

85
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,000
please give her this parting gift
from me.

86
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,600
Wuyue.

87
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:15,959
It's me.

88
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,399
You still remember to come back?

89
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,720
That man is notoriously unpleasant
to deal with.

90
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,140
You were so reckless to go to his place.

91
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,840
Aren't you afraid of losing your life?

92
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,600
That would be what I deserve.

93
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,800
Shen Nan,

94
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:38,272
I don't need you to
blame yourself like this.

95
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,319
I don't like it.

96
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
It'll make me feel

97
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,399
your kindness to me now
is your way of atoning.

98
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,519
But...

99
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,959
Do not feel that you owe me.

100
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,879
You don't owe me anything.

101
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,480
No, that's not it.

102
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,160
Everything I do is because I love you.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,199
I like hearing that.

104
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:06,879
Say that more.

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,160
I love you.

106
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,199
Love you only.

107
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,680
Reaching the blue sky,

108
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,000
or down to the netherworld,

109
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,000
only you.

110
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,360
Ke.

111
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,240
Let's get married tomorrow.

112
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Okay.

113
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,480
But

114
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,439
I look too unsightly now.

115
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,199
That man

116
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,600
must have thought
of a solution for me, right?

117
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,519
(Now that we've met,)

118
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,600
please give her this parting gift
from me.

119
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,720
(This pill can restore her five senses
for one day.)

120
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,800
(At dawn the next day,)

121
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,199
(she will pass away immediately.)

122
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,240
Thank you.

123
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,399
I love you, too.
