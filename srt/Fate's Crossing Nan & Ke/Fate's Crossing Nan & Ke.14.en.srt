=Episode 14=

3
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,880
What are you to me?

4
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,600
Why should I understand you?

5
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,280
Then, who is Mo Yunxi to you?

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,479
Is he worthy of your all-out efforts?

7
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,120
He and you are

8
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:07,799
not the same.

9
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,840
Not the same.

10
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,079
Get out of the way.

11
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,848
Get out of the way.

12
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,799
Go back with me.

13
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:47,680
Go back?

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,480
I didn't plan on going back
once I got out.

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,959
Come catch me if you can.

16
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,544
Come on.

17
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:04,416
Hey! You!

18
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,319
Get out of the way.

19
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,319
Are you crazy?

20
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,216
(Baihua Lane)

21
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:32,736
(Baihua Lane)

22
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,280
Ke.

23
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,240
Did you hear any strange sounds?

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,000
It's alright.

25
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,800
Maybe some stray cat ran in.

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,439
Officer Shen.

27
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,280
What are you doing?

28
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,319
Officer Shen, as an officer,

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,680
don't you know that trespassing
on private property

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
is against the law?

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,520
Shen Nan, what are you going to do?

32
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,280
Capturing an escaped convict.

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,039
That's ridiculous.

34
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,599
What convict could there be at my place?

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,800
The thief Cui Qi escaped this morning.

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,800
I saw him rushing into Baihua Lane.

37
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,960
This lane only has one exit.

38
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,280
He couldn't possibly have flown away.

39
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,960
So you're certain he's hiding in my inn?

40
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,719
Whether he is or isn't,

41
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,919
we'll know soon enough.

42
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,024
Go!

43
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,159
You've really tried hard to frame me.

44
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,080
Miss Ke,

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,759
you are suspected
of harboring a criminal.

46
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,959
Please come with me.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,512
Ke.

48
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,208
Ke.

49
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,319
Ke.

50
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,240
Ke.

51
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,040
Officer Lu, Ke is truly wronged.

52
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,439
Neither of us saw him come in.

53
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,720
How could we possibly harbor him?

54
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,079
You are a good person.

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,560
Could you please talk to Officer Shen
on my behalf?

56
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,160
The evidence is solid.

57
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,160
It's probably difficult to handle.

58
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,199
What should I do then?

59
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,160
Don't cry.

60
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,839
Don't cry just yet.

61
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,120
Let me think.

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,439
Wait for my news.

63
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:01,856
(Jiangzhou County Office)

64
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,639
Officer Shen.

65
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,560
Shouldn't all criminals
be put in prison?

66
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,399
Why do I

67
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,319
receive such special treatment?

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,360
Before Cui Qi confesses
to the crime of jailbreak,

69
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,519
we have the right to detain you.

70
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,160
That man is seriously injured.

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,279
He must be unconscious
for at least a dozen days.

72
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,680
You're going to put me
under house arrest?

73
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,920
Within seven days,

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,680
I'll clarify the matter
of the jailbreak.

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,160
Then you can naturally leave here.

76
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,360
Before that,

77
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
just stay here.

78
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,120
Food, clothing, and daily necessities
will be sent to you.

79
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,879
You mean,

80
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,279
you want to avoid the night
of the full moon?

81
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,680
What gives you the right to do this?

82
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,360
You think I would be grateful to you?

83
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,720
Or should I thank you for letting me

84
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,199
experience the life of a prisoner?

85
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,759
Don't be too full of yourself, Shen Nan.

86
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't need your gratitude.

87
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
I just want you to be safe.

88
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,664
Curse me

89
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,720
or hate me.

90
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,000
It doesn't matter.

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,439
Why didn't you go on patrol?

92
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,839
I had another brother take my place.

93
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,519
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

94
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,479
It seems I still couldn't keep it
from you.

95
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,920
You intentionally let Cui Qi out,

96
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,480
forced him to flee into Baihua Lane,

97
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,760
and then asked our people
to search Wangchuan Inn.

98
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,120
Did you plan this
from the very beginning

99
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,279
to take Miss Ke away?

100
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,319
This doesn't seem like something
you could do.

101
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,360
Love really is blind.

102
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:12,879
I just want to protect her.

103
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,839
Did you ever ask her

104
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,560
if she actually wanted this kind
of protection?

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,399
I don't know what happened between you,

106
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,040
but liking someone doesn't mean
ignoring her wishes

107
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,480
and being tough in treating her well.

108
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,160
You are confining her this way.

109
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,199
She must be so upset.

110
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,379
You don't need to worry about this.

111
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,439
I won't let her go.

112
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,959
You've seen it.

113
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,319
I tried but it didn't work.

114
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,199
But why did he do this?

115
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,639
He said he liked Ke before.

116
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,160
Sure enough.

117
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,600
Can't believe a man's lies.

118
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,160
Don't tar everyone with the same brush.

119
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,480
I'm innocent.

120
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,079
There should still be someone
who can save Miss Ke now.

121
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,959
It's simply ridiculous.

122
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,360
It's fine even if you failed
to guard a felon.

123
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,480
But you offended a friend
of Commander Mo,

124
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,079
caused a scene at her inn,

125
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,519
and even arrested the innkeeper
for custody.

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,120
You...

127
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,279
Shen Nan.

128
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,800
You've got a lot of nerve.

129
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,120
I didn't expect you to ask someone
from the Mo family to step in.

130
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,159
Since it's a misunderstanding,

131
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,240
can I leave now?

132
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,872
Sure.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,159
Of course.

134
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,200
Thank you.

135
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,320
Cui Qi was captured at Wangchuan Inn.

136
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,840
Why can't I investigate her?

137
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,640
Who allowed you to make decisions
on your own?

138
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
If we offend Commander Mo,

139
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,520
will I face good consequences
in the future?

140
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,919
Starting today,

141
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,720
you are suspended.

142
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
Go home and reflect on your actions.

143
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,839
What are you looking at?

144
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,480
Didn't I make myself clear?

145
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,679
When you acted without permission,

146
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,720
you should've thought of this outcome.

147
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,568
You...

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,320
Ke, you've finally come back.

149
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,240
You are indeed smart.

150
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:33,840
You even knew to seek help
from the Mo family.

151
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
I just didn't expect

152
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,879
that the Mo family
would actually help me.

153
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,480
You've helped the Mo family.

154
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,320
Of course, they won't just sit by.

155
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,799
Help?

156
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,159
Mr. Mo wanted

157
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,080
to thank you for curing
his son's illness.

158
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,719
And he also wanted to invite you
to his residence for a talk tonight.

159
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,799
What's wrong, Ke?

160
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,480
Because of me,

161
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,559
his dreams were interrupted.

162
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,679
I can't probe into Mo Yunxi's past,

163
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,600
or find the root of his mental knots.

164
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,600
Now he can fall asleep

165
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,440
just because of the rest of the incense.

166
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,679
Ke, you once said

167
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,200
the incense of Wangchuan
can only be used once.

168
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,480
Yes.

169
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,360
So, it was too early

170
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,960
for Mr. Mo to thank me.

171
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,200
Mo Yunxi's nightmare

172
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,559
is still unresolved.
