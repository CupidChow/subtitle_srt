1
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,698
=Fate's Crossing Nan & Ke=

2
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:51,246
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,520
I thought those were just folklore.

4
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,840
But it turns out
the Boqi clan really exists.

5
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,039
That's right.

6
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,439
I am the current guardian
selected from the Boqi clan.

7
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,959
The Wangchuan Inn exists

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
to devour the guests' nightmares

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,000
so that whoever steps in here

10
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,439
can leave behind
their most painful memories

11
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,760
and start a new life

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,560
after a beautiful dream.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,760
No wonder Officer Shen said

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,120
that all our guests
have vanished into thin air.

15
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,159
It turns out they changed
their identities

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,000
to start new lives.

17
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,280
But why don't you explain?

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,000
The clamorous words of the mass

19
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,120
may obscure the facts.

20
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,680
People only see what they want to see

21
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,560
and hear what they want to hear.

22
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,959
I'm tired. I'm going to rest.

23
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,560
Miss Ke.

24
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,360
Can I stay here?

25
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,560
Aren't you scared that I'm a monster?

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,280
I almost died once.

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,479
What is there to fear?

28
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,199
I like it here and want to stay.

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,240
Why?

30
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,439
Because...

31
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,599
Being around you makes me feel at home.

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,439
In that case,

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,479
you can stay.

34
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:11,552
(Baihua Lane)

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,840
Luo Xinyao, listen.

36
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,639
You married into our Pei family.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,639
So abide by our rules.

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,280
You bought clothes
the moment I looked away.

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,199
Are you trying to seduce someone

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,520
in that provocative dress?

41
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,439
So useless.

42
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,840
You might as well die.

43
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,919
How come my friends' mothers
are all young and beautiful

44
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,400
and you look like a peasant woman?

45
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,639
So embarrassing.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,520
Don't come to pick me up again.

47
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,840
Xinyao.

48
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,759
I know my mother is a bit harsh.

49
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,800
But it wasn't easy for her to raise me.

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,439
Please put up with her for my sake.

51
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,599
(But what about me?)

52
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,360
(Is life easy for me?)

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,319
(So embarrassing.)

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,280
(You might as well die.)

55
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,560
(You all wish I were dead.)

56
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,159
(Alright.)

57
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,520
(Then I shall fulfill your wish.)

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,600
Why are you so upset, Miss?

59
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,759
What a beautiful brocade you have.

60
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,399
What a pity.

61
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,600
Have a cup of hot tea.

62
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,720
Don't catch a cold.

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,199
Ladies, I just heard you
saying that it's an inn.

64
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,680
I left home in a hurry

65
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,319
and didn't bring any money.

66
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,279
I'm so sorry.

67
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,399
Miss, don't be afraid.

68
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,759
We run a legit business here.

69
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,920
Yeah, the roads are slippery at night.

70
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,839
Why don't you leave after dawn?

71
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
It's safer that way.

72
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,160
Rest assured.

73
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,879
Our boss lady won't mind
putting you up for a night.

74
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,120
Judging by your accent,

75
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,800
you're not a local.

76
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,920
I came from Rongcheng.

77
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,399
I married far from hometown

78
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,879
and settled here in Jiangzhou
with my husband.

79
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,439
You filed the report?

80
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,879
Officer.

81
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,120
My wife left home and has not returned.

82
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,560
She might do something foolish.

83
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,519
Please search for her.

84
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
I implore you, Officer.

85
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,399
Young master.

86
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
Please brief us

87
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,120
about the circumstances

88
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,360
so we can make

89
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,480
a targeted search.

90
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,240
My wife barely knows anyone
or has anywhere to go

91
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,879
in Jiangzhou.

92
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,000
She never socializes.

93
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,959
I've searched a few places

94
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,920
but to no avail.

95
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,439
So she must have left the city.

96
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,360
Officer.

97
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,199
I am Pei Shaoqing,

98
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,480
the tutor of
the young master of the Lu family.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,519
Hu'er?

100
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,360
That's right.

101
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,519
I teach Hu'er at Mr. Lu's mansion.

102
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,720
My wife

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,759
is named Xinyao.

104
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,000
She's from Rongcheng.

105
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,399
We got married ten years ago

106
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,519
and settled here.

107
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,720
She manages household affairs

108
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,079
and takes care

109
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,439
of our son at home.

110
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,560
It seems that you get along well.

111
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,560
She has no reason to leave.

112
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,600
We just had a small fight.

113
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,639
It has happened before.

114
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,439
Somehow she got upset this time

115
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,879
and just ran off.

116
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:16,879
Mr. Pei.

117
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,199
Just wait at home.

118
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,839
I will send people search
in the direction out of the city.

119
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,959
I'm counting on you.

120
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,879
Thank you.

121
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,240
Officer Shen.

122
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,720
Ke wants to see you.

123
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,200
I thought you wouldn't come.

124
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,919
But you did, to my surprise.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,399
Why don't you report the case

126
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,120
to the county office

127
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,039
and ask me to come?

128
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,519
Here is the petition.

129
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,039
(Petition)
I, Luo Xinyao,

130
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,879
am writing to sue my mother-in-law.

131
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,039
Luo Xinyao?

132
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,840
This is Luo Xinyao.

133
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,279
Is Pei Shaoqing your husband?

134
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,720
This morning,

135
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,519
he reported you missing

136
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,879
for the entire night

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,919
and asked us to find you.

138
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,440
He still cares about me.

139
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,799
It's just a trivial matter.

140
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,799
Officer Shen.

141
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,440
Will you accept this lawsuit petition?

142
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
What charges do you wish to bring?

143
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,799
