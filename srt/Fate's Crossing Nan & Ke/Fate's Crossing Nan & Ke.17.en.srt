00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:13,568
(Mo's Residence)

4
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,319
Take care.

5
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,159
(This time, I hurt him so badly.)

6
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,919
(He probably won't come
looking for me again.)

7
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,759
Who are you?

8
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,080
Why are you here alone?

9
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,080
Have you been separated
from your parents?

10
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,400
I'll wait with you.

11
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,919
This is my favorite food.

12
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,919
Would you like to try some?

13
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,199
(Turns out we met
hundreds of years ago.)

14
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,400
But I hope it has something
to do with me,

15
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,039
even if not now,

16
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,439
in the future it will also be fine.

17
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,840
(So what if he is someone
from the past too?)

18
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,080
(Your remaining life is only to atone
and to watch over Wangchuan.)

19
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,520
(You can't hope for anything else.)

20
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,960
(If we meet again,)

21
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,800
(we'll just be strangers.)

22
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,680
Since you came back from Mo's Residence
on the full moon day,

23
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,680
your health has been declining.

24
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,680
What should we do?

25
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,120
It's alright.

26
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,199
It's just some sequelae.

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,560
Sequelae?

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,199
Every time the moon is full,

29
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,120
my magical power will disappear.

30
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,599
That day when I forcibly burned incense
to enter Mo Yunxi's dream,

31
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,680
I suffered some backlash.

32
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,840
But don't worry.

33
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,159
My life is connected to that tree.

34
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,400
The water of Mengxi Creek
will slowly heal me.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,639
Ke.

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,560
I don't get it.

37
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,960
Although Mo Yunxi's family is powerful,

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,960
you're not a mortal of this world,

39
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,159
so you won't treat him differently
because of that.

40
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,319
Then why do you still take the risk
of backlash

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,360
to help him?

42
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,759
Do you like Mo Yunxi?

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,479
Was he your husband
in the previous life?

44
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,680
You want to be with him again?

45
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,879
So, disregarding the rules of Wangchuan,

46
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,400
you still want to help him
out of trouble.

47
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,520
It's not him.

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,840
It's not him?

49
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,719
The person I was fated with
in my past life is not him.

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,520
However,

51
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,000
there indeed are many
inseparable connections between us.

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,000
So I can't just sit by and do nothing

53
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,240
when he faces difficulties.

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,720
Whenever Mo Yunxi is in need,

55
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll always help him.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,199
But it has nothing to do with love.

57
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,959
I just

58
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,360
don't want to owe him anymore.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,839
If that's the case,

60
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,839
this matter is difficult to handle now.

61
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,439
How so?

62
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,707
(Happiness)

63
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
These are?

64
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,079
Sent by the Mo family.

65
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,368
The betrothal gifts.

66
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:01,024
(Wangchuan)

67
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,519
When will

68
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,079
this debt be settled?

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,639
Whose debt?

70
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,199
None of your business.

71
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,240
It's rumored that the Mo family
made a betrothal proposal for you today.

72
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
It seems it's not just a rumor.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,160
It's not what you think.

74
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,120
All of the betrothal gifts have been...

75
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,360
Why should I explain to you?

76
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,040
What exactly is your relationship
with Mo Yunxi?

77
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,079
Looks like

78
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,439
you're jealous.

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,720
I've already made it clear to you.

80
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,199
About us,

81
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,639
my affairs are none of your business.

82
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,319
Officer Shen, please go back.

00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,759

00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:23,600
You...

86
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,160
You don't treat Mo Yunxi
with this attitude.

87
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,480
Do you care about him
because of your past life?

88
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,199
Or do you just see him as a guest?

89
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,040
It has nothing to do with you, right?

90
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,639
