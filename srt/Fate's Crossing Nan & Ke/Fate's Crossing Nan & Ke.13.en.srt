=Fate's Crossing Nan & Ke=

2
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:50,784
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:52,800
(Mo's Residence)

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
You really came.

5
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,480
You followed me?

6
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,359
I just don't want you to take risks.

7
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,840
You and I are just passing strangers.

8
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,920
You should not pry into something.

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,000
Why do you always cast aside
others' concerns?

10
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,280
Because that's who I am.

11
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,239
But I've seen another side of you.

12
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,920
That side of you would cry, laugh,
act coquettishly,

13
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,239
stand up for justice, and
speak out against injustice.

14
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,760
Enough!

15
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,000
Shen Nan.

16
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,359
Don't forget what you've said.

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,319
How can you take a dream seriously?

18
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,519
The person you saw

19
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,879
was nothing but an illusion.

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,319
She has long been buried with that dream
in Yongning Village

21
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,840
and will never come back.

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,959
Take a close look.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,919
I'm not Meng.

24
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,400
I'm Ke.

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,719
(That's weird.)

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,919
(This girl clearly rejected me
during the day.)

27
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,479
(Why did she suddenly change her mind?)

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,879
Hurry up and guard at Yunxi's door.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,000
Make sure there won't be any trouble.

30
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,688
Got it.

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,839
(Old acquaintance?)

32
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,800
(He is really the one
I've been waiting for?)

33
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,560
Miss Ke.

34
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,599
Young master, no need for formalities.

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,479
Just call me Ke.

36
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,800
Ke.

37
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,479
Thanks for coming to help me this time.

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,039
If you can really cure my insomnia,

39
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,520
I'll surely reward you handsomely.

40
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,599
Then please give me the time
for burning an incense stick.

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
(Since he's an old acquaintance,)

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,240
(I'd like to see what the connection
between us is)

43
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,560
(in our past and present lives.)

44
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,599
(Happiness)
First bow to heaven and earth,

45
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,160
to honor the heaven and earth,
happily united for eternity.

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,360
Second bow to the parents,

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,920
to thank both parents
for raising the children.

48
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,040
Husband and wife bow to each other,

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,759
to commit to each other
in life and death.

50
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,240
My dear.

51
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,079
This is a prescription
from a famous doctor.

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,480
You will get better.

53
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:03,296
(Chuan)

54
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,560
As long as my husband stays safe,

55
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,759
I'm willing to give up everything.

56
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,439
Everything has its laws.

57
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,439
Yin and Yang need balance;
life and death offset each other.

58
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
If you want your husband to be safe,

59
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,240
you need to take away someone's fortune.

60
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,279
The person who just came
has the fate of a martial champion.

61
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,319
It would be the best fit.

62
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,480
Okay.

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,759
Our young master is amazing, right?

64
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,639
This year's martial champion
will undoubtedly be our young master.

65
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,399
The young master's illness
is very peculiar.

66
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,879
I'm really powerless to help.

67
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,319
The sky and the earth are anxious;
which family has a sick child.

68
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:13,279
His father or mother don't care,
hoping he meets the death soon.

69
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,040
(How can this be?)

70
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,920
(I originally thought I owed him
in only one lifetime.)

71
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,480
(It turns out to be every lifetime.)

72
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
I've actually harmed a person
to such an extent.

73
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,079
I'm sorry.

74
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,759
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,680
What's wrong with you?

76
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,040
Did you fail to enter the dream?

77
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,000
It doesn't matter.

78
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm used to it.

79
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,720
I've seen many famous doctors
over the years.

80
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,639
None could cure my stubborn disease.

81
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,160
You don't need to worry about it.

82
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,680
Sorry.

83
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,040
I've lost my composure.

84
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,319
Who's there?

85
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
How dare you peep?

86
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,879
The master sent me to take care
of the young master and Miss Ke.

87
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,759
Go report to my father.

88
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,920
Such behavior is against
the way of treating guests.

89
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,519
Do not do this again next time.

90
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,279
Yes, yes.

91
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,600
Miss Ke,

92
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm truly sorry.

93
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,799
My father means no harm.

94
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,399
Do not take it to heart.

95
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,440
(Given the servant's attitude,)

96
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
(Mo Yunxi's status in this family
is probably worrying.)

97
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,879
(But why?)

98
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,600
I've roughly understood your insomnia.

99
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,279
But as for how to treat it,

100
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,600
I still need to consider it carefully.

101
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,159
However, you can rest assured.

102
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,120
Tonight,

103
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,360
you'll surely be able to sleep tight.

Why are you still following me?

113
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,320
I'm not following you.

114
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,720
I'm just on night patrol.

115
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,600
Night patrol only covers the paths
