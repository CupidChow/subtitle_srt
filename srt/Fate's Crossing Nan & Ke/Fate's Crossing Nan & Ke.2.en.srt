00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:50,784
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,159
(Why does this Ke
look so much like that woman?)

4
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,079
You're injured.

5
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,840
(Is she a human)

6
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,359
(or a demon?)

7
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,319
You're on time today.

8
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,079
Where is the kid?

9
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,640
Relax. I'm not going to eat him.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,200
I'll stop teasing you.

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
Officer, please take that kid away.

12
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,760
He's been freeloading off me.

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,480
I don't like losing money.

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,200
Hu'er.

15
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,920
Ke.

16
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,040
Are you the eldest son of Mr. Lu?

17
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,519
I'm the head constable.

18
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,120
Your mother is looking for you.

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,519
Are you talking about Lady Yan?

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,280
(So that woman isn't his birth mother.)

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,519
(No wonder she didn't look for him.)

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,560
That's right.

23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,960
They are worried about you.

24
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,840
Let's go. I'll take you home.

25
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,159
Go on. It's time to go home.

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,919
Hu'er.

27
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,280
What happened
at the Wangchuan Inn last night?

28
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,280
This is a secret between Ke and me.

29
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,360
She told me not to tell anyone.

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960
I'm not "anyone".

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,479
You are the beloved one.

32
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,599
What?

33
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,840
You are Ke's beloved one.

34
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,560
I saw you holding her hand.

35
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,080
I guess I'll believe you.

36
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,159
Last night, Ke blindfolded me

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,039
and took me somewhere.

38
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,240
Hu'er.

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
Where did she take you?

40
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,800
To my former home.

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,319
A home without Lady Yan
and my younger brother.

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,719
My mother was still alive and well.

43
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
And my father didn't beat or scold me.

44
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't rush.

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Is it good?

46
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,879
We were a happy family of three.

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,904
And?

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
My mother sang my favorite lullaby
to put me to sleep.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,599
Then...

50
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,919
Then I woke up.

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
Ke told me

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,800
that it was all just a dream

53
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,240
and it was time to toughen up.

54
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,639
Ke told me to say goodbye
to a river lantern.

55
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,800
She said that my mother
lived inside that lantern.

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,039
And I must bid her farewell
to live a better life.

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,080
Let's go home.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,720
Officer Shen,
I knew you'd bring him back.

59
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,319
Hu'er just strayed into
the Wangchuan Inn.

60
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,560
He didn't get hurt.

61
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,240
But you, Mrs. Lu.

62
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,240
You'd better be more impartial

63
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,560
and take more care of him.

64
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,040
Thank you.

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,839
(Jiangzhou County Office)
Let's go, Hu'er.

66
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
How did you do that?

67
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,199
How did I do what?

68
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,839
You actually found him
in the Wangchuan Inn.

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,399
I brought him back.

70
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,600
But I'm worried Mrs. Lu
will keep mistreating him.

71
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,040
It's not as bad as you think.

72
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,839
While you were gone,

73
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
I spoke with Mrs. Lu.

74
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,839
She shared some sincere thoughts.

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
She wasn't horrible
to this child of her husband's

76
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,360
late wife.

77
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,879
She wants to get closer to him.

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,279
It's just that

79
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,839
Hu'er loves his deceased mother deeply

80
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,800
and sees his stepmother as an enemy.

81
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,279
(Ke told me to say goodbye
to a river lantern.)

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,800
She said that my mother
lived inside that lantern

83
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,399
and I must bid her farewell
to live a better life.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,879
Now I get it.

85
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,040
What?

86
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,360
I just find the Wangchuan Inn
quite interesting.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,399
(So is that woman called Ke.)

88
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,439
(What secrets)

89
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,920
(are you hiding after all?)

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,879
(Mother, you once said that)

91
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,000
people envy the divine power
bestowed upon our Boqi clan.

92
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,480
(We ingest nightmares
and weave beautiful dreams)

93
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,120
(in exchange for immortality.)

94
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,319
(But I don't think)

95
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,959
(that such a trade brings happiness.)

96
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,079
So, what brings happiness,
my sweetheart?

97
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,040
Seeing mountains,

98
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,079
the vast sea,

99
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,480
and the blooming flowers.

100
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,519
Anyway, we have to be free.

101
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,120
Alright.

102
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,000
Everyone has a right to choose

103
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,759
as long as there are no regrets.

104
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,399
(I can save your husband.)

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,680
(But you must agree to one condition.)

106
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,879
(From now on,)

107
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,399
(stay at the Wangchuan Inn forever)

108
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,839
(and guard it for me.)

109
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,639
(This is the cost you mentioned?)

110
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,879
That's right.

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,879
The Boqi clan is immortal
with the divine power

112
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,279
bestowed by heaven.

113
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,519
Yet you feed on dreams for life,

114
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,560
(which makes you the best guardians.)

115
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,439
(Use your freedom.)

116
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
My dear.

117
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,480
(To exchange for your husband's safety.)

118
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,560
My dear.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,240
(Keep my husband safe)

120
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,959
(and I will do everything.)

121
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,000
(But you must know)

122
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,959
(that everything has its laws.)

123
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,319
(There's a balance between
yin and yang, life and death.)

124
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,240
(Once you enter Wangchuan,
all the past is erased.)

125
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,079
(No more emotions, nor sorrow nor joy.)

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,199
(Regarding your husband,)

127
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,079
(even if you meet him one day,)

128
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,399
(you will be strangers.)

129
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,160
Given these terms,

130
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,160
will you still make this deal?

131
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,240
I'll do it.

132
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,480
Is it really worth it?

133
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,360
Yes, it is.

134
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,959
Without regret?

135
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,199
Without regret.

136
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,079
If it is destiny,

137
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,600
how can I not accept it?

138
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,079
Don't run. Stop!

139
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,439
Stop!

140
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:22,959
Don't run!

141
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,759
Stop!

142
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,560
Stop there.

143
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,040
Don't run!

144
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,519
(Baihua Lane)

145
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,120
Stop!

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,559
That girl is a runner.

147
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,440
Teach her a lesson

148
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,360
once we catch her.

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,136
Get her!

150
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,559
Stop!

151
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,320
- Open up.
- Open up.

152
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,279
Open the door.

153
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,679
Or I'll kill you.

154
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,799
Open up.

155
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,879
Open the door now.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Hurry, open the door.

157
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,360
Open up.

158
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,600
Open up.

159
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,600
Welcome to the Wangchuan Inn.

160
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,639
Open up. Come on.

161
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,759
What brought you here so late at night?

162
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:19,879
It's nothing.

163
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,360
We just came to see you.

164
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,240
Come on, don't do this.

165
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,720
Where are they?

166
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,600
They left.

167
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,039
But they were right there, trying to...

168
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,200
You must be mistaken.

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
Look at me now.

170
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,240
Am I not standing right here?

171
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,960
You are so pretty.

172
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Really?

173
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
Aren't you?

174
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,279
A pretty lady doesn't get punished

175
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,879
even if she makes a mistake.

176
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,120
People favor those who are pretty

177
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,840
even if they are venomous.

178
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,720
And the ugly ones

179
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,120
are easily seen as sinners even if

180
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,559
they've done nothing wrong.

181
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,840
Would you like to start over?

182
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,759
I can help you.

183
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,159
Legend has it that the Wangchuan Inn
can help people make their wishes...

184
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,559
Legends are not necessarily true.

185
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,159
But your decisions are true.

186
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,759
Have you decided?

187
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,200
(Jiangzhou County Office)
D-Demoness!

188
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,519
Demoness!

189
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,600
Demoness!

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,840
Demoness!

191
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:03,720
Demoness!

192
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,240
Demoness!

193
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,519
What is going on?

194
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,120
They're steamed bun shop owners.

195
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,480
They were found passed out
right outside Baihua Lane.

196
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,440
They're dazed for some reason.

197
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,039
Demoness!

198
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,360
They've been muttering that

199
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,559
the demoness harms people.

200
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,879
It's her again.

201
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,279
(Pretty as a fair jade,)

202
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,679
(venomous like a viper.)

203
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,480
(Is this your true self?)

204
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,759
(Or perhaps...)

205
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,519
What's wrong?

206
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,120
It's just been a few days,

207
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,039
and you're already obsessed with me?

208
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,440
I am Head Constable Shen Nan,

209
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,799
here to investigate the assault
on the steamed bun shop owners.

210
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,799
Please work with me, Miss Ke.

211
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,519
Steamed bun shop owners?

212
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,440
Who are they?

213
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,399
I don't know them.

214
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,799
Still denying it?

215
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,080
They were attacked outside Baihua Lane.

216
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,559
They woke up and went insane,

217
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,720
muttering about
a demoness harming people.

218
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,960
It must have something to do with you.

219
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,919
Really?

220
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,480
They call me

221
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
