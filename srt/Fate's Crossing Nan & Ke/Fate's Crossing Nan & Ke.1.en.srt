=Tales of the Dream Eaters=

2
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:50,784
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,759
(Legend has it that deep within
Jiangzhou's Baihua Lane,)

4
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,120
(there is an inn called Wangchuan.)

5
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,280
(People say the owner
of the Wangchuan Inn)

6
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,920
(is a mysterious woman)

7
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,840
(of unknown origins)

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,920
(and untold stories.)

9
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,959
(Light a rhino horn incense.)

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,799
(Pick a Red Spider Lily.)

11
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,640
(Enter a weaved dream.)

12
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,048
(Baihua Lane)

13
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,840
(Some revere her as a deity.)

14
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,439
(Others fear her as a demon.)

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,319
(No one knows who she really is)

16
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,560
(or why she guards this Wangchuan Inn.)

17
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,879
(But whenever the myriad lanterns
light up on the water's surface)

18
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,319
(and the wind chimes sway,)

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,079
(it is time for the Wangchuan Inn
to open its doors to the guests.)

20
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,199
I've been waiting for you.

21
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:56,879
(Jiangzhou County Office)

22
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,879
Officer Shen.

23
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,960
Something must have happened
to my boy Hu'er.

24
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,400
You must

25
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,879
do him justice.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,719
You said he went missing
at the Wangchuan Inn.

27
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,159
Have you looked for him?

28
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,800
I-I...

29
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,520
It's said that the demoness
at Baihua Lane feasts on humans.

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
It's terrifying.

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,919
How would I dare to go there?

32
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,400
So you were afraid of danger
and didn't even

33
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,479
look for your kid.

34
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,960
How do you call yourself a mother?

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,960
Nan, why are you agitated?

36
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
This isn't like you.

37
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,520
Nan, where are you going?

38
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,319
To Wangchuan.

39
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,672
(Wangchuan)

40
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,639
Feasting on humans.

41
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,079
Let's see what kind of demoness you are.

42
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,879
Young master, why did you barge into

43
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,839
my Wangchuan Inn?

44
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,680
Someone filed a report

45
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,079
against you, accusing you of murder.

46
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,839
I am here for investigation.

47
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,160
I am merely a woman of humble standing.

48
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,399
How would I dare commit murder?

49
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,920
Young master, please do not...

50
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,560
spout nonsense.

51
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,879
How come your guests

52
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,839
have been vanishing these years,

53
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,839
be they men or women?

54
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,120
Mr. Lu's eldest son
disappeared last night.

55
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,439
His soccer ball was found
right outside Baihua Lane.

56
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
How do you explain that?

57
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,000
Spill it.

58
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,160
Where is the child?

59
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,160
I merely gave them a dream, that's all.

60
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,240
If you wish, officer,

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,839
I can give you one as well.

62
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,240
Steamed buns for sale.

63
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Freshly steamed meat-filled buns.

64
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,839
Come and see.

65
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,240
Steamed buns for sale.

66
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,279
Freshly steamed meat-filled buns.

67
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,800
You beggar!

68
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,759
Don't steal my buns!

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,560
Stop there!

70
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,680
You're injured.

71
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,879
Who are you?

72
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,360
Who am I?

73
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,079
Some call me
a beauty that brings disaster.

74
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Some call me a demoness.

75
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,439
Some call me a fox spirit.

76
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,399
Feel free to call me

77
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,199
whatever you like.

78
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,519
What's your real name?

79
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,800
It might lead to misunderstandings
if a man keeps asking

80
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,199
a woman for her name.

81
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,120
My name

82
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,639
is Ke,

83
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,920
as in the "Dream of Nanke".

84
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,519
That's why I love to help people dream.

85
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,279
Officer Shen.

86
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,639
Do you sleep soundly

87
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,800
without dreams?

88
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,279
It's none of your business.

89
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,920
Fine.

90
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,519
Since you're such a killjoy,

91
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,679
you should go back.

92
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,399
Come back tomorrow.

93
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,879
I will hand the child over to you.

94
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,320
(Why are you doing this to me?)

95
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,559
(Ke.)

96
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,720
(Ke.)

97
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
You broke your promise, after all.

98
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,519
You said we'd be together forever.

99
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,440
On our wedding day,
we bound our hair together

100
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,440
as a vow to never part.

101
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,879
But you abandoned me.

102
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,720
That's not true.

103
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,559
It was to save you.

104
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,919
I wanted you to live.

105
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,360
What's the point of living

106
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,039
when I've lost my loved one?

107
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,600
Ke, you are so cruel.

108
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,679
How can you bear to leave me

109
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,320
to wait for reincarnation alone,

110
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,960
carrying the regret and pain

111
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,799
of never seeing you again?

112
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,879
Since you have given up on love,

113
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,039
why bother keeping this memory?

114
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,159
I might as well burn it.

115
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,039
No.

116
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,639
I do love you.

117
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,759
