=Episode 22=

3
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,119
Why am I here?

4
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,192
What's the deal with Ke's white hair?

5
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,439
When Ke wakes up,

6
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,799
ask her yourself.

7
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,280
Officer Shen,

8
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,640
Ke never thought of hurting you.

9
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,239
(I've never seen a man
give a girl a gift)

10
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,680
(and let her pay for it.)

11
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:47,776
(You've seen it today.
What do you think?)

12
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,799
(Ke never thought of hurting you.)

13
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,599
I know.

14
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,079
Why put yourself through this?

15
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,919
You're okay?

16
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,599
Great, you're okay.

17
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,080
Your white hair

18
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,400
is because of me?

19
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,439
As long as you're safe,

20
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,888
this white hair doesn't matter at all.

21
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Shen Nan.

22
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,320
I've thought it through.

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,016
I don't want to lie to myself anymore.

24
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,159
I want to be with you.

25
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:00,240
Are you still willing to...

26
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:04,039
Of course, I'm willing.

27
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
But everything has changed too quickly.

28
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,919
I'm afraid this is all an illusion.

29
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
Once I wake up from the dream,

30
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,599
you'll push me away again.

♪Losses don't matter

32
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,639
Speaking of a dream,

33
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,560
I promised you before

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,080
to enter your dreams.

35
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,159
Actually, my nightmare

36
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,759
dates back fifteen years ago.

37
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:41,560
(Memorial tablet of Mrs. Shen)

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,319
(That year,)

39
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:44,896
(my mother passed away from illness.)

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,608
(My father was devastated with grief)

41
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,919
(and spent his days in drunkenness.)

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,240
Didn't we agree

43
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,960
to grow old together?

44
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,960
Why did you

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,159
leave me behind?

46
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,399
Dad, what's wrong with you?

47
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,079
Dad, wake up, Dad.

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,720
From that day on,

49
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,120
I became an orphan

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,319
and homeless,

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,160
begging for survival.

52
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,040
Freshly steamed meat-filled buns.

53
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,160
Come and buy some.

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,399
You beggar!

55
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,504
Don't steal my buns!

56
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,240
Stop!

57
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,360
You are injured?

58
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,879
(If I jump down from here,)

59
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:49,800
(then the pain will end, right?)

60
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,360
We meet again, kid.

61
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
I'm not a kid.

62
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,720
Then tell me your name.

63
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:03,552
And I won't call you a kid anymore.

64
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,639
My name

65
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,120
is not important.

66
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,480
After all, my existence in this world

67
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,040
is meaningless anyway.

68
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,879
Of course not.

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
Everything in this world

70
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,720
has its own reason to exist.

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,240
Like these stars.

72
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Their light might be faint,

73
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,639
but they're also trying hard
to illuminate the sky.

74
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,360
Right?

75
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,639
If you keep searching,

76
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,592
you'll always find the meaning of life.

77
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,319
So don't negate yourself so soon.

78
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,399
(You didn't know)

79
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,240
(that day was my birthday.)

80
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,920
(I was going to give up everything.)

81
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,519
But you saved me that night.

82
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,800
You said

83
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,784
that from that day on,
I wouldn't be alone on my birthdays.

84
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,160
You gave me hope for life once again.

85
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,519
Later, I became a constable.

86
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,800
I caught many criminals
and protected many people,

87
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,079
earning people's love and gratitude.

88
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,079
But I'm still afraid

89
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,600
of becoming unnecessary.

90
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,600
Don't be afraid.

91
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,759
You've already done very well.

92
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:39,680
Really?

93
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,879
Of course.

94
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,232

If I exchange my life for his life,

98
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,279
will he be able to live?

99
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,439
That's right.

100
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,560
Shen Nan will not only
be safe and sound,

101
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
but will also share

102

But you

104

will have to pay the price
of dissipation.

105

In this case,
are you still willing to save him?

Of course.
