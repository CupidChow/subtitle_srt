Have you ever heard the saying?

4
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,359
If it can't be forced,
it's best to give up.

5
00:00:57,383 --> 00:00:58,988
(Receipt: Custom-make an outfit.
Customer: Shen Nan)

6
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,359
I don't want to give up.

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,239
Why are you so stubborn?

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
Save your nonsense.

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Are you going to help or not?

10
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,760
(I deeply appreciate
your careful care for me.)

11
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,480
(I know)

12
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,200
(that girls are too shy to express
their thoughts.)

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
(So this time,)

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,519
(let me ask you.)

15
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,400
Are you willing to marry me?

16
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,480
(Now there's such a misunderstanding.)

17
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,680
(What should I do?)

18
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,840
(If I directly tell him the truth,)

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,879
(will Mo Yunxi forgive me?)

20
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,519
(But I can't just stand by
and watch him die.)

21
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,200
(Fortunately, after that day,)

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,079
(Shen Nan never troubled me again.)

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,319
(Alright then,)

24
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,800
(this is good for everyone.)

(Baihua Lane)

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,639
What are you up to now?

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,639
I want to marry you.

28
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,319
You must be confused.

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,879
I told you

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,840
I won't fall in love with anyone.

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,240
Nor will I be with anyone.

32
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:15,719

33
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,439
I don't care.

or your creditor in this life.
