00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,600
When you first teased me,

4
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,759
did you ever think about this?

5
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,759
I didn't do it on purpose.

6
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,920
I was just joking.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,159
But I took it seriously.

Shen Nan, are you out of your mind?

There is no possibility between us.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,400
It's too late.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,040
Now that you've started it,

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,000
it's not something you can end
whenever you want.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,519

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,920

Saying such words to me
with that face of yours

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
takes some getting used to.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't know whether what's happening

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,599
is just a pipe dream.

38
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,759
Maybe you'll disappear

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,280
and become a stranger

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,719
when I wake up tomorrow.

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,599
What do you want?

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,439
I want you.

43
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,400
You've fulfilled someone else's dreams.

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,960
You've betrayed your own past.

45
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,039
I haven't.

46
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,840
If I destroy this place,

47
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,680
will you then be free?

48
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,400
You liar.

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,560
You promised to protect me
for all eternity.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,919
But you broke your promise.

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,919
Honey.

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,199
When we wed, we joined our hair

53
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,159
as a vow to never part.

54
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,479
But you abandoned me.

55
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,479
That's not true.

56
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,199
It was to save you.

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,439
I wanted you to live.

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,919
What's the point of living

59
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,479
when I've lost my loved one?

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,879
Ke, you are so cruel.

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,800
How can you bear to leave me

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,439
to wait for reincarnation alone,

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,399
carrying the regret and pain

64
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,240
of never seeing you again?

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,160
Since you have given up on love,

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,959
why bother keeping this memory?

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
I might as well burn it.

68
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:36,832
No.

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
I do love you.

70
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,279
But...

71
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,120
Fortunately, it was only a dream.

72
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,240
What have you done?

73
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,759
The tree is alive.

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,279
You've been moved after all.

75
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Why is this happening?

76
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,160
Do you know?

77
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,199
If this tree is alive,

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,480
it means

79
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,199
you've fallen in love with someone.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,639
I haven't.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,560
The human heart cannot lie.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,480
A withered tree is like a dead heart.

83
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,040
And now it's alive.

84
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,880
Since you've already fallen in love
with someone else,

85
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,079
you better return that lantern
filled with memories to me.

86
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,560
This way, you'll have no more ties
with your lover from a past life.

87
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,319
Impossible.

88
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,959
What are you still resisting?

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
After all, you no longer
have any attachment to him.

90
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,480
You're just coveting a momentary
false tenderness.

91
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
Who says I don't care?

92
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,040
I've given up my own memories

93
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,439
and exchanged my own love,

94
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,279
staying at the Wangchuan Inn forever.

95
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,120
Haven't I done that to make
my husband safe?

96
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,480
You still remember?

97
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,160
Of course.

98
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:15,600
So...

99
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,040
So, if you want your husband
to continue to be safe

100
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,879
and the contract to remain in effect,

101
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,319
don't forget our agreement.

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,240
If you fall in love again,

103
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,199
the contract will be gone.

104
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,759
If anything happens then,

105
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
don't blame me for not having warned
you beforehand.

106
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,399
I'll never let the contract
become invalid.

107
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,560
(So, if you want your husband
to continue to be safe)

108
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,519
(and the contract to remain in effect,)

109
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,920
(don't forget our agreement.)

110
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,839
(If you fall in love again,)

111
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,720
(the contract will be gone.)

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,199
(If anything happens then,)

113
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,680
(don't blame me for not having warned
you beforehand.)

114
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,240
It's time to take your medicine.

115
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,839
Drink it while it's warm.

116
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,600
You've become haggard recently.

117
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,079
I'm alright.

118
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,079
It's because
you've been taking care of me.

119
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,920
How could it be alright?

120
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,879
Since I promised to cure your illness,

121
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,920
I'd definitely give it my all.

122
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,160
This is not a hardship.

123
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,279
Why are you so good to me?

124
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,319
Because you are a guest of Wangchuan.

125
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,160
A guest

126
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,079
can receive such special treatment?

127
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,319
Ke,

128
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,319
are you willing to marry me?

129
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:36,800
(Receipt: Custom-make an outfit.
Customer: Shen Nan)

130
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Nan, you looking for me?

131
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,480
I need your help.

132
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,639
I want to propose to her.

133
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,759
Propose?

134
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,120
To whom?

135
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,399
Miss Ke?

136
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,552
Yes.

137
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,279
The news of her marriage to Mo Yunxi
has been spreading for days.

138
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,080
How are you still so cluelessly
in the dark?

139
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,159
It's all just baseless rumors.

140
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,000
You're wrong.

141
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
There is no smoke without fire.

142
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,779
Given the frequency of her
visits to the Mo family,

143
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,279
how could she have nothing
to do with Mo Yunxi?

144
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,000
She is just treating Mo Yunxi's illness.

145
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,960
There are so many patients
at Wangchuan Inn.

146
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,120
Why does she treat Mo Yunxi differently?

147
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,879
I don't mean to upset you.

148
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,720
I've already secretly asked Wuyue.

149
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,240
She even said that Miss Ke
felt differently about Mo Yunxi.

150
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,879
I thought you returned the betrothal
gifts because you had no interest in me.

151
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,519
I knew my life wouldn't last long

152
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,039
and I didn't want to hold up
your future.

153
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,399
But now that my health has improved.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,320
Your careful care for me

155
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,799
has deeply touched me.

156
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,320
I know

157
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,919
that girls are too shy to express
their thoughts.

158
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,679
So this time,

159
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,440
let me ask you.

160
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,320
Are you willing to marry me?

161
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,000
No matter what others say,

162
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
I don't believe she'll marry Mo Yunxi.

163
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,159
And, didn't you teach me

164
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,720
to take initiative?

165
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,679
Have you ever heard the saying?

166
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,159
If it can't be forced,
it's best to give up.

167
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:12,680
(Receipt: Custom-make an outfit.
Customer: Shen Nan)

168
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,159
