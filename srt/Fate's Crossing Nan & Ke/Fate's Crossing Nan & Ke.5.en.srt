=Tales of the Dream Eaters=

2
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:51,144
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,759
(Since then, rumors have spread
throughout the village.)

4
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,039
Murderer.

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,640
How could she be so vile?

6
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,599
(I didn't know
why Xiuniang dropped dead.)

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,319
(But my dumb husband
insisted that I killed her.)

8
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,519
(He even bribed local thugs)

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,120
(to set fire)

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,439
(to my pharmacy
under the cover of night.)

11
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,920
What's that noise?

12
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,519
Who is it? Who's outside?

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,319
Who are you? What do you want?

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,280
Someone paid us to do a job.

15
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,840
Seek justice from the right guy

16
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,799
in the afterworld.

17
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,200
It's your vile husband
who wants you dead.

18
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,400
We're just doing the job.

19
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,120
No, I'll leave.

20
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,879
Don't do this. I'll leave.

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,560
It's too late. Your man says,

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
"A life for a life."

23
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,680
What's going on? Who's there?

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,560
Village chief.

25
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,480
Village chief, help me.

26
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,079
They're going to kill me.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
You'd better get lost.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,599
Or we'll burn you, too.

29
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,840
Village chief.

30
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:02,920
Village chief.

31
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,280
Don't go, village chief.

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,519
Help me, village chief.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Village chief.

34
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,039
Village chief.

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
You can't do this to me.

36
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,319
What do you think?

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,840
Do they deserve to die?

38
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,560
But why did the village chief...?

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,159
You want to know

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,199
why he would just let a woman

41
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,639
get burned alive without doing anything.

42
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,960
Because money makes the world go round.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
I escaped the fire

44
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,599
and saw them taking bribes to do

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,759
what they shouldn't do.

46
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,639
I saved so many lives
in Yongning Village.

47
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,800
They used to praise me for my kindness.

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,199
But what's the point?

49
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,319
They won't love you
just because you're kind.

50
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,800
They take advantage of you
exactly because of it.

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,719
This is what they owe me.

52
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,800
I've fulfilled my wish.

53
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,360
I have no regrets.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,080
Who are you?

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,560
I am Meng, young master.

56
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,639
Zhuangzi dreams of butterflies.
It's just the "Dream of Nanke".

57
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,240
It's time to wake up.

58
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,399
Young master, you woke up.

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,199
What sorcery was that?

60
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,720
How did you make me fall asleep?

61
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,120
Did you kill those who

62
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,560
died in the dream?

63
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,279
You must be joking.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,439
A dream is a dream.

65
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,360
How can you kill someone in a dream?

66
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,160
You're so confused.

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,839
You fainted here just now.

68
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,399
I tried so hard and finally

69
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,160
carried you onto the lying chair.

70
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,160
It's fine that you don't thank me.

71
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,000
Yet you're framing me.

72
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,360
That truly disheartens me.

73
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,560
You don't have to put on an act.

74
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,519
Those missing villagers

75
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,839
have all been here.

76
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,720
Those who were attacked

77
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,920
all held Red Spider Lilies.

78
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,079
How do you explain that?

79
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,160
How does a flower

80
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,759
incriminate me?

81
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,399
Red Spider Lilies are only found

82
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,879
in the Wangchuan Inn
throughout Jiangzhou.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,839
You are mistaken, young master.

84
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,000
There are Red Spider Lilies
somewhere else.

85
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,120
Where?

86
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,279
Outside the Afterworld.

87
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,519
Officer Shen, according to the law,

88
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,879
you need evidence

89
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,519
to arrest me.

90
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,160
Please leave

91
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,120
if you don't have evidence.

92
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,560
Don't hinder my business.

93
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,319
Don't let me catch you
harming the people.

94
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,279
Officer Shen, has it occurred to you

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
that I exist because

96
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,120
the people need me?

97
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,439
(You have no idea
what the Wangchuan Inn represents.)

98
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,480
Mother.

99
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,000
Tell me more about the Wangchuan Inn.

100
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,759
Does it truly exist?

101
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,480
Yes, of course.

102
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,560
The Wangchuan Inns
are found everywhere in the world,

103
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,759
guarded by the selected members
of the Boqi clan.

104
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,600
And these guardians

105
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,319
can unleash their full potential
with their power

106
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,199
and acquire immortality.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,360
Do they live longer than you and Dad?

108
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,759
Your dad and I

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,279
only live longer than the average people

110
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,560
due to the special powers
of our bloodline.

111
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,199
But the guardians

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,560
of the Wangchuan Inn will never die.

113
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,120
Isn't that great

114
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,600
to live forever?

115
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,959
Silly kid.

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,959
You'll understand when you grow up.

117
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,040
(Mother.)

118
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,920
(The loneliness of immortality)

119
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,800
(turns out to be so tiresome.)

120
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,439
Your birthmark has been removed.

121
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,680
But you still can't get over it?

122
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,360
I really appreciate it.

123
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,519
The Silver Crown Grass
is highly poisonous.

124
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,560
You must be careful.

125
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,920
Don't get hurt.

126
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,120
What's wrong?

127
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,480
Are you afraid of me?

128
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,360
Not at all.

129
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,120
I will surely repay you

130
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,279
for giving me a new life.

131
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,600
Why should I expect anything
from a dying loser?

132
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,679
Am I wrong?

133
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,759
If you did administer poison,

134
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,039
at the least, you'll face imprisonment.

135
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,120
At the worst, you'll be executed.

136
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,080
You're giving away your future

137
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,159
for those two treacherous lovers.

138
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,159
Is it worth it?

139
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,440
I just can't accept it.

140
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,720
Why can those villains go unpunished?

141
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,679
Why?

142
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
I know.

143
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,600
But their lives are worth nothing

144
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,240
compared to your future.

145
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,519
Karma and retribution never fail.

146
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,399
They have their endings.

147
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,720
But you made it out alive.

148
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:29,080
Are you going to return
to the Afterworld for revenge?

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,039
Besides,

150
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,039
those people are dead.

151
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
They died in that dream.

152
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,519
Don't you remember?

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,399
But that's just a dream.

154
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,559
The world is just.

155
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,720
How do you know dreams won't come true?

156
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,799
What you need to do right now

157
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,279
is to focus on your new life.

158
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,000
And

159
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,080
wait for the day of the final revenge.

160
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,399
How long should I wait?

161
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,799
Five years?

162
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,159
Ten years?

163
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,559
Or even longer?

164
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,519
Does it matter?

165
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,039
You just need to know

166
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,720
that day will come.

167
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,039
Court business.

168
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,559
