How about I ask Mo Xingze

5
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,600
to help you get reinstated
to your position?

6
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,560
Do you have to get so close
to the Mo family?

7
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,000
Whom I associate with is my freedom.

8
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,439
Do you have any problems with it?

9
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,719
Give me a quick answer.

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,480
What?

11
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,400
I said give me a quick answer.

12
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,239
If you really want to marry Mo Yunxi,

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,560
give me a straight answer,

14
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,599
let me give up,

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,040
and tell me you like him
and won't give anyone else a chance.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,464
At least,

17
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,439
I won't do these stupid things anymore.

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,040

Miss Ke,

39
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,000
I invited you here today

40
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,560
(Serenity and far-reaching)
for Yunxi.

41
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,240
You know he has a lot on his mind.

42
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,960
From a young age he never tells
whatever is bothering him.

43
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
But I can tell

44
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,319
he treats you differently.

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
Yunxi likes you.

46
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,000
Of course, I'm aware
that he has a weak constitution

47
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,360
and he's suffering
from a chronic illness.

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,159
No one knows

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,199
how long he can hold on.

50
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,439
He was born with this illness.

51
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,919
It's no one else's fault.

52
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,919
But I still hope he can find happiness.

53
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,039
(His illness wasn't given
by the heavens,)

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,360
(but me.)

55
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,919
(I caused it.)

56
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,400
(Miss Ke,)

57
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,479
(you had someone send back
the betrothal gifts.)

58
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,719
(Yunxi had a big argument with me
after finding out.)

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,599
(He blamed me for making things difficult
for you without consulting him.)

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,360
(But...)

61
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm just a father who feels
for his child.

62
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,759
There are some things
he can't say for himself,

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
so I have to say it for him.

64
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:42,960
Miss Ke,

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,439
I just hope

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,800
you can consider

67
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,039
the betrothal seriously.

68
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,000
(Okay?)

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,599
My father decided on his own

70
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
and caused you trouble.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm the one who should apologize.

73
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,120
Don't I know about my own condition?

75
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,199
I'm already a dying person.

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,079
It's irrelevant to others.

77
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,439
Actually, I rarely dream.

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,319
But I have to thank Wangchuan Inn

79
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
for giving me a special experience.

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,879
If you hadn't unlocked my mental knots,

81
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
perhaps until I die,

82
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,399
I would still resent my parents
and my brother.

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,800
But your end
shouldn't have been like this.

84
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,759
Why do you always seem so unhappy?

85
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,399
I know,

86
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,639
to you,

87
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,600
perhaps I'm just a passerby.

88
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,519
But, Ke,

89
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,959
I hope you can be happy.

90
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,040
Rest assured and recuperate.

91
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,319
You will definitely get better.

92
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:29,879
Trust me.

93
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,360
(In this life,)

94
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,120
(I must change his destiny.)

95
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,920
(I can't let him die before me.)

96
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,839
(This is all I can do.)

97
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,439
Ke, you can't do it anymore.

98
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,120
You frequently consume dreams

99
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,360
and draw blood every day
to extend Mo Yunxi's life.

100
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,199
How can you sustain yourself like this?

101
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,839
I'm fine.

102
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
You're even willing to give up
your life for Mo Yunxi?

103
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:50,920
Wuyue.

104
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,040
Go back first.

105
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,519
You don't have to look at me like that.

106
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,160
I'm here just to ask one question.

107
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,319
I'll leave immediately
once I get the answer.

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,639

110
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,360
The first time I met that person

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
was a very long time ago.

112
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,079
Xiongbo consumes demons.

113
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,000
Tengjian consumes omens.

114
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,759
Lanzhu consumes faults.

115
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,439
Boqi consumes dreams.

116
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,560
