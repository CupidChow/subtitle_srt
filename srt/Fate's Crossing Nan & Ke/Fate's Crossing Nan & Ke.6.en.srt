=Tales of the Dream Eaters=

2
00:00:48,652 --> 00:00:51,200
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,359
What's going on, Officers?

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,079
It's frightening to see

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,239
so many of you.

6
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,319
Miss Wuyue.

7
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,760
We suspect you of
massacring the Yongning Village.

8
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,400
We are here to arrest you.

9
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,760
Everybody died?

10
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,560
They all died from
the Silver Crown Grass.

11
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,120
Your husband died

12
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,519
a horrendous death.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,959
So stop playing dumb.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,760
I gave you all my collection.

15
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,519
Please, Officer.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,680
Wuyue has handed over
all of the powder to me.

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,439
I can testify.

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,480
She can't be the murderer.

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,439
I've checked her up
in the county gazetteer.

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,359
I am fully aware of her grudges
against the villagers.

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,120
It is just wishful thinking that

22
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,200
you can exonerate her with a few words.

23
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,319
Arrest her.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,959
Understood.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Silver Crown Grass powder.

26
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,080
Again?

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,840
Senior.

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,639
Who is this?

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,919
Magistrate.

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,800
He's the one who massacred
the Yongning Village.

31
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,639
Gu Ming.

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,000
The Yongning Village?

33
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,159
I thought this woman called Wuyue
poisoned the villagers.

34
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,719
Yue is innocent.

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,960
I killed those people.

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,719
Let him speak.

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,439
I grew up as an orphan.

38
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,520
(My master took me in
and instructed me with care.)

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,560
(He was benevolent and kind.)

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
(He wanted me to inherit his pharmacy.)

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
(But I was unfilial)

42
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,560
(and wanted to see the world)

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,599
(due to my youthful vigor.)

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Senior, you know my father.

45
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't take his harsh words to heart.

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,080
He will be fine in a few days.

47
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,639
Take this jade pendant.

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,000
Pawn it if you're in serious trouble.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,599
But your mother left you that.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,599
I can't take it.

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,960
Why can't you take it?

52
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,879
We are family.

53
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,599
Here.

54
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,360
(Being away from home is not the same.)

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,280
(Take good care of yourself.)

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,560
Once I achieve something,

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,199
I will come back to get you and Master.

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,280
(After I left Yongning Village,)

59
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,599
(I've been to many places)

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,159
(and treated many patients.)

61
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,599
I saved up quite some money

62
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,879
for a house in the prefecture

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,280
to have Master and Yue

64
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,919
live with me as a family forever.

65
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,800
(But I never expected)

66
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,159
(that so much misfortune
would take place)

67
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
(in less than three years.)

68
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,800
(Master passed away.)

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,360
Yue married an untrustworthy man

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,959
and almost got killed.

71
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,800
Who are you?

72
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,639
What do you want?

73
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,480
Someone paid us to do a job.

74
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,560
What's going on? Who's there?

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,480
Village chief.

76
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,399
Village chief, help me.

77
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,920
They're going to kill me.

78
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,160
Village chief.

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,319
And that village chief

80
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,959
took money from that animal

81
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,439
to pay off the villagers.

82
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,800
He also got married.

83
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,439
Yue saved so many people in the village,

84
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,560
yet nobody helped.

85
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,639
None of those villagers were innocent.

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
I must make every one of them pay.

87
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,399
He learned from Wuyue's father

88
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,160
and knew how to extract poison.

89
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,839
The dozens of villagers

90
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,439
were all killed by him.

91
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,480
So what?

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
They deserved to die.

93
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,519
They kicked her when she was down.

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,839
They believed in rumors

95
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,360
and left her to die.

96
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,839
I remember

97
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,079
all of their sins clearly.

98
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,240
They all have Yue's blood

99
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,079
on their hands.

100
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,680
An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.

101
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,560
Take him away.

102
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,800
Wait for execution.

103
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,240
(Order)
Understood.

104
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,519
Dismiss.

105
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,600
Senior.

106
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:40,879
Don't cry.

107
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,600
Senior.

108
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,759
I've taken revenge for you.

109
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,079
Live your life.

110
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,319
Senior.

111
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,240
Senior.

112
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,240
Gu Ming told you to forget about him.

113
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,480
Ke.

114
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,480
Come with me.

115
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,439
Officer Shen.

116
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,759
If Gu Ming didn't turn himself in today,

117
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,399
then Wuyue might have been

118
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,839
wrongly convicted.

119
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,759
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,360
What's the use of apologizing
once the harm is done?

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,680
Officer Shen.

122
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,399
I hope you can
shoulder your responsibilities

123
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,920
and not let the people down.

124
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,560
This is the dream I promised you.

125
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,480
Now, you can let it go where it belongs.

126
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,120
Thank you.

127
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,680
I should be thanking you.

128
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,839
The Boqi clan feeds on dreams.

129
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,279
We may live long

130
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,439
but we get injured.

131
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,879
Only the water from
Mengxi Creek can heal us.

132
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,040
If we didn't have
all these guests at the Wangchuan Inn,

133
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,480
I would also be at risk.

134
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,240
The legends of the Boqi clan are real?

135
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,120
My mother told me when I was young

136
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,080
that you people were given
divine power for longevity.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,480
But you had to devour nightmares
of the mortals forever.

138
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,039
My mother said

139
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,759
that if the price of immortality
was so painful,

140
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,000
she'd rather live a mundane life.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,480
Mother.

142
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,279
You just said that
not all of us chose immortality.

143
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,879
Where did they go then?

144
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,600
To every corner of the mortal world,

145
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,440
hiding their identity.

146
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,879
They lived and died
just like ordinary people,

147
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,279
hiding the fact that
they were of the Boqi clan.

148
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
How did they hide it?

149
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,240
Some of them left

150
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,639
and chose to start a family
and have children

151
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,080
with the mortals.

152
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
And their children

153
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,679
were born with
the Boqi clan's bloodline.

154
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,399
It's just temporarily sealed.

155
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,279
If they don't break the seal
to obtain the divine power,

156
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,960
they'll remain like ordinary kids.

157
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,720
(Seal?)

158
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,679
(That's right.)

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,159
(The seal could be a birthmark)

160
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,720
(or a scar.)

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,519
Anyway, apart from
the fellow Boqi clan members,

162
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,559
(no one knows their secret.)

163
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,120
(If you find one of them one day,)

164
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,120
(don't disturb their peaceful life.)

165
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,159
(Because it's difficult)

166
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,039
to give up their divine power.

167
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,440
Do you understand?

168
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:19,840
