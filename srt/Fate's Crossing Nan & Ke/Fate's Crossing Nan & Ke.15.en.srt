3
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,319
What exactly are Mo Yunxi's

4
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,280
mental knots?

5
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,439
You want to know?

6
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,400
You've been drinking?

7
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,560
I've already lost my job anyway.

8
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,920
What's the harm in having a drink?

9
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,120
So you're here to settle scores with me?

10
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,320
I'm here to reminisce with you.

11
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,280
Reminisce?

12
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,879
Look at the lanterns in this river.

13
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,799
Each lantern represents a person
I've saved.

14
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:36,959
What are you trying to say?

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,640
I've saved too many people.

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
You're not the first.

17
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,519
Nor will you be the last.

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,439
So don't think you're special to me

19
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,680
just because I saved you once.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,040
You repeatedly break
the rules of Wangchuan.

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,280
If this continues,

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,159
I'll...

23
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:56,959
What?

24
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Kill you.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
You know

26
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,599
I'm a siren who kills
without hesitation.

27
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,759
I would do anything.

28
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,199
I can leave.

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
But don't you want to know

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,479
what exactly are Mo Yunxi's
mental knots?

31
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,960
(He is really the only exception.)

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,240
Since you care so much about Mo Yunxi,

33
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,560
you must be willing

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,840
to make a deal with me.

35
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,000
What do you want?

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,159
I want you.

37
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,599
How dare you?

38
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,240
What are you afraid of?

39
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,000
A rare day off.

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
I want you to spend a day with me.

41
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,719
I can agree.

42
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,800
But first, you have to tell me

43
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,039
what Mo Yunxi's secret is.

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,360
I've been fooled by this same bet
once already.

45
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,960
I won't give you another chance
to deceive me.

46
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,160
After all,

47
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
the prettier the woman,

48
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,719
the more deceptive she is.

(The Mo's Textile Shop)

73
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,199
Boss, this brocade is quite nice.

74
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,600
You really have a good eye.

75
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,680
This brocade is really a fine item.

76
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,839
Only our store has it in Jiangzhou.

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
Once this batch is sold out,

78
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,399
we don't know when the next batch
will arrive.

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,240
(They must have also said that
to Luo Xinyao back then.)

80
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,399
We've searched all over Jiangzhou
and couldn't find the brocade.

81
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,639
Your boss truly has wide connections.

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,519
To tell you the truth,

83
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,319
the head of the Mo family
is the current commander.

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,040
Average shops can never match
the connections we have.

85
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,480
But rest assured,

86
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,959
our store prides itself on honesty.

87
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,199
We would never take advantage
of backing by any big shot

88
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,600
to engage in any underhand practices.

89
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,519
You're too kind.

90
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,959
I'm also an official.

91
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,480
Naturally, I've heard of Commander Mo.

92
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,800
I just didn't know

93
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,079
that Commander Mo also manages a shop.

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
My master is not only skilled
in martial arts,

95
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,439
but is also adept at doing business.

96
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,720
The Mo family has gained
such a reputation over the years

97
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,160
because of him.

98
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,240
No wonder Mr. Mo always compliments him.

99
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,279
Having such a son

100
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,279
is truly a blessing.

101
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,800
(Why is he suddenly talking
about this with the shopkeeper?)

102
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,639
(Is he trying to hint at something?)

103
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,739
Unexpectedly, although Commander Mo
is not the eldest son,

104
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,759
he has taken on
such a heavy responsibility.

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
It's truly commendable.

106
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,160
Such behavior is against
the way of treating guests.

107
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,519
Do not do this again next time.

108
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
My father means no harm.

109
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,759
Do not take it to heart.

110
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,800
That explains it.

111
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,240
(It seems he brought me here)

112
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,600
(to let me hear this information,)

113
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,279
(so that I can find out Mo Yunxi's
mental knots.)

114
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,319
By the way,

115
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,240
send a few pieces of brocade
to Wangchuan Inn tomorrow.

Alright, Officer Shen.

117
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,920
He could think of such a method.

118
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,319
He's quite scheming.

119
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,320
What are you muttering about?

120
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,600
Nothing, just praising you.
