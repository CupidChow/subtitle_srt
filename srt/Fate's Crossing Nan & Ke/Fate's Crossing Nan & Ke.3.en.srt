=Tales of the Dream Eaters=

2
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:51,030
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,640
It must have something to do with you.

4
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,600
Really?

5
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,119
They call me

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,320
a "demoness"?

7
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:18,800
Nan.

8
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,240
You finally woke up.

9
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,879
Why am I here?

10
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,680
I was trying to arrest Ke,
the hostess of Wangchuan Inn,

11
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,800
and got stabbed.

12
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,599
You must be confused.

13
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,840
Where is the Wangchuan Inn?

14
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,400
And who is Ke?

15
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,840
Why would she hurt you?

16
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,240
The Jiangzhou citizens

17
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,680
have been under attack.

18
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,560
All clues pointed to
the Wangchuan Inn in Baihua Lane.

19
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,719
I went to capture the hostess, Ke,

20
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,240
and got stabbed.

21
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,280
Then I smelled a strange fragrance

22
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,919
and passed out.

23
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,840
Oh.

24
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,520
What a tumultuous and lustful dream.

25
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,479
Dream?

26
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,840
Are you saying that
what I just said was not true?

27
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,120
(That fragrance.)

28
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,759
Ke.

29
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,840
(It's her for real?)

30
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
Are you calling me, young master?

31
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,719
Still playing dumb?

32
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,039
What are you plotting?

33
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,680
You must be confused.

34
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,639
Meng is your maid.

35
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,879
Meng?

36
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,279
(Could it all just be)

37
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,639
(a dream?)

38
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,639
Our lord knew you worked hard

39
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,360
and chose a clever maid

40
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,639
to take care of you.

41
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,759
She just came.

42
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,399
How can you be so rude to her?

43
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,839
Don't scare her.

44
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,639
Look at you.

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,839
You must be ill
and having hallucinations.

46
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,279
But still, you have work to do.

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,319
Look into the strange illness
in Yongning Village.

48
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,399
Yongning Village?

49
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,839
That's right.

50
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,879
People in the Yongning Village
have been going mad,

51
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,079
harming others indiscriminately.

52
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,160
Accompanied by
increasingly insane symptoms,

53
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,079
they pass away shortly after.

54
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,560
What's the cause?

55
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,959
It's strange exactly because
we don't know the cause.

56
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,399
Our lord has been intending
to send you there.

57
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,399
But you fell into a coma

58
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,040
after you returned to the office

59
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,199
and slept for a full three days.

60
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:19,959
However,

61
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,480
you mentioned that inn owner.

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,319
No wonder you wouldn't wake up.

63
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,279
I bet you had

64
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,079
a unique and magical experience
in your dreams.

65
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,399
Meng.

66
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,639
Help him back to his room.

67
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,680
Understood.

68
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,839
Where are you going?

69
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,800
Why are you pulling me?

70
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,360
I have business with Officer Shen.

71
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,439
What kind of business?

72
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,240
I got this.

73
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,600
Let's go.

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,439
Come on, let's go.

75
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,600
Why does this village
have no sign of life at all?

76
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,480
You don't have to come

77
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,079
if you are so timid.

78
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,800
Please don't mind me.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm not afraid.

80
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Saying such words to me
with that face of yours

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,160
takes some getting used to.

82
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,000
Hurry. Grab him!

83
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,079
Don't let him get away.

84
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,560
Come on. Lock him up.

85
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,120
What are they doing?

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,079
How can they treat humans

87
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,120
as if they're animals?

88
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,120
According to the law,

89
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,279
when an epidemic occurs,

90
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,560
it's necessary
to quarantine all the patients.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,360
But does quarantine
justify imposing humiliation?

92
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,000
Get in.

93
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,079
Find a place to hide.

94
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,560
Are you okay?

95
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm fine.

96
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,040
Young master.

97
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,600
You woke up.

98
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,519
Are you still dizzy?

99
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,559
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,320
I was defenseless

101
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,000
and got you implicated.

102
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm fine, don't worry.

103
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,159
Your gauze is soaked in blood.

104
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
