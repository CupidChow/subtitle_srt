=Episode 4=

3
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,960
So the strange illness

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,560
is not caused by the environment.

5
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,079
So you're saying that

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
it's poisoning?

7
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,280
Young master, you are injured.

8
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,879
Young master, you are injured.

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,240
Would you like to rest a bit?

10
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,240
Is there a chance that someone

11
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,199
poisoned this water which flows

12
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,000
downstream to the wells,

13
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,520
poisoning the villagers?

14
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,439
That requires a huge amount of poison.

15
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,479
There is a poison that causes death
with just a tiny amount.

16
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,120
Even if that's the case,

17
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,680
the water is flowing.

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,919
After several cycles,

19
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,680
wouldn't the toxin be diluted?

20
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,919
So this culprit
poisons the water repeatedly

21
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,439
to achieve the desired outcome.

22
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,800
What outcome?

23
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Kill all the villagers.

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,759
Then...

25
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,680
Then we must find this culprit!

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,599
It's too risky.

27
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,439
Go back to the village.

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,479
I will go alone.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,120
Why do you want to leave me behind?

30
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,919
Don't you trust me?

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,159
It's not like that.

32
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,439
It's just...

33
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,159
Just what?

34
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,360
It's just

35
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,919
I don't know whether what's happening

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,879
is real or just a dream.

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,280
Maybe you'll be gone

38
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,639
and become a stranger

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,159
when I wake up tomorrow.

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,599
That's not quite it.

41
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,439
Even right now,

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm not sure that

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,520
I really know you.

44
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,639
Young master.

45
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,479
I'm right by your side.

46
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,599
I won't go anywhere.

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,120

that person's hideout tomorrow morning.

68
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,079

we use to track down criminals
on that person.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,480
Impressive, young master.

74
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,560
You're really amazing.

75
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,120
This is...

76
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,279
Silver Crown Grass. Highly toxic.

77
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,800
It can cause hallucinations

78
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,439
in ordinary people.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,079
Blood spots will appear

80
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,160

throughout the body.

82
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,399
There's no cure.

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,959
Aren't these the symptoms
of those who fell ill?

84
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,160
So much Silver Crown Grass.

85
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,079
If someone dries them up,
grounds them into powder,

86
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,519
and poisons the water,

87
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,399
no one nearby will survive.

88
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,759
Then...

89
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,600
Then what should we do?

90
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,480
Stop wasting your time.
They're all going to die.

91
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,160
What do you want?

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
What have those villagers done wrong

93
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,560
that you have to kill them?

94
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,759
What have they done wrong?

95
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,639
They couldn't distinguish

96
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,360
right from wrong

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,920
and watched the innocent die.

98
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,920
(I'm Wuyue,)

99
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,920
(born into a family of medicine.)

100
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,199
(I suffered from disdain as a kid
because I was ugly.)

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,199
(Before my father passed away,)

102
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,680
(he used the pharmacy
as a bargaining chip)

103
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,680
(to find me a husband.)

104
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,879
(But my husband)

105
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,519
(didn't love me.)

106
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,160
What are you doing?

107
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,879
What are we doing?

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Can't you see?

109
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,240
I've had enough.

110
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
This lousy pharmacy

111
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,799
doesn't make money.

112
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,759
And I have to see
your disgusting face every day.

113
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,879
I've figured it out.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
I'm divorcing you.

115
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:40,200
I did nothing wrong.
Why are you divorcing me?

116
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,000
Stop playing dumb.

117
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,399
You think I don't know?

118
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,000
You were having an affair

119
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,879
with your senior before you married me.

120
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,720
And your father wanted to hide it.

121
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,000
Do you think I'm a fool?

122
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
My senior has been away for years.

123
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,200
Even when he was here,

124
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,679
we respected each other as relatives.

125
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,480
Don't try to slander me!

126
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,879
But you.

127
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,200
You know he's married

128
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,000
yet you're doing such a shameless thing.

129
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
So what?

130
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,759
It's because you're ugly.

131
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,399
What did you say?

132
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,399
Say it again.

133
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,879
I said you're ugly.

134
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,759
You're the ugly one.

135
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,120
Get out.

136
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,120
Let go of me.

137
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,639
Get out, you wretch.

138
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,519
Get out.

139
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,519
You...

140
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,679
You...

141
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,080
Get lost.

142
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,039
Stay back.

143
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,279
Or I'll kill you.

144
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:51,960
Get lost

145
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,399
Leave now or I'll kill you.

146
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,360
Go, hurry up.

147
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Get out!
