[Episode 20]

4
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,260
That's enough.

5
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,120
How fresh it is.

6
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,300
It's already rotten.

7
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,690
Just give it to me for free.

8
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,140
This won't do, Young Master.

9
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,010
Young Master.

10
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,820
Young Master.

11
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,300
What are you doing here?

12
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,340
I'm here shopping for groceries.

13
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,420
Young Madam told me that

14
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,540
although the vegetables sold in the morning are fresh,

15
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,460
they are a bit too expensive.

16
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,540
The vegetables are the cheapest

17
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,260
when the stalls are about to be closed in the evening.

18
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:32,940
It's good you are here.

19
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,050
Help me think about

20
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,050
what I should buy.

21
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,460
You...

22
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,180
It's my salary.

23
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
This is my first time making money on my own.

24
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,380
I want to buy something for my wife.

25
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,420
What should I buy?

26
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,620
What should you buy...

27
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,570
[Tie the Red Sash and Carry the Gold Stamp]

28
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,340
Honey.

29
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,700
Are you casting accounts?

30
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,500
Are you tired?

31
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,220
Why do you look

32
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,460
so happy today?

33
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,700
I...

34
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,940
I got my salary.

35
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,030
Guess what I bought.

36
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,230
What did you buy?

37
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,780
What do you mean?

38
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,580
Didn't you say that

39
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,260
the rouge isn't trendy in Youzhou?

40
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,500
You want to make it popular

41
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
and make everyone think that

42
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,580
if a man

43
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,610
doesn't buy Huarong's rouge for his wife,

44
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,940
he's not a good husband?

45
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,659
This is different

46
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,700
from the gifts I gave you before.

47
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,500
I bought this with my own salary.

48
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,820
I went through a lot of trouble

49
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,580
to buy it

50
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,300
without you realizing it was me.

51
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,180
Although

52
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,940
I can't afford the most expensive one,

53
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,700
wait till

54
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,980
I get enough money saved.

55
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,380
I'll buy you another set.

56
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,860
Are you

57
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,850
not happy?

58
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,460
To tell you the truth,

59
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,740
business hasn't been good in the shop recently.

60
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,050
It's been over ten days,

61
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,700
but I only sold

62
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,360
some small, scattered items.

63
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,180
One of them

64
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,860
was bought by you.

65
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,140
I know the beginning is hard.

66
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,490
But I didn't expect it to be so bad.

67
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,900
Everything is hard at the beginning.

68
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Give it some time.

69
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,260
Boss Liu, you're so capable.

70
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,659
You will turn the tables.

71
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,980
But I've tried it.

72
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,870
There's still no update

73
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,380
from Mrs. Zhou.

74
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,500
Mrs. Zhou?

75
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,980
I've asked around.

76
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,860
Mrs. Zhou is the one who likes liveliness the most

77
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,590
among Youzhou's noble ladies.

78
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,740
She often has gatherings at home,

79
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,540
where she invites the wives of the noble

80
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,670
and prestigious families in Youzhou.

81
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,860
The location of our shop is not good.

82
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,580
Not many people know about it.

83
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,460
I thought

84
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,620
I could use the opportunity of gifting Mrs. Zhou

85
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,540
to let her

86
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,990
help us spread the word.

87
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,220
But it's been more than ten days.

88
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,940
Nothing happened.

89
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,900
Do you think

90
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,100
I did it wrong?

91
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,380
I've invested

92
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,560
all our money in it.

93
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
If there's still no improvement...

94
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,910
Don't worry.

95
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,659
Everything's hard at the beginning.

96
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,320
Let's think of some other way.

97
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,450
Madam Yue

98
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,540
was so attentive

99
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,350
when the shop first opened.

100
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
She kept asking me

101
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,330
how much dividend she could get.

102
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,060
Now that she saw that the business wasn't good,

103
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,620
she doesn't even get up.

104
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,730
Boss Liu.

105
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,750
Boss Liu.

106
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,700
What brings you here?

107
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,580
Boss Liu.

108
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,180
I'm here

109
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,620
to do you a big favor.

110
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,159
What favor?

111
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,060
Look.

112
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,780
Your box

113
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,460
looks good.

114
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,780
I can take it

115
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,260
and sell snacks in it.

116
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,620
How about

117
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,060
I offer you a price

118
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,780
and you can sell all your boxes to me?

119
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,909
How does that sound?

120
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,420
Who said I want to sell it?

121
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,740
Look.

122
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,970
You haven't sold one piece.

123
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,580
You won't be able

124
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,270
to pay the rent soon, right?

125
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,850
If you don't sell them to me at a discount,

126
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,260
do you want to live on air?

127
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,100
We won't sell.

128
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,900
Please go back.

129
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,500
Thank you.

130
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,460
-Get out. -Boss Liu.

131
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,980
Get out!

132
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,180
Boss Liu, let's talk about it.

133
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:08,940
I won't sell.

134
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,640
Boss Liu...

135
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,060
Get out.

136
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,460
My Lady, we have customers.

137
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,260
Mrs. Zhou, you're here in person,

138
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,890
and you brought so many friends with you.

139
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,950
I'm so honored that

140
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,020
I really don't know what to do.

141
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,179
It's because your rouge is of high quality.

142
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,559
[Zhou Gaolang's wife, Mrs. Zhou]

143
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,100
My old friends

144
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,100
couldn't take their eyes off it.

145
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,260
They kept asking me

146
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
where I bought it.

147
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,580
Well,

148
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
I can't beat them.

149
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,059
So I brought them here to bother you.

150
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,260
It's a blessing to us.

151
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,100
You honor us with your presence.

152
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,580
Ladies, please come in.

153
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,480
Look over here.

154
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,900
It's so well decorated.

155
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,780
I've never seen

156
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,420
a rouge shop

157
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,420
decorated so exquisitely.

158
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,340
Ladies.

159
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,010
This set, "Four Seasons",

160
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,380
is the most valuable cosmetics in our store.

161
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,500
Our rouge

162
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,220
makes use of the best formula from Yangzhou

163
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,300
in the past.

164
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,460
There are dozens of herbs

165
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,340
mixed and coordinated in it.

166
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,140
It takes more than ten procedures repeatedly.

167
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,900
Those sold elsewhere

168
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,560
would never

169
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,750
take so much effort.

170
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,590
No wonder it works wonders.

171
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,180
Since this is the best set,

172
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,820
why would we want anything else?

173
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,610
Give me a set.

174
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,060
Here.

175
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,140
Do your cosmetics come in

176
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,400
three box sizes, big, medium, and small?

177
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,900
If you want a single product,

178
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,900
like a lipstick or a cream,

179
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,580
you can buy them separately too.

180
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,300
No need.

181
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,140
Give me ten boxes of each.

182
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,370
I'll use them as gifts in the future.

183
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,340
We'll also go

184
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,160
check out the other products.

185
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,500
Look at this.

186
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,650
Boss Liu.

187
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,540
Other people may not know

188
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,590
about the Gu family's kind deeds,

189
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,840
but I do.

190
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,860
Especially your extra favor

191
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,460
to General Zhou.

192
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,940
We keep your favor

193
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,220
in our hearts.

194
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,580
Mrs. Zhou.

195
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,160
Don't be like this.

196
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,260
I just want to do business.

197
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,940
If you take extra care of my business

198
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,060
due to the favor or the deeds,

199
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,430
it won't be my original intention.

200
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,020
Originally,

201
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,500
it's because your products are good.

202
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,230
So I wanted to buy some as gifts.

203
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,660
Now that I think about it,

204
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,820
I have to buy more.

205
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,060
Look.

206
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,470
With your generosity and bearing,

207
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,030
and willingness to work hard in business,

208
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,180
once the word is out

209
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,260
about Huarong,

210
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,140
I won't be able to get any.

211
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,230
This one.

212
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,980
I'll have three sets.

213
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,510
I'll have five sets too.

214
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,820
And this. I want ten sets.

215
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Walk faster.

216
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,020
Walk faster.

217
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,020
My Lord.

218
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,060
Why did you buy so much food?

219
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,020
What day is it?

220
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,700
My rouge was sold.

221
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,820
Really?

222
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,860
How many sets?

223
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,670
Take a guess.

224
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,820
Three?

225
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,130
Five?

226
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,580
Not more than ten sets, is it?

227
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,980
46 sets, big and small.

228
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,140
And a lot more have been preordered.

229
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,380
46 sets?

230
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,820
Did the Feng Shui of your shop change?

231
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,830
Mrs. Zhou came here today.

232
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,860
She also brought many friends

233
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,730
to support me.

234
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,250
Thank goodness.

235
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,180
She finally came.

236
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,980
Otherwise, I'm really a sinner.

237
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,450
What do you mean?

238
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,620
I'll tell you the truth.

239
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,180
Don't be angry.

240
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,600
Brother, I have a favor to ask.

241
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,610
My mother

242
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,260
received the rouge from your wife.

243
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,140
She liked it very much

244
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,140
and wouldn't stop praising it.

245
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,100
She wanted me

246
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,310
to come and buy more

247
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,710
as gifts to her friends.

248
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,860
Brother.

249
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,620
It's a bit tricky.

250
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,890
Why?

251
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,500
The rouge sold in the shop

252
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,960
is all handmade by my wife.

253
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,500
It comes in small amount and it's very precious.

254
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,580
Business has also been good recently.

255
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,240
It'll be gone if it's sold out.

256
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,380
Besides,

257
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,820
rouge comes in various types.

258
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,460
You'll have to try it on your face

259
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,020
to know if you like it,

260
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,950
if it looks good,

261
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,740
and if it suits you.

262
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,290
So if Mrs. Zhou and her friends

263
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,260
like it,

264
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,270
why not go to the shop

265
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,180
and give it a try themselves?

266
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,580
No problem.

267
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,260
I thought

268
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,460
instead of sending rouge to their mansion,

269
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,300
it'd be better if we invited them to come here themselves.

270
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,740
This way, all the ladies in Youzhou

271
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,380
will know

272
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,500
that the rouge of Huarong

273
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
is the first-class product

274
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,700
that is even used by government officials' wives.

275
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,120
But I didn't expect...

276
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,060
You didn't expect that

277
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,820
after Zhou brought the message back,

278
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,950
there was no update.

279
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,220
After you told me about it yesterday,

280
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,180
I was so worried.

281
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,180
I didn't want to hold your business back.

282
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,700
I was going to see him.

283
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,070
You promised me you wouldn't be angry.

284
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,140
Mrs. Zhou is thoughtful.

285
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,870
I was wondering

286
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,140
why she brought

287
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,930
so many friends with her.

288
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,620
Turns out she saw us through.

289
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,220
It took her some time to invite all her friends

290
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,480
to come and support me.

291
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,700
I'm afraid

292
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,700
all the noble ladies

293
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,460
in Youzhou were here today.

294
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,790
That's a good thing.

295
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,190
It's her favor to us.

296
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,940
I know

297
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,540
you don't want to owe her.

298
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,730
But she was just here to show her support.

299
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,060
The future business performance still depends on

300
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,720
the quality of your products.

301
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,360
You're right, My Lord.

302
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,080
You were also right

303
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,300
about another thing.

304
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,630
Another thing?

305
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,380
Try this fragrance.

306
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,780
What kind of rouge do you want to buy, Sister?

307
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,020
I can't make up my mind either.

308
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,220
There are three different types of cosmetics boxes, namely

309
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,940
"Four Seasons",

310
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,540
"Eight Flowers",

311
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,340
and "Twelve Divisions".

312
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,140
Each one of them is so beautiful.

313
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,740
How about you, Sister?

314
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,500
Her Ladyship

315
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,980
heard that the rouge of Huarong

316
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,900
is extraordinarily exquisite.

317
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,030
So she sent me here to pick some for her.

318
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,860
Right. Look at the "Four Seasons" set.

319
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,660
How beautiful it is.

320
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,410
It's really exquisite.

321
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,020
This set is

322
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,630
the famous "Four Seasons".

323
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,340
Take a look.

324
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,700
It's the best gift you can think of.

325
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,580
-It's so exquisite. -Of course,

326
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,860
you can also use it yourself.

327
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,580
When friends get together,

328
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,500
if you use "Four Seasons" to fix your makeup,

329
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,220
can you imagine

330
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,740
how dignified and noble it will be?

331
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,580
It's truly pretty.

332
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,460
So exquisite.

333
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,420
Yeah.

334
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,890
But if you want to use it yourself,

335
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,620
this set, "Eight Flowers", is very good, too.

336
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,410
Look.

337
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,100
The gift box is so delicate.

338
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,740
There are eight colors in it.

339
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,780
They are made of herbs correspondent to

340
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,700
each season.

341
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,900
It's very suitable for you

342
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,380
to use yourselves at home.

343
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,140
Check out this shop.

344
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,530
My Lady.

345
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,260
Why is our business

346
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,020
so good

347
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,340
after Mrs. Zhou came here

348
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,800
with the

349
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,020
noble ladies?

350
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,860
In the past, Lord Ling of the state of Chu used to love a slender waist,

351
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,820
so people in the palace all starved.

352
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,130
The makeup and dressing style

353
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,380
the Empress and noble consorts

354
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
like in the palace

355
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,620
will soon

356
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,260
become very popular

357
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,550
in Eastern Capital.

358
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,500
Then the whole country will start to imitate it.

359
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,220
Now,

360
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,980
since the Commissioner's wife passed away and he hasn't remarried,

361
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Mrs. Zhou is currently the lady

362
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,480
of the highest status in Youzhou.

363
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,260
Surely, what Mrs. Zhou likes

364
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,180
will be sought after by women

365
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
all over Youzhou.

366
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,020
How dare you

367
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,340
come to see Mr. Zhao

368
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,540
with a business performance like this?

369
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,620
Also,

370
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,620
the turnover of the rouge shop this month

371
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
is so bad.

372
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,780
Did you

373
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,980
cook the books?

374
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,150
How could we?

375
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,580
We wouldn't dare

376
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,500
to deceive Mr. Zhao

377
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,630
even if we have eight lives to be taken.

378
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,380
Mr. Zhao.

379
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,260
There's a shop called Huarong

380
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,320
which just opened.

381
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,260
It took away our business.

382
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,770
[Mr. Zhao]

383
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,770
All the rouge business in Youzhou

384
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,370
is under Mr. Zhao's control.

385
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,490
How could

386
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,100
a small shop

387
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,010
ruin

388
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,040
your business?

389
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,900
Huarong Rouge Shop.

390
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,420
Is it opened by the Gu family

391
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,780
that came from Yangzhou?

392
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,620
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

393
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,940
Is the boss

394
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,100
a young woman?

395
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,540
She's a cub from the outside.

396
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,540
She doesn't know about the deal.

397
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,140
She doesn't have much money,

398
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,500
but she's bold enough

399
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,320
to compete with you, Mr. Zhao.

400
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,700
Mr. Zhao, how about this?

401
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,450
I'll take our men

402
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,620
to smash her shop.

403
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,140
No.

404
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,460
She can do business.

405
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,060
It's a good thing.

406
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,930
If there's business,

407
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,660
we should do it together.

408
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,420
"Eight Flowers" sells the best.

409
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,380
When they heard that

410
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,860
"Eight Flowers" would be taken off the shelves next month,

411
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
they all came to buy it

412
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,980
for fear that they couldn't get it.

413
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,900
There was a customer today

414
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,500
who bought six sets in one go.

415
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,330
That's how people are.

416
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,420
If you can buy something anytime,

417
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,260
you won't be desperate to buy it.

418
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,900
If you tell her

419
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,580
she won't be able to buy it soon,

420
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,710
she'll be eager to get it immediately.

421
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,900
You are really

422
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,380
good at business, My Lady.

423
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,940
When Jiusi told Mr. Zhou that

424
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,290
our business is so good that

425
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,220
demand exceeds supply,

426
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,500
and he refused to sell it,

427
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,860
it was just a bluff.

428
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,340
But after giving it more thought,

429
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,740
it's quite interesting.

430
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,440
So I decided to play along.

431
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,940
In the future,

432
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,020
we'll not only change the names,

433
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,660
colors and materials of the cosmetics,

434
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
we'll also change

435
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,730
the packing boxes.

436
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,050
We want the customers to buy every edition of the cosmetics

437
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,910
in order to collect all the boxes.

438
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,260
As you said, My Lady,

439
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,820
"Four Seasons" is targeted

440
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,180
at noble ladies.

441
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,740
So the price is set at

442
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,740
the level of ordinary people's one or two months' salary.

443
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,940
Only in this way can we

444
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,960
keep the dignity of noble ladies.

445
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,070
"Eight Flowers"

446
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,860
is the price of a meal

447
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,060
in a good restaurant.

448
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,740
So most women

449
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,840
will think about it

450
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,660
when they pay.

451
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,940
But even if they buy it,

452
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,070
it won't be too much for them to afford.

453
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,780
But why do we sell

454
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,730
"Twelve Divisions" at such a low price?

455
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,980
The work we put into it

456
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,060
and the materials we use

457
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,060
are not any worse.

458
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,770
Back then,

459
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,980
before I married into the Gu family,

460
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,090
I also liked to buy rouge for myself.

461
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,470
There were some colors that I already had.

462
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,780
But when I saw something similar,

463
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
I still wanted it.

464
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,280
I remember.

465
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,800
You had a tough time

466
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,010
back then, My Lady.

467
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,380
So you had to save money for a month

468
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,710
to buy a box of lipstick.

469
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,220
So,

470
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,730
when women buy rouge,

471
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,500
it's not because they have nothing to use,

472
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,700
but they want to make themselves happy.

473
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,380
When I set the price

474
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,540
for "Twelve Divisions", I was thinking,

475
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,380
if we can make a girl with no money

476
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,740
buy something that makes her happy

477
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,660
in our shop,

478
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,440
that would be the best.

479
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,710
The Qin family? I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

480
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,100
Although Ye's biological mother is of humble origin,

481
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,900
and he's a bit stubborn,

482
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,540
after all,

483
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,220
he's your son, General.

484
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,290
You don't know.

485
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,140
Time

486
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,860
has changed.

487
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,940
Now, Qin Yuan's sister

488
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,680
is the beloved concubine of the commissioner of Bingzhou.

489
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,940
In the past,

490
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,060
I would never

491
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,780
take a feckless person like him into consideration.

492
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,620
But now,

493
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,620
I have to use him

494
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,300
to be able to

495
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,550
talk to the commissioner of Bingzhou.

496
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,260
Is it for the matter of

497
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,080
forming a military alliance with Bingzhou?

498
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,740
Yes.

499
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,620
If Ye can

500
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,180
marry Miss Qin,

501
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,220
the Qin family's daughter,

502
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,620
perhaps

503
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,260
it can help Fan.

504
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,230
As for the alliance,

505
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,880
it can be negotiated as soon as possible.

506
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,220
If it goes like this,

507
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,860
it can also provide extra protection

508
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,490
for Youzhou.

509
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,900
It's just that Ye will be wronged.

510
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,800
It's also a disgrace to you, General.

511
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,660
My dignity is nothing.

512
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,260
Ye's grievances are nothing either.

513
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,260
As long as I can relieve Fan's troubles

514
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,420
and protect the safety of Youzhou's people,

515
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,680
I'll definitely do it.

516
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,840
I didn't expect

517
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,030
the word to have spread so fast.

518
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,680
You already know about it.

519
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:24,900
So

520
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,380
the engagement is real?

521
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,620
Congratulations then.

522
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,260
Brother.

523
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,660
By the way,

524
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,300
you are not a good friend.

525
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,860
Marriage is such a big deal.

526
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,660
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

527
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,940
And I don't think I've ever heard you

528
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,730
talk about Miss Qin before.

529
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,860
Father just informed me

530
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,060
of the marriage, too.

531
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,080
Miss Qin and I

532
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,880
have never met each other.

533
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,020
Never met each other?

534
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,010
So...

535
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,580
You don't know about her looks,

536
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,970
her temperament,

537
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,550
and personality at all?

538
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,340
No.

539
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,220
Marriage

540
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,460
should be up to

541
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,900
my parents' opinions.

542
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,380
And my father chose

543
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,590
this marriage for me

544
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,580
to be able to talk to

545
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,430
the commissioner of Bingzhou.

546
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,220
Youzhou and Bingzhou are neighbors.

547
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,420
They're staying put,

548
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,700
just like us.

549
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,090
Besides, Uncle Fan

550
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,700
has also put a lot of effort

551
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,500
into the alliance of our troops.

552
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,590
He sent letters there several times.

553
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,780
The reply

554
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,710
has always been ambiguous.

555
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,180
I'm also very anxious.

556
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,420
But you can't use your marriage

557
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,180
as a bargaining chip.

558
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,540
It's unfair to you, isn't it?

559
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm willing to.

560
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,380
These days,

561
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,020
I've seen my father

562
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,820
and Uncle Fan

563
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,300
worrying a lot

564
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,180
about reinforcing defense.

565
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,420
I saw it,

566
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,670
but there's nothing I could do.

567
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,140
If my marriage

568
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,240
can help improve the overall situation,

569
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,120
I'm more than willing to do it.

570
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,300
What if

571
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,140
you meet the girl you love in the future?

572
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,200
What should you do?

573
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,030
Society should come first in everything.

574
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,820
Moreover,

575
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,660
the kind of girl I like

576
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,330
is rare in the world.

577
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,380
In the future,

578
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,620
I don't think there could be any chance

579
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,620
for me to meet one.

580
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,780
Brother,

581
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,420
what kind of girl do you like?

582
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:39,900
Brother.

583
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,100
To be honest,

584
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,260
in my mind,

585
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,660
the girl I like

586
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,950
is a heroine,

587
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,220
like

588
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,820
a swordswoman,

589
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,300
someone who can conquer the battlefield

590
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,700
and fight bravely.

591
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,140
My Lady, take a look.

592
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,340
Isn't it irritating?

593
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,740
These days,

594
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
there has been a large batch of

595
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,340
rouge in boxes like this.

596
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,620
Even the packing boxes

597
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,330
and the bottles inside

598
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,590
are exactly like ours.

599
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,640
They are obviously imitating us.

600
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,060
What about the price?

601
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,360
It's only half of ours.

602
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,540
I knew

603
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,430
this would happen sooner or later.

604
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,600
How dare you sell a box of trash rouge

605
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,540
for one or two taels of silver?

606
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,960
I thought it was something great.

607
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,510
If you don't give me an explanation today,

608
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,250
I won't let you off.

609
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,780
Let's go out and have a look.

610
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,780
Come on.

611
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,100
Take a look, everyone.

612
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,960
Come and have a look.

613
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,090
Look at my daughter.

614
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,190
My daughter has to make her living

615
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,990
with her face.

616
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,780
Now that she's like this,

617
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,580
what should she do in the future?

618
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,060
What happened?

619
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,100
What do you mean what happened?

620
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,700
Are you the owner of Huarong?

621
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,580
Yes.

622
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,780
Here.

623
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:03,980
Check it out.

624
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,040
My daughter

625
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,460
used your cosmetics,

626
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,900
and her face is ruined like this.

627
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,660
I won't ask for much.

628
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,800
50 taels of silver.

629
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,620
If you give me the money,

630
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,700
I will let you go.

631
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,140
If you don't give it to me,

632
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,000
since you are hindering my business,

633
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,720
don't think about doing business

634
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,960
yourself either.

635
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,170
Don't think about it.

636
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,010
You can't do business either.

637
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,380
Don't think about doing business anymore.

638
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,020
Miss.

639
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,430
Which rouge of ours did you use?

640
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,580
Can I have a look?

641
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
Recently,

642
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,050
there have been lots of counterfeits in the market.

643
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,450
Maybe you used some inferior counterfeit.

644
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,550
What do you mean?

645
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,900
Are you refusing to admit it?

646
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,860
Yes.

647
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,080
You won't admit it?

648
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,340
There's no evidence.

649
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,870
We need to see the evidence.

650
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,420
You...

651
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,440
They have to provide physical evidence, right?

652
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,130
Who said we don't have evidence?

653
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,060
Here.

654
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,510
Take a look.

655
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,430
Look carefully.

656
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,540
Isn't it

657
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,350
the exact same rouge?

658
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,900
Look carefully.

659
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
Yes, it's exactly the same.

660
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,660
Take a close look.

661
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,780
Isn't it the same thing

662
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
sold in your shop, Huarong?

663
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,310
Yinhong.

664
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,940
Go get

665
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,100
a piece of our rouge.

666
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,740
Yes.

667
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,770
Even if you get ten boxes,

668
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,900
this was still bought here.

669
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,200
It's the same no matter how many pieces you take out.

670
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,830
Look at her face.

671
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,410
She's here.

672
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,640
Please take a look, everyone.

673
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,920
Can you see something?

674
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,860
Isn't this just a handkerchief?

675
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,340
Yes.

676
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,550
What can you tell

677
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
from a shabby cloth?

678
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,260
What trick

679
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,620
can you come up with?

680
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,580
Everyone.

681
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,020
There's a brocade handkerchief

682
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,420
weaved with golden twill

683
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,290
in every rouge box

684
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,060
sold by Huarong.

685
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,220
You kept saying

686
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,100
that the rouge was bought from us.

687
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,170
Let's see

688
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,420
if there's the unique golden twill pattern

689
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,080
on the brocade handkerchief.

690
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,340
Open it and check.

691
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,690
Why do you have to check?

692
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,620
What can you tell

693
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,790
from a shabby cloth?

694
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,980
What's there to see?

695
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,060
Take it out.

696
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,380
Have a look.

697
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,820
Take it out and have a look.

698
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,740
Mom,

699
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,420
there's no golden twill on our handkerchief.

700
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,950
Who asked you to take it out?

701
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,610
It's different.

702
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,530
A golden twill handkerchief...

703
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,780
Don't listen to

704
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,310
the nonsense of this bitch.

705
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,860
Don't listen to her nonsense.

706
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,620
Madam.

707
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,420
Since we've made it clear,

708
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,770
don't pester us anymore.

709
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,430
Or it may delay her treatment.

710
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,620
How can I take her to the doctor

711
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,080
if you don't give me money?

712
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,380
Don't trust her.

713
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,150
What nonsense is she talking about?

714
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,350
This evil bitch.

715
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,090
She makes a lot of money from us.

716
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:29,980
Now that something bad happened,

717
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,220
she wouldn't admit it.

718
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,000
What's the difference

719
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,040
between her and

720
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,100
a client freeloading at our place?

721
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,350
They're both shameless.

722
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,320
-That's right. -Shameless!

723
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,140
Shameless.

724
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,980
Look at my daughter's face.

725
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,260
Her mouth is so dirty.

726
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,050
We've never heard

727
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,660
any dirty words like this before.

728
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,140
My Lady, she just wants to extort money.

729
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,540
Let's just give it to her.

730
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,770
Just give her the money to avoid misfortune.

731
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,700
Is it me who's gone too far?

732
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,060
Look.

733
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,540
Got it.

734
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,420
Look.

735
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,210
Wait here.

736
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,320
Give me an explanation.

737
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:53,900
Boss.

738
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,780
Boss.

739
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,180
Something happened

740
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,390
at your wife's rouge shop.

741
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,500
Let me ask you.

742
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,570
What did she give you?

743
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,320
All defending her.

744
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,570
My daughter's face

745
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,800
has been ruined...

746
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,460
How dare you hit me?

747
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,300
That's right. I'm hitting you evil cow

748
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,490
who's slandering me.

749
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,140
Well done! Well done!

750
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,700
You hit me in the street.

751
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,360
Do you think

752
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,300
there's no law in Youzhou to punish you?

753
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,980
Shut up!

754
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,340
The law of Youzhou

755
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,660
should punish you first.

756
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,900
Do you dare to go to court with me?

757
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,500
If her face is ruined, go and testify it with me.

758
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,780
Go! Go!

759
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,360
You little bitch!

760
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,540
You old liar!

761
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,700
Old liar!

762
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,100
You lied to me.

763
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,460
How dare you lie to me!

764
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,150
You old liar.

765
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,320
Old liar.

766
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,900
Do you think Huarong is easy to smear?

767
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,820
You old liar!

768
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,290
Beat her up! Come on!

769
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,460
Let's go!

770
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,540
Who dares to?

771
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,170
[Yamen]

772
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,820
Alright. It's over.

773
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,620
She only

774
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,820
got rashes on her face

775
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,660
because she ate river shrimp.

776
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,500
In fact, she just wanted to extort money from you.

777
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,700
The old woman got the punishment of being slapped 20 times.

778
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,900
And she wrote a letter of apology.

779
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,500
Tomorrow,

780
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,040
it'll be posted in our shop

781
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,180
as an apology to you.

782
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,780
And to clear Huarong's name.

783
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,900
Did I scare you?

784
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,860
I know it was bad-looking.

785
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,340
But I had no choice.

786
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,420
50 taels of silver is no big deal.

787
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,860
But if they ruined our reputation,

788
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,590
it'll be hard to turn the table.

789
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,340
I know.

790
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,260
They were making a scene in the street.

791
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,980
If they really took advantage of us,

792
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,420
and someone learned from them,

793
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,060
I don't know how many people

794
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,620
will come and bully us.

795
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,420
I know.

796
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,980
We only have a few people in the shop.

797
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,140
There were many of them.

798
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,900
When they were making a scene in the street,

799
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,700
the onlookers

800
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,510
could only hear what they said.

801
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,210
Even if I reported it to the government later,

802
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,500
I would have already been slandered by them.

803
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,260
I could only turn against them on the spot,

804
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,590
be even more aggressive

805
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,820
and louder than them,

806
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,550
so that the onlookers could hear what I had to say.

807
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,500
I know.

808
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,140
Were you disgusted by me?

809
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,140
Why would I?

810
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,460
I cursed.

811
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,420
I said the dirtiest words.

812
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,700
I even hit them with a broom.

813
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
I saw everything.

814
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,820
It was very imposing

815
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,620
and very cute.

816
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,540
Stop comforting me.

817
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,780
I know

818
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,740
I lost my dignity

819
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,490
and I was like a shrew.

820
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,910
I humiliated the Gu family.

821
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,380
I was a joke.

822
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,860
I know.

823
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,840
How is that embarrassing?

824
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,640
Think about it.

825
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,980
When you chased me

826
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,940
with a sword back then,

827
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,900
you were much more shrewish than you are now.

828
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,560
I, Gu Jiusi,

829
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,920
like this kind of girl.

830
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,220
Really?

831
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,660
Yes.

832
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,670
Stop crying.

833
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,100
Let's go home.

834
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,240
♫It's like a dream♫

835
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:25,170
♫Feelings of lovesickness♫

836
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,340
You don't want to go?

837
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,060
♫Love once begun, will never end♫

838
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,860
Fine.

839
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,180
If you don't want to walk,

840
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,960
♫Spring breeze passing by♫

841
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,100
I'll carry you on my back.

842
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:40,050
♫Like the smile of youth on your face♫

843
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,840
If you don't hop on,

844
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,220
I'll keep kneeling like this.

845
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,320
♫Drops of lovesickness immersed in days and nights♫

846
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,760
♫Nowhere to be found♫

847
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,420
Come on.

848
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,580
♫You once said I'm heartless♫

849
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:54,180
♫I didn't know I couldn't stop missing you♫

850
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,960
Hold tight.

851
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,660
One, two, three, go.

852
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,450
♫Love once begun, will never end♫

853
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,230
♫Follow you everywhere you go♫

854
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,530
♫Days and nights, I can't help myself♫

855
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,580
Actually,

856
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,980
I don't care

857
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,860
whether you were dignified or not,

858
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,530
♫What is love and what is anticipation♫

859
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,740
and whether you were decent or not.

860
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,370
I only care if you were bullied.

861
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,500
♫Our hearts collide♫

862
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,380
When I'm here,

863
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,150
of course I'll protect you.

864
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,760
♫If only one person understands the hopes I wouldn't give up♫

865
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,580
But if I'm not there,

866
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,630
I'd rather you be more shrewish

867
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,980
so that you can protect yourself.

868
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,950
♫You are the one I hold on to♫

869
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,260
On my way here,

870
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,380
I was so worried that you were bullied.

871
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,970
♫If only one person can get me through the storm♫

872
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,860
I was so happy

873
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
to see you being like that.

874
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,690
♫You're the home I come back to♫

875
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,420
My wife is so great.

876
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,360
♫If only one person can protect me through the long nights♫

877
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,660
I

878
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,620
will let you be

879
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,260
the cute little girl as you are.

880
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,020
When you get old,

881
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,780
♫You're the peace of my life♫

882
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,900
you'll still be a lovely old lady.

883
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:46,290
♫Hoping the hands that I'm holding tight are yours♫

884
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,060
Gu Jiusi.

885
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,390
You're so great.

886
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,470
You're even better than I thought.

887
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,290
How great am I?

888
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:52,630
♫If I can make a wish, I hope we can be like this for the rest of our lives♫

889
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,010
So great that

890
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,580
I want to spend the rest of my life

891
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,300
with you.

892
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,460
Let's go home.

893
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,940
How dare you come back

894
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,600
to see Mr. Zhao? You couldn't even get such a simple thing done.

895
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,740
Yes.

896
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,690
Mr. Zhao.

897
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,090
It's all my fault.

898
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,720
I'm incompetent.

899
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,450
This is the deposit

900
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,580
you gave me that day.

901
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,420
You said

902
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,850
I could come back to collect the reward after it's done.

903
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,600
Now that I couldn't get it done,

904
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,740
I dare not

905
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,660
take the deposit either.

906
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,380
No need.

907
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,430
Even though you didn't get it done,

908
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,350
you still kept your mouth shut.

909
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,290
Take this money

910
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,300
to buy medicine.

911
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,060
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

912
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,270
All right, get lost.

913
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,220
Yes.

914
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:36,980
Yes.

915
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,420
Mr. Zhao.

916
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,500
I didn't expect

917
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,340
such a small shop

918
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,740
to be so hard to deal with.

919
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,660
Last time,

920
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,020
we counterfeited a batch of rouge,

921
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,220
but it was all wasted.

922
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,560
This time, it's all in vain again.

923
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,550
I also heard that

924
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,370
they are on good terms with

925
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,590
General Zhou's son.

926
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,620
Mr. Zhao.

927
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,780
What is their background,

928
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,060
you think?

929
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,260
I've asked around.

930
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,030
A friend from the south told me that

931
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,179
the No.1 local merchant in Yangzhou

932
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,510
is the Gu family.

933
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,179
The young madam in charge of the mansion

934
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,230
is surnamed Liu.

935
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,020
It's them?

936
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,699
So what?

937
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,300
The world has changed.

938
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,060
The No.1 local merchant in Yangzhou

939
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,420
has ended up here.

940
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,449
They've lost

941
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:29,690
all their family fortune,

942
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,699
and they're living on

943
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,540
a small rouge shop.

944
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:42,860
Mr. Zhao.

945
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,139
They made you lose so much money.

946
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,070
How about

947
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,100
we do something

948
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,960
while they are still unstable...

949
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,620
What's the rush?

950
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,380
Listen.

951
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,900
Be more steady

952
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,540
in the future.

953
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,570
The last thing we want to do is to attract attention.

954
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,300
Now,

955
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,180
let's get the most important thing done

956
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,820
before taking care of anything else.

957
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,740
In the future,

958
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,700
there will be a whole lot of opportunities

959
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,900
to deal with them.

960
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,620
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

961
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,880
I've begged my father several times,

962
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,180
but he didn't allow me to enter the assembly hall

963
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,940
to discuss military matters with you.

964
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,700
Zhou,

965
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,340
please put in a good word for me.

966
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,940
OK?

967
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,550
You're still young.

968
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:37,380
Uncle Fan

969
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,090
wants you to accumulate experience for a few years.

970
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:40,820
You're not

971
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,960
much older than me.

972
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,860
You can get the things assigned by

973
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,390
Father and Uncle Zhou done.

974
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,140
So can I.

975
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,540
Not to mention me.

976
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,620
I make mistakes from time to time, too.

977
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,180
You're Uncle Zhou's son.

978
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,060
So what if you make a mistake?

979
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,860
In my opinion,

980
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,220
the only thing you did wrong

981
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,150
is not letting Gu

982
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,520
be Deputy Commandant.

983
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
Gu saved my life.

984
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,020
After he came to Youzhou,

985
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,420
he donated so much money.

986
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,740
Why did you only give him a position

987
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,020
as Yamen runner?

988
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,420
Yu.

989
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,940
Gu donated his family fortune.

990
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,900
Don't tell others

991
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,300
about this.

992
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,460
I know.

993
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,620
My father has told me

994
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,380
many times.

995
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,420
We need to keep a low profile.

996
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,900
We can't let others know that

997
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,020
Youzhou's strength is completely different now.

998
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,300
We don't want Youzhou to be targeted by others.

999
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,300
Still, even if you and I

1000
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
don't bring it up,

1001
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,980
the Gu family has done such a great deed,

1002
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,140
but they didn't get

1003
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,200
any decent reward.

1004
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,240
I really feel sorry for Gu.

1005
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
Jiusi and his wife

1006
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,780
are generous and broad-minded.

1007
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,220
If they have

1008
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,380
any selfish intention,

1009
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,340
they wouldn't have

1010
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,780
donated all their money.

1011
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,300
It's exactly because

1012
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,220
Gu is generous and broad-minded,

1013
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,950
he should get even more reward.

1014
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,200
On this matter,

1015
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,060
neither you nor my father

1016
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,390
was thoughtful enough.

1017
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,220
All right.

1018
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,650
-Boss. -Boss.

1019
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,780
Since we've been reinforcing the defense these days,

1020
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,660
they carried hundreds of kilograms of stones.

1021
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,700
They're worn out.

1022
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,540
After they finish their work tomorrow,

1023
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,090
I'll take all of you to Liu's Tavern

1024
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:12,950
to have a drink.

1025
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,310
Thank you, Boss.

1026
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,340
Boss.

1027
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,500
Should we ask Gu Jiusi

1028
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,830
to join us for the drink?

1029
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,420
He looks like

1030
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,060
a useless, delicate young master.

1031
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,620
But he seems to be quite capable doing his job.

1032
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,780
When I asked him to carry armaments in the warehouse,

1033
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,840
he got it done fast.

1034
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,230
Without any complaint.

1035
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,780
He's not bad.

1036
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,940
He's also warm-hearted, friendly,

1037
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,580
and pretty easy to get along with.

1038
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,620
Well,

1039
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,980
let him join us tomorrow.

1040
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,520
One more person is not too much a difference.

1041
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,200
Mr. Fan is here.

1042
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,000
Everyone, gather in the hall.

1043
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,460
Yes.

1044
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:54,720
[Upright and Strict]

1045
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,780
Gu Jiusi is still transporting armaments?

1046
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,340
Yes.

1047
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,260
How many armaments

1048
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,700
have you transported this time?

1049
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,340
Six carts.

1050
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,250
Six carts of armaments

1051
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,460
were all transported by Gu Jiusi alone?

1052
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,020
Mr. Fan.

1053
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,380
These days,

1054
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,820
we've all been busy reinforcing defense at the wall.

1055
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,780
We didn't have time for other things.

1056
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,020
You were obviously looking for an excuse

1057
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,060
to slack off.

1058
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,500
The hard labor of transporting armaments

1059
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,160
has been done by someone else.

1060
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,380
What are you saving your energy

1061
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,260
for?

1062
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,780
You may as well exercise.

1063
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,860
Now the war is urgent.

1064
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,360
This way, you won't slack off.

1065
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,380
Young Master.

1066
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,640
Maybe we shouldn't

1067
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,460
go too far.

1068
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,060
They bullied Gu.

1069
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,460
Of course I have to

1070
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,460
back him up.

1071
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,260
Besides,

1072
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,510
Father said,

1073
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,900
a man who's merciful can't be a general.

1074
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,500
I must establish my majesty.

1075
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,980
This way,

1076
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,280
they'll respect me in the future.

1077
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,100
Yes.

1078
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,310
Raise your arms higher.

1079
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,540
You'll be whipped if you slack off.

1080
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,900
Young Master.

1081
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,010
Young Master.

1082
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,570
Young Master.

1083
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,180
Look.

1084
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,660
Is it enough?

1085
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,240
Put it down.

1086
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,460
To be honest with you,

1087
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,340
Gu Jiusi is my friend.

1088
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,820
What happened today

1089
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,020
is a lesson for you.

1090
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,020
You know

1091
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,540
what you should do in the future.

1092
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,580
If I hear

1093
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,080
any of you make things difficult for Gu Jiusi again,

1094
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,720
I won't let you off easily.

1095
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,270
Understand?

1096
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,740
Yes.

1097
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,700
Boss.

1098
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,340
What bad luck did we have?

1099
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,780
It's exhausting enough to reinforce the defense for days.

1100
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,490
We had to go through this drill.

1101
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,820
There's no other explanation.

1102
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,820
It must be Gu Jiusi

1103
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,390
who talked behind our back.

1104
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,260
This Gu Jiusi.

1105
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,660
He pretended to be timid in front of us.

1106
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,340
I thought

1107
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,620
I wronged him before.

1108
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,580
But he has a strong background.

1109
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,430
We can't do anything to him.

1110
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,110
Deal with it.

1111
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,020
He bullied my men, and you're asking me to deal with it?

1112
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
Boss, forget it.

1113
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,380
Don't make any more trouble.

1114
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,220
In the end, we'll be the ones who suffer.

1115
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,780
No.

1116
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:29,940
I can't let you

1117
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,340
call me Boss for nothing.

1118
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,310
Don't worry.

1119
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,340
If anything happens,

1120
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,500
I'll take all the responsibility.

1121
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,100
Remember.

1122
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,420
You know nothing

1123
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,340
about this.

1124
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,440
You have nothing to do with it.

1125
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,490
Who is it?
