00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
By the way, Jiusi.

5
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,340
I went to Ye Mansion

6
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,860
according to your order.

7
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,220
How are they?

8
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,940
The Ye family

9
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,290
is gone.

10
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,660
All gone?

11
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,660
Apart from Ye Shi'an who was not in Yangzhou

12
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,980
and had went back to the academy,

13
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,240
I didn't hear about any other survivors.

14
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,570
When I went there,

15
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,100
their bodies were

16
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,160
already taken away and incinerated.

17
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,500
Mrs. Gu.

18
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,540
This is...

19
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,160
This is the fan I embroidered for Yun'er.

20
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,280
How could it be?

21
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,980
Wasn't Wang Shanquan after money?

22
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,340
The Ye family was a noble family.

23
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,170
Why did he harm them?

24
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,980
A noble family like the Ye family

25
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,180
always despised him.

26
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,980
Now that he had the chance to take revenge,

27
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,310
he wouldn't let it slip.

28
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,780
Jiusi.

29
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,100
Take these two bags.

30
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,780
There are some money, food,

31
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,780

32
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,829
and some other things inside.

34
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,410
Okay.

35
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,820
Thank you.

36
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,660
What about your family?

37
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,990
Is everything settled?

38
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,660
They were originally living

39
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,660
outside the city.

40
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,190
So they are alright.

41
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,230
I have prepared the carriages.

42
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,740
I'm going to take them far away.

43
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,780
That's good.

46
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,779
I'm leaving.

47
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,940
After parting today,

48
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,630
I don't know when

49
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,659
we'll meet again.

50

Please take care.

51
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,980
Stay alive.

52
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,420
Take care.

53
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,100
What are you thinking about?

54
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,280
I suddenly remembered

55
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,950
the three of us when we were little.

56
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,460
Tell me about it.

57
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,440
Wenchang was like you when he was young.

58
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,940
He was not valued by his family.

59
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,780
They always dressed him in

60
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,990
colorful clothes.

61
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,380
Because of this,

62
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,310
the kids in the private school

63
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,570
always laughed at him.

64
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,090
Chen Xun and I couldn't stand it.

65
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,180
To support him,

66
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,730
we also wore red clothes

67
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,990
to school the next day.

68
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,980
The kids in the private school

69
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,380
were scared to offend me.

70
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,920
As long as I wore red,

71
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,570
no one dared to bully him.

72
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,000
Since then,

73
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,230
the three of us became good friends.

74
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,700
What about you?

75
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,180
When did you and Ye Yun

76
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,670
first meet each other?

77
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,030
I forgot too.

78
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,860
I just know

79
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,050
we've known each other

80
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,820
for as long as I can remember.

81
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,810
Her mother and my mother were childhood friends.

82
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,160
In our generation,

83
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,720
we were childhood friends too.

84
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,170
She may look obedient now,

85
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,650
but she was very annoying when she was young.

86
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,710
She was arrogant and unreasonable.

87
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,150
She even fought me for a piece of walnut cookie.

88
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,560
Later,

89
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,260
my father married Madam Yue.

90
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,490
She suddenly changed.

91
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,890
She became very nice to me.

92
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,180
So, so nice.

93
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,920
She always thought of me.

94
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,290
She wanted to give me everything.

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,130
She even wanted me to marry her brother

96
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,060
and be her sister-in-law.

97
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,810
She wanted to be with me forever

98
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,090
and become a family.

99
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,170
Good thing you didn't marry him.

100
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,820
I told her,

101
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,260
when you grow up,

102
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,140
you have to marry someone too.

103
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,960
By then,

104
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,190
we won't be able

105
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,520
to be together forever.

106
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,850
Guess what she said.

107
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,040
What did she say?

108
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,050
She said.

109
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,250
She said...

110
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,360
She... She said

111
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,160
she would never get married.

112
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,810
She can't bear to leave her grandmother.

113
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,360

She can't bear to leave her brother.

115
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,420
She can't bear to leave me.

116
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,600
She said,

117
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,770
she wanted to be the most

118
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,640

119
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,480
Tell me.

120
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,060
Why was she so silly?

121
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,870
Tell me.

122
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,660
Why was she so silly?

123
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,840
Currently, all the paths

124
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,390
leading out of Yangzhou are being guarded.

125
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,030
The waterway is out of the question.

126
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,790
We can only take the mountain path.

127
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,050
A carriage is too noticeable.

128
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,710
It's better to travel on foot.

129
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,880
After we pass Yan City,

130
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,140
cross the border of Yangzhou,

131
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,610
and enter the Qingzhou border,

132
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,590

133
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,120

I ranked first in the Provincial Examination.

194
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,870
What's the old man

195
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,420
going to say this time?

196
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,920
What happens if I pass?

197
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,350
What then?

198
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,230
Enough.

199
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,870
Don't flatter me.

200
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,750
We don't produce scholars in this family.

201
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,870
I told you I can pass the exam.

202
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,340
Gu Langhua.

203
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,370
You were the only one who didn't trust me.

204
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,020
And now?

205
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,470
Now I've passed the exam.

206
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,930
I even ranked first.

207
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,430
It's fine to cry.

208
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
I'm here with you.

209
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,520
I hated him for hitting me when I was young.

210
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,610
So I never called him father

211
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,350
and called him old man instead.

212
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,070
I seldom ever called him

213
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,620
father before.

214
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,510
I always thought

215
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,170
he didn't care about me at all.

216
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,290
He only forced me to study

217
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,290
and pass the exam.

218
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,069
I always thought

219
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,540
he wanted me to be successful

220
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,099
so he could boast about it.

221
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,040
But now I understand.

222
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,620
He really wanted me to be capable.

223
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,200
He really didn't want me

224
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,750
to be in this situation.

225
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,870
But now I'm capable.

226
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,120
I have ranked first in the exam.

227
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,460
But he could never see it anymore.

228
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,740
I've been arrogant since I was young.

229
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,340
I despised fame and fortune.

230
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,180
I wanted to travel the world

231
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,440
with a sword on my back.

232
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,200
I learned martial arts for years.

233
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,930
But I couldn't even protect

234
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,790
my closest kin.

235
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,170
A mere Wang Shanquan

236
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,730
was able to

237
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,930
back me into a corner.

238
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,930
They died because of me.

239
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,220
They died because of me.

240
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,100
I was wrong.

241
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,890
I realized it too late.

242
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,440
I realized it too late.

243
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,120
Your Majesty, bad news.

244
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,810
Lord Liang has rebelled.

245
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,640
There are so many of you,

246
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,800
yet you failed to capture Gu Jiusi?

247
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm afraid that

248
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,290
Gu Jiusi has already

249
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,890
escaped Youzhou territory.

250
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,890
He must be on his way to Youzhou.

251
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,840
Counting the days,

252
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,220
he should have arrived in Qingzhou.

253
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,340
If we want to catch Gu Jiusi,

254
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
we'll need the help of Qingzhou.

255
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,000
The Commissioner of Qingzhou and I

256
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,460
have always been enemies.

257
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,900
So he won't do us

258
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,490
this favor.

259
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,230
We don't need his help.

260
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,160
You just need to

261
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,180
utilize some wealth of yours.

262
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,860
Then, everyone

263
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,620
will be of use to you.

264
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,750
Send out a message.

265
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,270
The person who presents Gu Jiusi,

266
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,980
be he dead or alive,

267
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,620
will be rewarded with

268
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
100 taels of gold.

269
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,280
Yes.

270
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,060
We might as well use all the money

271
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,370
we have confiscated from his family

272
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,150
on him.

273
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,280
How much food do we have left?

274
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,670
It's not enough.

275
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,810
We won't be able to reach Youzhou like this.

276
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,340
We need to find another way.

277
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,010
Jiusi.

278
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,750
[Wanted]

279
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,530
I didn't expect Wang Shanquan's search

280
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,950
to reach all the way out here.

281
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,950
What should we do?

282
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,270
We can't stay here for long. Let's go.

283
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,560
Kind man, give me some food.

284
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,990
We don't have any food.

285
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,250
I beg of you.

286
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,850
Please save my daughter.

287
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,530
My daughter will die soon.

288
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,330
I beg of you.

289
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,680
Please save my daughter.

290
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,480
I beg of you.

291
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,670
Please be kind.

292
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,810
Please save my daughter.

293
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,830
Thank you.

294
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,000
She has food.

295
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,400
Please give me something to eat.

296
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,240
I haven't eaten for three days.

297
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,080
I beg of you.

298
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,340
Please.

299
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,250
They are wanted criminals!

300
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,470
We can trade them for food.

301
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,350
Hurry up.

302
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,160
Let's go.

303
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,420
Here, food!

304
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,260
All for you!

305
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,860
It's fine now.

306
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,850
Jiusi.

307
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,130
On the day of the incident,

308
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,190
there were so many soldiers.

309
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,910
But I wasn't this afraid.

310
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,970
But now,

311
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,280
we're just like

312
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,380
those people.

313
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
We don't even know if we can survive.

314
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,060
We will survive.

315
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,330
We will definitely reach Youzhou.

316
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,640
How could you

317
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,440
treat Young Master Ye like this?

318
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,910
How barbaric.

319
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,980
Young Master Ye

320
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,700
is a famous Confucian scholars

321
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,420
He's usually

322
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,890
a proud person.

323
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,470
If it weren't for the chaotic times,

324
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,040
I'm sure he would've ranked first in the subsequent

325
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,680
examinations and met the Emperor already.

326
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,970
Kneel to the Commissioner.

327
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,400
Kneel.

328
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,120
Young Master Ye,

329
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,310
why are you so stubborn?

330
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,830
You've suffered so much.

331
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,470
You still don't understand?

332
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,020
I am simply

333
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,740
seeking talents.

334
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,560
Just kill me.

335
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,280
No.

336
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,550
Your Ye family

337
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,440
is the top family of scholars

338
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
in Jiangnan.

339
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,990
You are the only son of the Ye family.

340
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,840
How can I let your family

341
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,900
lose its only descendant?

342
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,500
I know.

343
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,820
You want me to submit to you

344
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,840
because you want the famous families and scholars

345
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,660
in Jiangnan to bear witness.

346
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,410
If even the Ye family has become

347
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,510
spineless and given up on our honor,

348
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,440
they wouldn't dare to disobey you.

349
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,160
But you're wrong.

350
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,690
I will not yield to your whims.

351
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,660
Because I'm not afraid of death.

352
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,410
Your torture to force a confession out of me

353
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,710
are not enough

354
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,060
to make me feel any fear.

355
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,970
I know you're not afraid of death.

356
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,760
But as long as you're human,

357
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,740
there must be something you're afraid of.

358
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,520
Mr. Ye, did I forget to

359
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,780
tell you something?

360
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,130
Your sister Ye Yun.

361
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,140
Did you think she was dead?

362
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,430
How can I bear to kill such a beauty?

363
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,940
Where is she?

364
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,380
She's in my villa.

365
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,950
But she won't live long.

366
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,240
What did you do to her?

367
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,360
Ever since she served me in bed,

368
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,670
she's been seeking death.

369
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,330
She kept trying to jump into the well when people weren't looking.

370
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,590
You bastard!

371
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,510
Behave!

372
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,320
I'll kill you!

373
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,200
Bastard!

374
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,590
How is she now?

375
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,850
I'll kill you!

376
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,840
It's good now.

377
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,030
It's fine now.

378
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,000
She stopped seeking death.

379
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,330
Because I told her,

380
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,440
as long as she serves me well,

381
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,870
her brother in prison

382
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,310
can live.

383
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,330
But

384
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,810
she is really sick recently.

385
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,090
She needs to take a large amount of

386
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,030
ginseng and lingzhi every day.

387
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,990
Ye Shi'an.

388
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,470
If you insist on not surrendering,

389
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,460
I can save the money intended for

390
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,760
treating your sister.

391
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,250
Bring me to her.

392
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,000
How is she?

393
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,510
The doctor said

394
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,810
Madam Yun is depressed

395
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,870
and has fallen ill.

396
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,460
If this continues,

397
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,020
I'm afraid her life will be in danger.

398
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,700
You may leave.

399
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,660
Yes.

400
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,290
Yun'er, I beg of you.

401
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,850
No matter what happens,

402
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,260
you must survive.

403
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,080
Yuru.

404
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,180
Yuru.

405
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,860
Yuru!

406
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,010
Yuru!

407
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,000
Jiusi.

408
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,080
Yuru, you're awake.

409
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,230
Do you want some water?

410
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,520
Jiusi.

411
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,050
I just want you to

412
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,490
hug me like this.

413
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,780
I should have known

414
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,440
that you weren't eating much.

415
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,270
We've been walking for so many days.

416
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,270
The food should have been long gone.

417
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,420
But you were still able

418
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,590
to give me food.

419
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,100
I'm so stupid.

420
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,260
I should have noticed it earlier.

421
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,560
We didn't have enough food.

422
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,930
If we both ate,

423
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,250
no one can get to Youzhou.

424
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,120
If I ate less,

425
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,020
you could eat more.

426
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,470
I've calculated it.

427
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,410
I think I can

428
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,070
last another three to four days.

429
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,860
There's still half of the way

430
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,010
to Youzhou.

431
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,440
If...

432
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,230
If you don't have water to drink

433
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,280
while traversing the desert,

434
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,500
you can drink my blood instead.

435
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,400
When my blood is dry,

436
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,640
leave me alone.

437
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,930
Go by yourself.

438
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,140
It's faster

439
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,500
on your own.

440
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,370
What nonsense are you talking about?

441
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,800
I'm not spouting nonsense.

442
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,550
This is the best way.

443
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,610
It would be a shame

444
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,330
if we both

445
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,400
died on the road.

446
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,790
Liu Yuru, let me tell you.

447
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,590
I'd rather die

448
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,370
than do that.

449
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,230
Jiusi.

450
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,420
Don't be willful.

451
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,780
If you're dead,

452
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,960
I won't go to Youzhou.

453
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,090
I won't go anywhere.

454
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,860
I will die with you.

455
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,210
Liu Yuru.

456
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,180
Aren't you the best at doing business?

457
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,570
If I'm dead,

458
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,220
your previous efforts to save me in Yangzhou

459
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,550
would have been in vain.

460
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,960
It's a total business loss.

461
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,970
Even if I live,

462
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,330
I won't remember your kindness.

463
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,660
I will forget you and...

464
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:53,730
And I'll marry

465
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,650
several ladies

466
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,870
and live a carefree life.

467
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,710
Liu Yuru.

468
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,350
I don't deserve your sacrifice.

469
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:01,960
Besides...

470
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,550
Didn't you promise me

471
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,659
to be with me forever?

472
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,440
You can't go back on your words.

473
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,170
Understand?

474
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:50,969
Yuru.

475
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,870
Through this desert,

476
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,270
we'll reach the border of Youzhou,

477
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,490
Lu City.

478
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,340
Do you know?

479
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,740
Legend has it that

480
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,170
there is an orchid fairy

481
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,460
who can bloom flowers in winter.

482
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,900
Do you want to go see it?

483
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,660
Do you know

484
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,450
why it's called Lu City?

485
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,880
Rumour has it that

486
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,060
a female merchant

487
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,970
was in danger in the desert.

488
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,060
It was a white deer

489
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,090
that saved her.

490
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,180
From then on, it was called Lu (Deer) City.

491
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,020
Yuru.

492
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,010
You're also a female merchant.

493
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,860
You will have good luck too,

494
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,850
right?

495
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,880

Water.

500
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,770
Open your mouth.

501
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,860
Yuru, open your mouth.

502
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,150
Open your mouth.

503
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,000
Don't leave me here.

504
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:32,980
You are my life.

505
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,340
Don't abandon me.

Thank goodness.

527
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,400
You're finally awake.

528
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,950
Why are you here?

529
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,000
Madam Gu

530
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,530
has been settled in Wangdu.

531
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,070
I knew something happened to your family.

532
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,830
I thought

533
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,470
you would cross the borders

534
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,350
and come straight to me.

535
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:39,830
So I've been waiting for you

536
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,760
past Lu City.

537
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,410
But I didn't expect

538
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,740
to find the two of you

543
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,060
Take a good rest.

00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,070
After you're both rested,

545
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,860
I'll personally escort you back to Wangdu.

546
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,490
How is Yuru?

547
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,000
Don't worry.

548
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,810
I've asked the doctor

549
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,070
to check on Yuru.

550
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,000
The doctor said she was fine,

551
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,970
just that her vitality was weak.

552
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,230
She's resting in the east room right now.

00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:17,930
