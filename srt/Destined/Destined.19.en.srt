Forget it.

8
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm just a loser who depends on my wife anyway.

Someone also said that

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,040
they didn't want me to be an official.

Rouge powders are extremely delicate.

113
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,430
They should avoid wind and direct sunlight.

114
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,400
Even improper sealing could result in dampness,

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,290
This Mr. Zhao

193
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,750
is obviously a profiteer.

194
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,390
Young Madam, in that case,

195
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,190
we don't have to be polite to him.

196
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,550
What do you mean?

197
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,480
When our cosmetics shop

198
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,280
opens,

199
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,040
we can sacrifice some profit to establish ourselves.

200
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,640
All our goods will be cheaper than his.

201
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,240
If we can gift with purchase, that's even better.

202
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,920
Then, all the ladies in Youzhou will know

203
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
that our products

204
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,560
are good and affordable.

205
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,330
When the time comes, we'll see if his goods

206
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,420
can still be sold.

207
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,430
I see you have taken

208
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,410
our business lessons to heart.

209
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,460
I remember everything

210
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,660
you say, Young Madam.

211
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,190
Am I right?

212
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:47,800
Go.

213
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,430
Yes.

214
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,660
Brother Long! Brother Long.

215
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,460
What's wrong?

216
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,760
I beg of you.

217
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,310
Don't leave him with me anymore.

218
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,240
He's just a pampered young master.

219
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,540
He can't do anything right

220
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,720
and kept adding to the trouble.

221
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,450
I'm going to die because of him.

222
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,330
It's not that I can't do it.

223
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,990
I just haven't done it before.

224
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,020
Wait for tomorrow.

225
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,200
Let's go tomorrow. I...

226
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,870
No need.

227
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,960
I won't be able to stand it

228
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,760
if you follow me again tomorrow.

229
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,650
Qi!

230
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,580
Coming.

231
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,230
You'll take him tomorrow.

232
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,170
Boss.

233
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,340
I can't do that.

234
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,810
Who's willing to take him?

235
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,160
Fine.

236
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,190
You'll follow me tomorrow.

237
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,930
Okay.

238
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,230
What a burden.

239
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,560
I'm actually not that bad.

240
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,940
Pearl, bee wax, mica,

241
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,110
and so many aromatic powders.

242
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,600
Are you planning

243
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
to open a cosmetics shop?

244
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,750
Yes.

245
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,680
Will you be able to provide

246
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,980
the goods on my list?

247
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,910
Providing goods is not difficult.

248
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,300
But the things you want

249
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,630
are all valuable goods.

250
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,750
Plus the transportation fees...

251
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,920
It will take at least 100 taels of silver

252
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,930
to get the goods.

253
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,980
100 taels of silver?

254
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,290
You're charging 100 taels of silver

255
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,500
for these few items?

256
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,810
The world is not peaceful these days.

257
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,120
The price of everything

258
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,630
is increasingly rapidly.

259
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,730
Besides, the roads are filled with danger.

260
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,360
Right?

261
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,000
We can count our lucky stars if four out of ten carts

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,400
can safely arrive here from the outskirts.

263
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,400
Boss,

264
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I'm already making a loss with this.

265
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,720
I heard that

266
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,980
Mr. Zhao from the west of the city

267
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,310
is also buying from you.

268
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,590
Is this the same price you gave him?

269
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,080
You must be from elsewhere.

270
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,260
Mr. Zhao is one of the

271
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,060
richest

272
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,900
merchants in Youzhou City.

273
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,130
He would spend at least

274
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,180
70,000 to 80,000 taels

275
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,650
here every year.

276
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,250
You are new here

277
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,090
and you want their offer?

278
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,890
Counting the costs,

279
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,740
the raw materials we buy

280
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,450
will be more expensive than

281
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,380
the original goods Mr. Zhao sells.

282
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,080
How will we compete like this?

283
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,450
Young Madam, you must have figured it out already.

284
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,250
I memorized the business scriptures for nothing.

285
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,070
You had the right idea.

286
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,960
We would have done what you said

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,680
if we were still in Yangzhou.

288
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,240
But it won't work now?

289
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,260
Business is like a battlefield.

290
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,410
A commander must act accordingly.

291
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,460
You can't win a battle

292
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,650
just by following the books.

293
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,970
I need to study

294
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,090
the situation in Youzhou a little more.

295
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,000
You've been working all day.

296
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
You must be tired.

297
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,730
No, I'm not tired.

298
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,560
When did you learn

299
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,100
how to...

300
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,550
I'm just following examples, I'm not very good.

301
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,350
Please excuse my lack of skills.

302
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,880
Your technique is so smooth and practiced.

303
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,930
What do you mean you're not very good?

304
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,280
You flatter me too much.

305
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,830
Mingqian Longjing tea?

306
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,840
How did you know I like this?

307
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,180
Our family

308
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,710
is living on a tight budget.

309
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,080
Why did you buy such expensive tea leaves?

310
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,760
I can't afford it by the catty.

311
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,020
So I only bought one copper's worth.

312
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,100
It won't last long.

313
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,370
Our family

314
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,930
is no longer rich like before.

315
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,990
No need to spoil me.

316
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,190
Our family is indeed not as rich as before.

317
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,370
But you continue to treat me well.

318
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,190
Naturally, I can't treat you badly either.

319
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,000
My lord, have some tea.

320
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,820
Okay.

321
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,360
How is it?

322
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,990
Does it taste like what you drank in the past?

323
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
No.

324
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,080
No?

325
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,110
As expected...

326
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,060
Tea brewing is not something

327
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,320
I can master in a day.

328
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,000
It's nothing like it.

329
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,400
I've never had

330
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,540
such delicious tea before.

331
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,030
I knew you would talk nonsense.

332
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,330
Let me show you something.

333
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,350
Here.

334
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,420
Take a look.

335
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,600
How is it? Is it pretty?

336
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,850
What is this?

337
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,140
A... Lunch box?

338
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,370
What lunch box?

339
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,150
This is the new cosmetics case I've designed.

340
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,780
Cosmetics case?

341
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,619
For storing cosmetics?

342
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,560
Yes.

343
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,130
Isn't its design a bit complicated?

344
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,579
Is it complicated?

345
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,540
I've been drawing it for a long time.

346
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,740
I think it looks good.

347
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,490
But if there are too many patterns,

348
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,050
it'll look tacky.

349
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,060
Look.

350
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,790
If we remove the patterns here,

351
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,920
and here,

352
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,240
and a little bit here,

353
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,260
won't it look better?

354
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,750
If we follow your suggestion...

355
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,060
It seems to make sense.

356
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,870
Your husband

357
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,760
may be very poor now,

358
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,570
but I've seen and eaten a lot of things.

359
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,570
There's no good stuff

360
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,920
I haven't seen.

361
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,100
That's great.

362
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,780
I was most worried

363
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,250
about the cosmetics case.

364
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,470
I was worried that it was not enough for people

365
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,530
to fall in love with it at first sight.

366
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm here. Don't worry.

367
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,710
I'm doing you such a big favor.

368
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,040
Do you have any reward for me?

369
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,300
Yes.

370
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,570
What is it?

371
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,800
When my cosmetics shop breaks even,

372
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
I'll pay you a salary.

373
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,080
My lord.

374
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,000
Help me

375
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,330
draw a few more designs.

376
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,900
Is this a reward for you

377
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,070
or for me?

378
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,270
Come on, just draw.

379
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,230
Okay.

380
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,830
There's no water.

381
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,980
I'm telling you to get water.

382
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,730
What?

383
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,530
Must everyone serve you

384
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,370
like your servants at home?

385
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,250
Find a well. Go.

386
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,360
Young Madam.

387
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,110
I want to ask you something.

388
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,900
I heard

389
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,660
you spent all our budget,

390
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,170
worth 100 tales of silver,

391
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,100
on these

392
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,190
containers

393
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,130
and cases for storing cosmetics.

394
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,260
The materials are expensive.

395
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,110
The craftsmanship is complicated too.

396
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,820
I've hired

397
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,760
the best craftsmen in Youzhou

398
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,390
to custom-make a variety of cosmetics cases,

399
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,910
and all kinds of silk and satin

400
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,630
for wrapping the cosmetics cases.

401
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,970
They are worth this price.

402
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,860
People are here to buy cosmetics,

403
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,460
not some box.

404
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,890
You spent most of your funds

405
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,400
on the box on the outside.

406
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,450
What about the cosmetics

407
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,250
on the inside?

408
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,720
Young Madam, please.

409
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,230
I'm living under your roof,

410
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,820
so I shouldn't have said anything.

411
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,450
But

412
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,970
at the rate you're going,

413
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,810
I'm afraid

414
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,110
even our money for food

415
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,160
will be lost.

416
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,850
Business is different now.

417
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,240
I can only take a gamble.

418
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,630
Since I've already gambled,

419
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,050
you don't have to worry.

420
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,660
If we can perfect the cosmetics case,

421
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,510
we would have already won half the battle.

422
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,840
As for the cosmetics...

423
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,310
I have my own sources.

424
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,620
And what would that be?

425
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,620
Did my donkey offend you?

426
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,790
Why did you hit my donkey?

427
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,550
It's eating my vegetables.

428
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,950
Look, it's still eating.

429
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,930
Don't move!

430
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,030
My donkey is injured.

431
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,370
Can you afford to pay?

432
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,550
Make way.

433
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,230
What are you doing?

434
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,190
Stop arguing!

435
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:15,920
Officer.

436
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,940
His donkey ate my vegetables.

437
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,410
He can't leave.

438
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,080
No.

439
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,840
Officer, he hurt my donkey.

440
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,150
My donkey is pregnant.

441
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,410
What if he seriously injured it?

442
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,200
My family of three

443
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,720
rely on this donkey for a living.

444
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,680
Now that my donkey's injured,

445
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,910
I won't be able to make a living.

446
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,960
You have to pay me 50 coppers.

447
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,260
Otherwise, you can't leave.

448
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,730
I have to treat my donkey!

449
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:34,940
Officer.

450
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,500
You have to uphold justice for me, Officer.

451
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,550
Officer, Officer!

452
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,860
This is outrageous! Officer.

453
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,740
Stand up!

454
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,920
Get up!

455
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,670
Isn't it just 50 coppers?

456
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,070
I'll pay you instead.

457
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,440
But I only have 70 coppers with me.

458
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,950
How about

459
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,170
35 coppers each?

460
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,380
Compromise a little.

461
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,100
Wait.

462
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,410
The Youzhou territory

463
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,090
is governed by law and reason.

464
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,360
You have to pay for the vegetables your donkey ate.

465
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,960
But you also have to pay for hurting the donkey.

466
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,370
Those are two different matters.

467
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,390
What's the use of you offering to pay for it?

468
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,210
But, Officer.

469
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,730
If I pay him, and he pays me back...

470
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,780
Doesn't that mean

471
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,580
no one is compensated in the end?

472
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,820
Yes. Besides...

473
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,600
We don't have the money.

474
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,150
Old sir,

475
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,780
I know you.

476
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,970
You and your daughter used to

477
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,230
each carry two baskets

478
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,500
and sell vegetables on this street every day.

479
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,300
Why are you always alone lately?

480
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,820
You're old.

481
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,750
You can only carry two baskets each time.

482
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,850
I'm afraid the rest of your crops

483
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,400
will rot in the field.

484
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,250
Yes, Officer.

485
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,560
I'm worried about that too.

486
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,930
My daughter just got married last month.

487
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,930
But if the vegetables are not sold out,

488
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,330
they will be rotten and wasted in the field.

489
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,980
Your donkey is injured too.

490
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,910
I'm afraid it can't do heavy work

491
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,640
like food grinding for a while.

492
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,420
How about this?

493
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,490
Starting today,

494
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,590
lend your donkey to him for half a day

495
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,780
every day until he has sold all his crops.

496
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,130
He will give you half of the extra money earned.

497
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,560
How does that sound?

498
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,630
-Sure.
-Okay.

499
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,580
Okay.

500
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,310
I haven't refilled your bottle yet.

501
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,770
The money in the pouch

502
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,870
is your meal allowance for the next few days, right?

503
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,300
If you really gave it to them just now,

504
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,630
what will you be eating?

505
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,510
I can skip a few meals.

506
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,480
I can go home in the evening and eat too.

507
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,140
I think they both had it rough.

508
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,760
You're so childish.

509
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,060
Your amount of money

510
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,790
can only solve this problem.

511
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,300
But this kind of problem

512
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,560
happens every day at least a hundred times

513
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,490
in Wangdu City alone.

514
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,540
There must be thousands of such cases

515
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,260
in the world every day.

516
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,750
Even if someone

517
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,010
as rich as a deity

518
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,020
decides to be kind

519
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,550
and donates all his wealth,

520
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,970
he cannot help everyone.

521
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,230
The real difficulty of the people is poverty.

522
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,540
Poverty can't be solved

523
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,540
by charity alone.

524
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,930
Yes.

525
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,500
Even if we donate everything,

526
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,340
it's just a temporary solution.

527
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,780
But what can we do in the long run?

528
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,480
Besides, how can there be

529
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,570
such a kind-hearted rich man

530
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,210
in this world?

531
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,780
Speaking of which,

532
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,580
weren't you a rich young master?

533
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,640
Have you really fallen to this point?

534
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,540
You only have 70 coppers on you?

535
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,700
But...

536
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,850
At least you're not heartless.

537
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,390
[Li Mansion]

538
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,590
I told you to be careful.

539
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,600
But you didn't listen.

540
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,770
So many petals have fallen.

541
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,820
They don't want them anymore.

542
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
What should we do?

543
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,880
Sorry, boss.

544
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,610
How many times do I have to tell you?

545
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,050
You are so...

546
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,310
Hello.

547
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,500
Are you the fresh flower dealer?

548
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,130
Yes.

549
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,890
Mr. Zhou Ye told me to look for you

550
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,290
if we want to buy flowers.

551
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,380
Are you ordering flowers for your mansion?

552
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,140
Our plants are transported

553
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,440
from the suburbs early in the morning.

554
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,570
They are very fresh.

555
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,960
I have a suggestion.

556
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,640
Would you like to hear it?

557
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,240
Go ahead.

558
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,470
These plants are very

559
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,560
clean and fresh.

560
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,160
Rich families display fresh flowers

561
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,970
to create an air of elegance.

562
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,190
But here you are,

563
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,910
transporting flowers as if they are firewood.

564
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,170
If I were in charge,

565
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,900
I might not order flowers from you anymore.

566
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,970
I suggest that you make some effort

567
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,320
and arrange the stalks

568
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,630
according to their length.

569
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,770
Then, you can group the flowers together

570
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,940
into bouquets and send them

571
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,080
to each household.

572
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,760
After they receive the flowers,

573
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,770
they can directly display them in vases of water.

574
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,330
It's elegant and cheap.

575
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,630
It also gives them the impression

576
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,490
that you're a meticulous person.

577
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,440
Madam,

578
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,170
you are right.

579
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,140
But my business

580
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,320
makes very little profit.

581
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
How can I afford to hire

582
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,620
someone to do those meticulous things?

583
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,850
Starting tomorrow, I can bring people over

584
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,610
to organize the flowers for you.

585
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,340
We don't have to let these with damaged stalks

586
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,400
go to waste either.

587
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,020
We can make them into flower baskets

588
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,480
and sell or gift them away.

589
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,220
I promise, within 10 days,

590
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,430
more and more people

591
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,430
will come to order flowers from you.

592
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,630
As for the salary,

593
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,380
we won't take a single copper.

594
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,020
You just need to agree

595
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,720
to let us take home

596
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,230
the remaining flowers

597
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,490
that could not be sold.

598
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,410
Really?

599
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,920
With this deal,

600
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,440
you will surely profit.

601
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,780
Will you do it or not?

602
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,660
Yes.

603
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,540
Of course.

604
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,360
Young Master, are you done for the day?

605
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,390
Didn't I ask you to help the Young Madam

606
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,610
instead of picking me up?

607
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,490
I have been

608
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,500
picking you up for so many years.

609
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm used to it.

610
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,850
I'll worry if I don't pick you up.

611
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:36,910
What are you doing?

612
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,860
Sir.

613
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,790
I'm a servant of our young master.

614
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,630
I'm here to pick him up.

615
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,470
A servant?

616
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,370
You only have 70 coppers left in your pocket.

617
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,040
But you still bring a servant

618
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,390
to work to serve you.

619
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,020
Gu Jiusi,

620
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,490
I really underestimated you.

621
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,120
In the end, a starved camel is

622
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,980
still bigger than a normal horse.

623
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,770
This...

624
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,240
My family doesn't know the rules.

625
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,500
He won't come anymore.

626
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,390
You outsiders

627
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,990
hid away and enjoyed your lives

628
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,080
when the world was at peace.

629
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,310
Now war has started, and you're all here in Youzhou.

630
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,650
All of you come here

631
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,300
to be freeloaders.

632
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,850
If you can't do other things well,

633
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,700
you can at least sweep the floors, right?

634
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,120
Yes.

635
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,130
From now on, don't leave after work.

636
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,550
Sweep the floors before you leave.

637
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,180
Got it?

638
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,440
Yes, got it.

639
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,150
This...

640
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,570
How can he say that?

641
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,200
What's wrong with us outsiders?

642
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,860
Did the outsiders offend him?

643
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,030
Now the world is in chaos.

644
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,830
Only Youzhou remains peaceful.

645
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,800
Refugees coming from all directions

646
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,270
came to seek shelter in Youzhou.

647
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,320
We're taking up their residence

648
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,580
and eating their food.

649
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,920
They must be upset.

650
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,940
We even relied on connections

651
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,280
to take their job.

652
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,000
It's normal that they don't like us.

653
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,400
But that's someone else.

654
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,200
How can others compare to you?

655
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,700
Our Gu family

656
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,960
donated all our assets to the city.

657
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,840
Without you...

658
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,190
The grain prices in Youzhou

659
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,920
would have skyrocketed by now.

660
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,870
Don't make a big deal out of it.

661
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,870
If other provinces know that

662
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,970
Youzhou got the Gu family's property

663
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,220
and grew its strength in secret,

664
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,860
we can kiss our peaceful life goodbye.

665
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,250
But that Huang Longfei

666
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,810
is obviously making things difficult for you.

667
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,790
How about we ask Young Master Zhou

668
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,990
to teach him a lesson?

669
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,900
Let's see if he still dares to give you

670
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,160
a hard time after that.

671
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,880
I never told on my bullies

672
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,470
when I was young.

673
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,270
But you want me to tell on him now?

674
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,710
Although Huang Longfei

675
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,560
is kind of grumpy,

676
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,830
he's a rare good official.

677
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,090
It actually has nothing to do with them, too.

678
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,150
It's just that I didn't do my job well.

679
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,830
Young Master, you're meant to

680
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,090
study and do great things.

681
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:31,850
Not for those

682
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,250
trivial and heavy labor.

683
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,090
How can I sweep the world if I can't even sweep a room?

684
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,520
Now I finally understand.

685
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,200
I grew up in a privileged environment.

686
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,170
My thoughts were mostly lofty and idealistic.

687
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:41,970
I was filled with

688
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,360
a strong desire to help the people of the world,

689
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,360
but I didn't have the skills to put things to practice.

690
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,570
Since I've agreed to be a Yamen runner,

691
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,710
I must do it well.

692
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,930
I don't believe that I can't do it.

693
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,280
I'm well-educated,

694
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,990
I fight well,

695
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,960
and I'm good at cricket fighting.

696
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,360
There's no way I can't conquer this street.

697
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,780
Munan.

698
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,830
Soon,

699
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,340
I will be the best Yamen runner

700
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,260
on this street.

701
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,120
Young Master, that is a

702
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,760
big ambition.

703
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,350
By the way,

704
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,780
don't tell Liu Yuru

705
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,130
about this.

706
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,470
She's busy with business.

707
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,330
It's already hard enough for her.

708
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,120
Let's go.

709
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,750
Eldest Sister.

710
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,580
Are these the cosmetics we're here to buy?

711
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,550
Not yet.

712
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,650
They will be when we're done with them.

713
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,700
Fresh flowers are delicate goods.

714
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,700
A lot of them are expended every day.

715
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,770
We'll take these remaining flowers and petals

716
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,610
back home,

717
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,120
mash them into juice,

718
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,760
and process them into cosmetics ourselves.

719
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,980
After they are done,

720
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,110
we will stock the goods up for a month,

721
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,920
and that will be enough inventory for the shop.

722
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,340
This way, we don't have to buy

723
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,190
premade aromatic powder every month.

724
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,590
We can save a lot of money.

725
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,050
Young Madam.

726
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,220
I thought

727
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,110
the rouge you ordered have arrived,

728
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,790
so you called us here to help you move them.

729
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,420
If that were the case,

730
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,390
the hard work will be over

731
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,320
in a short while.

732
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,160
I didn't expect you to have this in mind.

733
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,130
I'm old.

734
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,180
I'm shameless.

735
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,280
But Yuzhao and Yuying

736
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,920
are your own sisters.

737
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,180
You make them show their face in public

738
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,150
early in the morning for some manual labor.

739
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,350
How will they get married in the future?

740
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,310
Even if you're ordering a servant around,

741
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,440
you still have to pay the monthly fees.

742
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,420
Mother, I'm willing to do it.

743
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,410
Mother Yue, what are you talking about?

744
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,940
What do you mean by ordering a servant around?

745
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,030
It's just an example.

746
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,970
Fine.

747
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,090
Since you want to get even with me,

748
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,540
let's calculate everything carefully.

749
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,160
Currently, people everywhere

750
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,790
are rushing to purchase food.

751
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,390
Youzhou is the safest place.

752
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,030
Yesterday, the price of rice

753
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,750
rose to 300 coppers per five kilograms.

754
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,640
Even the cheapest cut of sheep organs

755
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,190
cost 260 coppers per catty.

756
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,290
Including groceries,

757
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,970
oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar,

758
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,190
you and my two sisters

759
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,750
spend at least 30 coppers per day.

760
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,100
That amounts to one tale of silver

761
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,360
per person each month.

762
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,530
This does not include the cost

763
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,130
of your clothes and lodging.

764
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:03,800
But we...

765
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,480
The Gu family is not as rich as before.

766
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,040
We can't afford to raise freeloaders.

767
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,250
Even Jiusi and I

768
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,770
have to work every day.

769
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,240
Everyone works hard day and night.

770
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,030
Why do you alone feel wronged?

771
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,850
If you think contributing this much

772
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,030
puts you at a loss,

773
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,800
you're free to leave the Gu family.

774
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,690
We'll see how much effort

775
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,120
it takes for you

776
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,300
to earn enough silver

777
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,960
to last you a month in Youzhou.

778
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,210
Young Madam.

779
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,510
Look.

780
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,110
I didn't say much.

781
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:32,990
You didn't have to

782
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,390
say all of that in return.

783
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,070
Yinhong, Munan.

784
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,330
Let's move the goods quickly.

785
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:39,960
We need to deliver these

786
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,220
to the respective families before noon.

787
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,650
What are you waiting for? Help them.

788
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,760
Or they will call us

789
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,890
freeloaders again.

790
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,220
Mother, you're here.

791
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,240
I remember

792
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,590
we need to squeeze the juice

793
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,340
out of these red petals.

794
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,080
Then we'll add clean water,

795
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,980
wrap the remains in fine gauze, and squeeze out the yellow juice.

796
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,820
And then,

797
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,160
we will rise the remains in

798
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,590
acidized rice water.

799
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,980
If we repeat the process several times,

800
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,120
the rouge produced will be

801
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,230
pure and fine with no mixed colors.

802
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,830
Your memory is great, Mother.

803
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,380
You remembered it perfectly.

804
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,190
Back then, the Gu family made our

805
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,370
first fortune by selling cosmetics.

806
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,250
That time,

807
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,930
I hired the best craftsman

808
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,450
in Yangzhou City.

809
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,250
We discussed things together

810
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,640
and kept trying different methods.

811
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,020
After several refinements,

812
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,650
we finally

813
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,690
came up with a whole set of formulas.

814
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,360
Things like ink for drawing eyebrows,

815
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,080
white powder for the face,

816
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,590
and lip balms for the lips.

817
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,730
The set included formulas for all of those.

818
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,130
Now that I think about it,

819
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,220
that was 20 years ago.

820
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,080
Mother, the formulas we're using now

821
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,870
are the same old formulas

822
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,670
you left in the accounting room.

823
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,060
People like to say,

824
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,540
the best rouge comes from Suzhou and loose powder from Yangzhou.

825
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,010
Our craftsmasters from the two cities

826
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,210
had unique skills and were meticulous.

827
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,000
Even when it came to materials, they chose

828
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,640
not to use the usual lead powder.

829
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,160
Instead, they used pearls, ground clam shells,

830
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,420
bee wax, and deer musk.

831
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,850
This attention to details

832
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,580
is beyond the wit of outsiders.

833
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,220
But it costs too much to make.

834
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,370
It's fine if the business is good.

835
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,150
If business is not good,

836
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,760
then...

837
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,100
Relax.

838
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,910
Just do it.

839
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,140
We just have to do our best

840
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,770
and leave the rest

841
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,620
to the heaven's will.

842
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,320
Got it, Mother.

843
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,860
Yongzhou and Liangzhou are in chaos too?

844
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,350
That's right.

845
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,030
Now,

846
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,080
there is no place

847
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,340
that is truly at peace.

848
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,050
Everywhere, people with fame and fortune are

849
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,870
taking advantage of the chaos to rise to power.

850
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,790
They're afraid they'll be devoured

851
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,460
by other forces if they are too slow to rise.

852
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,219
What does Commissioner Fan think about this?

853
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,949
Commissioner Fan never thought about

854
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:23,260
establishing his own army or declaring independence.

855
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,889
In this chaotic world,

856
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,280
to protect

857
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,830
the people of Youzhou,

858
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,889
we must have our own power.

859
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:31,590
Recently,

860
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,120
we've been busy strengthening our defenses

861
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,719
and securing food supplies.

862
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,360
Thanks to your family's support,

863
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,870
we're able to keep the people of Youzhou

864
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,199
safe for the time being.

865
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,360
That's good, that's good.

866
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,620
But...

867
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,210
You've contributed so much

868
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,300
to Youzhou.

869
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,730
In the end,

870
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,110
you only became a mere Yamen runner.

871
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:49,969
Not only me,

872
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,790
Commissioner Fan and my father

873
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,360
all feel bad about it.

874
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,800
It's nothing.

875
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,870
It's good to be a Yamen runner too.

876
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,140
I've been too busy lately

877
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,760
and couldn't care for you.

878
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,110
I wonder

879
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,370
how you've been doing here.

880
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,760
Did anyone give you a hard time?

881
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,890
If anything happens,

882
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,860
you must tell me.

883
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,370
With my personality,

884
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,670
who can bully me?

885
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:11,700
Don't worry.

886
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,170
That's good.

887
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,790
Have some tea.

888
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,200
We've worked hard for so long.

889
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,080
Our shop

890
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,210
is finally opening.

891
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,730
Our shop?

892
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,420
That's the Gu family's shop.

893
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,680
What does it have to do with you?

894
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,880
You're in such a rush to call it our shop.

895
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,710
Mother, Eldest Sister said that

896
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,510
after the opening,

897
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,480
she will still need our help.

898
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,810
She will pay us monthly.

899
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,790
How much money could that be?

900
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,310
You're so easily bought over.

901
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,530
She's making you work full-time for her.

902
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,460
She also said

903
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,800
we all worked hard.

904
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,440
When the shop makes profit,

905
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,770
we'll get dividends at the end of the year.

906
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,760
Did she really say that?

907
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,610
Yes.

908
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

909
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,980
Come on.

910
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,200
Look at you.

911
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,840
Wipe it carefully.

912
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,520
This is our family business.

913
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,870
Get working.

914
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,520
This is our family business.

915
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,030
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

916
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,870
Seriously.

917
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,450
We're here.

918
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,110
Here we are.

919
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,310
Yinhong.

920
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,070
We're back.

921
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,460
Coming.

922
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,560
The cosmetics cases and containers

923
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,490
Young Madam ordered have arrived!

924
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,460
Come and move the goods.

925
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,180
Okay.

926
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,820
So heavy.

927
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,170
It looks nice, yes.

928
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,440
But isn't it too big?

929
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,730
Looking at it,

930
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,790
it doesn't look like

931
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,120
it's for storing rouge.

932
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,420
You think that way,

933
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,140
because no one has used it to store cosmetics.

934
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,060
From now on,

935
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,790
everyone in Youzhou will know.

936
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,590
This is how you should store your cosmetics.

937
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,480
This is so beautiful.

938
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:54,350
Move the goods.

939
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,000
Hurry up.

940
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,590
Okay.

941
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:36,370
[Tie the Red Sash and Carry the Gold Stamp]

942
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,630
My lord.

943
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,100
Here.

944
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,320
Have a seat.

945
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,180
My lord.

946
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,700
I have something

947
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,790
to ask you today.

948
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,640
You haven't paid me last time.

949
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,480
What do you want this time?

950
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,180
My cosmetics shop is ready.

951
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,610
It only needs a name.

952
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,050
I thought about it.

953
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,760
Only you are capable

954
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,030
of helping me with this.

955
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,900
This is easy.

956
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,670
Just call it Liu's Cosmetics.

957
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,480
Liu's?

958
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,530
Yes.

959
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,870
In the past, you were running

960
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,340
the business under the Gu's name.

961
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,230
Even if people called you Boss Liu,

962
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,120
you were still Boss Liu of the Gu family.

963
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,880
Now you finally have

964
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,020
your own business.

965
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,240
Of course you should call it Liu's.

966
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,880
It's good,

967
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,770
but it's not suitable.

968
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,620
Why?

969
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,090
It’s too hasty.

970
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,250
If I'm running a fabric shop,

971
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,970
a pharmacy, or a restaurant,

972
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,610
they can all be called Liu's.

973
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,920
But a cosmetics shop cannot be called that.

974
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,600
The name I'm looking for

975
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,780
should be unique and elegant.

976
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,340
It cannot sound too casual

977
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,550
or too uncommon.

978
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,430
It must be memorable and easily remembered.

979
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,260
Next time, whenever someone uses cosmetics,

980
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,520
they will immediately think of my shop.

981
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,650
That would be great.

982
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,970
That's a lot of requirements for a single name.

983
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,110
We're doing the

984
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,460
ladies' business here.

985
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,840
In that case,

986
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,570
we have to give them our best.

987
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,130
From the shop name and packaging

988
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,820
to the quality of the goods,

989
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,020
we have to prioritize their interests

990
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,220
every step of the way.

991
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,900
We need to think about

992
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,600
how to make them fall in love

993
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,990
with our shop and products.

994
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,120
If we're unwilling to

995
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,000
even to put in this bit of effort,

996
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,890
out of all the rouge shops in the market,

997
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,030
why should they spend their money

998
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,990
on my shop?

999
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,330
Why are you looking at me?

1000
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
When I look at you,

1001
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,180
a poem suddenly comes to mind.

1002
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,080
What poem?

1003
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,610
Clouds desire beautiful clothes.

1004
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,090
Flowers desire a beautiful appearance.

1005
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,240
-Great!
-Nice!

1006
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,130
[Huarong Rouge Shop]

1007
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,330
Thanks to your help,

1008
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,770
the shop was opened successfully.

1009
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,650
Please

1010
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,080
accept these, Zhou.

1011
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,090
Consider it

1012
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,690
a small gift for your mother.

1013
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,000
These are the so-called rouges?

1014
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,210
This case contains fragrant loose powder.

1015
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,180
This case contains foundation cream.

1016
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,370
This case contains ink for drawing eyebrows,

1017
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,770
and sunset powder for blushing the cheeks.

1018
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,360
These four are lipsticks.

1019
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,210
They represent the four colors

1020
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,210
of the four seasons.

1021
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,470
Peach pink, rose red,

1022
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Osmanthus orange, and plum auburn.

1023
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,470
In my eyes,

1024
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,110
they all look similar to each other.

1025
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,290
For example, these two colors

1026
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,890
look exactly the same to me.

1027
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,220
What's the difference?

1028
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,850
It is quite strange indeed.

1029
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,080
Men usually cannot tell

1030
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,090
the difference in cosmetic colors.

1031
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,060
But as women,

1032
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,230
one look,

1033
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,200
and we can tell that

1034
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,800
this set of seasonal colours

1035
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,940
is practical and ingenious.

1036
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,240
With these colours, you can

1037
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,970
come up with countless beautiful combinations.

1038
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,920
I hope your mother

1039
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,460
will like my small gift.

1040
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,510
Thank you, Third Sister.

1041
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,130
Young Madam,

1042
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,840
we are so short of money.

1043
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,160
Why did we give our best goods

1044
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,000
away for free?

1045
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,520
Our business is small and our shop is in a remote location.

1046
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,200
To attract more customers,

1047
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,630
we need something

1048
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,980
more attention-grabbing

1049
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,190
than firecrackers

1050
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,050
to draw them in.

1051
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,290
What is it?

1052
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,120
Word of mouth.
