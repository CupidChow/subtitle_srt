[Episode 21]

4
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,100
Just let it go.

5
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,229
He bullied you guys! How can I let it go?

6
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,050
Boss, forget it.

7
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,300
Don't get into more trouble.

8
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,100
In the end, we'll be the ones who suffer.

9
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,789
No!

10
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:52,860
You call me Boss.

11
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,120
I have to deserve that!

12
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,259
Don't worry.

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,259
If anything happens,

14
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,380
I'll take full responsibility.

15
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,070
Remember.

16
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,330
You know nothing

17
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,390
about this matter.

18
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,520
It has nothing to do with you guys.

19
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,550
Who's it?

20
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,850
Later,

21
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,060
let's go for a drink.

22
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,900
OK.

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,500
Douchebag.

24
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,790
Young Master Gu.

25
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,390
What happened to your face?

26
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,540
Nothing. I fell.

27
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,910
Officer,

28
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,900
the weapons have been moved to the arsenal.

29
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,780
My job is done.

30
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,860
Thanks a lot, Young Master Gu.

31
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,900
You don't have to waste your time

32
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,900
on such trivial tasks in the future.

33
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,100
Officer,

34
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,810
if you have a problem with me,

35
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,750
just be frank.

36
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,460
Today is your last day here.

37
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,740
Why?

38
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,820
You'll work in the garrison from tomorrow on.

39
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,880
There's no work here for you anymore.

40
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,780
Why?

41
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,520
The garrison guards the four gates of Youzhou.

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,260
All you need to do is stand watch.

43
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,660
The workload is much lighter there.

44
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,579
Young Master Gu.

45
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,220
Take care.

46
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
See yourself out.

47
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,590
I demand an explanation!

48
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,500
Stop pretending!

49
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,750
You told Young Master Fan

50
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,540
to fix us, didn't you?

51
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,620
We can't afford to be on your bad side,

52
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,390
so we found an easy job for you.

53
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,970
Our paths won't cross again.

54
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,100
Isn't that nice?

55
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,540
Fan Yu.

56
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,620
You've been pretending to be a hard worker lately.

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,860
But after all,

58
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,660
you're just a loser who wants shortcuts

59
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,060
by pulling strings!

60
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,180
Who do you think you are?

61
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,100
Let's go!

62
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,350
Munan.

63
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,700
Munan.

64
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,980
Where is Yuru?

65
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,820
Young Madam went out.

66
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,659
Young Master.

67
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,060
You got in a fight?

68
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,180
No, no, no.

69
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,020
Does it hurt?

70
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,730
Shut up.

71
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,620
Go get me something

72
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,820
to reduce the swelling.

73
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,420
Go, go, go.

74
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,170
Go, go, go.

75
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:49,820
Your face…

76
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,630
Hurry up.

77
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,670
My lord.

78
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,020
My lady.

79
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,980
What's wrong?

80
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,980
Why are you hiding your face?

81
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,760
I have a toothache.

82
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,150
Drop your hands.

83
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,980
Drop it!

84
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,190
Who did this?

85
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,300
No one.

86
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,140
I bumped into the door frame.

87
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,550
Who did it?

88
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,660
You said

89
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,300
everything was good at work.

90
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,659
I've been busy with the shop

91
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,659
and believed you.

92
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,659
Did they gang up against you?

93
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,060
I'm so good at martial arts.

94
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,120
No one can bully me.

95
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,830
Don't worry.

96
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,190
I'm a man.

97
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,300
I can

98
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,710
take care of myself.

99
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,140
Don't think too much.

100
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,300
I'll go in and get it treated.

101
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,570
We're not going to the rouge shop today.

102
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,960
Ask Munan to go to the market

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,370
and hire several strong men.

104
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,090
Strong men?

105
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,930
Do you need to move something?

106
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,060
Just ask him to do it.

107
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,650
Yes.

108
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,340
It's him?

109
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,170
Yes.

110
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
His name is Huang Longfei.

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
He's Young Master's immediate superior.

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,520
He started the bullying

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,980
and others followed suit.

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,290
Go, go, go.

115
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,070
Beat him up!

116
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,610
Harder!

117
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,370
Harder!

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,530
Let's go.

119
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,610
Who are you?

120
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,510
That's enough?

121
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,010
Quite enough.

122
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,090
How dare you beat me?

123
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,250
Bring it on!

124
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,790
You got some nerve!

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,940
Tell me your name if you got the balls!

126
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,130
We struck back

127
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,940
for Young Master this time.

128
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,040
Don't say a word about it after going back.

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,240
Don't let Jiusi know.

130
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,490
Don't worry, Young Madam.

131
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,200
I won't mention this to anyone.

132
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,050
Young Master will never find out.

133
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,580
Let's go.

134
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,770
Good for you.

135
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,310
He messed with you.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,870
He messed with me,

137
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,170
so you hired muscle to beat him?

138
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,100
He had it coming.

139
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,640
If he messes with you again,

140
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,770
I'll beat him again.

141
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,640
Why are you laughing?

142
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,330
Am I ridiculous?

143
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,170
No.

144
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,600
I think

145
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,330
you're cute.

146
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,750
Now that you've beaten him

147
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,980
and taken revenge,

148
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,370
are you not mad anymore?

149
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,570
Don't you even start.

150
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
You're not allowed to do this again.

151
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,090
This?

152
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,170
If he messes with you again,

153
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,660
you'll fight back.

154
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,850
You'll just lose your job at worst.

155
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,810
It's no big deal.

156
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,330
I'm a man. If I don't work,

157
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,929
how am I going to feed myself?

158
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,090
I'll support you.

159
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,830
You're so very nice, Boss Liu.

160
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,950
You don't mind me being a freeloader?

161
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,500
If you keep working there,

162
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,520
you'll have to suck it up

163
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,610
and be bullied by bad people.

164
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,340
I'd rather you be a freeloader.

165
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Actually, the guy who messed with me

166
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,220
might not be bad.

167
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,120
He beat you black and blue.

168
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,580
Why are you defending him?

169
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,070
He beat me

170
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,760
because Fan Yu

171
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,150
beat other Yamen runners

172
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,370
for me.

173
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,870
He wanted justice

174
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,880
for his subordinates

175
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,610
so he beat me.

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
He hates injustice.

177
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
So do I.

178
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,000
I have no reason to blame him.

179
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,520
On the contrary,

180
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,120
I think he's very righteous.

181
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,040
He's a tough guy

182
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,090
who's not snobbish at all.

183
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,880
I admire him.

184
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,070
I don't want

185
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,010
an eye for an eye.

186
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,450
That'll only escalate the conflict.

187
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,050
Maybe in the future,

188
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,450
I can be friends with him.

189
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,610
I have to say,

190
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,650
you're a respectable man

191
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,970
with a big heart.

192
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,680
It's my honor to be your wife.

193
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:28,950
You flatter me.

194
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,140
So I shouldn't have beaten him?

195
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,010
You're my wife.

196
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,000
What's wrong with

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
you defending your husband?

198
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,410
But

199
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,570
as I said yesterday,

200
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,610
I can take care of myself.

201
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,850
Trust me.

202
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,490
Okay?

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,730
Mr. Jin.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,010
The goods are all packed.

205
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,940
We're good to go.

206
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,650
Have you gotten the pass we need to leave town?

207
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,290
Yes.

208
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,200
Youzhou is a big city.

209
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,310
There should be people

210
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,240
going in and out.

211
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,090
A while ago, there were refugees

212
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,210
coming to Youzhou every day.

213
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,090
Now the states nearby are all in chaos.

214
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,170
With city gates and roads locked down,

215
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,050
no one can make it here.

216
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,370
As for coming out,

217
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,280
Youzhou is the only safe place

218
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,250
in the world.

219
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,650
No one wants to come out.

220
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,510
[Youzhou]

221
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,410
Mr. Jin.

222
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,370
Mr. Jin.

223
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,170
Making another delivery for Master Zhao?

224
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,770
Here is the pass.

225
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,530
Take a look.

226
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:51,970
No need.

227
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,210
Master Zhao sends goods

228
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,120
out from here several times

229
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,890
every month.

230
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,090
We all know that.

231
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,410
Master Zhao must be a great businessman

232
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,910
to land clients in times like this.

233
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,000
[Pass]

234
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,970
Master Zhao is well-connected.

235
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,080
He can do business

236
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,970
that you outlanders can't.

237
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,610
What?

238
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,700
Are you jealous?

239
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,570
Herbs.

240
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:09,950
Uncover it.

241
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,630
They're Master Zhao's goods!

242
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,680
I know,

243
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,090
but rules are rules.

244
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:14,970
What do you mean?

245
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,290
You don't trust Master Zhao?

246
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,190
It has nothing to do with trust…

247
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,850
Shut up.

248
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,170
Know your place.

249
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,170
Let them go.

250
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,930
You told me to be strict.

251
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,370
I mean to others.

252
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,560
When Master Zhao

253
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,430
made contributions to Youzhou,

254
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,170
you were

255
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,100
God knows where.

256
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,450
How would I know that?

257
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,180
Mr. Jin.

258
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,540
It's his first day here.

259
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,830
Cut him some slack.

260
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,610
Mr. Jin.

261
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,020
Have a safe journey.

262
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,330
Please.

263
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,410
[Youzhou]

264
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,960
Sir.

265
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,110
What do you want me to do this time?

266
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,180
Have you heard of Master Zhao?

267
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,330
Everyone in Youzhou

268
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,390
knows Master Zhao.

269
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,880
I heard that he made contributions

270
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,810
to Youzhou once.

271
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,560
I heard from some old people

272
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,970
that about ten years ago,

273
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,280
the border of Youzhou was harassed by bandits.

274
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,480
The commissioner then was incompetent

275
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,360
and couldn't chase away those bandits.

276
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,050
It was Master Zhao who led troops to guard the border

277
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,890
and besieged several of the bandits' dens.

278
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,410
Nowadays, in the vicinity of Wangdu,

279
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,530
the Heifeng Fort is the only place where there are bandits.

280
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,520
With hilly terrain, it's an impregnable fortress.

281
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,690
The government can't do anything about them.

282
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,640
Except for them,

283
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,370
all the bandits were wiped out.

284
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,610
So,

285
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,760
this man once led an army?

286
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,080
Master Zhao was a commander.

287
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,720
Later, he was affected

288
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,930
by a mistake his son made

289
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,520
and got discharged from the army.

290
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,970
It's said that he hurt his leg when fighting the bandits.

291
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,530
There was nothing much

292
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,790
he could do in the army.

293
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,530
Later, he became a successful businessman

294
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,880
and gave out food every year.

295
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,610
He's a famous philanthropist.

296
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,410
So that's the reason

297
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,650
why he left the army.

298
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,760
He's been through a lot

299
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,960
to get where he is now.

300
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,370
Yes.

301
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,420
Sir.

302
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,160
Why are you asking about him?

303
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,010
I'm just curious.

304
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,640
He's transported lots of herbs

305
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,840
out of town recently.

306
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,530
Do you know

307
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,340
where he keeps those herbs?

308
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,420
Master Zhao's warehouse?

309
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,070
I asked around.

310
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,230
The guards at his warehouse

311
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,490
are changed at dawn.

312
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,650
The defense is weak then.

313
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,730
I need to go check it out.

314
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,330
Why?

315
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,490
Because something's wrong.

316
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,290
What's wrong?

317
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,260
The tracks.

318
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,610
According to the pass,

319
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,280
they were transporting herbs,

320
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,880
but the tracks were too deep.

321
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,190
Herbs wouldn't have been that heavy.

322
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,370
You mean

323
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,110
Master Zhao smuggled illegal goods out?

324
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,690
Both Commissioner Fan and General Zhou

325
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,150
are preparing for war now.

326
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,690
They have no time for things like this.

327
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,690
According to you,

328
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,450
Master Zhao

329
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,890
is popular among the people

330
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,090
and well-connected.

331
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,960
Even if he had really smuggled illegal goods,

332
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,050
it would be smoothed over

333
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,210
and he wouldn't be punished.

334
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,890
Why do you have to latch on to it?

335
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,020
This is what he gets for picking on you.

336
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
He made imitations of your work

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,770
and hired someone to throw mud at you.

338
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,530
Now he smuggled illegal goods

339
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,530
in broad daylight.

340
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,900
I have to get to the bottom of it.

341
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,190
Even if I can't bring him down,

342
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,610
I can get under his skin.

343
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,930
So you've heard about

344
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,520
what happened in the shop.

345
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,220
Of course.

346
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,370
You backed me up.

347
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,970
I'll do the same for you.

348
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,540
You must be careful.

349
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:37,860
Don't worry.

350
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,820
I know what to do.

351
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,260
Master Zhao,

352
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,720
after these 25 hundred kilograms of grains are delivered,

353
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,240
we'll have to wait for ten days

354
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,690
for the next batch to arrive?

355
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,570
What?

356
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,650
Why are you so impatient, Mr. Hu?

357
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,660
I'm worried that something may go wrong.

358
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,090
Can we transport grains out

359
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,450
more quickly?

360
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,390
If the commissioner

361
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,970
and General Zhou notice

362
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,510
that half of the grains

363
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,090
in the granary are gone,

364
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,090
I, the Tax Circuit Intendant,

365
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,220
will lose my head immediately.

366
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,090
Mr. Hu,

367
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,850
don't worry.

368
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,150
Let me tell you something.

369
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,210
I've filled the granary

370
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,490
with rotten grains.

371
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,660
Even if Fan and Zhou check on it now,

372
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:18,890
they won't

373
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,570
notice anything unusual.

374
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,650
With the help of Prefect Fan

375
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,770
and Commander Xia,

376
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,850
we just need to be careful

377
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,250
and hunker down.

378
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,650
Nothing will go wrong.

379
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,530
I understood, but…

380
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,880
By the way,

381
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,690
besides Yanzhou and Qingzhou,

382
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,780
Bingzhou has secretly reached out to me too.

383
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,070
They want to buy our grains

384
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,360
to replenish their military supplies.

385
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,050
I asked for

386
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,690
five times the price!

387
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,340
Mr. Hu,

388
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,740
just be patient.

389
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,010
Once the granary is empty,

390
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,320
we can sneak out of Youzhou

391
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,819
during the commotion.

392
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,450
By then,

393
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,230
Fan Xuan and Zhou Gaolang

394
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,349
will be guarding a doomed city with no food stores.

395
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,740
They'll be too up a creek

396
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,250
to go after us.

397
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,490
You're so good at doing business.

398
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,730
Master Zhao,

399
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,849
I'm at your disposal.

400
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,890
Guards!

401
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,450
Check over there.

402
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,220
Yes.

403
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,210
Get him!

404
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,170
Go get him!

405
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,050
I've seen him before.

406
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,050
He's a Yamen runner.

407
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,290
If he informs on us,

408
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,170
what should we do?

409
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,770
Jiusi said he'd be back soon.

410
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,130
It's almost dawn.

411
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,410
Has something happened to him?

412
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,770
Young Master is so good at martial arts.

413
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,810
Nothing can happen to him.

414
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,810
Don't worry yourself, Young Madam.

415
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,450
You're right.

416
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:34,890
No.

417
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,280
He should've long come back.

418
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,480
Something must have gone wrong.

419
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,940
I need to ask Zhou for help.

420
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,140
Young Madam.

421
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,490
[Commissioner's Mansion]

422
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,010
Mr. Gu.

423
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,170
Mr. Gu.

424
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,680
Master Zhao wants to see you.

425
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,810
Please come with me.

426
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,660
[Commissioner's Mansion]

427
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,980
Master Zhao.

428
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,490
He's here.

429
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,130
OK. You may leave.

430
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:28,890
Yes.

431
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,450
Mr. Gu.

432
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,660
Welcome to my humble abode.

433
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,730
Where is she?

434
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,630
Who do you mean?

435
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,940
What are you talking about?

436
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,170
I can't understand

437
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,330
what you're saying.

438
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,920
You're a local hero, Master Zhao.

439
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,490
If I've ever offended you,

440
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,210
you can come at me.

441
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,580
What's the point of victimizing a woman?

442
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,210
You're getting me confused.

443
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,210
But

444
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,410
judging from what you said,

445
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,220
I gather that something has happened

446
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,610
to your wife, right?

447
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,640
Mr. Gu,

448
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
I have to warn you.

449
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,250
Outside Youzhou,

450
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,850
a group of brutal bandits

451
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,450
are lurking in the mountains.

452
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,110
Their den is the Heifeng Fort.

453
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,000
In Youzhou,

454
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,490
when women go missing,

455
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,890
those bandits

456
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,930
are very likely the culprit.

457
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,410
I don't want to brag,

458
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,930
but I do have some sway

459
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,130
with the Master

460
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,250
of those bandits.

461
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,770
If I mediate between you and him,

462
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,090
he'll surely do me a favor

463
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,520
and release several of his captives.

464
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,410
Then what should I do

465
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,370
to get your help?

466
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,570
The bandits at the Heifeng Fort

467
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,890
are all ferocious murderers.

468
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,960
Rest assured.

469
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,960
I'll do whatever I can

470
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,010
to help your wife.

471
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,530
It's just that…

472
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,890
If I help you today,

473
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,410
in the future,

474
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,330
we'll be friends.

475
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,050
As friends,

476
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,850
we should

477
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,650
help and support

478
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,570
each other.

479
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,690
Tomorrow,

480
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,570
my fleet escorting the last batch of grains

481
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,760
will pass the north gate

482
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,020
where you stand watch.

483
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,690
Mr. Gu,

484
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,170
I bet you know what to do.

485
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,250
The people in Youzhou

486
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,850
depend on those grains to survive.

487
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,450
Without them,

488
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,570
countless people would become refugees

489
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,970
and even starve to death.

490
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,850
Master Zhao,

491
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,400
you're a philanthropist

492
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,520
and once fought on the battlefield

493
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,980
for the people of Youzhou.

494
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,850
Why are you so selfish now?

495
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,930
Mr. Gu,

496
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,130
I am a philanthropist!

497
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,970
If you don't believe me,

498
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,690
go ask around.

499
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,030
How many soup kitchens have I built

500
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,870
and how much money have I given out?

501
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,320
In the whole Youzhou,

502
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,920
I'm renowned for my kindness

503
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,980
and everyone holds me in high regard.

504
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,930
I know.

505
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,420
You're quite a figure.

506
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,690
The commissioner

507
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,570
and the son of General Zhou

508
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,610
are friends of yours.

509
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,850
However,

510
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,730
today,

511
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,410
you're just an insignificant gate guard.

512
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,240
Your voice doesn't carry much weight.

513
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,440
Even without your help,

514
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,770
I won't have any trouble

515
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,770
getting this deal done!

516
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,130
As long as you keep your mouth shut,

517
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,330
no one will know.

518
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,650
But if you

519
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,330
insist on

520
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,130
making things hard for me,

521
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,610
whatever may happen

522
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,130
to your wife

523
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,930
will be beyond my capability.

524
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Tomorrow at dawn,

525
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,570
if my fleet

526
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,850
leaves town smoothly,

527
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,850
your wife will return safe and sound.

528
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,370
Mr. Gu,

529
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,180
think about it.

530
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
See the guest out.

531
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,450
Please, Mr. Gu.

532
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,370
Master Zhao,

533
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,810
I've sent someone to keep an eye on him.

534
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,730
Keep it quiet.

535
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:08,770
Yes.

536
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,100
Master Zhao.

537
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,800
There's one thing I don't understand.

538
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,320
Since Gu Jiusi

539
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,010
has found out our secret,

540
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,370
why don't we…

541
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,690
Gu Jiusi has to die.

542
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,810
However,

543
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,610
it can't be our doing.

544
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,420
I've been providing for the Heifeng Fort for so long.

545
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,690
It's time for them

546
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,970
to repay my kindness.

547
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,870
You know what to do,

548
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,130
don't you?

549
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
You're so wise, Master Zhao.

550
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,800
By the way,

551
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,530
a message came from the Heifeng Fort.

552
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,570
They've brought that woman

553
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,850
to the fort.

554
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,970
What should they do next?

555
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,570
I see.

556
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,930
[The Heifeng Fort]

557
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,610
Young Madam.

558
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,590
[Shen Ming, the Assistant Master of the Heifeng Fort]

559
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,650
Y-Young Madam.

560
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,050
I think he's a bandit.

561
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,010
Young Master,

562
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,030
no matter how much you were paid,

563
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,160
I'll pay you double.

564
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,090
Sorry.

565
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,660
No one has ever called me

566
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,040
Young Master before.

567
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:00,890
My name

568
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,610
is Shen Ming.

569
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,010
I'm a bandit,

570
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,180
not a Young Master.

571
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,370
Well,

572
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,840
do you know who paid me to do this?

573
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,450
The one in Wangdu.

574
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,090
Young Master,

575
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,130
you just want money.

576
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,650
You were paid to do this.

577
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,290
I promise.

578
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,150
As long as you let us go,

579
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,210
I'll give you

580
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,760
much more than he did.

581
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,730
Young Master.

582
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,330
Did you hear me?

583
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,450
Yes.

584
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,570
What do you think?

585
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,230
You're pretty.

586
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,340
Those who kidnapped you

587
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,690
said you're pretty.

588
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,890
Looking at you now,

589
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,130
I agree with them.

590
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,250
You're prettier

591
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,880
when you're not talking.

592
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,050
To be honest,

593
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,970
you're the prettiest girl

594
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,850
I've ever seen in my life.

595
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,470
Most importantly, you're very elegant.

596
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,030
Anyway,

597
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,230
you can't go back now.

598
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,140
Why don't you just be my woman?

599
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,130
If you say yes,

600
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,000
I promise to treat you very well.

601
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,090
But I'm married!

602
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,330
I know.

603
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,570
You're

604
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,230
the wife of that Yamen runner.

605
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,280
But

606
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,610
now that I abducted you,

607
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,210
your reputation is ruined.

608
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,290
Even if I let you go,

609
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,980
would he take you back?

610
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,450
Even if he did,

611
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,550
would he

612
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,150
treat you well in the future?

613
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,450
He'd surely

614
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,200
remember this incident for his whole life.

615
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,610
Imagine what kind of suffering

616
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,810
you'd be put through.

617
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,520
Am I right?

618
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,580
He…

619
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,970
He won't do that!

620
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,850
If you're so sure,

621
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,310
why are you shivering?

622
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,430
Young Madam is just afraid of you.

623
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,010
To tell you the truth,

624
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,650
it was not my decision

625
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,850
to kidnap you.

626
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,300
I'm not the Master here.

627
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,330
You offered

628
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,330
to give me money,

629
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,890
but it didn't appeal to me.

630
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,450
I'm not young anymore.

631
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,240
Before my mother passed away,

632
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,700
she urged me to find a wife.

633
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,310
I've met lots of women,

634
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,690
but you seem the right one for me.

635
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,340
No special reason.

636
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,420
You're quite a looker.

637
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,260
Let me tell you something.

638
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,280
I'm good at martial arts

639
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,490
and have a good temper.

640
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,020
I'll be very nice to my wife.

641
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,170
Most importantly,

642
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,240
I don't care about

643
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,930
conventions.

644
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
You were married,

645
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,890
but I don't mind.

646
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,610
I just want you to be my wife.

647
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:04,800
Anyway,

648
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,240
you can't go back anymore.

649
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,610
Even if you did,

650
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,740
what would others think of you?

651
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:10,930
Wouldn't your husband

652
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,960
despise you?

653
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,650
You might as well

654
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,560
stay here with me

655
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,090
and be happy for the rest of your life.

656
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,020
Isn't that good?

657
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,210
My husband is not that kind of person.

658
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,680
He doesn't care about those things.

659
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,090
He'll come to save me.

660
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,450
My husband can give me

661
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,910
everything you promised.

662
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:25,760
Why should I

663
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,440
spend the rest of my life with you?

664
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,090
My husband

665
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,490
is more handsome than you

666
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,570
and has better martial art skills.

667
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,830
He treats me very well.

668
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,670
He buys me whatever I want.

669
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,430
He even spent a whole month's salary

670
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,410
to buy me rouge.

671
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,510
Can you do that?

672
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,610
Wait.

673
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,270
A whole month's salary

674
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,510
spent on rouge?

675
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,170
Yes.

676
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,090
What is your face?

677
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,860
A supper-sized canvas?

678
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,830
How are you going to

679
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,960
use up so much rogue?

680
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,760
You're a bandit who knows nothing.

681
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,440
He bought it but I don't have to use it up.

682
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,500
Then why bought it?

683
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,600
Why spend money on things you don't need?

684
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,280
You're

685
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,410
such a spendthrift!

686
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:57,960
You…

687
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,520
Don't argue with him.

688
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,490
He's a moron.

689
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:05,930
Young Master.

690
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:06,930
If you

691
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,530
can't make the decision,

692
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,130
tell your Master

693
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,600
that the money he wants,

694
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,660
I can give it to him.

695
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,650
Forget it.

696
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:16,730
This matter

697
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,140
is not negotiable.

698
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,050
You

699
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,250
should just pray

700
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,580
that you can stay alive.

701
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Why did you say so?

702
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,530
Do you think the one behind it

703
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,610
paid us

704
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,670
just to kidnap you?

705
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,570
A message just arrived.

706
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,850
He told us

707
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,650
to make you disappear

708
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,930
without a trace.

709
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,370
Eat.

710
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,330
Otherwise,

711
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,490
you'll die on an empty stomach.

712
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,810
Young Master,

713
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,610
my hands are tied.

714
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,490
How can I eat?

715
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,170
Stupid me.

716
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:12,730
Okay.

717
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,820
I'll untie you.

718
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,440
What should I do?

719
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,200
If I let the grains out of town,

720
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,050
Youzhou will be doomed.

721
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,290
But Yuru…

722
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,930
You should thank me.

723
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:03,530
Without me,

724
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,620
you and your little maid

725
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,610
would've been put through hell.

726
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,540
That's exactly what you're doing.

727
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,380
Yinhong.

728
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:14,530
Young Master.

729
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,090
My maid is young and ignorant.

730
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,290
She didn't mean what she said.

731
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,820
Please don't take offense.

732
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,650
No offense taken.

733
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,210
I heard that you're from the south.

734
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,370
Are all the girls in the south

735
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,370
like you?

736
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:28,850
Like what?

737
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,610
Elegant.

738
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,010
Have a gentle and beautiful voice.

739
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,170
Polite

740
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,590
and good-looking.

741
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,050
But not fragile.

742
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,210
Look at you.

743
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,750
You look very calm.

744
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,700
Don't worry.

745
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,860
You

746
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,900
still stand a chance of living.

747
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,410
The one who paid us

748
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,170
just wants you to disappear.

749
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,930
As for how,

750
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,170
he doesn't care.

751
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,420
As for the guys outside,

752
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,610
I've told them

753
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,550
that I'll make you my wife.

754
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,380
None of them dares to hurt you.

755
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,290
However,

756
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,530
if they know

757
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,130
that you refuse to be my wife,

758
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,120
there's no telling

759
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,050
what they may do.

760
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,290
Well,

761
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,430
I'm grateful, Young Master Shen.

762
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,570
If you are, marry me.

763
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,250
Look.

764
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,290
It'll dawn soon.

765
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,830
If you don't agree now,

766
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,310
I'll ask you every day.

767
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,530
You'll say yes sooner or later.

768
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,050
So,

769
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,010
you might as well say yes now.

770
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,320
At the first light of day,

771
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,410
let's get married.

772
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,330
It'll save so much trouble.

773
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,890
Young Master Shen, you can't

774
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,700
get married in such haste.

775
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,770
Haste?

776
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,100
I'm already taking my time.

777
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,450
Other guys

778
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,590
simply kidnap

779
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,640
any women they want.

780
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,700
They don't care how those women feel.

781
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,600
I'm different from them.

782
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,690
I am

783
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,130
seriously

784
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,690
bonding with you.

785
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,449
Well,

786
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,290
if you marry me,

787
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,639
I'll have the most beautiful wife

788
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,889
at this fort.

789
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,690
That's something to brag about.

790
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,300
Why are you so quiet?

791
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:43,969
I know.

792
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,120
You've been up all night.

793
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
You must be tired.

794
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,190
How about this?

795
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,620
Take a rest.

796
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,239
I'll watch out for you.

797
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,320
If anything happens,

798
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,920
I'll notice it immediately.

799
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:55,820
Don't worry.

800
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:57,700
Alright.

801
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,470
Go to sleep.

802
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,020
Why don't you sleep?

803
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,090
I can't sleep.

804
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,060
You don't feel sleepy?

805
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,370
When do you usually

806
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,130
go to bed?

807
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,290
I often stay up

808
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,410
until midnight.

809
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:19,930
So late.

810
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,850
Why are you up so late?

811
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,690
Bookkeeping takes lots of time.

812
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,290
Besides,

813
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,290
my husband is busy.

814
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,140
I need to wait for him to come back.

815
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,640
Will you

816
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,440
wait for him to come back to sleep?

817
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,040
Of course.

818
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,650
Will you wait for him for dinner?

819
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,410
Sure.

820
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,770
If he dies,

821
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,570
will you remember him forever?

822
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,330
Of course!

823
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,410
Great!

824
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,970
If you marry me,

825
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,370
I'll be very happy.

826
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,010
You shameless rogue.

827
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,110
Get over yourself.

828
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,610
Find a mirror

829
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,810
and look at yourself.

830
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,450
Why should I look in the mirror?

831
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,710
Am I not good-looking?

832
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,210
You wouldn't be a bandit if you were.

833
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,250
What does my appearance

834
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:10,960
have to do with

835
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
me being a bandit?

836
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,640
Girl,

837
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,970
you make no sense at all.

838
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,540
Enough.

839
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,290
Let's go to sleep.

840
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,930
Wait, you…

841
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,850
You said you couldn't sleep.

842
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,540
I prefer sleep to your blabber.

843
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,130
Okay?

844
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:30,690
Okay.

845
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,620
Good night.

846
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,130
[Youzhou]

847
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,290
[Youzhou]

848
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,200
Do you need to check the pass?

849
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,290
No.

850
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,070
Please.

851
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,370
Wait.

852
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,810
I'd like to check the goods.

853
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,890
If you check,

854
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,090
check it all out.

855
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,850
[Youzhou]

856
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:10,580
Alright.

857
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,650
Off you go.

858
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,450
[Youzhou]

859
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,170
Tomorrow morning, when I signal you,

860
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,330
give this letter and sachet

861
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,130
to Mr. Zhou Ye.

862
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,610
Huzi,

863
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,770
Youzhou's future is at stake.

864
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,900
You must be careful.

865
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,650
Understood.

866
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,840
[Youzhou]

867
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,370
Where are you going?

868
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,170
Are you pretending to be asleep?

869
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,050
No.

870
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,670
You two are too clumsy

871
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,010
and made all that noise.

872
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,440
It woke me up.

873
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,750
I wanted to be nice

874
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,080
so I untied you

875
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,520
so that you could sleep well

876
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,580
and enjoy the food.

877
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,570
But you just want to run away.

878
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,930
You said it yourself.

879
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,680
The one who paid you

880
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,480
wants us dead.

881
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,520
We have to either run away

882
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,650
or be sitting ducks.

883
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,400
Take my word.

884
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,570
You can't escape.

885
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,730
We'll see.

886
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,490
I told you

887
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,230
that you can't escape.

888
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,090
Why wouldn't you believe me?

889
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,330
[Youzhou]

890
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,770
Young Master.

891
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,770
Young Master, be careful.

892
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,060
What did you say?

893
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,770
Gu Jiusi

894
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,580
went to the Heifeng Fort

895
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,730
all alone?

896
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,210
Yes,

897
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,220
Master Zhao.

898
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,160
He didn't even bring his valet

899
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,810
with him.

900
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,850
Just he and his horse.

901
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,930
Great.

902
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,710
I was worried that he might be too cowardly

903
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,010
to rise to my bait.

904
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,650
After all, he can marry twice

905
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,130
but only die once.

906
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,540
I didn't expect him

907
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,050
to be a hopeless romantic

908
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,690
who would go to the Heifeng Fort alone

909
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,250
to throw his life away for a woman.

910
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,810
Good.

911
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,450
Good!

912
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,810
Once Gu Jiusi is dead,

913
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:42,890
you'll have

914
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,650
nothing more to worry about.

915
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,010
Great!

916
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:51,940
We'll set off

917
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,090
very soon.

918
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,610
Remember.

919
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,630
Now we train twice a day

920
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,580
instead of once.

921
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,330
Yes.

922
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,960
General Zhou.

923
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:10,330
Mr. Gu asked me

924
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,660
to give you this letter.

925
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,090
Zhou.

926
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,490
Master Zhao colluded with Hu Heng, the Tax Circuit Intendant,

927
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,630
to secretly transport

928
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,560
the grain reserves out of Youzhou.

929
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,790
He has emptied

930
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,320
almost half of the granary.

931
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,290
Sorry that I couldn't

932
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,690
inform you immediately.

933
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,900
But fortunately, it's not too late.
