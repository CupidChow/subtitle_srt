Father.

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,440
Father.

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,920
I'm fine.

Don't be afraid.

I'm here with you.

Father.

14
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,870
I didn't set the Luo family's house

15
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,120
on fire.

16
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,930

Help!

22
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,680
I accidentally knocked over a candlestick.

23
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,650
If I can,

24
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,600
I'm willing to

25
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,130
give up everything

After we enter the city,

38
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,090
we'll directly charge into the court.

39
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,659

soldiers who died on the battlefield of Nanzhao

43
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,690
and my family

44
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,409
who died for nothing!

Gu Jiusi.

49
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,630
What are you doing?

50
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,770
Yesterday, the young Emperor decided

51
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,570
to relinquish the throne to you.

52
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,700
It's also what the late Emperor wished.

53
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,010
He applauded your bravery

54
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,580
and contributions to national defense.

55
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,460
He said you're the pillar of the country

56
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,720
and deserve the crown.

57
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,720
Therefore,

58
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,300
your ascending the throne is legitimate

59
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,840
and what we all wish.

60
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,130
I,

61
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,340
together with all other officials,

62
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,970
welcome you into the capital

63
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,400

65
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,400
You surprised me.

66
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,810
In order to save Fan Yu,

67
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,280
you even managed to make him abdicate.

[The Eastern Capital]

69
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,080
I'm not trying to save the young Emperor.

70
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm doing this

71
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,850
to save the honor

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,980
of the Youzhou Army,

73
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,390
to protect the people of the Eastern Capital,

74
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,280
to save Da Xia from wars,

75
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,840
and to maintain peace.

76
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,880
Our country

77
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,490
can't afford another war.

78
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,200
Your Majesty,

79
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,190
please disarm and take the throne.

80
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,460
It turns out that my old friend

81
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,040
never understood me.

82
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,700
Gu Jiusi,

83
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,650
neither do you!

84
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,170
What I want

85
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,290
is never the throne.

86
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,770
Whether when Brother Fan was on the throne

87
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,520
or when his son ruled,

88
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,840
the Zhou family

89
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,090
never thought of

90
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,220
taking the throne from the Fan family!

91
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,420
If Fan Xuan failed

92
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,640
to see that,

93
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,970
then I have to say

94
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,800
he never truly understood me.

95
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,159
Today,

96
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,260
I must kill Fan Yu,

97
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,169
the tyrant.

98
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,789
He forged an imperial edict

99
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,159
to send the Youzhou Army to attack Nanzhao,

100
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,890
causing 100,000 soldiers to die in the southwest!

101
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,650

102
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,680

104
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,210

107

He's paid with his life for what he did.

108
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,040
Hasn't Fan Yu done anything wrong?

109
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,370
He sent my soldiers to death,

110
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,730
cut off my military supplies, and killed my family!

111
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,160
With God's blessing,

112

I and the soldiers here

113
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,250
didn't die in Nanzhao.

114

But that wretch

115
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,530
dropped bombs in the lake,

116
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,490
trying to drown 300,000 heroes.

117
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,530
What an atrocity!

118
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,480
He was indeed deceived by Luo Zishang.

119
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,890
But didn't Fan Yu

120
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,180
issue all those imperial edicts

121
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,610
himself?

122
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,450
Who am I to him?

123
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,930
I'm his

124
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,600
Uncle Zhou.

125
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,030
Everyone he killed in the Zhou family,

126
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,760
every one of them,

127
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,760

grow up.

130
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,130
He doesn't have a heart

131
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,770
and is worse than animals!

132
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,520
Today,

133
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,650
I'll kill whoever

134
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,840
begs for mercy for him.

135
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,150
If anyone dares to stop me from entering the city,

136
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,920
I'll leap over them

141
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,290
just ride across my body.

142
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,390
As long as I'm still breathing,

143
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,930
I won't step back.

144
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,160
I can't let Your Majesty

145
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,780
become a sinner

Your Majesty.

148
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,820
Vying for power is not an act of heroism.

149
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,480
It's the common folk who suffer the toll of war.

150

758
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,900
You'll have no one to take care of you when you're old.

759
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,230
Yun'er, how about this?

760
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,840
Our first child will have your surname.

761
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,900
He'll be the descendant of the Ye family.

762
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,240
When the child grows up,

763
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
he'll hold your brother's funeral.

764
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,560
What?

765
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,880
My funeral?

766
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:48,980
Shen Ming,

767
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,080
are you cursing me?

768
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,360
Don't forget

769
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,180
that I'm the head of this family.

770
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,210
I can

771
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,360
kick you out anytime.

772
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,770
I don't mind you kicking him out.

773
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,160
Brother.

774
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,680
Before doing that,

775
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,080
can you bring my sister-in-law back first?

776
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,060
That's right.

777
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,910
Our sister-in-law is the most important.

778
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,320
I got it.

779
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,280
This dinner

780
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,320
is a trap.

781
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,320
It's not.

782
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,670
Here, Brother-in-law.

783
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,370
Brother-in-law.

784
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,430
Let's have a toast.

785
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,100
When Crown Prince Ye administered the country,

786
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,360
he minimized taxes,

787
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,880
expanded trade,

788
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,060
and offered farming subsidies.

789
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,880
The rich merchant Gu-Liu Yuru

790
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,570
built charity halls

791
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,050
and promoted foreign trade.

792
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,660
♫It's a time of unrest♫

793
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,980
As a result, Da Xia prospered

794
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,050
♫Memories of the good old days flood back at times♫

795
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,960
and its people lived in peace.

796
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,530
In the fifth year of the Anjian Period,

797
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:56,120
Emperor Gaolang took Northern and Western Liang back

798
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,120
♫He writes order in chaos♫

799
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,240
from invaders

800
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,800
♫Dark hair turns grey and escapes from the hairpin♫

801
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,190
and made Da Xia whole again.

802
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,920
After the victory,

803
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,390
♫Mountains crumble, and the beacon fires fade♫

804
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,850
Emperor Gaolang fell ill

805
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,240
because of years of toil

806
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,350
♫I miss playing chess and drinking wine with you♫

807
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,620
and had no energy for court affairs,

808
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,540
so he passed the throne to Crown Prince Ye.

809
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,310
♫It was autumn when we parted ways♫

810
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,880
The new period is named Zhaoming.

811
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,530
Gu Jiusi was appointed as the Left Counsellor,

812
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:15,730
♫We sang songs about a brighter future♫

813
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,580
Ye Shi'an the Right Chancellor,

814
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,010
Shen Ming the commissioner of Bingzhou,

815
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,870
♫Sharing a boat with you, we drift down the rivers♫

816
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,530
and Zhou Zhuo the commissioner of Youzhou.

817
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:22,590
♫Walking the path with you, we travel the martial world♫

818
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,400
They'll serve the country together.

819
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,400
♫With a smile, we talk of right and wrong, life and death♫

820
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,190
♫Joy is hard to define♫

821
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,800
Rise.

822
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,740
♫Riding alongside you, I see the world unfold♫

823
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,200
Meet His Majesty.

824
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,370
♫Fighting alongside you, I no longer fear the unknown♫

825
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,040
Congratulations, Your Majesty,

826
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,570
♫In the dust stirred up by the wind, we write our own fates♫

827
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,400
on achieving national unity

828
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,930
and prosperity.

829
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,520
Long may you reign.

830
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,850
Congratulations, Your Majesty,

831
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,410

Long live Your Majesty!

835
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,450

♫Mountains crumble, and the beacon fires fade♫
