[Episode 13]

4
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,500
There are so many

5
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,229
beautiful stones in your pond.

6
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,009
Can I take some home?

7
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,500
You like pretty stones?

8
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,180
Thank you.

9
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,220
What's your name?

10
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,300
I told you to keep an eye on him,

11
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,620
yet he messed with

12
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,579
the granddaughter of Scholar Su next door.

13
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,910
He didn't mess with her.

14
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,300
That naughty girl

15
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,579
climbed over the wall to play with him.

16
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,910
What's the difference?

17
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,190
Don't you know he can't be seen?

18
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,730
If word gets out

19
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,260
that my only daughter

20
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,530
was sullied

21
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,020
and then abandoned

22
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,620
before getting married,

23
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,300
and have a son out of wedlock,

24
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,380
the whole Luo family

25
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,240
will be disgraced because of you!

26
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,340
He can't

27
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,100
go to the garden again.

28
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,820
His existence

29
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,340
should forever be a secret.

30
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,810
Guards!

31
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,420
Yes.

32
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,820
Lock him up.

33
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,420
Yes.

34
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,340
I have to go to the garden.

35
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,620
I promised

36
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,660
to give her Yuhua Stones!

37
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,900
-Fire!
-Fire!

38
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,100
Mother!

39
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,420
Mother!

40
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,860
Mother!

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,980
Mother!

42
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,500
What's your name?

43
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,140
You can have the whole piece.

44
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,700
These are my treasures.

45
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,300
I'll share them with you.

46
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,500
Miss,

47
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,580
why did you sneak out alone?

48
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,420
You shouldn't sit with a beggar.

49
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,340
He's my new friend.

50
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,180
Go home now.

51
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,140
Her Ladyship is waiting for you.

52
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,540
Liu Yuru.

53
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,900
Why did she happen to be you?

54
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,310
Unfortunately,

55
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,460
even if she's you,

56
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,420
now that you married Gu Jiusi,

57
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,260
you have to go down

58
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,340
with the Gu family.

59
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,750
[Wang Mansion]

60
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,030
Congratulations, my lord.

61
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,940
On what?

62
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,980
Lord Liang

63
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,159
is about to rise up.

64
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,060
Just as you expected.

65
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,900
Everyone has the right

66
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,340
to execute a traitor.

67
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,860
Yangzhou is the bread basket of the country.

68
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,850
It's too critical to be lost.

69
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,840
In the current situation,

70
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,140
even if you take the whole Yangzhou

71
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
into your control,

72
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,320
it'll be seen as a justifiable

73
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,660
and patriotic act.

74
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,180
By the time Lord Liang is brought to justice,

75
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,180
every state will have been weakened by the conflicts.

76
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,260
By then,

77
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,780
whoever takes over the Eastern Capital

78
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:23,900
will have to

79
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
welcome you into the new court.

80
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,020
Mr. Luo.

81
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,620
You have a remarkable mind.

82
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,140
It's my honor to have your advice.

83
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,659
Go back now.

84
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,460
It's been long since you came out.

85
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,700
They may be worried.

86
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,180
Mother.

87
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,159
Have a good rest after going back.

88
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,500
Wait for my news.

89
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,340
One more thing.

90
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,830
Tomorrow is your birthday.

91
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,860
I planned to ask Yun

92
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,940
to send it to you,

93
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,580
but since I met you today,

94
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,360
I'll give it to you myself.

95
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,780
Mother, you embroidered this again.

96
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,460
This pattern

97
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,900
must have taken you lots of time.

98
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,220
I told you so many times

99
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,660
not to embroider these things.

100
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,790
You never listened.

101
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,670
Will they celebrate your birthday tomorrow?

102
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,660
We're about

103
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,300
to leave Yangzhou soon.

104
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,380
There are so many things

105
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,440
waiting to be done.

106
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,220
My birthday is not important.

107
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,900
No one will remember.

108
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,500
Right.

109
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,970
I just think that Jiusi cares for you

110
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,280
and may remember it.

111
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,220
The result of the Provincial Examination will be out tomorrow.

112
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,300
He's too busy

113
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,260
worrying about himself

114
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,659
to remember my birthday.

115
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,820
It's okay.

116
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,260
Birthdays

117
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,590
don't matter much to me.

118
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,520
It's enough that you remember it.

119
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,500
So far.

120
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,630
Come on. Do it again.

121
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Great!

122
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,240
I'll give it a shot too.

123
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,980
You threw it very far too.

124
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,610
Right?

125
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,060
Wait.

126
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,300
This stone is so beautiful.

127
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,300
It surely is.

128
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,780
Could it be a gem?

129
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,700
It must be a gem.

130
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,299
Let's go

131
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,059
hide it in the secret spot.

132
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,659
Okay. Let's hide it there

133
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,900
and tell no one about it.

134
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,100
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

135
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,740
Hurry. No one's here.

136
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,620
Hurry up.

137
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,370
That's where I hide my treasures.

138
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,540
Keep it between us.

139
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,770
There are many pretty stones in my pond.

140
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,380
I'll pick them out

141
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,420
and give them to you.

142
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,060
Okay.

143
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,740
But I'm leaving tomorrow.

144
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,260
Y-You're leaving?

145
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,590
Where are you going?

146
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,180
I'm going home with my mother.

147
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,460
I live in Yangzhou.

148
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,340
Will you forget me after you leave?

149
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,520
I'll come back to visit my grandpa again.

150
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,780
But maybe it'll be years

151
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,040
before you come again.

152
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,820
Then tell me

153
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,340
your name.

154
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,580
If I know your name,

155
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,300
I won't forget you.

156
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,130
I really can't tell you.

157
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,180
Well,

158
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,380
with those colorful stones as reminders,

159
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,380
you'll remember me forever, right?

160
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,770
Then I'll go collect them today.

161
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,660
Tomorrow morning,

162
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,920
let's meet here again.

163
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,100
I'll give you all the pretty stones.

164
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,970
Would you like that?

165
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,340
Yes. It's a deal.

166
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,460
Deal.

167
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,750
I'll be here tomorrow.

168
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,550
Pinky swear.

169
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,890
Master,

170
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,020
100,000 boxes of fireworks are ready.

171
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,280
They can be ignited at a moment's notice.

172
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,820
Where is she?

173
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,900
Master?

174
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,100
Liu Yuru.

175
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,860
Where

176
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,100
is she?

177
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,340
Happy birthday, Fairy Yuru.

178
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,380
Happy birthday, Fairy Yuru.

179
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,730
[Happy Birthday]

180
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,460
Wish you happiness and longevity.

181
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,780
Wish you happiness and longevity.

182
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,740
Wish you happiness and longevity.

183
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,970
Yinhong.

184
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,850
What's wrong with you?

185
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,620
Why did you join them

186
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,700
to make such a fuss?

187
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,850
We're not making a fuss.

188
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,900
According to Young Master,

189
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,780
we're having a celebration

190
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,460
to give you all our best wishes.

191
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,220
Exactly.

192
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,580
No one mentioned anything about it

193
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,820
because we want to surprise you

194
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,880
and make you happy.

195
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,610
You want to make me happy?

196
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,720
You just want to embarrass me!

197
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,920
Put it down, everyone.

198
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,500
Drop the act.

199
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,430
You're elated inside, aren't you?

200
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,450
Let's do it again!

201
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,900
Happy birthday, Fairy Yuru.

202
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,900
Wish you happiness and longevity.

203
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,860
Wish you happiness and longevity.

204
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Wish you happiness and longevity.

205
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,660
Yuru.

206
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,220
Mother.

207
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,350
Save the etiquette.

208
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,580
Today is your birthday.

209
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,940
You deserve more respect than anyone else.

210
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,650
I've told the stores

211
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,550
to put everything aside today.

212
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,340
Don't worry about anything.

213
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,580
Just have a good time

214
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,860
celebrating your birthday.

215
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,920
Thank you, Mother.

216
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,300
Here.

217
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,460
This is your birthday gift.

218
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,700
Mother, as your daughter,

219
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,570
I haven't given you and Father any gift.

220
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,170
How can I take a gift from you?

221
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,460
We want to give you a gift.

222
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,220
Just take it.

223
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,060
This old man is loaded.

224
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,900
Don't be shy.

225
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,340
Take a look. Do you like it?

226
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,240
Take a look.

227
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,660
Yinhong.

228
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,220
What a heavy gift.

229
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,130
Thank you, Father, Mother.

230
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,540
You're welcome.

231
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,420
We're glad that you like it.

232
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,110
Yes.

233
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,510
We've been so busy recently

234
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,540
and today the result

235
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,020
of the Provincial Examination will…

236
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,350
Today is your birthday.

237
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,260
How would you like to celebrate it?

238
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,390
How to celebrate it?

239
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,540
How did you celebrate it in the past?

240
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,850
In the past,

241
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,580
my mother

242
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,180
arranged everything for me.

243
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,380
It was lots of fun too.

244
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,840
How about this?

245
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,570
I'll take care of everything this year.

246
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,430
I promise you'll have a great day.

247
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,140
The kitchen has been preparing

248
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,100
for the birthday banquet since two days ago.

249
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,500
Where are you taking her?

250
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,220
Just eating is so boring.

251
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,660
I'll take her out for some fun.

252
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,420
To where?

253
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,100
You love watching

254
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,340
cock fights and dog races,

255
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,820
but Yuru may find them too uncouth.

256
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,100
You're right, old man.

257
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,830
I'm taking her to watch cock fights and dog races.

258
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,740
You're messing around again.

259
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,780
Yuru is an elegant lady.

260
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,060
Unlike you,

261
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,020
she can't fool around

262
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,820
and draw attention wherever she goes.

263
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,260
But when she replenished stocks,

264
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,100
kept accounts, and talked business,

265
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,340
she's already received lots of attention.

266
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,470
Aren't you the same?

267
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,370
That's for business.

268
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,100
Business is serious.

269
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,870
They're different!

270
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,460
What's the difference?

271
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,100
Remember our family motto?

272
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,740
Women are equal to men.

273
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,020
Women should be allowed

274
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,350
to do things that men do.

275
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,820
Are you saying that the women in our family

276
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,140
can only work hard to make money

277
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,340
and can't go out for fun?

278
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,140
Is it fair?

279
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,380
He's insane.

280
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,290
I want to take you out for fun.

281
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,220
Do you want to go?

282
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,460
I…

283
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,100
It's her birthday.

284
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,340
She has the final say.

285
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,580
Come back, you brat!

286
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,260
He's misbehaving again.

287
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,270
Why didn't you stop him?

288
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,010
It makes sense.

289
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
What makes sense?

290
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,850
Why is it that the women in this family

291
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,980
can only go out to make money

292
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,460
but not for fun?

293
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,660
When I have my birthday next year,

294
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,700
you have to take me out

295
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,380
for fun too.

296
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,300
Why are you…

297
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,400
I knew I couldn't count on you.

298
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,070
I'll go by myself next year.

299
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,780
No.

300
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
I'll go tomorrow.

301
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,660
Rou.

302
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,380
I didn't say you can't go.

303
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,790
[Gu Mansion]

304
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,660
Good morning, Mrs. Gu.

305
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,420
Mrs. Gu,

306
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,420
happy birthday!

307
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,730
I've told you how to address her!

308
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,740
Call her Second Brother!

309
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,740
What's the point

310
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,420
of calling her that?

311
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,020
We're not fools.

312
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,500
We've been

313
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,580
your brothers for so many years,

314
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,490
but you never treated us like this.

315
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,180
Why have you

316
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,060
never gone through so much trouble

317
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,660
to celebrate our birthdays?

318
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,420
Get lost.

319
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,780
We'll wait for you.

320
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,310
So much for our friendship.

321
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,120
They're just jealous.

322
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,140
Let's go.

323
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,530
Let's go to the Examination Hall first.

324
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,100
The Examination Hall?

325
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,620
Why?

326
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,500
To check the ranking, of course.

327
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,780
It's too early.

328
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,580
No.

329
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,100
The result will be out at seven.

330
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,380
If we go late, we won't be able to get to the front

331
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,420
to see the ranking clearly.

332
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:29,950
We agreed

333
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,480
to watch cock fights first.

334
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,380
You meant it?

335
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,940
Of course. Let's go.

336
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,300
Go get him! Come on!

337
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,020
Go. Go. Go.

338
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,900
Place our bets

339
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,100
on that Black Wind.

340
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,860
Black Wind.

341
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,340
No, no. On General Danding.

342
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,020
On the General.

343
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,610
Wait.

344
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,890
Let me think about it.

345
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,980
Hurry up.

346
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,710
They'll take no more bets soon.

347
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,780
General Danding.

348
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,380
General Danding?

349
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,780
You've made up your mind?

350
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,420
Black Wind.

351
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,700
No take backs.

352
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,660
I'm placing the bets now.

353
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,339
Wait. Give me one more second.

354
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,329
What if we lose?

355
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,540
Trust me. We won't lose.

356
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,220
Hurry up.

357
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,400
General Danding it is!

358
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,579
General Danding.

359
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,579
General Danding!

360
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,540
Black Wind!

361
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,579
General, hit him!

362
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,540
Beat him up! Hurry!

363
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,180
I don't dare to look.

364
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,710
Beat him!

365
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,080
Beat him up!

366
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,660
How's it? How's it?

367
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
See for yourself.

368
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,980
Beat him, General!

369
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,040
Yes. Beat him hard!

370
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,780
Get him!

371
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,920
They're fighting!

372
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,820
Get him!

373
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,300
Beat him up!

374
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,100
We won!

375
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,130
We won! We won!

376
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,260
We won! We won!

377
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,080
Mrs. Gu.

378
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,520
Young Madam, here are your winnings.

379
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,580
Why are they double?

380
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,870
General Danding

381
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,020
is Mr. Gu's cock.

382
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,060
If he wins, you'll get a bonus.

383
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
Therefore, the winnings are double.

384
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,390
Alright. Put them away.

385
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,460
Here.

386
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,300
Fortunately, General Danding

387
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,860
is yours.

388
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,220
Black Wind

389
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,150
was very fierce.

390
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,340
Black Wind

391
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,420
is his cock too.

392
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,020
No wonder you said we wouldn't lose.

393
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,420
They're both your cocks.

394
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,700
He splashed out

395
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,400
on all the best cocks here.

396
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,340
Jiusi, if you play this way,

397
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,500
you'll always be the winner.

398
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,820
Do you still find the games fun?

399
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
Of course.

400
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,500
I love winning.

401
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,540
Mr. Gu,

402
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,060
your General Danding,

403
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,740
Black Wind,

404
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,140
Marshal Jin, and Lan Caihe

405
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,100
won a total of

406
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,830
472 taels of silver this month.

407
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,220
Later, the manager

408
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,140
will seal the money

409
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,220
and send it to your mansion.

410
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,420
I'll keep the streamer.

411
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,420
It's auspicious.

412
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,380
Today is my wife's birthday.

413
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,300
Use the money

414
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,620
to buy yourselves a celebratory drink!

415
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,860
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

416
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,100
Happy birthday, Young Madam Gu.

417
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,770
Wish you happiness and longevity.

418
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,980
One more time.

419
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,620
Happy birthday, Young Madam Gu.

420
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,300
Wish you happiness and longevity.

421
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,780
Are you happy?

422
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,140
Yes.

423
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,930
Yinhong said you liked playing with little animals

424
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,980
when you were a kid

425
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,260
and were good at climbing walls.

426
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,700
That's not true.

427
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,220
Yinhong.

428
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,020
Why did you tell him everything?

429
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,600
It's not a big deal.

430
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,750
It looks good on you.

431
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,380
You bought out half the shops on the street.

432
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,590
Where are we going next?

433
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,100
Stop complaining.

434
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,660
I'll celebrate

435
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,300
your birthdays too.

436
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,060
Munan.

437
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,740
Send my friends home.

438
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,060
I…

439
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,780
I didn't know we were still friends to him.

440
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,580
Let's go.

441
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,380
Yinhong.

442
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,860
Yuru.

443
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,420
What else do you want to do?

444
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,500
I've had a wish for years,

445
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,830
but it was never fulfilled.

446
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,610
What's it?

447
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,340
I want to learn to ride a horse.

448
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,220
When I was young,

449
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,820
I envied boys who could ride.

450
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,020
That's easy.

451
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,300
Come up.

452
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,120
What are you doing?

453
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,020
I'll take you to ride.

454
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,620
Come on up.

455
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,020
Let's go riding.

456
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,980
Tighten your legs.

457
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,540
Lean forward.

458
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,650
No, no, no.

459
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,060
It's so wobbly.

460
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
I'm scared.

461
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,140
Let me tell you something.

462
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,060
It'll become steady

463
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,190
when the horse runs.

464
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,420
Should I make the horse run?

465
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,820
No, no, no.

466
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,940
I-I want to come down.

467
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,530
You asked to learn to ride.

468
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,340
I don't want to learn it now.

469
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,660
Help me dismount.

470
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,300
Try again.

471
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,060
Now, get me down.

472
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,020
Okay.

473
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,660
You…

474
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,550
Hold the horse steady before getting me down.

475
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,540
I didn't expect to see Boss Liu

476
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,740
so scared by riding.

477
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,820
You'll be laughed at if word gets out.

478
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,080
No one will laugh at me.

479
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,780
Only you saw it.

480
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,140
Actually, you're almost there.

481
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,900
You just need more practice.

482
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,540
We'll see. It's too scary.

483
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,140
You promised

484
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,580
to ride and sing with me.

485
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,220
You can't go back on your word.

486
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,280
I will keep my word.

487
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,870
I'm just taking a break.

488
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,800
I'll definitely master it in the future.

489
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,940
Unfortunately, your birthday is only one day.

490
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,220
It's too short.

491
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,060
There are lots of interesting things

492
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,390
I haven't shown you yet.

493
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,420
Then let's save them

494
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,100
for my next birthday,

495
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,060
shall we?

496
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,220
Why next birthday?

497
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,870
I'll show you tomorrow.

498
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,860
No.

499
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,940
I want to

500
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,670
save them for my next birthday.

501
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,860
Gu Jiusi.

502
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
Will we

503
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,730
celebrate my next birthday too?

504
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,060
Are you a fool?

505
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,260
Your every birthday

506
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,700
will be celebrated.

507
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,970
What's wrong?

508
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,360
Why are you crying?

509
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,700
No one

510
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,390
celebrated my birthday like this before.

511
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,100
But you said

512
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,980
your mother arranged everything for you every year

513
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,540
and you had lots of fun.

514
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,500
I lied.

515
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,340
When I was still a maiden,

516
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,060
only my mother

517
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,460
remembered my birthday.

518
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,900
Every year, she made a bowl of noodles

519
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,780
with an egg for me.

520
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,620
That was all I got for my birthday.

521
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,780
I was fine with that,

522
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,180
but you made me so happy this year.

523
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,500
I'm afraid

524
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,540
I won't settle for just a bowl of noodles in the future.

525
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,380
Don't think too much.

526
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,780
In the future,

527
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,930
we'll celebrate your every birthday.

528
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,340
I'll take care of everything

529
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,940
and make you happier every year.

530
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,110
We'll celebrate it in different ways.

531
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,060
I give you my word.

I can afford fireworks too.

Our fireworks are better.

Get it loaded

573
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,060
and take it with us.

574
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,140
Yes.

575
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,220
Also,

576
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,420
bring enough Yangzhou's soil with us.

577
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,180
I'm afraid these plants won't survive

578
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,020
after we arrive in Youzhou.

579
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,780
Yes.

580
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,500
My lord.

581
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,540
Let's go to bed now.

582
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,660
Arrange these things tomorrow.

583
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,120
We've gotten enough time.

584
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,510
We're leaving soon.

585
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,340
I feel uneasy.

586
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,500
We've been very careful

587
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,780
in the past few months.

588
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,550
Yuru is meticulous.

589
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,980
From applying for the pass, loading the boat, to sending scouts out,

590
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,020
she arranged different people

591
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,340
for different tasks.

592
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,380
No one knows about our plan.

593
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,150
Hasn't that brat come back?

594
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,540
It's so late now.

595
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,230
Yuru is with him. Nothing will happen.

596
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,140
We'll spend lots of time on the ship.

597
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,060
Traveling by ship is tiring.

598
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,660
Let's go to bed now.

599
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,100
Master, Madam.

600
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,020
Bad news.

601
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,420
Wang Rong is coming this way

602
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,570
with troops.

603
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,800
So the Wang family has heard about it.

604
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,960
They won't go easy on us this time.

605
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,220
We have to leave tonight.

606
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,300
I'll stall them.

607
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,540
You'll take the others

608
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,340
to the dock through the secret tunnel.

609
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,300
If I don't meet you

610
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,340
in two hours, you'll sail.

611
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,120
We can't leave you behind.

612
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,930
You'll head out of Huainan

613
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,460
and wait for me at Moon Dock.

614
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,300
Don't worry.

615
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,080
I'll go meet you there by road.

616
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,860
You…

617
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,620
Trust me.

618
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:26,570
[Gu Mansion]

619
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,320
Know the score here

620
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,750
and get out of my way.

621
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,500
Otherwise, I won't ask so nicely again.

622
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,260
Mr. Wang.

623
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,500
What a surprise.

624
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,620
Gu Langhua,

625
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,740
plead guilty now!

626
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,110
In years of doing business,

627
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,060
the Gu family has always abided by the law

628
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,260
and never evaded our taxes.

629
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,480
What am I guilty of?

630
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,220
Stop playing dumb.

631
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,780
Lord Liang colluded with Jiang He

632
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,580
to plot a mutiny!

633
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,460
The Gu family

634
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,700
delivered military supplies for them secretly,

635
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,300
which made you traitors too!

636
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,780
Treason

637
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,280
is a very serious offense.

638
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,380
Do you have evidence?

639
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,820
Evidence?

640
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,220
I'll find some

641
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,420
after searching your house.

642
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,700
I dare you!

643
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,740
Gu Langhua!

644
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,450
I was ordered by the commissioner

645
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,780
to search for evidence.

646
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,840
You wouldn't let me

647
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,460
because you feel guilty!

648
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,550
Do I look guilty?

649
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,620
Mr. Wang.

650
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,550
The unspoken ambition

651
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,780
of the Wang family

652
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,750
is no longer a secret.

653
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,940
In Yangzhou,

654
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,220
you amassed ill-gotten gains and imposed unjust taxes.

655
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,380
You covet our wealth

656
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,340
and use the demotion of my brother-in-law

657
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,940
as an excuse to rob us

658
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,270
in the name of the court!

659
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,210
How dare you!

660
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,700
Mr. Wang,

661
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,300
there's no need to posture and yell.

662
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,700
You're too young

663
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,570
to accuse anyone

664
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,580
of treason.

665
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,580
Get your father here.

666
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,940
I'll wait for him here.

667
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,820
I won't budge an inch.

668
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,580
Madam.

669
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,730
The carriages are ready.

670
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,580
Good. Go tell all the managers

671
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,650
to hurry to the dock

672
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,580
with their families.

673
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,240
Find Ship Xuan 3 of the Cao Sect

674
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,100
and tell the crew they're there to ship Mr. Jiang's jewelry.

675
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
They'll let them on board.

676
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,830
Understood.

677
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,470
Let's go.

678
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,260
Send a carriage to the Liu family

679
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,620
to pick up Yuru's mother.

680
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,100
Hurry.

681
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,520
The rest of you, follow me.

682
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,340
[Liu Mansion]

683
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,300
Don't let anyone escape.

684
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,660
Don't be afraid.

685
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,120
Search!

686
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,060
Officer! Officer!

687
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,340
Officer!

688
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,460
Officer.

689
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,100
Go. Go. Go.

690
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,540
Go.

691
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,460
Eldest Madam.

692
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,260
Eldest Madam.

693
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,220
You have a way out, don't you?

694
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,540
Eldest Madam.

695
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,890
I beg you.

696
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,300
Please help us.

697
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,300
I know

698
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,060
I was very mean to you.

699
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,860
But now,

700
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,210
for the sake of the children,

701
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,180
I beg you

702
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,240
to take us with you.

703
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,580
Eldest Mother, please help us.

704
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,380
Please.

705
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,340
Eldest Madam.

706
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,340
-Please.
-Please, Eldest Mother.

707
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:06,980
Okay.

708
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,260
Let's leave together.

709
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,020
Thank you, Eldest Madam.

710
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,200
After them!

711
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,220
Hurry up!

712
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,140
Move, move, move!

713
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,820
Yun, leave with us.

714
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,180
Yun, leave with us.

715
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,340
Come on!

716
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,540
Yun, leave with us!

717
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,100
Yun, leave with us!

718
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,060
Yun.

719
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,380
Go, go.

720
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,940
Yun, leave with us!

721
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,020
Eldest Madam, go!

722
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,130
Go!

723
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,740
Yun! Yun!

724
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,980
Let's go. Hurry.

725
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,300
Is everyone here?

726
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,410
Yes.

727
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,180
Everyone, come with me!

728
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,220
Yes.

729
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,250
Grandmother!

730
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,790
Grandmother, what's going on?

731
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,460
Has something bad

732
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,500
happened to us?

733
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,170
Go back now.

734
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,650
No matter what happens,

735
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,910
don't leave your room!

736
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,020
As long as I'm still part of the Ye family,

737
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,219
nothing will happen!

738
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:13,550
Let's go!

739
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,699
Grandmother.

740
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,020
All right. My birthday is over now.

741
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,150
Let's go check the ranking.

742
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:29,810
Fine.

743
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,030
I can't escape this moment any longer.

744
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:32,780
Let's go.

745
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,580
Jiusi.

746
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,909
-Jiusi.
-Jiusi.

747
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,540
Jiusi.

748
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,659
Mrs. Gu.

749
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,300
We need to borrow Jiusi for a sec.

750
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:41,940
Come.

751
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,540
Just a sec.

752
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,300
What's wrong with you guys?

753
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,650
Your house is surrounded

754
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,710
by Wang Rong's men.

755
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,820
What a scumbag!

756
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,780
I have to go back now.

757
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,260
Chen Xun.

758
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,860
Stay here with Yuru.

759
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,870
Don't let her get suspicious.

760
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:01,820
If I

761
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,420
don't come back in two hours,

762
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,620
take her

763
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,980
to hide in your place.

764
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,020
Wenchang,

765
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,100
go home now

766
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,860
and leave Yangzhou with your family.

767
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,090
The sooner the better.

768
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,180
Is it that serious?

769
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,350
There'll be chaos in Yangzhou.

770
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,420
After Wang Shanquan deals with the Gu family,

771
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,300
other aristocrats and rich merchants

772
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,380
will be next.

773
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,220
As my close friends,

774
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,460
you two will definitely be watched.

775
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,120
Chen Xun's father is a scholar

776
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,020
and you live outside Yangzhou.

777
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,280
You may be safe for now.

778
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,230
But your family does business too.

779
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,780
They won't let you go.

780
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,620
Do as I say.

781
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,180
No matter how powerful

782
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,340
Wang Shanquan is,

783
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,980
he has to abide by the law.

784
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,580
If Darong is thrown into chaos,

785
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,940
there will be no law.

786
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,540
Do you mean…

787
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,490
Enough. We have no time for this.

788
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,300
When the dust settles,

789
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,020
we'll drink together again.

790
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,180
Deal.

791
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,540
You owe us

792
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,900
a dinner at Cuiming Restaurant.

793
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,660
Sure.

794
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,470
You can drink as much Jolly Spring as you want.

795
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,140
Yang Wenchang got into trouble again.

796
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,380
I need to help him settle it.

797
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,900
Chen Xun will stay here with you.

798
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,820
After I come back,

799
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,750
we'll check the ranking together.

800
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:18,850
Wenchang.

801
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,700
Chen Xun.

802
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,940
What did Wenchang do?

803
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,710
Why are they in such a hurry?

804
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,940
Yang Wenchang…

805
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,660
Boss Liu.

806
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,920
My master wants to see you.

807
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,300
Mrs. Gu.

808
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,420
Who is he?

809
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,460
I made business with his master.

810
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,540
Please tell Mr. Luo

811
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,960
that I'm busy today

812
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,700
and we shall talk business

813
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,620
another day.

814
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,070
You may read the letter first.

815
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,700
Chen Xun.

816
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,700
Something urgent happened

817
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,060
in business.

818
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,900
When Jiusi comes back,

819
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,140
tell him

820
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,660
not to worry about me.

821
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
I'll be back soon.

822
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,380
Mrs. Gu.

823
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,580
It's so late now.

824
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,640
You can't go alone.

825
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,590
I'll go with you.

826
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,260
No need.

827
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,440
Some business secrets

828
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,390
may be involved.

829
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,980
You'd better not come.

830
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,140
I often

831
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,620
go out alone for business.

832
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,580
Jiusi knows it.

833
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,420
Don't worry.

834
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,900
Let's go.

835
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,260
Mrs. Gu.

836
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,820
Mrs. Gu.

837
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,300
Stay safe.

838
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,380
Before tonight,

839
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,290
375 ships have left Yangzhou

840
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,340
from Changfeng Dock.

841
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,820
The whole Gu family

842
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,940
is relocating

843
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,900
but no one knows about it.

844
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,060
You did a great job, Boss Liu.

845
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,100
But now that I found out about it,

846
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,660
I can't let you go

847
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,730
without saying goodbye.

848
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,300
How did he know?

849
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,460
He even knows

850
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,080
how many ships we used.

851
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,420
Has he

852
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,780
been watching the Gu family?

853
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,830
What's his purpose?

854
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,060
Is he going to

855
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,180
ask for hush money?

856
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,900
Boss Liu.

857
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,070
We'll reach the shore soon.

858
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,340
Master.

859
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,140
Yes.

860
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,060
Boss Liu.

861
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,420
Please.

862
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,110
The fireworks in Yangzhou

863
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,100
are my birthday gift for you.

864
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,700
It's so kind of you, Mr. Luo.

865
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,340
It's too generous a gift.

866
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,580
I can't accept it.

867
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:44,860
Mr. Luo,

868
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,230
just tell me what you want.

869
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,860
I just landed a deal

870
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,430
and feel very happy,

871
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,750
so I invited you here for a talk.

872
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,820
I'll leave Yangzhou

873
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,760
for another deal soon.

874
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,940
Have a nice trip, Mr. Luo.

875
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,940
You're a mysterious man,

876
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,380
but I never probe into things

877
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,980
that are not my business.

878
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,140
I hope you can do the same.

879
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,180
Stay out of the matters

880
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,580
that have nothing to do with you.

881
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,310
Life is unpredictable.

882
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,260
We may need each other's help in the future.

883
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:21,900
Boss Liu,

884
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,700
would you leave Yangzhou

885
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,780
with me?

886
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,670
You're talented and resourceful.

887
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,460
Staying with Gu Jiusi

888
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,100
is a waste of your acumen.

889
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,660
It's a great pity.

890
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,300
Mr. Luo,

891
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,700
I respect you.

892
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,590
Please deserve my respect.

893
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,660
I respect you too

894
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,700
and never take you

895
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,700
as a woman

896
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,460
who only knows about housework.

897
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,900
I asked you to leave with me

898
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,700
because I cherish your talents.

899
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,300
So don't get me wrong.

900
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,700
If you work with me,

901
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,510
sooner or later,

902
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,630
you'll become a great success.

903
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:04,940
Mr. Luo,

904
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,500
I run the Gu Business

905
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,570
as the Young Madam of the Gu family

906
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,700
and Gu Jiusi's wife.

907
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,980
I don't know you personally.

908
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,540
I'll forget what you said tonight.

909
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,900
Yangzhou is in chaos now.

910
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,620
Don't be afraid.

911
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,380
Leave with me.

912
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,580
You're just

913
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,740
an innocent person dragged down by the Gu family.

914
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,940
You don't deserve

915
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,790
to die like this.

916
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,400
I've told you this before.

917
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,380
I'll never betray the Gu family,

918
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,170
let alone Gu Jiusi!

919
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,340
But after tonight,

920
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,340
Gu Jiusi

921
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,200
will no longer live in this world!

922
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,940
Young Madam.

923
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:09,380
Young Madam.

924
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,240
Where is Jiusi?

925
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,740
Young Master asked you to go to the dock.

926
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,500
Quick!

927
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,150
Has Jiusi gotten on board?

928
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,660
Let's go.

929
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,280
[Guazhou Dock]

930
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,100
Madam.

931
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,740
Coming.

932
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,180
Madam.

933
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,690
The soldiers are headed to Changfeng Dock.

934
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,820
Guazhou Dock was poorly guarded.

935
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,820
All the guards have been taken down.

936
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,740
Good.

937
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,340
You may leave.

938
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,020
Yes.

939
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,300
We usually

940
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,160
exchange goods at Changfeng Dock

941
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,520
but are now leaving

942
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,980
from Guazhou Dock.

943
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,100
You're so clever, Madam.

944
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,620
Yeah.

945
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,320
This is the last smoke screen.

946
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,940
It's Yuru's idea.

947
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,740
Young Madam.

948
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,620
Madam, Young Madam is here.

949
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,340
Young Madam.

950
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,180
Mother! Mother!

951
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,780
Yuru.

952
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,220
-Young Madam.
-Young Madam.

953
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,740
Mother.

954
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,860
Are you okay?

955
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,130
I'm fine.

956
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,980
