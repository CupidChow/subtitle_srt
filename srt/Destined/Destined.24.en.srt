567
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,880
Understand?

568
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,350
Yes.

569
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,210
Guards!

570
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,200
Sir.

571
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,380
Send a letter now.

572
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,800
Invite Young Master Luo

573
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,990
back to Yangzhou.

574
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,290
Go.

575
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,550
Yes.

576
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,860
What are you waiting for?

577
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,110
Yes.

578
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Idiot.

579
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,310
Young Master Ye.

580
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,410
Good job, Young Master Ye.

581
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,600
This time, we worked in collusion, one from without and the other from within.

582
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,490
Not only did we lower the price of grains

583
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,330
in Yangzhou,

584
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,300
but we also caused Wang Shanquan's Shan's Bank

585
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,560
to suffer a great loss.

586
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,440
Shan's Bank

587
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,370
couldn’t stand the withdrawal of the crowds.

588
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,830
It's already closed down.

589
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,620
Come with us.

590
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,560
Otherwise Wang Shanquan

591
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
will make things difficult for you.

592
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,940
But Yun'er

593
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,050
is still in Wang Shanquan's hands.

594
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,970
Back then,

595
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,030
to protect my life,

596
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,920
she had no choice

597
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,280
but to marry Wang Shanquan.

598
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,510
And I also wanted to protect her.

599
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,190
That's why I work for Wang Shanquan.

600
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,740
Now both of us

601
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,750
can't go anywhere else.

602
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,250
I read everything

603
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,860
in the letter you wrote to me.

604
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,320
Wang Shanquan, that bastard.

605
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,040
Young Master Ye,

606
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,210
Let's find a way

607
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,130
to save Yun'er

608
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,130
and leave Yangzhou together.

609
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,050
Let's not talk about this first.

610
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,740
Look who's here.

611
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:38,930
Mother.

612
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:41,780
Mother!

613
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,340
Mother!

614
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,040
Mother!

615
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,760
Mother!

616
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,580
Mother!

617
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,610
Mother!

618
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,210
Yuru.

619
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,390
Mother.

620
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:04,300
I thought I would never see you again.

621
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,680
Mother.

622
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,100
I thought

623
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,080
I would never see you again.

624
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,320
Mother.

625
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,510
Mother!

626
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,200
Mother.

627
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,800
After I fell off the cliff,

628
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,610
I was dying.

629
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,760
Luckily, Young Master Ye saved my life.

630
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,200
So I can see you now.

631
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,790
Young Master Ye.

632
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,850
I will never

633
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,440
forget

634
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,610
your great kindness.

635
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,520
You don't have to do that.

636
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,320
Please get up.

637
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,970
[Wang Mansion]

638
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,360
I have no appetite.

639
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,980
Just take them away.

640
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,250
Madam Yun.

641
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,070
Take them away.

642
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,580
Do you really think

643
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,470
you are still an innocent girl?

644
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,130
Why are you doing this?

645
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,670
A woman's fate is always harder than a man's.

646
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,630
Whether it's a noble lady

647
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,170
or a prostitute,

648
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,860
they're the same in troubled times.

649
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,420
Young Miss Ye.

650
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,410
Nowadays, in this world,

651
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,750
you're considered to be living a good life

652
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,920
with the current situation,

653
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,780
being well-fed

654
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,860
and safe and sound.

655
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,250
Why do you still put on airs

656
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,250
like a daughter from a noble family?

657
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,830
Given your statement,

658
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,970
am I supposed to

659
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,900
express gratitude with a smile to the one

660
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,430
who killed my whole family?

661
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,150
In this world,

662
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,620
we don't only live

663
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,240
for the basic necessities.

664
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,480
Lady Xifeng.

665
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,360
You haven't seen my grandmother,

666
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,110
Yuru,

667
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,460
and those women

668
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,190
who are of indomitable spirit in troubled times.

669
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,880
People like you

670
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,860
are so grateful

671
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,440
to be treated as a pet by men.

672
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,030
I can't do it.

673
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,720
I'm disgusted.

674
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,550
You don't have to

675
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,350
keep a close watch on me for them.

676
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,830
Anyway,

677
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,220
I'm already in Wang Shanquan's hands.

678
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,400
This is already

679
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,990
my entire life.

680
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,010
Your entire life?

681
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,410
Young Miss Ye.

682
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,460
How old are you?

683
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,730
Yet you're already talking about the entire life.

684
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,610
He owes me

685
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,190
the Ye family's blood debt.

686
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,470
You want me to

687
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,210
treat him willingly with a smile.

688
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,460
That's impossible.

689
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,270
You're from a good family.

690
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,250
You don't understand men's dirty thoughts.

691
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,060
Let me teach you how to be adorable.

692
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,650
Men always

693
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,380
love the new and loathe the old.

694
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,630
You've only been here for a year.

695
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,110
Wang Shanquan has doted on you for a year.

696
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,000
It's almost the end.

697
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,130
Have you seen him once

698
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,610
in the past two days?

699
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,060
If he never comes to disgust me again,

700
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,940
it'll be my wishes coming true.

701
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,370
You don't care about yourself.

702
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,780
What about Ye Shi'an?

703
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,430
What do you mean?

704
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,820
Young Miss Ye,

705
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,660
do you really think

706
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,970
you saved

707
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,980
Ye Shi'an's life

708
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,810
by marrying Wang Shanquan?

709
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,790
After the chaos in Yangzhou,

710
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,220
Wang Shanquan was in a hurry to recruit talented people.

711
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,450
He was also in a hurry

712
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,100
to crack the whip on those

713
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,010
noble families who have some influence

714
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,440
but are not worth

715
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,240
to fight with.

716
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,090
He wanted the Yangzhou people to know that

717
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,220
if they work for him,

718
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,990
they can not only save their lives,

719
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,650
but also have a bright future.

720
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,610
Ye Shi'an

721
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,850
was the most suitable candidate.

722
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,500
Now that Yangzhou has become peaceful,

723
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,700
the bloody stone road

724
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,310
a year ago

725
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,220
has long been washed clean.

726
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,970
People are forgetful.

727
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,820
Young Miss Ye,

728
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,960
you're already useless to Ye Shi'an.

729
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,020
Your sacrifice and persistence

730
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,070
are nothing.

731
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,000
You don't want to see me?

732
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,720
It's okay.

733
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,560
In a few days,

734
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,200
you will never

735
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,130
see me again.

736
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,940
If you think

737
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,620
you can scare me

738
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,420
with these unreasonable words,

739
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,940
you're wrong.

740
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,330
One more thing.

741
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,190
Shan's Bank

742
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,620
of Wang Shanquan

743
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,790
which is managed by Ye Shi'an

744
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,990
has been closed down.

745
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,030
Wang Shanquan

746
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,090
values money the most.

747
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,400
If anyone causes him to lose money,

748
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,570
he will kill the one.

749
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,210
Young Miss Ye,

750
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,390
you're smart.

751
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,530
You know clearly

752
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,970
whether I'm scaring you or not.

753
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:14,730
Now,

754
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,540
you have only two options.

755
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,010
Either

756
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,050
kill yourself as soon as possible

757
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,970
and cut off the ties with Ye Shi'an

758
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,170
so that he can escape.

759
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,180
Or if you want to live,

760
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,850
you should give in to Wang Shanquan

761
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,660
and learn how to please him from other concubines.

762
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,300
Before he's fed up with you,

763
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,910
keep his affection

764
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,280
in your hands

765
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,880
as your amulet.

766
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,850
But if he dies,

767
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,090
everything will be gone.

768
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,240
The debt will be gone.

769
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,430
The same goes for your hatred.

770
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,470
You have to think carefully about

771
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,270
which to choose.

772
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,690
Yun'er.

773
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,490
Look.

774
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,900
These silver hairpins are a pair.

775
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,150
One for each of us.

776
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,050
Let me put it on you.

777
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,230
So pretty.

778
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,370
It's too plain.

779
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,520
Why do I need so many pearls?

780
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,810
It'll be very heavy.

781
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,370
I like elegant things.

782
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,070
The hairpin given by others

783
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,770
is not as beautiful

784
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,190
as the gift from you.

785
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,590
That's because Yun'er is beautiful.

786
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,470
Once you are 15 years old,

787
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,730
you'll be a young lady.

788
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,280
I wonder

789
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,710
who is so lucky

790
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,760
in Yangzhou City

791
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,020
to be Yun'er's

792
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,740
husband.

793
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,090
The young talents in Yangzhou City

794
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,810
are not in the same league as my brother.

795
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,140
I don't like any of them.

796
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,750
In the future,

797
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,820
I would like to marry someone in Eastern Capital.

798
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,590
Someone in Eastern Capital?

799
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,350
You told me

800
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,650
you want to be my family

801
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,050
for the rest of your life.

802
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,010
If you really get married in Eastern Capital,

803
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:36,600
we can't

804
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,160
play together anymore.

805
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,650
Then I'll never get married.

806
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,330
How can a girl

807
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,550
never get married?

808
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,230
I won't.

809
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,000
After getting married, I have to serve my parents-in-law

810
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,430
and take care of my husband and son.

811
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,350
I don't want to.

812
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,950
I can't bear to leave Grandmother.

813
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,510
I can't bear to leave my parents.

814
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,310
I can't bear to leave my brother.

815
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,000
I can't bear to leave you too.

816
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:00,960
I want to be

817
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,350
the most beloved girl in my family forever.

818
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,450
Silly girl.

819
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,670
This hairpin is so beautiful.

820
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,860
I can't take those hatreds on the chin.

821
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,300
I can't rely on

822
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,240
flattering my enemies.

823
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,380
Yuru.

824
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,270
My brother told me

825
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,030
that you're alive.

826
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,340
He said you came to Yangzhou.

827
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,220
You have no idea

828
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,370
how glad I am.

829
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,230
I really want to see you again.

830
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,410
But...

831
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,640
Let's meet in the next life.

832
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,610
Madam Yun,

833
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,220
your brother sent you some chestnut cakes.

834
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,530
Chestnut cakes?

835
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,380
Yes.

836
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,920
Put them there.

837
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,240
Sir,

838
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,040
the merchants we brought back

839
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,050
have been interrogated.

840
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,310
Shen is not among them.

841
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,440
Our informant from Cangzhou

842
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,080
reported that

843
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,460
he has never heard of

844
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,480
Shen Bancheng.

845
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,220
The person may have even faked his name.

846
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,100
What about the grains?

847
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,530
The grains

848
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,640
have been taken away a few days ago.

849
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,290
Has Luo Zishang come back yet?

850
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,850
Young Master Luo has departed.

851
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,580
He'll arrive in Yangzhou soon.

852
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,140
Sir,

853
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,610
Madam Yun invites you

854
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,270
to Chunqin Pavilion tonight.

855
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:06,950
Reject her.

856
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:08,719
Sir.

857
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,150
Madam Yun

858
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,670
has been dressing carefully since just now.

859
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,380
She asked me desperately

860
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,560
to invite you over.

861
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,610
She always ignores me at the usual time.

862
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,800
When I almost get tired of her,

863
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,659
she's suddenly become so initiative today?

864
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:24,889
Fine.

865
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,610
Tell her

866
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,790
I'll check it out tonight.

867
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:29,850
Yes.

868
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,800
Master, you're back.

869
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,639
Find some high-skilled spies who know how to kill people.

870
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,489
While the soldiers of the government

871
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,380
are arresting the grain merchants tonight,

872
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,780
ask them to follow me out.

873
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:51,600
Yes.

874
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,679
Fortunately, your eyes

875
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,400
remember everything you saw at a glance.

876
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,700
You only met once.

877
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,620
But you recognized her.

878
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,360
Master treated her differently.

879
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,160
I would surely

880
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,620
pay more attention to her.

881
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,110
That's why I remembered.

882
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,840
I’ve arranged Yinhong

883
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,630
and my mother

884
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,680
for loading all the grains

885
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,410
onto the boat and transporting them away.

886
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,040
Shen Ming.

887
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,840
I'll leave Yun'er to you.

888
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,760
Don't worry, Sister.

889
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,250
Does Yun'er know

890
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,740
I will save her tonight?

891
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,140
She will know.

892
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,820
I hid a letter

893
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,250
in the chestnut cakes.

894
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,640
My sister can't breathe

895
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,110
when she eats chestnut cakes since young.

896
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,320
Since I gave her chestnut cakes,

897
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,840
she must have found out there's something fishy.

898
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,680
She should have read

899
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,560
the letter.

900
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,590
That's good.

901
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,440
Shen Ming, take this.

902
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,630
When Yun'er sees this hairpin,

903
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,180
she'll know you are one of us.

904
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,780
Remember,

905
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,330
bring her out safely.

906
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,660
The two of us

907
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,310
will wait for you at Changfeng Dock

908
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,650
to leave Yangzhou together.

909
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,200
Okay.

910
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,130
Shen,

911
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,540
it’s heavily guarded there.

912
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,720
Are you sure you can do it alone?

913
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:04,910
Don't worry.

914
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,780
It's dark and windy. I'm good at

915
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,000
climbing over the high walls

916
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,460
and taking somebody away.

917
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,310
Please.

918
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,560
No worries.

919
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm leaving then, Sister.

920
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,750
Be careful.

921
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,720
Okay.

922
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:19,760
By the way,

923
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,690
what is

924
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,350
Shen's previous occupation?

925
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,760
A bandit.

926
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,150
Yun'er, what do you mean?

927
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,910
You treated me nicely

928
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,250
all these days.

929
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,560
I was so immature

930
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,710
that I didn't cherish

931
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,880
your kindness.

932
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,160
I know I was wrong.

933
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,900
I've thought it through.

934
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,130
That's good.

935
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,310
What's your plan today?

936
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,230
Sir,

937
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,540
today,

938
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,740
let's drink the wedding wine together.

939
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,990
And let bygones

940
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,300
be bygones.

941
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,660
Does it sound good?

942
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,910
Sure.

943
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,630
Very good.

944
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:53,960
Sir.

945
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,010
Just drink like this?

946
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,080
It's too boring.

947
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,030
I have an interesting idea.

948
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,370
What is it?

949
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,700
Cover your eyes

950
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,260
and feed you.

951
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:18,620
Here.

952
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,280
Are you done?

953
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,560
Guards!

954
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,070
Guards!

955
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,710
Help!

956
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,770
Guards!

957
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,000
Get up.

958
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,080
Get up!

959
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,410
He's dead.

960
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,240
Arrest me.

961
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,600
Only if he dies,

962
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,710
can my brother

963
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,030
and Yuru

964
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,270
can escape safely.

965
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,240
Hurry up.

966
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,920
The one guarding the corner in the southwest

967
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,600
is the brother

968
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,560
of my sister.

969
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,460
His sister's indebted to me.

970
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,590
Show him this,

971
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,880
then you can escape.

972
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:16,760
Why?

973
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,820
Why do you want to let me go?

974
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,930
Live a good life.

975
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:22,980
Show me.

976
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,000
How long a weak woman

977
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,050
in this chaotic world

978
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,020
can live

979
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,580
with an indomitable spirit.

980
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,120
What are you waiting for?

981
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,040
Go!

982
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,590
When I was in such a situation,

983
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,610
I also hoped that

984
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,820
there would be a third way for me.

985
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,100
Help!

986
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,530
The commissioner was assassinated.

987
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,130
Your team.

988
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,040
Search over there.

989
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,630
The rest,

990
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,360
come with me.

991
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,050
Yes.

992
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,190
Help!

993
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,250
The commissioner was assassinated.

994
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,320
Stop!

995
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,700
Are you Ye Yun?

996
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,010
I'm not.

997
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,470
I'm really not.

998
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,390
Don't be afraid.

999
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,410
I'm here to save you.

1000
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,770
Let me put it on you.

1001
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,300
You work for Yuru?

1002
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:08,770
Yes.

1003
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,920
What's wrong?

1004
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,060
Are you hurt?

1005
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,490
This is not my blood.

1006
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,480
It's Wang Shanquan's blood.

1007
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,250
I killed him.
