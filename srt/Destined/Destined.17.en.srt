00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,140
It's almost impossible

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,820
to do business now.

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,520
In the eyes of the government,

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,630
we merchants are the most useless.

10
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,930
People like us

11
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,610
don't make money

12
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,540
by farming land.

13
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,950
It's acceptable in times of peace,

14
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,750
but the country is in chaos now.

15
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,100
In the eyes of the locals of Youzhou,

16
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,060
we're just

17
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,180
a bunch of freeloaders

18
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,060
who make no contributions

19
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,120
to producing food.

20
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,300
You're right.

23
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,290
figure out a better solution.

24

Yuru,

25
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,100
you're now far more

26
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,060

27
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,060
Not at all, Mother.

28
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,420
I just got nothing to do at home

29
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,950
and did some thinking.

30
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,820
The current situation

31
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,860
is worse

32
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,140
than we expected.

33
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,060

Here, this is the last one.

36
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,180
Thank you.

00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,540
Sir,

38
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,180
if you want to do something like this again,

39
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,110
please cut me in.

40
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,780
You asked so many questions today

41
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,570
because you want to make your mark in Wangdu, right?

42
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,340
I grew up

43
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,860
begging on the streets of Wangdu.

44
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,920
I know everyone and everything here.

45
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,180
You'll need eyes out there

46
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,980
and someone to run your errands.

47
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,900
You're quite smart.

48
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,620
Here, the deposit.

Thank you, sir.

Young Master,

51
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,980
we spent the whole day

52
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,220
listening to those poor people chatting.

53
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,579
Would that do us any good?

54
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,060
Of course it would.

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,780
But all I heard

56
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,510
was gibberish and complaints.

57
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,940
But did you hear any complaints

58
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,140
against the commissioner of Youzhou

59
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,620
and the government?

60
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,820
No.

61
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,020
They just mentioned

62
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,780
that they were righteous and honest.

63
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,579
That's it.

64
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,940
The dignitaries can't tell us

65
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,260
how the government rules.

66
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,390
No one knows that better than the poor.

67
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,100
Youzhou is under clean governance

68
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,340
and the people here are kind and genuine.

69
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,180
It's way better than Yangzhou

70
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,380
which appears prosperous but is rotten inside.

71
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:06,910

Where did you go today?

74
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,019
I just hung out on the street.

75
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,380
You look upset.

76
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,700
Did you get in trouble with the government?

77
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,100
Not really.

78
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,580
When we were in Yangzhou,

79
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,310
I always knew how to take the next step.

80
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,740
But here in Youzhou,

81
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,960
every step leads to a dilemma.

82
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,980
I can't even see

83
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,930
the road ahead.

84
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,610
I don't know

85
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,060
where the ship of the Gu Business

86
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,659
will sail.

87
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,260
Mother.

88
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,380
I'm fine.

89
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,940
I just got emotional.

90
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,500
Youzhou and Yangzhou

91
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,620
are completely different places.

92
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,900
I don't know much

93
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,940
about business,

94
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,180
but I know that old ways

95
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,460
won't work in new environments.

96
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,920
Don't worry. Take it easy.

97
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,220
My son has grown into a man.

98
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,700
I wonder how your uncle is doing.

99
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,380
Uncle and Lord Liang are close.

100
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,720
In the current situation,

101
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,020
no news

102
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,580
is the best news.

103
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,420
Mother.

104
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,470
Since Father won't be back,

105
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,260
it's time for us

106
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,070
to make a cenotaph for him.

107
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,950
How can you be sure that he won't come back?

108
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,260
You just said that he disappeared in the fire.

109
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,620
Did you see him die

110
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,820
or spot his dead body

111
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,100
with your own eyes?

112
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,180
If you didn't,

113
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,020
he must still be alive.

114
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,420
Anyway,

115
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,980
unless I see

116
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,380
his body with my own eyes,

117
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,840
I won't believe he's dead.

118
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,659
Mother.

119
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,340
Enough.

120
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,620
Never

121
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,390
mention this matter again.

122
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,159
In the past few months,

123
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,260
people kept saying

124
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,260
that there were wars everywhere

125
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,860
and you two were completely out of touch

126
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,120
because you were dead.

127
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,730
I never believed them.

128
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,620
I was sure

129
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,580
that you'd come back.

130
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,180
Look.

131
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,460
You two

132
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,100
came back to me

133
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,300
safe and sound.

134
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,410
Langhua will surely be back too.

135
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,850
As long as there's hope,

136
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
I'll wait for him.

137
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,340
But if he never...

138
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,230
If he still hasn't come back

139
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,070
by the time I die,

140
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,430
you'll bury his clothes

141
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,380
with me.

142
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,700
By the way,

143
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,300
I've been thinking about one thing for days

144
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,350
and have made up my mind.

145
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,000
There's no time like the present.

146
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,580
So I'll tell you about it now.

147
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,940
Yuru,

148
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,580
you'll be in charge of this family from now on.

149
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,780
You'll decide everything

150
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
about the Gu Business in the future.

151
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,380
Tomorrow morning,

152
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,220
I'll tell my decision

153
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,780
to every manager

154
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,420
working for us.

155
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,820
No, Mother.

156
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,260
I can't do it without your guidance.

157
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,460
Yuru,

158
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,260
you're gifted

159
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,429
and have been learning from me for so long.

160
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,580
The conventions in Youzhou

161
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,550
and how business works here

162
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,220
are all new to me too.

163
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,750
There's nothing you can learn from me now.

164
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,140
But I'm too young.

165
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,020
When I started doing business,

166
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,220
I was about your age.

167
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,340
Being young

168
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,340
means being brave.

169
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,500
I'll count on you to make our family thrive.

170
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,300
I'm old.

171
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,860
I don't have the energy and courage for that anymore.

172
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,020
In the future,

173
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,850
I'll just take care of the plants

174
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,220
left by your father.

175
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,490
They are his treasures.

176
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,020
If I don't take good care of them,

177
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,880
when he comes back,

178
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,700
he'll hit the ceiling.

179
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,780
Yuru.

180
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,060
The weight of our family

181
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,100
is on your shoulders now.

182
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,420
Yes.

183
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,220
Mother.

184
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,460
Jiusi.

185
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,420
You need to help Yuru.

186
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,420
From now on,

187
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,280
you'll look out for each other

188
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,540
and put each other before yourselves.

189
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,260
You must do your best

190
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,940
to keep her safe.

191
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,460
Yes.

192
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,380
I've been thinking a lot lately.

193
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,620
I'm tired.

194
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,620
I'm going to rest.

195
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,140
Youzhou and Yangzhou

196
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,870
have very different climates,

197
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,970
but Mother managed

198
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,950
to keep these plants thriving.

199
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,980
It's not hard to see how much effort she put into it.

200
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,920
Mother is wiser than most people.

201
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,060
She knows everything.

202
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,890
If she needs to believe

203
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,340
that Father will come back

204
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,980
to feel better,

205
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,660
so be it.

206
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,790
We all need to believe in something

207
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,280
to go on with our lives.

208
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,970
Life is peaceful now,

209
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,020
but at night,

210
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,820
I think of my father,

211
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,340
Wenchang, my master,

212
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
and other innocent people who died.

213
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,980
It's been eating at me.

214
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,060
There's one thing

215
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,620
I don't understand.

216
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,780
If Wang Shanquan just wanted money,

217
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,700
why was he dead set

218
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,940
on killing us all?

219
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,480
Perhaps because of jealousy.

220
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,780
The Gu family was prominent.

221
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,900
Back in Yangzhou,

222
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,180
when I was still a maiden,

223
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,500
I often heard people say

224
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,900
that the Gu family ruled Yangzhou.

225
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,380
Even the commissioner

226
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,040
had to listen to the Gu family.

227
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,620
But Wang Shanquan is

228
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,890
a narrow-minded rat.

229
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,860
He's too greedy and foolish

230
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,140
to amount to much.

231
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,460
It's not very likely

232
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,940
that he set Yangzhou on fire.

233
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,220
Yangzhou is in chaos now.

234
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,270
Don't be afraid.

235
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,780
You're just

236
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,510
an innocent person dragged down by the Gu family.

237
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,260
Perhaps,

238
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,260
someone

239
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,860
plotted all this behind him.

240
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,220
It was my birthday when things went south.

241
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,180
Do you remember?

242
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,130
After celebrating my birthday,

243
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,840
you hurried back downtown

244
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,340
and asked Chen Xun to stay with me in the suburb.

245
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,970
At that time,

246
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,260
were you told

247
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,340
that Wang Shanquan surrounded our house with troops?

248
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,010
Yes.

249
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
It was dangerous,

250
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,040
so I left you in the suburb.

251
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,340
After you left,

252
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,580
Luo Zishang appeared.

253
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,180
Luo Zishang?

254
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,380
What did he want with you?

255
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,220
He said if I left with him,

256
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,940
I wouldn't have to die.

257
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,620
He also told me

258
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,280
that after that night,

259
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,740
the Gu family and Gu Jiusi

260
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,260
would no longer exist in this world.

261
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,140
By that time,

262
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,900
the mutiny hadn't happened,

263
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,000
but he seemed to know it would.

264
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,590
I investigated him once

265
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,220
but couldn't find any useful information.

266
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,100
So,

267
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,780
he plotted all this

268
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,750
behind Wang Shanquan.

269
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,460
If that were the case,

270
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,260
he'd deserve to die.

271
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
Sooner or later,

272
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,380
I'll make him pay

273
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,860
for every life he took.

274
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,190
Master, what are you thinking?

275
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,420
If she were alive,

276
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,580
she'd hate my guts

277
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,680
and see me as an implacable enemy.

278
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,140
Master, you never allowed yourself

279
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,660
to wallow in grief.

280
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,580
Why do you make an exception for her?

281
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,100
Xifeng.

282
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,680
Do you remember how we met?

283
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,820
Yes.

284
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,540
Back then,

285
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,500
I was reduced to prostitution and tried to kill myself.

286
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,580
You saved me

287
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,940
and bought my freedom

288
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,640
so that I could keep on living.

289
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,020
Never wallow in grief.

290
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,350
You mean I'm cold-blooded, don't you?

291
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,940
Yes.

292
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,490
I came back

293
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,420
from hell.

294
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,620
Of course I'm cold-blooded

295
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,860
and callous to everyone.

296
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,660
I showed you sympathy

297
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,740
back then

298
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,260
because of her.

299
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,460
If I hadn't met her,

300
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,540
I would've become

301
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,580
a downright monster.

302
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,380
If only she were not

303
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,220
Young Madam Gu.

304
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,620
Unfortunately,

305
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,900
she must have died

306
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,250
with Gu Jiusi

307
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,740
during the trudge.

308
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,320
The desert in Qingzhou stretches for 200 miles.

309
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,860
It's a barren place

310
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,880
where numerous people starved to death.

311
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,900
She looked

312
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,260
so fragile.

313
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,880
Master, I've got news.

314
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,460
Gu Jiusi is still alive?

315
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,940
Really?

316
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,540
Yes.

317
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
He and his wife

318
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,250
have arrived at Wangdu.

319
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,540
They actually

320
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,580
crossed the desert

321
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,660
and reached Youzhou on foot?

322
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,340
But it's not a big deal.

323
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,140
He's just a runaway small-timer.

324
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,220
Better off dead

325
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,670
but no threat alive.

326
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,540
My lord, don't you know

327
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,500
that the weeds not uprooted

328
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,900
will grow again?

329
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,300
Gu Jiusi

330
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,130
was a notorious toff in Yangzhou.

331
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,180
He was spoiled

332
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,700
and knew nothing but cock fights and dog races.

333
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,220
Now that his father is dead,

334
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,060
what big changes can he make?

335
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,140
I'm afraid

336
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,000
you've underestimated Gu Jiusi.

337
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,940
Mr. Luo,

338
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,910
you seem to think highly of him.

339
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,890
I just know him better

340
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,740
than most people.

341
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,339
The Gu family

342
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,829
has moved half of their property away.

343
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,020
Now in Youzhou,

344
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,660
they're still big names.

345
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
If the Gu family…

346
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,260
Mr. Luo.

347
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,100
I intended to forget this matter

348
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,100
yet you brought it up.

349
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,180
I could've had all the Gu family's fortune

350
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,680
in my pocket.

351
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,650
If you hadn't insisted on

352
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,020
killing every one of them

353
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,480
to settle a personal feud,

354
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,240
it wouldn't have taken so long

355
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,980
and the Gu family

356
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,860
wouldn't have gotten the time

357
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,260
to move half their property to Youzhou.

358
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,180
Our plan was foolproof.

359
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,620
If your son hadn't made them suspicious…

360
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,080
Don't change the subject!

361
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,340
You insisted on

362
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,780
wiping out the Gu family.

363
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,420
I've fulfilled

364
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,020
my every promise to you.

365
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,060
But I only got

366
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,760
half of what you promised.

367
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,070
So in the future,

368
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,700
I won't take your words seriously again.

369
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,580
Don't tell me what to do.

370
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,100
Mingyi.

371
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,420
Let's go.

372
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,540
Wang Shanquan

373
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,460
held you in high regard

374
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,990
when he needed your advice.

375
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,220
Now that things settled down

376
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,540
and he has Yangzhou in his control,

377
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,980
he changed his attitude immediately.

378
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,180
What an ingrate!

379
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,020
It's no surprise.

380
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,000
I chose Wang Sunquan to help me

381
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,820
not only because

382
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,620
he's greedy and profit-driven.

383
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,500
I needed someone

384
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,340
as short-sighted and foolish as him.

385
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,200
He caused a bloodbath in Yangzhou

386
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,420
and sparked outrage.

387
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,020
Once the dust settles,

388
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,300
many people

389
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,030
will come to settle the score with him.

390
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,180
If he treats me well,

391
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,620
people will know

392
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,950
that I colluded with him

393
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,300
and helped him.

394
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
By then,

395
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,860
I'll be blamed

396
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,310
for the bloodbath in Yangzhou.

397
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,300
You mean…

398
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,900
He wants to bite the hand that feeds him.

399
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,230
Then I'll help him bite off the whole hand.

400
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,140
I'll show the world

401
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,100
that Wang Shanquan

402
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,040
is mean and cruel to me as well,

403
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
and that I'm a victim like everyone else.

404
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,500
It's the only way

405
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,220
to make everyone bow to me

406
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,580
when I take over Yangzhou.

407
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Jiusi.

408
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,000
I have something to discuss with you.

409
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,620
Forget it.

410
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,720
Let's talk about it another time.

411
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,220
Well,

412
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,880
I've got something to say too.

413
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,230
It's really important.

414
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,580
Go ahead.

415
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,100
Never mind.

416
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
You may beat me up.

417
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,900
Are you still

418
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,600
thinking about divorcing me?

419
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,780
No!

420
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,160
What are you thinking?

421
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,230
Then why would I beat you up?

422
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,620
How about

423
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,890
we say it at the same time?

424
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,820
OK.

425
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,860
One, two, three.

426
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,800
I want to give our family fortune to the government.

427
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,700
We're in sync.

428
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,420
Mother,

429
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,140
I want to talk to you about something.

430
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,180
What's it? Go ahead.

431
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,020
I want to give away all our fortune.

432
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,260
All of it?

433
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,700
Whose idea is this?

434
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,040
Although Yuru runs the house,

435
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,020
it's my idea.

436
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,300
Yuru.

437
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,160
You agree with him?

438
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,780
Yes.

439
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,500
Actually,

440
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,620
it's my idea

441
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,620
as much as Jiusi's.

442
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,890
Mom, I'm so sorry.

443
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,970
♫Tear stains on the letter♫

444
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,220
♫The blurred contour of your face♫

445
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,570
♫Remember you'll always be missed♫

446
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,520
Mother, please punish me.

447
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,140
Get up.

448
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,420
You're in charge of the family.

449
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,320
♫The world is so big♫

450
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,460
What we should do

451
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,900
is totally up to you.

452
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,480
♫You're my sun and moon♫

453
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,600
♫Lighting my way through the dark♫

454
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,980
Sit down and eat.

455
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,430
♫How can I forget you♫

456
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:54,830
♫Forget us, and forget the days we spent together?♫

457
00:22:54,830 --> 00:23:00,080
♫How can I move on as if you were never in my life?♫

458
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,490
♫I miss you♫

459
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,690
♫I still love you♫

460
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,960
♫But I can't hold you in my arms again♫

461
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:13,790
♫Will it be like the first time we met?♫

462
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,440
For god's sake.

463
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,260
How are we going to survive?

464
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,660
It can't be serious.

465
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,060
How are we going to get by?

466
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,780
[With wealth and benevolence, we'll make the world a better place.]

467
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,260
Munan.

468
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,660
Go get some tea for the managers.

469
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,180
Yes.

470
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,860
Wait.

471
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,580
Don't you need to donate the tea too?

472
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,940
I can do without tea.

473
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,220
Everyone here is older than me

474
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,740
and has made great contributions

475
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,900
to the Gu family.

476
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,300
The Gu Business is the Gu family's business

477
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
but has only gotten so successful

478
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,500
because of your efforts.

479
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,700
Stop. You're giving us too much credit.

480
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,780
Who are we?

481
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,300
To put it bluntly,

482
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,220
they're just a bunch of workmen.

483
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,780
In the bosses' good graces,

484
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,300
we got to be dressed nicely,

485
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,630
but we'd be damned if we forgot our places.

486
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,900
Yes.

487
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,020
So save those pleasantries

488
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,620
that can't get us anywhere.

489
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,100
Yeah.

490
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,170
[With wealth and benevolence, we'll make the world a better place.]

491
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,860
Fine.

492
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,100
I got a math problem here.

493
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,300
If you can give me an answer,

494
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,820
we won't have to donate a dime

495
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,340
and no one will be dismissed.

496
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,960
At this time last year,

497
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,180
there were 3.3 million people in Youzhou

498
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,580
and more than 350 million kilograms of crops were yielded.

499
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,610
They were just enough for the locals to eat,

500
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,260
seed, and pay taxes.

501
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,230
There would even be extra food.

502
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,940
But after the war broke out,

503
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,260
tens of thousands of people flooded into Youzhou.

504
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,390
Most of those people

505
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,820
are rich merchants,

506
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,860
the gentry, and their servants.

507
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,580
Those people don't work on farms

508
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,220
but all need food to eat.

509
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,300
Youzhou's soil is infertile and the farmland is limited.

510
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,130
How should we

511
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,270
feed the extra population?

512
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,900
With the money we make,

513
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,940
we can go outside to buy food.

514
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,100
Yes.

515
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,220
But war is raging across the whole country

516
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,020
and has displaced countless people.

517
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,980
Every adult male

518
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,440
has been drafted to fight.

519
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,940
Commissioners

520
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,210
are also scrounging for food

521
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,410
to feed their armies.

522
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,140
Can you tell me

523
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,020
which state has extra food now?

524
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,500
You're being melodramatic, Young Master.

525
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,820
There were bad harvests due to floods

526
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,860
and plagues of locusts in the past.

527
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,610
Food shortages are nothing new.

528
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,020
We just have to buy food at a higher price.

529
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,940
Every state made up excuses to evade taxes every year.

530
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,340
They all have stores of food

531
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,620
and are waiting for the price to rise.

532
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,420
Once the price rises,

533
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,460
there'll be supplies.

534
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,410
I've been doing business for half of my life.

535
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,980
Business is all about demand and supply.

536
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,540
I know how the two

537
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,860
affect each other.

538
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,260
But Manager He,

539
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,830
you seem to have forgotten something.

540
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:22,370
[With wealth and benevolence, we'll make the world a better place.]

541
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,180
Food

542
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,110
is different from other products.

543
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,060
When the price of cosmetics rises,

544
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,620
one can wait to buy them next month.

545
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,140
But when the price of food rises,

546
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,940
one can't wait to eat next month.

547
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,300
If the supply of cosmetics is 10% short,

548
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,780
the price will increase by 20%.

549
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,640
But if the food supply is 5% short,

550
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,900
people will freak out

551
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,380
and panic-buying will be triggered.

552
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,220
The price will then

553
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,500
increase by ten times, a hundred times,

554
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,540
or even a thousand times.

555
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,780
Think about it.

556
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,300
If the food supply is cut off for three days,

557
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,820
what will happen?

558
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,660
That

559
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,430
will throw Youzhou into chaos too!

560
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,300
The people will become the mob.

561
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,780
In a time of unrest like that,

562
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,540
how people like us

563
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,100
who have money and stores of food

564
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,500
will end up

565
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,230
is not hard to guess, right?

566
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,140
So I suppose

567
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,740
even if we don't donate everything,

568
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,200
within two or three years,

569
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,420
we'll be deprived of everything.

570
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,580
We don't have two or three years.

571
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,820
The war

572
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,680
has affected the spring plowing.

573
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,750
If we don't save ourselves now,

574
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,500
we'll be doomed

575
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,650
in less than half a year.

576
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,380
Well…

577
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,700
Do we have to donate everything?

578
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,340
Well,

579
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,940
is giving away all our fortune

580
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,420
in exchange for safety

581
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,860
the only option we have?

582
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,660
I'm afraid the war

583
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,180
will take a toll on everyone.

584
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,780
Young Master,

585
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,500
we were too angry to mind our manners just now.

586
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,140
Please forgive us.

587
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,860
You…

588
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,020
Managers,

589
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,580
there's another important thing we need to do.

590
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,710
Please come with me.

591
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,020
What's he going to do?

592
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,700
Let's go.

593
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,530
You all have a share

594
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,470
of the Gu family's fortune.

595
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,060
As the Young Madam,

596
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,150
I'm sincerely grateful to you.

597
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Every manager

598
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,790
can have 3,000 taels of silver

599
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,180
as the capital to start your own business

600
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,500
to make a living.

601
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,060
Besides,

602
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,900
all your assistants,

603
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,580
accountants, and buyers

604
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,820
can have 300 taels

605
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,940
as severance pay.

606
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,900
You've worked hard for so many years.

607
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,430
We're forever in your debt.

608
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,360
This is the least we can do for you.

609
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,940
How can we take the money?

610
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,700
Yeah.

611
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,300
Thank you, Young Master.

612
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,260
Thank you, Young Madam.

613
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,140
W-What's wrong

614
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,980
with you guys?

615
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,610
Have you never seen money before?

616
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,340
A little bit of money

617
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,940
is enough to make you relent?

618
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,540
The gibberish

619
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,420
of two young people

620
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,620
has convinced you to part ways?

621
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,980
Manager He,

622
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,580
Young Master had a point.

623
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,060
You…

624
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,060
I've been through

625
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,300
thick and thin

626
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,660
with the Gu family.

627
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,860
How old are you two?

628
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,540
How in the world

629
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,070
can you donate your family fortune so easily?

630
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,780
A little money is all I got

631
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,060
for years of hard work?

632
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,520
You're right, Manager He.

633
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,940
Managers,

634
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,140
some of you worked for the Gu family longer than others

635
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,500
and contributed a lot more

636
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,850
to the Gu Business.

637
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,260
Manager He,

638
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,420
Manager Xue,

639
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,500
and Manager Gao

640
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,180
have more seniority

641
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,320
and made more contributions.

642
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,740
They deserve a bonus.

643
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,950
I've asked someone to make calculations.

644
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,340
Do you expect me to thank you?

645
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,100
Should I feel honored

646
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,020
to be given so much money?

647
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,370
I don't want the money.

648
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,100
You can either keep it

649
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,580
or give it to them.

650
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,180
Leave as you please.

651
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,740
Part ways if you want!

652
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,820
As long as I'm still breathing,

653
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,620
the Gu Business won't go under!

654
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,920
-Manager He!
-Manager He!

655
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,340
Jiusi.

656
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,300
Do you think we made the wrong decision?

657
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,190
You know the answer.

658
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,910
We made the right decision.

659
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,740
But everyone is so sad.

660
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,700
What Manager He said today

661
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,420
was indeed too harsh.

662
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
I don't blame him.

663
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,500
Manager He is very loyal.

664
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,600
He just doesn't want to leave.

665
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,660
Today,

666
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,980
when everyone's eyes

667
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,510
were fixed on me,

668
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,900
I felt

669
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,270
I was doing something unforgivable.

670
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
Fortunately,

671
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,380
Mother supports us.

672
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,060
Mother is taking it hard too.

673
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,420
The more she supports me,

674
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,460
the more apologetic I feel.

675
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,500
Jiusi.

676
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,180
We broke Mother's heart.

677
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,780
Do you know

678
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,820
why she let you take charge

679
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,100
of the Gu Business at this time?

680
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,020
Was it because of Father?

681
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,980
She's overwhelmed with grief

682
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,840
and doesn't have the energy to do business anymore?

683
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,220
Things like that can't defeat her.

684
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,100
Mother always protected her children and subordinates

685
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,580
under her wings.

686
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,340
Under no circumstances

687
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,460
would she leave

688
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,220
all the hard work to you

689
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,580
to seek pleasure herself

690
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,110
when the future is full of uncertainties.

691
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,940
Then what's the real reason?

692
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,880
She needs you to make the hard decisions.

693
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,900
Our elders

694
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,380
started this family business

695
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,180
from scratch.

696
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,820
Mother knows

697
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,020
that her past experience

698
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,660
will become her restraints.

699
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,230
In the new environment,

700
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,430
we have to give up all we have

701
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,540
and start over.

702
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,420
Only in this way

703
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,880
can she let you make the right choice.

704
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,780
Also,

705
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,820
we

706
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,840
made this decision together.

707
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,740
Don't put so much pressure

708
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,500
on yourself.

709
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,940
Boss Liu,

710
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,260
since Mother let you take charge,

711
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,300
you just need to loosen up

712
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,580
and muster the courage

713
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,420
to do whatever feels right to you.

714
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,020
No matter what the result is,

715
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,370
we'll stand together as a family.

716
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,300
Can't believe I said that.

717
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,740
I'm indeed

718
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,140
the best man in the world.

719
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,340
You're so lucky

720
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,450
to be my wife.

721
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,580
Don't be such a bragger.

722
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
I said so much

723
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,500
but didn't get any compliments from you,

724
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,900
so I have to flatter myself.

725
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm also handsome,

726
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,140
dashing, and debonair.

727
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,220
With wealth and benevolence,

728
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,460
we'll make the world a better place.

729
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,980
That's the Gu Business's motto.

730
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,580
Yeah.

731
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,820
I've read it thousands of times

732
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,500
and known it by heart,

733
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,510
but I didn't realize until today

734
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,969
that I never understood its true meaning.

735
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:29,980
Young Master.

736
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,750
I'm so sorry.

737
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,230
I was so rude yesterday.

738
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,080
I apologize to you

739
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,380
and Young Madam.

740
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,440
You don't need to apologize.

741
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,989
I do, Young Master.

742
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,510
You and she reminded me

743
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,610
of this family motto.

744
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,010
I kept saying

745
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,730
that I'm devoted to the Gu Business,

746
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,690
but I forgot

747
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,620
the foundation of the Gu Business.

748
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,260
With wealth and benevolence,

749
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
we'll make the world a better place.

750
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,810
Old Master Gu

751
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,790
wrote those words himself.

752
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,760
I heard from Mother

753
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:06,730
that when Grandfather

754
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,030
made this plaque,

755
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,170
the Gu Business was very small

756
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,830
and the money they earned was only enough to pay the rent.

757
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,710
Yes.

758
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,730
At the end of that year,

759
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,030
after your grandfather

760
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,790
gave out rewards and dividends

761
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,050
and paid the taxes,

762
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,400
he used

763
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,070
the little bit of money left

764
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,470
to buy this rosewood plaque

765
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,070
and wrote this family motto.

766
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,000
He asked me to use the rest of the money

767
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,890
to buy bread

768
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,400
for the poor.

769
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,750
Really?

770
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,580
Back then,

771
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,930
right under this plaque,

772
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,520
your grandfather

773
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,160
told everyone working in the Gu Business

774
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,710
to keep in mind

775
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,430
the meaning of this motto.

776
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,290
Business should not

777
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,420
just benefit one person or one family.

778
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,700
It should benefit the world

779
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,330
and everyone living in it.

780
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,920
Young Master, you're right.

781
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,180
The war will take a toll on everyone.

782
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,910
You donated the family fortune

783
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,380
to the commissioner of Youzhou

784
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,930
not just for self-protection.

785
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,520
You did it

786
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,580
also for the peace of Youzhou.

787
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,760
You're so young

788
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,820
but way more far-sighted

789
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,090
than an old man like me.

790
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,140
Manager He,

791
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,870
the one visionary is Yuru.

792
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,890
I'm just supporting her.

793
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,160
It surprises me

794
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,710
that you

795
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,070
had the strongest objection at first

796
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,830
but understood our intention best

797
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,510
in the end.

798
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,400
Young Master,

799
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,210
I feel ashamed.

800
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,610
Mr. Nie, you've been working so hard.

801
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,640
Young Madam.

802
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,580
I'm just doing my job.

803
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,510
We went over

804
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,070
the numbers yesterday.

805
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,370
There are no mistakes.

806
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,050
Why are you...

807
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,240
I just want to check them again.

808
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,940
I've spent half of my life working

809
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,350
as an accountant in the Gu Business.

810
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,830
This is the last time I do calculations here.

811
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,400
I just want to

812
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,990
take it slow

813
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,750
and do the accounting one more time.

814
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,890
I see.

815
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,150
I'll leave you to it.

816
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:47,690
Take your time.

817
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,360
Take care, Young Madam.

818
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,960
Young Madam.

819
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,510
Madam wants to see you in the greenhouse.

820
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,120
Okay.

821
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,110
Why do you look so timid?

822
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,680
Mother,

823
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,030
I thought

824
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,890
you wouldn't want to see me again.

825
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,110
Silly.

826
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,550
You're not only as decisive as me when doing business,

827
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,560
but also as silly as

828
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,610
I used to be.

829
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,500
When I first took over

830
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,140
the Gu Business,

831
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,900
I was around your age

832
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,670
and faced a similar dilemma.

833
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,760
At that time,

834
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,780
the textile industry in Yangzhou

835
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,630
was embarking on a new era.

836
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,190
Silk reeling, spinning, weaving, and embroidering

837
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,660
developed into separate trades.

838
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,840
I was young and ambitious.

839
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,270
I was sure

840
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,530
that we needed to make changes

841
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,920
to survive in the new era.

842
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,180
So, once I took charge,

843
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,690
I bought

844
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,060
ten stores and an embroidery workshop.

845
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,720
In one night,

846
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,070
I spent all the Gu family's savings.

847
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,850
I even mortgaged

848
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,710
the Gu family's ancestral house.

849
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,020
If I had failed,

850
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,780
the whole family

851
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,800
would've become homeless.

852
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,190
Tell me.

853
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,870
Wasn't that

854
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,010
very similar

855
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,020
to you donating all our fortune?

856
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,210
You've always been cautious and stable.

857
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,090
I'm surprised to know

858
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,820
that you once went out on a limb.

859
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,280
I'm cautious and stable

860
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,100
because I'm old.

861
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,540
When people get old,

862
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,300
they tend to be uptight

863
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,560
and bigoted.

864
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,490
Then what happened?

865
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,690
What happened later?

866
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,010
Later,

867
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,490
shops sticking to the old ways

868
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,430
closed down one after another,

869
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,830
while the Gu Business

870
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,610
went with the tide

871
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,820
and grew bigger and bigger.

872
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,820
At that time,

873
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,560
my decision was opposed by almost everyone

874
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,150
just like yours is.

875
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:13,090
Only my father-in-law, Old Master Gu,

876
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,890
supported me.

877
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,120
He said

878
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,020
that he had faith in the one he chose.

879
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,400
He believed

880
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,470
that I was the future of the Gu family.

881
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,310
Yuru.

882
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,760
Now I believe

883
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,670
that you're the future of the Gu family.

884
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,600
The Gu family

885
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,280
will surely

886
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,140
emerge stronger from the crisis.

887
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,070
Mother,

888
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,170
I won't let you down.

889
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,730
Remember,

890
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,870
we're a family.

891
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,600
We support each other

892
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,390
when bad things happen.

893
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,930
Have you taken care of

894
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,990
all those managers and assistants?

895
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,010
Yes. Rest assured, Mother.

896
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,230
That's good.

897
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,560
In times like this, we have to get used to saying goodbye.

898
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,820
No matter what,

899
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,370
we need to survive first to hold out hope.

900
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,980
I just wish

901
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,610
that it could work out for everyone.

902
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,530
The Gu family used to be

903
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,950
a shining moon held high by all of us.

904
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,270
Now that we've become a scatter of stars,

905
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,550
a new story will begin.

906
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,820
I just wonder

907
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,130
whether

908
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,040
I can meet them again before I die.

909
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,620
Since you care about them,

910
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,660
why don't you say goodbye to them personally?

911
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,180
No need.

912
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,250
It would just make everyone sad.

913
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,020
Parting is too heavy

914
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,670
for someone my age.

915
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:11,780
Madam.

916
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,570
Madam.
