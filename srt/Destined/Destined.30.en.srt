[Destined]

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,030
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,259
I will help you

5
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,240
get what you want, Your Highness.

6
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,100
I'd like to

7
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,060
propose a toast to you, Grand Tutor.

8
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

9
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,420
Jiusi.

10
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,870
To be honest,

11
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,220
for a moment just now,

12
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,220
I was worried that

13
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,660
you'd go back there with a sword

14
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,790
to kill Luo Zishang.

15
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,500
In that case, all of you will be implicated.

16
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,360
I won't do that.

17
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,900
Still, seeing my enemy right in front of me,

18
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,670
but I can't avenge

19
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,860
my father

20
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,980
and the innocent.

21
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,190
This feeling...

22
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,140
I understand.

23
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,340
The Ye family

24
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,380
was also murdered

25
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,790
and destroyed.

26
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,910
But now,

27
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,680
I can't do anything about him.

28
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,030
So why don't you go see His Majesty,

29
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,370
reveal the true colors

30
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,340
of Luo Zishang,

31
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,500
and ask His Majesty to execute him?

32
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,720
What Luo Zishang is best at

33
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,980
is to stir up trouble behind the scenes.

34
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,570
No one

35
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,830
knows his true colors.

36
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,180
They all think he endured the humiliation

37
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,850
and worked for Wang Shanquan

38
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,740
to protect the gentry of Jiangnan.

39
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,540
That's why he has high prestige.

40
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,670
Also,

41
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,079
what he's best at

42
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,280
is to bewitch people.

43
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,170
If we make a scene now,

44
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,380
someone

45
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,940
will get a hold over us on purpose

46
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,940
to impugn His Majesty

47
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
and Youzhou Sect.

48
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,430
It won't be worth it.

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,660
But His Majesty can tell right from wrong.

50
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,060
Doesn't he trust us more?

51
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,500
It won't make any difference.

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,390
Think about it.

53
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,740
Luo Zishang

54
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,000
dared to show up in Eastern Capital

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,020
presumptuously.

56
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,740
That means

57
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,990
he has something

58
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,780
that makes others, even His Majesty,

59
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,220
dare not confront him.

60
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,780
The new dynasty is just built. It's not a good time to crusade.

61
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,340
Now His Majesty's foundation is still unstable.

62
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,130
The prefectures are in separatism.

63
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,650
Now is the time for them to take stock of the situation

64
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,510
and surrender.

65
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,570
Luo Zishang just

66
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,940
took the initiative to offer Yangzhou.

67
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,470
If anything happens to him,

68
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,070
who else would dare to surrender to Da Xia?

69
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,020
So

70
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,540
Luo Zishang got a death-exemption plate

71
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,070
in the name of

72
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,899
taking scope of the situation of the world?

73
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,140
Exactly.

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,110
For His Majesty,

75
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,370
and for the stability of the new dynasty,

76
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,900
I can endure the blood feud.

77
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,690
But that's the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor.

78
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,060
The Crown Prince is the foundation of our dynasty,

79
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,430
and the future of Da Xia.

80
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,510
He traded Yangzhou for this position.

81
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,260
That is to put the bet

82
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,980
on the Crown Prince.

83
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,980
That's what I'm most worried about.

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,000
[Spring in the Four Seas]

85
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,380
I'm your humble servant, Luo Zishang.

86
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

87
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,180
I got a pair of

88
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,100
Hepu luminous pearls

89
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,900
for your entertainment, Your Majesty.

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,940
Please accept it.

91
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,110
Thank you, Grand Tutor.

92
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,620
I heard that

93
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,430
you killed Wang Shanquan

94
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,740
and offered Yangzhou, Grand Tutor.

95
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,820
His Majesty made an exception and appointed you as the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor.

96
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,060
Since you're His Majesty's favorite,

97
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,380
how come you have time

98
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,990
to come to my palace?

99
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,460
When His Majesty took over Eastern Capital,

100
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,950
if not for your support,

101
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,100
how could he make the world submit?

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,740
And now,

103
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,260
His Majesty's foundation is still unstable,

104
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,220
but he tried to purge hostile forces

105
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,140
in the name of treasury investigation.

106
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,830
In fact,

107
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,020
he's trying to seize power from you, Your Majesty.

108
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,350
His Majesty

109
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,620
did hurt me

110
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,420
and the old officials of the previous dynasty with this move.

111
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,350
What do you have in mind, Grand Tutor?

112
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,580
I heard that

113
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,220
Princess Yunchang

114
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,940
used to have an engagement

115
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,980
with Gu Jiusi.

116
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,540
Since it's the late emperor's dying wish,

117
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,600
the engagement should be fulfilled.

118
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,230
Gu Jiusi

119
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,590
is a loyal official.

120
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,300
The only thing he relies on

121
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,630
is His Majesty's trust.

122
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,420
If he marries Her Highness,

123
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,220
he can get under your command, Your Majesty.

124
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,080
And His Majesty

125
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,150
won't be able to trust him anymore.

126
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,230
Gu Jiusi

127
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,020
will become the best sword

128
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,980
in your hands, Your Majesty.

129
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,820
The princess is the only child

130
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,470
left by the late emperor.

131
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,430
It's time to find her a

132
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,000
good marriage.

133
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,590
Liu Yuru.

134
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,100
After the princess marries into the Gu family,

135
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,560
there will be no Mrs. Gu in the world anymore.

136
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,100
But I can still

137
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,590
make you Boss Liu.

138
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,050
[Ministry of Revenue]

139
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,060
Brother Jiusi.

140
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,460
[Princess of the previous dynasty, Li Yunchang]

141
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,540
You are...?

142
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,380
Why didn't you bow to Her Highness?

143
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:07,900
No need.

144
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,180
I'm just here to see my old friend.

145
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,180
No need to focus on the formalities.

146
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,380
I didn't know who you are.

147
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,290
Please forgive me for being rude,

148
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,740
Your Highness.

149
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,900
Brother Jiusi.

150
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,160
Why are you so distant?

151
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
I'm Yunchang.

152
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,590
Don't you remember?

153
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,260
We've known each other since we were little.

154
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,750
I was only five then.

155
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,230
You didn't know who I am,

156
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,820
and treated me as a maid.

157
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,060
You climbed the tree to take the kite down for me,

158
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,370
and coaxed me into calling you brother

159
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,620
before giving it back to me.

160
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,659
You are the Phoenix born with pearl, Your Highness.

161
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,700
How would I, an inferior official, dare to make connections with you?

162
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,420
I did countless mischievous things

163
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,020
in my childhood.

164
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020
Please forgive me

165
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,960
if I offended you, Your Highness.

166
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,540
You didn't offend me.

167
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,540
I'm very happy

168
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,940
that fate brought us together.

169
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,610
The snow three years ago

170
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,650
made us miss each other

171
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,580
accidentally.

172
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,030
I thought it was over between us.

173
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,940
I didn't expect that

174
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,340
the kite string is still there.

175
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,100
No.

176
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,100
It was all set up by

177
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,350
Lord Liang.

178
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,620
I have absolutely no feelings

179
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,900
for you.

180
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,270
How can I deserve you?

181
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,860
Besides,

182
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,300
I already have a wife.

183
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,220
She is the wealthiest person in Youzhou,

184
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,300
the boss of Huarong rouge shop,

185
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,030
Liu Yuru.

186
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,020
We are in

187
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,620
a harmonious and loving relationship now.

188
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,780
Brother Jiusi, it's been a long time since we last met.

189
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,510
Why don't you stay in the palace

190
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,180
and take a walk with me in the garden?

191
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,940
My legs

192
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,990
are not well.

193
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,090
Deputy Minister Gu.

194
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,299
Remonstrator Ye wants to see you at the Ministry of Rites.

195
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,820
I have something important to do.

196
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,150
See you, Your Highness.

197
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,400
Brother Jiusi.

198
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,100
Wait, Brother Jiusi.

199
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,550
My Lady.

200
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,260
Someone from the palace sent an invitation.

201
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,950
Leave it.

202
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
I'll give it to Jiusi when he's back.

203
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,180
My Lady.

204
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,710
This invitation is for you.

205
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,940
The man delivered it said

206
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,470
Her Highness wants to invite you to a flower-admiring banquet.

207
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,100
Why does Princess Yunchang

208
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
want to invite me?

209
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,380
It's said to be a banquet for the wives of the officials of Eastern Capital.

210
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,750
Many ladies are going.

211
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,100
We've been in Eastern Capital for so long,

212
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
and we've had no problem

213
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
with Princess Yunchang.

214
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
How come

215
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,190
she jumped out to woo us

216
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,900
when Jiusi is investigating the Treasury?

217
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,580
Something

218
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,990
is not right about this.

219
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,310
My Lady.

220
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,660
Shall I decline the invitation for you?

221
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,750
No.

222
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,510
I need to see her.

223
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,310
Wanzhi.

224
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,700
You've never enjoyed palace banquets and socializing.

225
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,780
Sorry for making you

226
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,840
come with me today.

227
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,110
Don't mention it.

228
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,270
Li Yunchang must be up to no good

229
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,610
sending you that invitation.

230
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,820
I don't trust her enough

231
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,880
to let you go alone.

232
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,910
Moreover, these days,

233
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,380
the gossip of her knowing Jiusi since they were young.

234
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,500
and having an engagement with him

235
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,430
has been all over Eastern Capital.

236
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,380
When I was working,

237
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,580
my colleagues all wanted to pry into it

238
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,980
explicitly or implicitly.

239
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,870
People say women like to gossip.

240
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,820
I don't see men

241
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,980
being any better.

242
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,310
I'm not angry as the victim.

243
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,940
Why do you have to be mad at

244
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,600
those who believe the rumors?

245
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,840
People in Eastern Capital

246
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,260
all seem to be decent on the outside,

247
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,790
but they are full of tricks.

248
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,660
Anyway, I can't let them

249
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,920
take advantage of you.

250
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,830
Mrs. Gu.

251
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,730
How have you been?

252
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,740
Young Master Luo.

253
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,500
We parted in a hurry at Yangzhou dock,

254
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,980
and I only got to see you off from afar.

255
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,440
I always feel sorry for it.

256
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,150
But luckily,

257
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,820
we meet again so soon.

258
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,190
I didn't expect you

259
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,830
to come to Eastern Capital,

260
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,460
given that you're so busy in Yangzhou, Young Master Luo.

261
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,980
Eastern Capital is a prosperous place.

262
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,660
All businessmen long for it.

263
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,360
Just like you, Mrs. Gu.

264
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm no exception, either.

265
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,020
Compared with

266
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,150
your current identity as a noble wife,

267
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,620
I admired you more

268
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,820
when you were still

269
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,880
Boss Liu back then.

270
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,550
Who is he?

271
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,390
Nobody.

272
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,810
A serpent

273
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,870
that only dares to hide in the shadow.

274
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:21,980
So delicate.

275
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,040
This is beautiful.

276
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,110
It's so beautiful.

277
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,070
Yes.

278
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,460
Mrs. Liu.

279
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,420
Mrs. Liu, your hairpin

280
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,900
is a good item.

281
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,670
It's rare to see

282
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,280
such a precious treasure.

283
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,510
How sharp-eyed you are.

284
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,500
Let's enjoy the flowers together.

285
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,110
Okay.

286
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,900
Who is the lady

287
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,860
wearing a wood hairpin?

288
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,260
She's Vice Director of the Granaries Bureau Liu Chun's wife.

289
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,260
I see.

290
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,180
You may leave.

291
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,270
Yes.

292
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,510
Wanzhi.

293
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,300
What rank is Vice Director of the Granaries Bureau?

294
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Vice Director of the Granaries Bureau is a fourth-rank official.

295
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,100
Fourth-rank?

296
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,680
Isn't it the same as Jiusi's rank?

297
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,550
Almost.

298
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,790
Isn't this Mrs. Gu,

299
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,020
Deputy Minister of Revenue's wife?

300
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,270
Mrs. Gu!

301
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,180
We've heard a lot about you.

302
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,550
What a coincidence.

303
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,910
My husband Liu Chun

304
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,940
also works in the Ministry of Revenue, same as Deputy Minister Gu.

305
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,070
Your husband

306
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,420
is His Majesty's favorite

307
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,100
now.

308
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,230
Now that I see your temperament,

309
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,070
you are really extraordinary.

310
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,060
Mrs. Liu, you flatter me.

311
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,260
This is nothing.

312
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,900
You, on the other hand, have a great taste, Mrs. Liu.

313
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,430
The hairpin you're wearing

314
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,140
looks like plain wood.

315
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,420
But it's clearly made of thousand-year-old Dalbergia odorifera

316
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,700
from Qiongzhou.

317
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,440
It's rare in the world.

318
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,590
It's much more valuable than gold.

319
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,300
This hairpin equals

320
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,700
Vice Director Liu's annual salary, right?

321
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,170
It's worth a lot indeed.

322
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:25,990
Yes.

323
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,310
Annual salary?

324
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,140
Mrs. Liu.

325
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,690
My family used to have

326
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,860
a few properties.

327
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,860
But I've never been

328
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,030
as wealthy as you.

329
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,380
If Vice Director Liu

330
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,990
has some ways to make money,

331
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,060
please enlighten me.

332
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,190
What Dalbergia odorifera?

333
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,660
I don't understand.

334
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,340
This is just an ordinary hairpin.

335
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,300
It's worthless.

336
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,070
Princess Yunchang is here!

337
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,830
Greetings, Your Highness.

338
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,850
You're all here for fun today.

339
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,170
You are my guests.

340
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,930
Don't mind the formalities.

341
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,790
Please rise.

342
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

343
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,550
Did I say you can rise?

344
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,140
I heard that Mrs. Gu comes from a commoner's family.

345
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,170
Your humble family went through

346
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,910
a lot of trouble raising you.

347
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,580
And you married into a noble family.

348
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,940
Now you can even attend

349
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,540
the same banquet as the wives of the officials.

350
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,100
It shows that

351
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,430
with good luck,

352
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,870
even a blade of grass can fly to the sky.

353
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,830
Yuru, get up.

354
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,390
Do you dare to disobey my order?

355
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,240
No, I don't.

356
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,320
But I have a question, Your Highness.

357
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,660
When His Majesty was saving the late emperor,

358
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,100
it was Mrs. Gu, who was born a commoner,

359
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,740
raised the military provisions.

360
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,180
When the bandits of Lord Liang was attacking Wangdu,

361
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,620
it was also Mrs. Gu who guarded the city gate

362
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,940
and protected the people.

363
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,780
As for you noble ladies,

364
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,990
besides hiding in the capital,

365
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,440
what have you ever done

366
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,360
for the dynasty

367
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,740
and the people?

368
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:20,950
Wanzhi.

369
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,300
We were both born commoners.

370
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,100
We are a far cry from Her Highness.

371
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,220
How can we compare ourselves with Her Highness?

372
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,780
Your Highness, for you,

373
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,300
an ordinary flower-admiring banquet

374
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,960
can be held so extravagantly.

375
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,620
I think Your Highness

376
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,340
must have put a lot of thought in it

377
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,550
for us.

378
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,420
I'm just a vulgar woman in the army.

379
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,220
I can't tell if there are thoughts in it.

380
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,870
But I want to ask you, Sister,

381
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,700
how much

382
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,550
does this flower-admiring banquet cost today?

383
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,940
That must be a lot.

384
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,610
There are 12 tables of delicacy

385
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,500
set in the Imperial Garden for the flower-admiring banquet.

386
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,700
It takes at least 1,000 taels of silver.

387
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,940
1,000 taels?

388
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,740
1,000 taels?

389
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,180
It equals

390
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,780
ten second-rank officials' annual salaries.

391
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,030
Mrs. Gu.

392
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,150
Are you accusing me?

393
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,180
I dare not.

394
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,859
It's just that now is the initial stage of Da Xia.

395
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,670
It's time for us to work together

396
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,150
and serve our dynasty.

397
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,859
As officials' wives,

398
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,500
we shouldn't fight among ourselves.

399
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,390
Not only that,

400
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,280
we should also make contributions to Da Xia.

401
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,550
If we can

402
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,900
be thrifty and frugal in our households,

403
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,220
it also counts as pledging allegiance to our country.

404
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,740
You...

405
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,860
His Majesty is here!

406
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,860
Well said.

407
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,260
Greetings, Your Majesty.

408
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,990
Rise.

409
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,200
-Thank you, Your Majesty./N-Thank you, Your Majesty.

410
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,100
Yuru.

411
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,440
I heard

412
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,590
what you just said.

413
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,380
Well said.

414
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,740
Your Majesty.

415
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,380
I'm shallow and inexperienced.

416
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,260
I was just thinking about

417
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,540
what I did in the household

418
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,100
to manage internal affairs.

419
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
Sorry about that, Your Majesty.

420
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,560
Don't belittle yourself.

421
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,980
In fact, the management of a country and a household

422
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,270
shares the same root.

423
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,460
If the officials' wives and their households

424
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,270
can set an example

425
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,750
to create a clean and thrifty fashion,

426
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:28,870
then

427
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,020
it will definitely create

428
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,270
the peace and prosperity of Da Xia.

429
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,100
Do you understand?

430
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,790
Brilliant! Your Majesty!

431
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,910
Yuru.

432
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,910
When we were in Youzhou,

433
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,000
I witnessed you and Jiusi

434
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,860
help the people and donate money.

435
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,670
Now the people of Wangdu are living in peace.

436
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,910
You also contributed a lot to that.

437
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,980
It seems that you care about the country.

438
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,640
You're not an ordinary woman.

439
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,310
If you were a man,

440
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,390
you must be a hero.

441
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,880
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

442
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,380
You've been busy with court administration lately, Your Majesty.

443
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,010
You are not as robust

444
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,310
as before.

445
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,260
Since the weather is good,

446
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,310
you should come out more often

447
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,040
and get more sunlight.

448
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,510
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

449
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,020
I wonder why you wanted to see me

450
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,420
here today?

451
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,660
What could it be?

452
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,890
I'm old.

453
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,660
What I care about is only my children.

454
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,030
I only have

455
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
one child, Yunchang.

456
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,890
I hope Your Majesty

457
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,150
can make a decision for her marriage,

458
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,670
and betroth her to a good husband.

459
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,790
This is good news.

460
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,060
Your Majesty.

461
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,430
I wonder

462
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,550
if you have someone in mind for her?

463
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,880
You don't know, right?

464
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,410
Yunchang had

465
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,180
an engagement with the current

466
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,420
Deputy Minister of Revenue,

467
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,620
Gu Jiusi.

468
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,390
Gu Jiusi?

469
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,500
But he already has a wife.

470
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,990
I know.

471
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,860
But that Liu is just

472
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,100
a commoner.

473
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,740
Just let him divorce her.

474
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,760
Besides, when it comes to marriage,

475
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,650
the late emperor

476
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,580
arranged the marriage for Yunchang first.

477
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,380
Liu only married him after that.

478
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,500
It won't be us oppressing her

479
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,140
as the royal family.

480
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,140
Your Majesty.

481
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,740
The princess is royalty.

482
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,110
And Gu Jiusi

483
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,990
is already married.

484
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,020
Besides, he's not a highly-ranked official.

485
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,580
It will be wronging the princess.

486
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,180
It's really inappropriate.

487
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,470
In my opinion,

488
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,150
you should

489
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,740
choose someone else for her, Your Majesty.

490
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,100
If Yunchang is willing to choose someone else,

491
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,370
I wouldn't have to ask you for this favor myself,

492
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,860
Your Majesty.

493
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,900
Yunchang is

494
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,150
spoiled by me.

495
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,180
She and Deputy Minister Gu were childhood sweethearts.

496
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,630
They've been hanging out since childhood.

497
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,690
Now she only wants to

498
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,220
marry him.

499
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,820
Your Majesty.

500
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,380
This is the last wish

501
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,110
of the late emperor.

502
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,860
Now that the late emperor

503
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,240
had no other children,

504
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,490
Yunchang is the only child left

505
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,110
with the royal blood.

506
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,860
Back then, I brought

507
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,220
the entire court to welcome you at the gate with my only child.

508
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,780
I dedicated everything to you, Your Majesty.

509
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,860
I'm not asking for anything else

510
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,820
but shelter.

511
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,180
I hope Your Majesty

512
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,220
can call the shots here for my child's marriage.

513
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,420
It will be

514
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,020
granting the last wish of the late emperor.

515
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,760
Although I'm the emperor,

516
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,550
the matchmaking

517
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,940
still needs them

518
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,950
to love each other.

519
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,960
How about this?

520
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,460
I'll ask Official Gu

521
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,220
for you.

522
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,590
How about that?

523
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,820
[Changgeng Palace]

524
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,050
[All-embracing Walls for Worldly Matters]

525
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,350
Official Gu.

526
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,590
How's your household doing recently?

527
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,900
Recently, my household

528
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,980
has been peaceful, healthy and harmonious.

529
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,310
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

530
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,500
Well,

531
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,070
how are you

532
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,870
and your wife, Liu, getting along?

533
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,260
My wife Liu Yuru and I

534
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,540
have had

535
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,860
a harmonious and loving relationship

536
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,550
since we got married.

537
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,670
Official Gu.

538
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,780
If I ask you to

539
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,790
marry Princess Yunchang,

540
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,150
what do you think?

541
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,220
I appreciate your and Her Majesty's kindness.

542
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,060
I do appreciate your kindness, but...

543
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,510
I'm already married.

544
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,710
When you got married, Deputy Minister Gu,

545
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,290
your background wasn't a good match in the first place.

546
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,990
Now you are

547
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,020
an imperial official, Deputy Minister Gu.

548
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,350
You're held in high regard by His Majesty.

549
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,150
You're the best of the best.

550
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,070
Just divorce your wife and get married again.

551
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,550
Deputy Minister Gu.

552
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,750
Why don't you express your gratitude to His Majesty?

553
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,100
Your Majesty.

554
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,940
Your Majesty.

555
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,500
I have a question.

556
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,140
Go ahead.

557
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,140
I've read the classics.

558
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,620
I know that

559
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,220
in the etiquette of being a husband,

560
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,570
there are three "Don't Leave"s.

561
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,460
Don't leave your wife if she has no maiden family to turn to.

562
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,460
Don't leave your wife if she served

563
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,940
and mourned her in-laws for three years each.

564
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,660
Don't leave your wife if you get rich after sharing a humble life with her.

565
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,020
My wife Liu Yuru

566
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,420
has no maiden family to turn to in Yangzhou.

567
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,940
She mourned devotedly for my father,

568
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,130
and served my parents

569
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,430
dedicatedly

570
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,000
and meticulously.

571
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,270
Since we got married,

572
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,570
we've been through thick and thin together.

573
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,170
We never left each other.

574
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,240
Even when the Gu family was in trouble,

575
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,300
she never despised me

576
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,470
due to poverty.

577
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,790
Deputy Minister Gu.

578
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,140
What do you mean,

579
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,300
telling me this?

580
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,350
I want to ask you, Your Majesty.

581
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,900
If I were to divorce my wife

582
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,650
due to riches and honor,

583
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,540
it would be disloyal and unfaithful

584
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,260
to my devoted wife who's been through thick and thin with me.

585
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,860
If I distressed my household

586
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,850
for social climbing,

587
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,780
it would be unfilial to my parents.

588
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,140
As a loving mother,

589
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,740
are you really willing to

590
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,220
let Her Highness marry

591
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,820
such an ungrateful, disloyal

592
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,340
and unfilial man like me?

593
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,270
It's a pity indeed.

594
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,470
It seems that

595
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,220
you have no luck

596
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,090
to marry

597
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,220
Princess Yunchang, Official Gu.

598
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,810
Yes.

599
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,420
However,

600
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,620
you and your wife are deeply in love.

601
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,310
It really touched me.

602
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,700
It's said that it was because of the first snow

603
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,420
in the early spring of Yangzhou that

604
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,940
stopped the marriage-bestowing envoy,

605
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,660
you two

606
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,320
got to get married in advance.

607
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,460
This is God's will.

608
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,750
It's God's will.

609
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,410
You two love each other,

610
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,670
and share weal and woe.

611
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,460
What a match made in heaven.

612
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,180
Come on, bring me a pen and paper.

613
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,710
Hurry.

614
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,980
I'm going to make these words

615
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,900
into a plaque

616
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,670
and gift it to Deputy Minister Gu and his wife.

617
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

618
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,830
[Blessings from Heaven]

619
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,380
What are you looking at?

620
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,860
Do you think I'm not embarrassed enough?

621
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,300
Your Highness, please calm down.

622
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,990
Get out!

623
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,800
A match made in heaven.

624
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,770
[A Match Made in Heaven]

625
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,220
The more I look at this plaque, the more I like it.

626
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,030
Munan, go.

627
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,650
Hang it

628
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,510
in the bedroom.

629
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,270
I want to see it

630
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,140
the first thing every morning.

631
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,950
Hurry up.

632
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,300
Let's go.

633
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,270
So exaggerated.

634
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,260
Why did His Majesty suddenly

635
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,460
want to give you this?

636
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,060
Is it that your Sister Yunchang

637
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,660
is still thinking about you,

638
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,420
so His Majesty wanted to give you an amulet?

639
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,180
You guessed it right.

640
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,990
But this time,

641
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,100
I was so eloquent

642
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
that I made Her Majesty speechless.

643
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,130
Why did you do that to her?

644
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,620
On our wedding night,

645
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,460
you proposed to divorce me, right?

646
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,990
Isn't it wonderful

647
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,100
if you can marry the princess and become a consort?

648
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,700
Why are you still dredging stuff up

649
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,980
after you're done with the ledger?

650
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,700
Stop that.

651
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,540
Let it go.

652
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,790
I won't.

653
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,110
Fine, go ahead.

654
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,700
But "A Match Made in Heaven"

655
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,780
was His Majesty's words.

656
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,110
Do you want to disobey the imperial edict?

657
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,900
What's wrong?

658
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,460
I feel like

659
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,070
something isn't right.

660
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,020
His Majesty has always been benevolent.

661
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,420
And he knows that we've been through thick and thin together.

662
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,550
He wouldn't have wanted to break us up.

663
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,500
Back then,

664
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,660
the Empress Dowager offered Eastern Capital.

665
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,970
His Majesty owed her

666
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,350
a very valuable favor.

667
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,780
But now,

668
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,060
the Empress Dowager insisted on making things difficult for His Majesty.

669
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,720
It's indeed a bit extravagant

670
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,550
to use the favor here.

671
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,940
The intention of this marriage

672
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,430
can't be that simple.

673
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,270
His Majesty trusts me a lot,

674
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,620
so he asked me to investigate the Treasury.

675
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,480
This is against

676
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,910
the interests of the old officials of the previous dynasty.

677
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,740
The Empress Dowager's brother Lu Yong

678
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,730
is the head of the officials of the previous dynasty.

679
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,860
The Empress Dowager

680
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,020
wouldn't want His Majesty

681
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,580
to continue investigating.

682
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,380
That's right.

683
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,070
As a loyal official,

684
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,450
what I rely on

685
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,780
is His Majesty's trust.

686
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,150
If I marry the princess,

687
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,620
it will be

688
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,980
allying with the Empress Dowager and the old officials of the previous dynasty.

689
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,660
His Majesty

690
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,880
won't be able to trust me anymore.

691
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,580
This move is so sinister.

692
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,630
A big payoff for a small effort.

693
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,140
It sounds like...

694
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,710
What Luo Zishang would do.

695
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,630
Eastern Capital is complex and intertwined.

696
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,020
I need to go talk to

697
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,390
that old fox.

698
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,940
You're doing pretty well.

699
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,740
Looks like my mother has been worried for nothing.

700
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,350
What?

701
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,140
You've been in Eastern Capital for so long,

702
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,870
and it just occurred to you that you have an uncle?

703
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,310
Tell your mother

704
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,100
not to worry.

705
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,740
Come on in and have a seat.

706
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,740
In ancient times, people used to draw a circle on the ground to serve as a prison,

707
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,780
and it shall not be entered.

708
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm not going in.

709
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,560
It's good outside.

710
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,700
Whatever.

711
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,420
You've grown taller.

712
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,230
It must be because we haven't seen each other for a long time.

713
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,110
I've heard a lot about you.

714
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,340
By the way,

715
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,460
about Princess Yunchang...

716
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,390
Were you really not tempted at all?

717
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,030
She is a beauty.

718
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,260
Since she met you for the first time in Eastern Capital,

719
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,030
she's been secretly in love with you.

720
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,550
Don't talk nonsense.

721
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,930
If my wife hears it,

722
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,930
I won't be able to get away with this.

723
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,430
Look how scared you are.

724
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,900
My niece-in-law

725
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,990
who I've never met

726
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,300
overwhelms you like this?

727
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,030
Let's get down to business.

728
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,290
It's all because

729
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,100
you insisted on investigating the treasury case.

730
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,220
Asking you to marry the princess

731
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,040
was

732
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,150
just a beginning.

733
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,790
I can't even say

734
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,020
it's a bad thing.

735
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,130
But if you insist that

736
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,780
you'd keep on investigating,

737
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,050
then you'll be

738
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,050
doing it the hard way, little Jiusi.

739
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,460
Little Jiusi is not intimidated

740
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,860
by their little games.

741
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,110
You may not be intimidated.

742
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:32,900
But do you know

743
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,980
how many people's interests you're going against?

744
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,710
Your family, your friends,

745
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,660
and

746
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,060
my niece-in-law

747
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,980
who I've never met.

748
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,180
They'll all be in danger because of you.

749
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,720
Have you thought about it?

750
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,670
I will protect them.

751
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,220
But you have to

752
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,750
have the ability to do that.

753
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,780
Besides,

754
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,420
even if you find out

755
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,700
all the corrupt officials,

756
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,580
so what?

757
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,470
Do you want to

758
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,410
dismiss them all?

759
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,460
Why not?

760
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,280
You should go back.

761
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,670
Or your mother will be worried.

762
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,350
Fine.

763
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,100
What brings you here,

764
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,540
Grand Tutor?

765
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,700
Of course I'm here to

766
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,000
solve problems for you, Minister Lu.

767
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,110
Last time,

768
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,200
you planned Princess Yunchang's marriage,

769
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,700
and it made the Empress Dowager

770
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,560
so angry that she almost fell ill.

771
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,780
Grand Tutor,

772
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,320
what do you have in mind this time?

773
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,380
Minister Lu.

774
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,590
I'm afraid we have to concede a battle to win a war.

775
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,500
Liu Chun has to go.

776
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,860
Lose a tail to stay alive.

777
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Even a gecko knows it.

778
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,550
If Grand Tutor Luo

779
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,340
can only offer such plans,

780
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,790
you won't be worth

781
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,030
30% of the money.

782
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,790
Do you know how much

783
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,420
30% of the treasury money is?

784
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,950
If you want to get the dividend,

785
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,360
you have to give me something good

786
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,180
and solve this case.

787
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,390
Don't let anyone

788
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,740
continue the investigation.

789
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,870
Minister Lu.

790
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,469
No matter how hasty you are,

791
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,639
you should at least let me finish.

792
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,030
Go ahead.

793
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,429
Killing Liu Chun

794
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
is not important.

795
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,909
What matters is

796
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,239
who's the one to kill Liu Chun.

797
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,870
Somebody!

798
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,120
Serve tea for Grand Tutor Luo.

799
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,210
[Yun]

800
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,090
Your Highness, you are so diligent.

801
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,010
If His Majesty knows about this,

802
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,740
he will be very pleased.

803
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,860
Father would never come

804
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,620
to the Waterside Eastern Palace

805
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,750
to see if I work hard.

806
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,900
He only knows to praise Gu Jiusi

807
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,560
at court for being competent.

808
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,580
Father praised him again for several times

809
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,860
at court these days.

810
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,180
Even his expression was more delighted

811
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,380
when he looked at him.

812
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,980
It's been a long time

813
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,390
since he looked at me

814
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,870
that way.

815
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,580
Gu Jiusi did a great job

816
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,380
investigating the treasury case.

817
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,620
It's understandable that His Majesty appreciates him.

818
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,750
How hard could it be?

819
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,390
If Father entrusted this to me,

820
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,030
I could get it done as well.

821
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,860
Your Highness.

822
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,110
Since you've thought about it,

823
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,700
why don't you investigate it yourself?

824
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,960
His Majesty only cares about the result.

825
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,620
It doesn't matter who does the investigation.

826
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,190
As long as Your Highness

827
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,660
finds some clues

828
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,860
before Gu Jiusi,

829
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,370
His Majesty will definitely see

830
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,460
your heart

831
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,190
and talent, Your Highness.

832
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,030
[Yun]

833
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,060
Why did you write

834
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,920
so many "Sun"s?

835
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,520
[Yun]

836
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,470
You saw it wrong.

837
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,490
That's "Yun".

838
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,980
It's just that his handwriting is ugly.

839
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,590
Yun?

840
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,670
Let me see.

841
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,240
It's really "Yun".

842
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,750
Yun from Ye Yun.

843
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,100
Why did you write Yun?

844
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,990
Nothing.

845
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,020
I just wrote it casually.

846
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,700
If you were just writing casually, why did you write a whole page of it?

847
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,230
Let me explain.

848
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,660
This Yun...

849
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,860
A few days ago,

850
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,900
your sister Ye Yun

851
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,160
taught me how to write.

852
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,930
I wrote "Shen Ming" for a few days.

853
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,790
And now, it's time to write "Yun".

854
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,340
I was just studying.

855
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:38,870
Study...

856
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,750
Why?

857
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,150
When?

858
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,520
Just the two of you?

859
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,470
In the same room?

860
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,510
Get out!

861
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,760
Go make a pot of tea.

862
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,670
Hurry up.

863
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,590
Calm down.

864
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,060
-Give it to me./N-Hurry up.

865
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,900
-Go./N-See?

866
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
He hid it in his inside pocket.

867
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,830
It's good that he's studying hard.

868
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,120
You think too much.

869
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,200
You think too much.

870
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,780
Really?

871
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,300
You definitely think too much.

872
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,100
He's just a bandit. Uneducated.

873
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,880
[Yun]

874
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,510
Isn't it pretty?

875
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,890
[Yun]

876
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,420
[Yun]

877
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,860
Yun'er is not the only one

878
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,220
who can read and write.

879
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,710
Why did he ask Yun'er to teach him?

880
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,890
You are still thinking about it?

881
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,540
If it doesn't work,

882
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,500
I can teach him.

883
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,740
The ledger of the East Treasury

884
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,310
has been thoroughly checked.

885
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,530
[Ledger of No.31 East Treasury]

886
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,780
There are many problems in it,

887
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,960
[May 16th]

888
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,790
but the books are balanced.

889
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,710
They

890
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,480
must have some other ways.

891
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,390
I got it.

892
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,800
It's Shen Ming.

893
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,460
Every time he went to my place to move the ledger,

894
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,460
he's always been fluttering about in there.

895
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,340
So it seems

896
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,220
this guy

897
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,750
has some other intentions.

898
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,780
You seem to have

899
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,230
a grudge against Shen Ming, right?

900
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,190
Shouldn't I?

901
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,700
This is the Notes of Fire of the previous dynasty.

902
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,340
Three years ago,

903
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,060
there was a fire in East Treasury,

904
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,980
from No.16 to No.32.

905
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,690
It's said that only the blackened walls remained after the fire.

906
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,580
That's why the Treasury was moved to

907
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,780
the current address.

908
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,400
Don't you think

909
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,250
the ledger

910
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,700
is too clear and complete?

911
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,180
Right?

912
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,770
Logically,

913
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,940
after the moving and the fire,

914
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,260
there should be some omission and blurs

915
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,260
in the ledger.

916
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,520
But this ledger

917
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,980
is so clear that it seems to be

918
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,640
waiting for someone to check.

919
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,030
I think

920
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,780
Shen Ming is one of us.

921
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,230
It's good if

922
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,470
your sister is with him.

923
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,050
Financial matters should be settled clearly even between brothers.

924
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:31,700
Besides,

925
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,630
women's misfortune

926
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,660
always starts from them getting married.

927
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,420
We are the only two left

928
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,350
in the Ye family.

929
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,420
I can let her be

930
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,260
Miss Ye for a lifetime

931
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,410
effortlessly.

932
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,780
No, wait a minute.

933
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,970
What do you mean "women's misfortune

934
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,700
always starts from them getting married"?

935
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,630
Yuru

936
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,340
is a counter-example, right?

937
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,300
How can Yun'er be the same with Yuru?

938
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,820
Yun'er is still young.

939
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,720
I have to keep an eye on her.

940
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,540
What if she gets coaxed?

941
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,660
I think

942
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,200
you shouldn't meddle in your sister's business.

943
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,060
It's annoying.

944
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,750
If she doesn't like it,

945
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,640
would she let Shen Ming be around her like this?

946
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,180
Enough.

947
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,910
About Shen Ming,

948
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,860
I'll talk to him in a few days.

949
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,260
There was a fire

950
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,340
in such an important place like the Treasury,

951
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,620
but there's no official record about it?

952
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,940
Yes, there is.

953
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,860
According to the censor,

954
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,920
it's hot in summer,

955
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,660
and it's easy for candlesticks to overturn.

956
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,140
It's normal to have a fire.

957
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,870
There was nothing suspicious.

958
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,020
What is the name of

959
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,950
the censor?

960
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,700
Liu Zhe.

961
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,860
After he found nothing suspicious

962
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,690
about the fire,

963
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,260
he handed it over to the Ministry of Revenue.

964
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,100
After that,

965
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,830
a man named Zhou Kai handled it.

966
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,500
Is it this Zhou Kai?

967
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,980
It's traceable.

968
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,620
Dead?

969
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,780
Zhou Kai was a Treasury official.

970
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,530
He retired due to illness three years ago.

971
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,130
And he passed away a year ago.

972
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,740
Since he worked for the Ministry of Revenue for 20 years,

973
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,420
Minister Lu even paid

974
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,950
his family ten taels of silver himself

975
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,340
for the funeral.

976
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,800
What about Liu Zhe?

977
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,180
He retired and returned to his hometown.

978
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,780
He should be able to be found.

979
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,070
The war two years ago

980
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,740
affected his residence.

981
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,310
The village was destroyed.

982
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,580
And he went missing.

983
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,940
There's one more place we can investigate.
