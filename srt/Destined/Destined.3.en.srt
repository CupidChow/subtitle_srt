[Episode 3]

4
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,780
Be of one mind and maintain a harmonious household.

5
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,740
The auspicious time has come. The groom, please.

6
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,500
Master.

7
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,460
You taught me

8
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,500
all my martial arts skills.

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,579
As the saying goes,

10
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,060
"Once a teacher, forever a father."

11
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,740
Your son is in trouble.

12
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,600
You can't just stand by and watch.

13
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,060
Right?

14
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:35,660
Father.

15
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,220
Young Master.

16
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,020
Stop torturing me.

17
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,540
The wedding has started.

18
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,260
You'd better hurry up.

19
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,540
They're forcing me to get married

20
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,620
to a random woman.

21
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,140
How can

22
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,410
my own father do that?

23
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,540
Master has his own reasons for doing this.

24
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,000
What reasons does he have?

25
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,220
He's the master of the family,

26
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,620
so you obey whatever he says.

27
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,340
What if

28
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,260
he wants you to break my legs?

29
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,120
Would you do it?

30
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,620
Seriously?

31
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,900
Master.

32
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,460
Young Master, don't worry.

33
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,380
When you become the head of the Gu family,

34
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,740
and you ask me to break someone's leg,

35
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,700
I'll do it too.

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,300
How long do I have to wait?

37
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,420
Block him.

38
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,900
I'm not wearing it.

39
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,990
Why isn't the groom coming out?

40
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,540
Don't worry. Just wait.

41
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,440
The auspicious time has come.

42
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,730
The groom, please.

43
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,540
Why isn't he here yet?

44
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,820
Did something happen?

45
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,440
Where is the groom?

46
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,300
Are they getting married or not?

47
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,140
What's up with Jiusi?

48
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,580
It's taking him so long to get changed.

49
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,140
Didn't you say he'd be here soon?

50
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,620
I'll go tell him to hurry up.

51
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,550
I'll go with you.

52
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,700
I'd hate to trouble you.

53
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,740
It's no trouble at all.

54
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,460
We should get to the bottom of this.

55
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,060
If Young Master Gu doesn't want to get married,

56
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,500
he might as well return to the Eastern Capital with me

57
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,830
to report to Lord Liang.

58
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,260
Hurry up.

59
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,490
Wait, Sir.

60
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,830
What's going on?

61
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,920
The Liu family is really not up to par.

62
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,780
Maybe the Gu family is having second thoughts.

63
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,300
Having second thoughts?

64
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,630
That can't be possible.

65
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,050
What's going on?

66
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,400
Really?

67
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,270
Wait, Sir.

68
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,280
Sir!

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,130
Wait.

70
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,770
I just

71
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,030
want to see Mr. Gu

72
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,500
and ask him what he means by this.

73
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,100
Why are you trying to stop me?

74
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,580
My son is immature.

75
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,409
It would be bad

76
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,580
if he offends you.

77
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,820
The marriage came abruptly

78
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,840
and he has been behaving evasively and suspiciously.

79
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,310
Is the marriage fake?

80
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,780
It is not

81
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,080
Lord Liang who is waiting for Gu Jiusi,

82
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,970
but His Majesty!

83
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,650
Making up a marriage

84
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,700
to deceive His Majesty

85
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,080
is a crime

86
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,970
that will get your property confiscated and your whole family executed!

87
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,270
Do you know that?

88
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,510
Who said this marriage is fake?

89
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,280
The groom is here.

90
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,350
He's coming.

91
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,880
Take it.

92
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,310
There are stairs ahead. Be careful.

93
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,320
So many people are watching.

94
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,200
If you fall,

95
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,050
you'll embarrass my family.

96
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,670
Lay down the saddle.

97
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,910
May you have fortune, prosperity, and safety.

98
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,310
Place the fans together.

99
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,910
May you live together in harmony.

100
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:30,800
Follow me.

101
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,450
Divide the fans.

102
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,720
May you have abundant offspring.

103
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,520
The bride crosses the saddle.

104
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,690
May you have fortune, prosperity, and safety.

105
00:06:55,159 --> 00:07:00,490
A magpie bridge is built in the heaven, prayers for dexterity in needlework in the mortal world.

106
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,510
A perfect match, divinely ordained, is made.

107
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,570
Obstruct disasters and invite unending blessings.

108
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,330
Upon the first scatter, enter into an everlasting marriage.

109
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,270
Upon the second scatter, have abundant offspring.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,610
Upon the third scatter, remain safe all year.

111
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,820
Upon the fourth scatter, often be reunited.

112
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,650
Upon the fifth scatter, have a son soon.

113
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,310
The bride and groom are here.

114
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,160

115
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,490

♫ The wind makes the moon and my heart flutter ♫

151

Young Master.

152
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,180
The last ferry has left.

153
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,740
I'm afraid we can't get home today.

154
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,540
We can only wait until tomorrow.

155
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,680
You don't have to see me off.

156
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,790
Goodbye.

157
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
Take care.

158
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,330
Apologies for our lack of hospitality.

159
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,020
I've finally gotten rid of him.

160
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,870
I'll go back to my room if there's nothing else.

161
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,840
Stop.

162
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,510
Come here.

163
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,290
One more thing.

164
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,750
What is it?

165
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,140
It's about tonight.

166
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,580
Sleeping?

167
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,040
Lord Liang's emissary hasn't gone far.

168
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,950
If he hears that

169
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,840
you didn't consummate your marriage on your wedding night,

170
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,730
our whole family will get beheaded.

171
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,190
Consummate the marriage?

172
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,730
Hush.

173
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,260
Lower your voice.

174
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,530
Also,

175
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,550
Young Miss Liu is a member of our family now.

176
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,440
If you don't consummate the marriage

177
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,570
and people find out,

178
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,130
everyone in Yangzhou city

179
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,850
will make fun of us.

180
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,670
I thought...

181
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,010
I thought you...

182
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,680
You... What's wrong with you?

183
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,890
You got in trouble, and I'm your scapegoat.

184
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,410
Fine.

185
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,170
Since you've

186
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,510
gotten her to come,

187
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,990
I'll humble myself for one night.

188
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,830
Just this once.

189
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,590
Never again.

190
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,480
How many more times do you want?

191
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,750
How many more times do you want to get married?

192
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,380
What?

193
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,260
The shops on East Street

194
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,520
are under Yuru's name?

195
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,850
Technically speaking,

196
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,540
the betrothal gifts should be left

197
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,670
to Yuru's brothers.

198
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,420
But she doesn't have brothers.

199
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,630
Mrs. Gu, you must be joking.

200
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,520
Yuru has a younger brother.

201
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,990
How can you say that she doesn't?

202
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,040
Right, Mao?

203
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,590
Younger brother?

204
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,040
Did I get it wrong?

205
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,310
My in-law told me

206
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,110
Yuru is her only daughter.

207
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,210
Does she have another child?

208
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,020
I only have Yuru.

209
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,530
I have no other children.

210
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,370
Madam.

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,050
My son, Mao,

212
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,490
is Madam Yue's son.

213
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,170
Master.

214
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,110
The Gu family is one of Yangzhou's reputable families.

215
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,830
We have our rules.

216
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,450
Didn't Madam Yue

217
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,500
say that

218
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,710
Yuru

219
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,010
is the eldest and legitimate daughter of the Liu family?

220
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,400
After all,

221
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,050
they have different statuses.

222
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,350
Yes.

223
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,080
Mrs. Gu is right.

224
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,830
I didn't think it through.

225
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,600
But then again,

226
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,900
even if these stores

227
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,800
don't belong to Mao,

228
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,170
they should be put

229
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,030
under my master's name.

230
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,250
Right, Master?

231
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,610
Madam Yue.

232
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,500
That's not right.

233
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,510
I thought about how, as a businessman,

234
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,110
it must be hard on Master Liu.

235
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,410
It must have been hard for you

236
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,840
to prepare Yuru's dowry too.

237
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,730
So, I left the shops

238
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,660
under Yuru's name

239
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,750
as her dowry.

240
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,700
If I put them

241
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,550
under Master Liu's name,

242
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,610
How much dowry

243
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,780
will your family have to give

244
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,710
to match up to our betrothal gifts?

245
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,360
Besides, this was my son's idea.

246
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,300
Well,

247
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,860
I have a favor to ask you.

248
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,380
Go ahead.

249
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,450
Well...

250
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,270
We've already gotten married.

251
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
Liu Yuru can be considered

252
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,110
half a member of the Gu family.

253
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,110
What do you mean, half?

254
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,660
From now on,

255
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,380
she is a member of the Gu family.

256
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,470
That's not what I meant.

257
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,190
I...

258
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,030
Here's the thing.

259
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,000
There is a duplicitous concubine

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,050
in her family

261
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,900
who has been mean to her since she was young.

262
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,530
The betrothal gifts

263
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,410
will most probably

264
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,920
end up in her hands.

265
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,860
That's why I was thinking...

266
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,610
Understand?

267
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,860
I don't understand.

268
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,470
Can you

269
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,520
leave those betrothal gifts

270
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,290
under Liu Yuru's name?

271
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,840
She likes money.

272
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,860
She can feel at ease this way.

273
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,120
You've really grown up.

274
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,670
You're thoughtful now.

275
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,950
No.

276
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,590
I just can't stand that concubine.

277
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,850
She's too two-faced.

278
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,450
I didn't mean anything else.

279
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,470
Don't worry.

280
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,280
The most valuable betrothal gifts

281
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,880
are the shops on East Street.

282
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,270
I will put them under Yuru's name.

283
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,280
When the title deeds are stamped,

284
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,130
I'll ask Ruixue to send them to you.

285
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,520
Okay.

286
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,450
That's good.

287
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
I really didn't mean anything else.

288
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,870
Alright.

289
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,100
You're embarrassed?

290
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,360
I'm not.

291
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,980
Jiusi likes Yuru.

292
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,110
He wanted to do her a favor.

293
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,800
As parents,

294
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,570
we're happy to see our children are getting along,

295
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,330
right?

296
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,670
Yes.

297
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,110
You're so thoughtful.

298
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,860
Enjoy your meal.

299
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,190
I'll go greet other guests.

300
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,390
[Chunhe Hall]

301
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,750
Young Miss Ye.

302
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,550
Mrs. Gu.

303
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,520
Please come with me.

304
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,940
Master.

305
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,250
What is this?

306
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,470
I'm angry

307
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,770
for the Liu family.

308
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:43,860
Doesn't this mean that

309
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,390
they're giving us nothing?

310
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,560
The Gu family is a big family.

311
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,280
They only have to spare a little

312
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,410
for us to—

313
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,040
Shut up!

314
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,550
You...

315
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,750
Don't you feel ashamed enough?

316
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,400
Mrs. Gu is thoughtful.

317
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,040
Young Master Gu

318
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,839
is considerate towards Yuru too.

319
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,140
He must be sincere.

320
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,460
The most important thing in their marriage

321
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,660
is that their household is harmonious.

322
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,490
We can't lose our dignity

323
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,890
over this little gain.

324
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,119
If we make the Gu family unhappy,

325
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,079
Yuru would have a hard time.

326
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,240
It would be a hindrance

327
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,490
to your business too.

328
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,930
Wan is truly a lady from a noble house.

329
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,070
She has made our family proud.

330
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,370
You should take over

331
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,980
the management of our household.

332
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,100
Yes.

333
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,620
I'm ignorant.

334
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,340
How can I compare

335
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,570
to Eldest Madam?

336
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,430
Since Madam Yue has said so,

337
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,320
it's settled then.

338
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,130
Let's eat.

339
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,090
Yinhong.

340
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,350
You may leave.

341
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,540
Yes.

342
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,840
Yun'er, why are you here?

343
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,200
I was eating in the front yard

344
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,700
when Mrs. Gu came to see me.

345
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,230
She said Young Master Gu was receiving guests in the front yard.

346
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,450
It must be boring

347
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,790
for you to wait here alone,

348
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,600
so she asked me to keep you company.

349
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,730
She's too kind.

350
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,070
I've had my fill of the fun

351
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,350
in the front yard.

352
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,660
Gu Jiusi...

353
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,260
Really?

354
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,320
I heard this myself.

355
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,690
Mrs. Gu said that

356
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,640
leaving the betrothal gifts under your name

357
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,770
was Gu Jiusi's idea.

358
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,030
I didn’t expect

359
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,550
that even though Gu Jiusi

360
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,890
has many flaws,

361
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,070
he's quite thoughtful.

362
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,010
That's much better than my brother.

363
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,410
My brother

364
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,420
only looks nice,

365
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,940
but he only cares

366
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,200
about his studies.

367
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,920
As for my mother,

368
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,430
she can't be

369
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,870
as nice as Mrs. Gu either.

370
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,000
It would be good if she didn't give you trouble.

371
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,290
That said, you're always well behaved.

372
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,650
I don't think she will be able to find any bones to pick.

373
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,440
My brother

374
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,990
is still on his way.

375
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,580
This morning,

376
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,100
the letter he wrote to me arrived.

377
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,700
I secretly wrote to him

378
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,420
saying that Grandmother likes you

379
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,080
to help you test his feelings.

380
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,320
He was very happy.

381
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,870
He replied and said he would marry you.

382
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,610
He said he would leave immediately

383
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,870
to come back to see you.

384
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,110
But

385
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,950
it's still too late.

386
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,470
My brother is traveling day and night.

387
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,500
He doesn't know you've already...

388
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,690
you've already married someone else.

389
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,070
He has a bright future.

390
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,940
He will meet a good match.

391
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,080
Yuru.

392
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,640
We grew up together.

393
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,800
We are closer than blood sisters.

394
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,340
These days,

395
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,600
because of this,

396
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
I've barely slept.

397
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,710
Our family has let you down.

398
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,310
No one is here now.

399
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,950
If you feel sad,

400
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,080
just scold me

401
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,090
and hit me.

402
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,570
Yun'er, don't worry.

403
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,360
I don't blame anyone.

404
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,980
I understand.

405
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,640
So many things have happened these years.

406
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,650
I've made it through

407
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,910
by myself.

408
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,050
When a woman gets married,

409
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,990
it is to serve her in-laws

410
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,930
and take care of her husband and children.

411
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,790
She'll live out her life that way.

412
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,590
Besides...

413
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,870
Besides, Gu Jiusi

414
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,890
is not as bad as I thought.

415
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,440
What?

416
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
Yun'er, don't worry.

417
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,810
I will be fine.

418
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,600
If the world

419
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,410
were fairer to women,

420
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,370
how great would that be?

421
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,500
There isn't

422
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,320
so much fairness in this world.

423
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,920
Young Miss Ye.

424
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,750
Young Master Gu is here.

425
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,620
Gu Jiusi is here.

426
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,500
Yuru, I’m leaving.

427
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,890
It's finally done.

428
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,070
Why are you still up in the middle of the night?

429
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,910
Isn't it tiring

430
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,840
to hold this fan?

431
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,190
My Lord hadn't returned

432
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,780
and the fan removal ritual hadn't been carried out,

433
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,910
so I dared not sleep.

434
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,860
The play is over.

435
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,870
You don't have to pretend anymore.

436
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,020
My Lord,

437
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,250
you haven't had cross-cupped wine with me yet.

438
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,340
You just need to meet with him in private

439
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,080
and disgust him a few times.

440
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,450
His reputation

441
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,710
is bad.

442
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,850
Even if he goes out to accuse you,

443
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,320
others will think

444
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,840
he's slandering you.

445
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,150
Young Miss Liu.

446
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,740
I know you're a

447
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,790
meticulous

448
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,260
and intelligent woman.

449
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,270
So you can't possibly

450
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,770
be serious about wanting to marry me, right?

451
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,280
Actually, I can understand.

452
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,870
I know that

453
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,090
I'm nothing

454
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,650
without my money and good looks.

455
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,160
All the young women in the city

456
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,500
avoid me like the plague.

457
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,640
I don't care.

458
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,690
If I'm by myself,

459
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,830
I'll be happy to fight crickets my whole life.

460
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,470
But if I were to get married,

461
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,820
I'd still hope to marry a girl

462
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,040
I like

463
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,590
and who likes me.

464
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,060
I want to love her with all my heart

465
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,280
for this lifetime

466
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,940
and live with her happily for the rest of my life.

467
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,570
But

468
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,330
neither of us

469
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,800
like the other.

470
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,390
How about this?

471
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,540
Let's pretend we didn't get married

472
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,700
and live our own lives.

473
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,340
If you fall in love with someone,

474
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,770
or if I fall in love with someone,

475
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,770
we'll dissolve the marriage, okay?

476
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,300
Don't worry.

477
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,440
When we dissolve the marriage,

478
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,370
I'll give you...

479
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,390
I'll give you a whole street's worth of shops.

480
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,180
Two streets.

481
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,580
You...

482
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,920
You want to divorce me?

483
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,600
That sounds awful.

484
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
Dissolution. Dissolution.

485
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:24,960
I know.

486
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,930
Women

487
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,950
care about their reputation.

488
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,540
The reason they care about their reputation

489
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,190
is because they want to marry into a good family.

490
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,360
Marrying into a good family

491
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,020
is so they can live a good life.

492
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,980
But if you are capable

493
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,500
and have the money to live a good life,

494
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,800
wouldn't you stop needing to care

495
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,060
about others' gossip?

496
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,470
Just like me.

497
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,900
Is there anyone in Yangzhou city who wouldn't say

498
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,230
I'm ridiculous, a wastrel, and a failure?

499
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,400
Do you think I care?

500
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,990
Today,

501
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,180
we got married.

502
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:05,930
It's okay.

503
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,480
I know this may be

504
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,000
hard to accept right now,

505
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,670
but we have plenty of time.

506
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,760
Take your time to think it over.

507
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,850
When you figure it out,

508
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,320
you'll find that

509
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,090
dissolving this marriage

510
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,430
is an excellent idea.

511
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:24,440
You...

512
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,040
Don't you like Ye Shi'an?

513
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,510
If we dissolve our marriage,

514
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,140
you can

515
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,150
marry Ye Shi'an.

516
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,670
You can say we've been through thick and thin together.

517
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,590
I'll protect you from now on.

518
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,720
If he dares not marry you,

519
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,280
I'll beat him until he does.

520
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,850
Get out!

521
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,700
Get out!

522
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,590
Wait.

523
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,470
You hit me,

524
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,690
but you're crying?

525
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,320
This...

526
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:15,990
Young Miss Liu.

527
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,230
Fairy Liu.

528
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,380
My ancestor.

529
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,980
You must be tired after crying for a long time.

530
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,120
Why don't we eat something delicious?

531
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,910
If you eat something delicious,

532
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,260
you'll feel better.

533
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,410
That's enough.

534
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,630
I have a bad temper.

535
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,560
I

536
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,820
showed you a way out.

537
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,420
How can you be so ungrateful?

538
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,280
You don't want this and you don't want that.

539
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,710
What do you want?

540
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,090
Do you actually like me?

541
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,560
You...

542
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,310
Really?

543
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,830
No.

544
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,310
I was wondering why you would

545
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,070
secretly

546
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,870
praise my talent and character.

547
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,020
It seems my mother was telling the truth.

548
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,790
Liu Yuru.

549
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,190
You do meet

550
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,990
my parents' standard for a good daughter-in-law.

551
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,120
But the girl I like

552
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,800
should be free-spirited

553
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,150
who can go horseback riding, singing,

554
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,950
and traveling the world with me.

555
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,760
You're too obedient.

556
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,690
We are not suitable for each other.

557
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,750
I'm sorry.

558
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,390
I can't give up my life

559
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,820
for your life.

560
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,060
A- Although I can't

561
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,190
give you my heart,

562
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,520
I can give you a carefree life.

563
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,190
Also, my parents are nice.

564
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,590
They will treat you well.

565
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,350
Liu Yuru.

566
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,570
Love is bad for your health.

567
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,620
You need to be forward-looking.

568
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,240
Listen.

569
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,520
As time goes by, you will realize

570
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,120
money is the most important.

571
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,190
You're smart.

572
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,700
I believe one day,

573
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,960
you will grasp this.

574
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,240
Tomorrow...

575
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,860
I'll take you to have fun tomorrow.

576
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,460
After that, you'll find out that

577
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,970
there is no pain

578
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,310
that can't be healed.

579
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,320
If there is,

580
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
it means you haven't had enough fun.

581
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,800
I'll give you

582
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,190
all my money.

583
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,080
I don't want it.

584
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,630
You don't want money?

585
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,480
Jewels?

586
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,700
These are priceless treasures.

587
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,810
I don't want it.

588
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,940
You don't want anything?

589
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,870
You only want me?

590
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,310
I...

591
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,820
Stop crying.

592
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,550
My head hurts from your crying.

593
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,420
Okay, let's just stay here.

594
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,810
What should I do?

595
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,240
Young Madam.

596
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,920
It's time to get up.

597
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,580
Young Madam.

598
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,190
Young Madam, what's wrong?

599
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,410
Why are you still wearing your wedding clothes?

600
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,140
You didn’t consummate your marriage last night?

601
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,220
Where is Young Master?

602
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,590
He jumped out of the window and ran away.

603
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,140
What?

604
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,480
He ran away?

605
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,800
Where did he go?

606
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,360
I don't know.

607
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,330
But Master and Madam

608
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,800
are waiting in the main hall

609
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,680
for you and

610
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,170
Young Master Gu to serve them tea.

611
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,630
If you miss the time...

612
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,250
Tell them I'm sick.

613
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,430
I'm too tired.

614
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,620
Yes.

615
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,640
Liu Yuru is too scary.

616
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,240
Too scary.

617
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,830
She's really too scary.

618
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,050
What's so scary about her?

619
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,330
I've asked around.

620
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,640
Her father was caught by the Maritime Trade Superintendency.

621
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,830
They'll sue him and confiscate his property.

622
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,840
She married you

623
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,600
because your family is powerful

624
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,610
and can help her.

625
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,300
She just wants your family's money.

626
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,100
That's right.

627
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Anyway, she can't do anything to you

628
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,040
because she needs you.

629
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,560
Just think of her as Young Madam Gu

630
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,580
only in name.

631
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,340
Do whatever you like.

632
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,190
You don't understand.

633
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,210
I wish

634
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,000
she were after our money

635
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,680
and power.

636
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,100
I asked yesterday.

637
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,830
That's not what she wants.

638
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,350
What does she want?

639
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,730
She wants me.

640
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,080
She wants to take revenge on you?

641
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,550
That's a lot to sacrifice, isn't it?

642
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:46,770
She likes me.

643
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,190
That's impossible.

644
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,750
Doesn't she like Ye Shi'an?

645
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,340
Yes.

646
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,130
How would I know

647
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,690
why she suddenly fell in love with me?

648
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,290
What does she like about you?

649
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,900
It must have been love at first sight

650
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,300
because of my good looks.

651
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,570
In life,

652
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,440
love is the only thing that can't be forced.

653
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,010
If she wanted wealth,

654
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,970
that'd be easy.

655
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,590
But her being serious about me

656
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,110
is really hard for me.

657
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,960
You have no idea.

658
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,010
She kept crying last night,

659
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:17,590
nonstop.

660
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,790
I stayed up all night.

661
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:19,590
I...

662
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,740
Actually, it's not that complicated.

663
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,090
It's easy for a man

664
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,560
to make a woman give up.

665
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,210
Go to Lanxiao House

666
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,710
and ask some courtesans

667
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,140
to keep you company for three days.

668
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,740
I'm sure she'll give up then.

669
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,200
Why isn't that brat here yet?

670
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,090
Master! Madam!

671
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,400
Bad news!

672
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,679
Young Master... Young Master ran away!

673
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,510
He ran away?

674
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,000
What about Daughter-in-law?

675
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,170
Did she run away?

676
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,360
No.

677
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,630
It's fine as long as Yuru didn't run away.

678
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,310
It's fine if Jiusi does.

679
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,090
Where did he go?

680
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,150
[Lanxiao House]

681
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,500
Here.

682
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,600
Greetings, Young Master Gu.

683
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,580
It’s your first time looking for a courtesan.

684
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,179
Do you have any preferences?

685
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,850
The courtesans here

686
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,440
are well-versed in all the refined hobbies.

687
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,510
They are unbeatable

688
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,060
at all of them.

689
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,250
If you like something special,

690
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,980
I can recommend some.

691
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,960
Really?

692
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,380
Of course.

693
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,150
Young Master?

694
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,370
Let me think.

695
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,640
Do any of you

696
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,170
know how to play leaf cards?

697
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,340
This...

698
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,090
Do you?

699
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,590
Cockfighting works too.

700
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,330
Cockfighting?

701
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,300
This...

702
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,430
Bastard!

703
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,150
In the past,

704
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,500
whenever I went to Lanxiao House with Young Master,

705
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,840
it was only to listen to songs,

706
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,060
nothing else.

707
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,930
It's spread all over the city.

708
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,050
Young Master was different this time.

709
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,100
He spent a fortune

710
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,950
on nine courtesans.

711
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,010
Bring the cane!

712
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,810
Yes.

713
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,200
Master.

714
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,290
Don't stop me!

715
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,350
How could I

716
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,530
not beat him today?

717
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,950
Haven't you beat him enough

718
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,420
since he was a child?

719
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,570
Has it ever worked?

720
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,570
It's different now.

721
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,790
He's a married man.

722
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,430
He should establish his family and career.

723
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,280
I must break his legs today.

724
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,900
Since Jiusi is married,

725
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,830
this is

726
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,230
between him and his wife.

727
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,450
If we interfere,

728
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,040
it will be a mess.

729
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,220
It's easy for you to

730
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,480
bring him back and beat him up.

731
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,200
But what if enmity forms between Jiusi and Yuru

732
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,380
because of this?

733
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,350
What do you think we should do?

734
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,250
In my opinion,

735
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,950
this is not for us to decide.

736
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,690
It depends on Yuru.

737
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,300
Master. Madam.

738
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,650
Young Madam

739
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,950
is not feeling well today,

740
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,880
so she couldn't get up to serve tea.

741
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,810
Young Madam said

742
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,140
this is inappropriate,

743
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,120
so when she feels better,

744
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,660
she'll come immediately

745
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,520
to apologize to Master and Madam.

746
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,730
It's okay.

747
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,080
Since Yuru isn't feeling well,

748
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,130
let her rest.

749
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,040
I'll go take a look.

750
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,580
Yuru.

751
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,940
Forgive my impertinence.

752
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,630
Take a rest.

753
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,540
We don't have so many rules.

754
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,560
Tell me

755
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,960
what's going on

756
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,450
between you and Jiusi?

757
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,170
I didn't want to marry him.

758
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,570
But when I brought it up,

759
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,090
your family said

760
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,770
you praised Jiusi

761
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,240
and you liked him.

762
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,500
How can you believe Madam Yue?

763
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,260
To be honest,

764
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,790
on the day of the Ye's family banquet,

765
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,090
Old Madam Ye had already decided on me.

766
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,320
She even came to propose the marriage.

767
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,600
We were waiting for Young Master Ye to return Yangzhou

768
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,130
so he could officially come to propose marriage and present the betrothal gifts.

769
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,530
Young Master Gu and I

770
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,630
met by chance.

771
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,580
It was a misunderstanding.

772
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,020
There was nothing between us.

773
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,820
You were

774
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,250
supposed to marry into the Ye family?

775
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,990
This is absurd.

776
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,320
It's also our family's fault

777
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,240
for not being meticulous enough

778
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,370
and failing to understand the whole situation.

779
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,750
I must

780
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,140
apologize to you for this.

781
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,940
My marriage into the Ye family

782
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,520
had no clear path.

783
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,790
The private affairs of my household aren't important enough

784
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,190
to be known by outsiders.

785
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,920
It's not the Gu family's fault.

786
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,180
I can't accept

787
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,860
your apology.

788
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,150
What’s your plan

789
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,120
now that it has become like this?

790
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,450
What else can I do?

791
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,110
A woman's marriage

792
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,950
is the order of her parents

793
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,390
and the matchmaker.

794
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,410
Since I've married into the Gu family,

795
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,820
I thought I could

796
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,850
spend my life with Young Master Gu,

797
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,200
no matter what the future held.

798
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
But Young Master Gu didn't think so.

799
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,220
He told me yesterday

800
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,330
that he would meet someone he really likes

801
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,550
in the future

802
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,190
whom he will treat well,

803
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,640
so he will divorce me sooner or later.

804
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,810
Jiusi did say this before.

805
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,320
He wants to find

806
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,850
a girl with whom he is wholeheartedly in love.

807
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,250
In love, he is pure and sincere,

808
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,810
moreso than most men.

809
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,510
It's just that if this purity and sincerity

810
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,560
aren't directed towards me,

811
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,580
they're as good as poison.

812
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,050
I had accepted my fate.

813
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,020
Since I married him,

814
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,440
I didn't expect much from him.

815
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,350
But he must at least

816
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,520
let us live our life.

817
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,840
On his wedding night,

818
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,570
he said he wanted to divorce me.

819
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,790
Now, he's gone.

820
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,240
He's forcing me to die.

821
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,250
Yuru.

822
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,600
Do you want us

823
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,150
to help you find him?

824
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,050
No.

825
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,970
He can go wherever he wants.

826
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,850
He can do whatever he wants.

827
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,620
Let him be.

828
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,220
He

829
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,820
already dislikes me.

830
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
I have no hope for the rest of my life.

831
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,830
I only beg of you

832
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,520
to take care of Mother for me.

833
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,510
From tomorrow onward, I'll go to the Buddhist hall

834
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,200
to copy scriptures and pray for you every day.

835
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,860
What a good child.

836
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,640
Don't be afraid.

837
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,650
Whether it's a coincidence

838
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,270
or a joke,

839
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,110
since the Gu family has

840
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,630
accepted you into our family,

841
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,130
you are now

842
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,730
our legitimate Young Madam.

843
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,190
No one is allowed to treat you badly.

844
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,100
Good girl.

845
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,870
I know how hard it is for you.

846
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,020
Just cry.

847
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,370
When you're done crying,

848
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,830
you have to stand up again.

849
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,100
If you lock yourself in your room

850
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,500
for the rest of your life,

851
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
then your life would really be over.

852
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,820
I don't know.

853
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:57,920
I can't

854
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,980
go on anymore.

855
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,600
The weather is great today.

856
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:10,980
Why don't you

857
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,200
go to the shop with me

858
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,710
to lighten up?
