Manager Ma of the timber yard

5
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,979
has recently been promoted and lacks experience.

The other cunning ones

7
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,900
might really want to prevail over you,

8
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,830
but he might not.

9
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,340
What he wants most now is  backer.

10
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,539
You just need to avoid others

11
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,060
and win him over in private,

12
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,720
he will come to you naturally.

13
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,020
Young Madam.

14
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,300
It was all because the servant who reported the day before yesterday

15
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,500
didn't make it clear.

16
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,139
If I had known

17
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,600
it was you who summoned me,

18
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,660
I-I would have found time to meet you

19
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,100
even if I didn't sleep.

20
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,020
The son of Manager Xue,

21
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,020
who works in the raw silk shop, Xue Mancai,

22
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,620
is the assistant in the shop.

23
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,420
He still owes me 80 taels of gambling debt,

24
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,680
and he can't afford it.

25
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,740
He doesn't dare to tell his father about it.

26
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,860
If Manager Xue is so arrogant,

27
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,260
why don't you go to his son

28
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,060
and mention a bit about the gambling debt?

29
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,520
I guarantee he'll solve everything for you.

30
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,420
Young Madam,

31
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,380
just let me know if there's anything I can do for you.

32
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,140
I promise I'll get it all done.

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,800
is a respectable elderly man.

35
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,300
If he didn't come to see you,

36
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,760
he might really be tied up.

37
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,340
So you should humbly pay him a visit

38
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,100
and treat him with the greatest courtesy.

39
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,300
When he's available,

40
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,340
he will surely tell you everything he knows

41
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,800
and make all-out efforts.

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,100
so they don't take me seriously.

70

Mr. Zhu wrote a letter to me.

107

Could it be that Jiusi

108

caused trouble in the academy again?

109

for him to make trouble.

111
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,940
You're right.

112
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,050
If so, it must be Mr. Zhu despised him for being stubborn

113
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,850
and wanted to quit teaching him.

114
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,980
Mr. Zhu wrote a letter to praise him.

115
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,140
He said he's been studying hard lately

116
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,460
and has improved in leaps and bounds.

117
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,990
He made a spurt of progress.

118
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,380
Just like a different person.

I beg your pardon for my rudeness.

163
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,400
if I've brought my personal seal.

164

I'm just curious about

171
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,480
why you changed your mind.

172
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,340
Generally speaking, no one else except the Gu Business

173
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,270
has such a bulk-purchasing power.

174
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,740
That's true.

175
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,100
But yesterday,

176
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
a businessman did bring me a sample.

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,220
Moreover,

178
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,820
the price of the goods

179
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,300
is 25% lower than yours.

180

Also,

181
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,680
he promised to deliver the goods one month earlier.

182
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,660
It surprises me that there's such a competent merchant

190
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,870
because the Gu family is trustworthy.

191
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,580
But Youzhou is infertile

192
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,240
and lacks financial support.

193
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,020
I can only wait and see.

194
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,260
So we have to postpone

195
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,820
the contract signing.

196
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,940
Young Madam,

197
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,420
I broke my promise first.

198
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,320
I feel ashamed about it.

199
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,990
It's nothing, Mr. Zhou.

200
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,960
Business is business.

201
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,910
That's how it should be.

202
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,740
Mr. Zhou came all the way

203
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,660
to Yangzhou.

204
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,140
I hope

205
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,330
you can return with satisfaction.

[Money Helps the World]

207
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,510
Thank you, Young Madam.

208
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,140
I'll take my leave first.

209
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,260
Sorry.

210
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,270
By the way, Mr. Zhou,

211
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,340
may I know

212
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,200
who the businessman you are contacting?

213
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,540
Luo Zishang?

214
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,700
Who is it?

215
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,340
I've never heard of him.

216
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,700
Anyway, this guy

217
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,380
has undercut

218
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,220
Young Madam.

219
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,260
So Young Madam will not

220
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
come to join the celebration party.

221
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:02,980
How is she?

222
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,940

223
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,340
since this morning,

224
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,900
Young Madam had been racking her brains

225
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,020
in her room alone.

226
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,560
I guess she's thinking of a solution.

Young Madam.

232

A man addressed himself as Mr. Luo

233
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,640
sent an invitation

234
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,760
to invite you to Cuiming Restaurant.

You're finally joining us.

240
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,180
Nowadays, it's so hard

241
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,900
to meet you

242
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,700
outside the academy.

243

By the way, what trick

244
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,860
did you use today

245
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,700
to escape from that domineering woman?

246
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,620
What do you mean by that domineering woman?

247
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
I'm here

248
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,180
to ask you

249
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,220
to gather information about someone.

250
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,940
I've never heard

251
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,380
the name of this man.

252
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,140
I wonder if you have any idea.

253
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,870
-Who?
-Who is that mysterious?

254
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,380
Luo Zishang.

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,140
Why are you laughing?

256
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,000
Do you know him?

257

Jiusi.

258
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,020
Looks like you've been locked up for too long.

259
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,960
You don't even know what's going on outside.

260
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,180
Do you know

261
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,420
during the time

262
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,700
you were away from the outside world,

263
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,830
the title of the number one playboy

264
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,380
in Yangzhou City

265
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,100
has been taken away by someone else?

266
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,960
Guess who he is.

267
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,020
It's Luo Zishang.

268
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,820
Exactly.

269
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,340
What do you know about him?

270
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,540
Boss Liu, nice to meet you.

271
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,990
Mr. Luo.

272
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,100
Please.

273
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,060
I wonder if you are mad at me.

274
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,580
The business world is like a battlefield.

275
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,980
You have misunderstood me

276
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,060
for being petty.

277
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,140
That's good.

278
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,100
If I lose the chance

279
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,020
of making friends with you

280
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,420
because of a transaction,

281
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,340
it'll be a pity.

282
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,420
This is a pair of Moon-shaped Stones

283
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,480
I brought back from the Lion Kingdom.

284
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,940
Many shipwrecks happened this year.

285
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,780
There's only one pair of these in the entire Yangzhou.

286
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,100
I would like to give them to you

287
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,500
so that you can turn them into a pair of earrings.

288
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
It's just a little something to express my gratitude.

289
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,430
Businessmen are open to everyone.

290
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
We treat all the passers-by as our guests.

291
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,420
Once we sit down and have some tea,

292
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,750
we are already friends.

293
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,150
There's no need to make friends intentionally.

294
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,500
The tea is good.

295
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,320
But it is now out of season,

296
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,580
so its fragrance is of less perfection.

297
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,980
You came to visit me all of a sudden.

298
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,440
Is there any advice for me?

299
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,500
I dare not to give you advice.

300
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,250
I'm here

301
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,620
to offer you a partnership.

302
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,180
If we keep competing,

303
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,360
no matter who wins,

304
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,700
the winner will only gain a Pyrrhic victory.

305
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,740
If we lower the price,

306
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,060
the buyers will gain the profit

307
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,190
but not the sellers.

308
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,010
I never do

309
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,100
such an arduous but fruitless thing.

310
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,380
Do you mean

311
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,340
you want to take the order

312
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,580
from Mr. Zhou from Youzhou

313
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,180
together with the Gu family?

314
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,220
No.

315
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,020
I don't want to cooperate with the Gu family.

316
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,880
I only want to cooperate with you.

317
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,060
Me?

318
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,180
That's right.

319
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,980
Instead of letting the Gu family make money,

320
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,380
it's better for you to earn it for yourself.

321
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,580
If the Gu family withdraws itself from the competition

322
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,860
and I get the order,

323
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,340
Mr. Zhou

324
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,220
from Youzhou

325
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,070
can only sell goods from me.

326
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,860
By then, I will quote him a higher price.

327
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,780
After receiving the money,

328
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,510
I'll transfer 30% of the profit

329
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,580
to you

330
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,200
from my personal account.

331
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,220
Mr. Luo,

332
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,580
are you abetting me to reap without sowing

333
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,910
and to betray my family?

334
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,020
Boss Liu, your words are inappropriate.

335
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,750
It's just taking the advantage

336
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,780
and planning for ourselves.

337
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,420
Aren't you always

338
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,380
good at this?

339
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,180
30% of the profit

340
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,830
is at least ten thousand silver taels.

341
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,670
Although I am not a male,

342
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,020
I've read some classic literature.

343
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
I value loyalty and righteousness.

344
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,180
Betraying my employer is disloyal.

345
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,900
Disappointing the elders is unfilial.

346
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,980
Raising the price to deceive the customers is not benevolent.

347
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,860
Lying to my husband is dishonest.

348
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,580
To be such disloyal and unfilial,

349
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,310
not benevolent and dishonest,

350
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,300
let alone 10,000 taels of silver,

351
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,830
even a million taels of gold

352
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,440
won't bend me to your will.

353
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,940
Yinhong, let's go.

354
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,340
Liu Yuru,

355
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,900
the eldest daughter of the Liu family which owns a cloth shop.

356
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,980
Your father is Liu Xuan.

357
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,500
He came from an ordinary family.

358
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,700
Your mother is Su Wan.

359
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,940
She is a daughter of a noble family in Jiangning.

360
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,780
Unfortunately, when you were five,

361
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,700
a fire

362
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,780
almost killed

363
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,310
all the men of the Su family.

364
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,740
The Su family has waned because of that.

365
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,580
After that,

366
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,300
your mother suffered from grief and fell sick.

367
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,940
After your father

368
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,140
saw your mother's backer had been gone,

369
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,760
he disregarded your mother and only adored his concubine.

370
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,820
All these years,

371
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,580
you've suffered a lot, haven't you?

372
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,580
I'm sorry to trouble you

373
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,510
for what happened to my family in the past.

374
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,060
In the past?

375
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,819
Fine.

376
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,579
Then, I'll tell you

377
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,310
some new interesting stories.

378
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,550
In terms of being calculative,

379
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,140
I dare not

380
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,859
to play tricks in front of you.

381
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,579
Even if you're just a daughter of a cloth merchant,

382
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,240
with that family background,

383
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,700
you almost married

384
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,619
the man all the noble ladies in  Yangzhou

385
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,700
wanted to marry

386
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
but couldn't,

387
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,140
Ye Shi'an.

388
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
Nonsense!

389
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,860
Boss Liu.

390
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,420
Don't panic.

391
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,440
There are only you and me here.

392
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,860
Your maid, Yinhong,

393
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,810
is also your dowry trusted aide.

394
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,580
Don't worry.

395
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,340
Others can't hear us.

396
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,680
What are you trying to say?

397
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,620
How did you marry into the Gu family?

398
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,080
You know clearly about it.

399
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,380
Whether the title of Young Madam Gu

400
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,240
is worthy or not

401
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,020
depends on how the Gu family treats you.

402
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
He can indulge you to run a business.

403
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,460
He can also take over your power

404
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,790
and cut off your wealth,

405
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,630
and you will live

406
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,820
a miserable life

407
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,500
like your mother.

408
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,260
You work so hard

409
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,940
just to earn more money

410
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,710
in case Gu Jiusi

411
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,340
falls in love with someone else

412
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,500
and disregards you.

413
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,820
Since you're now in charge of the family business,

414
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,980
you should try to get more money

415
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,090
and hold it in your hands.

416
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,040
You're a smart one.

417
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,180
Boss Liu.

418
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,420
I'll wait for your good news.

419
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,740
Stop there!

420
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,010
Can you

421
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,340
cut to the chase?

422
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,820
Aren't we sharing the important details with you?

423
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,340
Yes.

424
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,220
You've been talking for so long

425
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,910
about

426
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,780
how he gained the attention of the prostitutes.

427
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,540
And about he saw flying raccoons

428
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,020
and grey cows taller than the buildings.

429
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,340
What nonsense is this?

430
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,780
That's not what I want to know.

431
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,880
Then, what do you want to know?

432
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,300
I want to know where he came from,

433
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,500
what his financial status is like, and when he started his business.

434
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,180
And what kind of business he usually does,

435
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,060
what means he usually exerts,

436
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,420
and how many close kins

437
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,900
and relatives he has.

438
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,830
I need to know everything clearly.

439
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,020
Jiusi.

440
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,460
Why are you asking about all of these?

441
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,720
None of your business.

442
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,140
Just tell me if you can help me or not.

443
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,060
We are brothers.

444
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,940
Since you asked for my help,

445
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,140
leave it to me.

446
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,820
Actually,

447
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,940
Luo Zishang is indeed high-profile.

448
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,420
If the three of us

449
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,900
skip school and ask around,

450
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,940
within three days,

451
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,200
we can get all the information about him.

452
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,420
You two are skipping school.

453
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,420
Don't involve me.

454
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,140
Now, it's a rare chance that

455
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,180
no one will keep watch on you.

456
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,040
Yet you still want to go to school?

457
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,390
I want to be a Jieyuan in the future.

458
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,100
Unlike you.

459
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,740
See you. I'm now going to school.

460
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,900
Mr. Luo,

461
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,500
you're indeed not an ordinary person.

462
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,660
You're perceptive and eloquent.

463
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,500
Your words

464
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,420
almost convinced me.

465
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,500
Unfortunately, you misunderstood one thing.

466
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,580
My husband, Gu Jiusi,

467
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,280
is different from others.

468
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,420
He is pure and sincere in love.

469
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,900
Pure and sincere?

470
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,020
Since ancient times, most men are unfaithful.

471
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,580
I travelled around the world,

472
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,380
and I know people change easily.

473
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,860
Gu Jiusi is like this.

474
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,260
So am I.

475
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,660
He likes you now.

476
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,660
How could you believe

477
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,300
a man's oaths

478
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
and vows of being together forever?

479
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,260
Boss Liu,

480
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,260
I thought you were smart.

481
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,510
You're wrong.

482
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,420
He never made

483
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,220
an oath to me,

484
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,640
let alone the vows of undying love.

485
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,380
You are well informed.

486
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,980
But I'm afraid you don't know

487
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,560
the perfect match in his heart

488
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,460
is not me.

489
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,500
If he didn't like you,

490
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,580
how would he allow you to make a scene in the brothel

491
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,700
and humiliate him?

492
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,580
If he didn't like you,

493
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,340
why wouldn't he divorce you

494
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,200
instead of studying hard for you?

495
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,700
If he didn't like you,

496
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,780
why would he change his attitude

497
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,300
and get rid of all his bad habits?

498
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,760
You don't understand him.

499
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,710
He treats me well

500
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,820
because he is benevolent,

501
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,700
faithful,

502
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,660
and sincere.

503
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,020
I think you don't understand men.

504
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,500
I told you

505
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,860
he is different from others.

506
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,780
Even if you travel all over the world,

507
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,540
you can't find

508
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,580
someone like him.

509
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,020
He is pure and sincere in love.

510
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,500
Even if his love

511
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,020
doesn't belong to me,

512
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,660
he will respect me

513
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
and treat me well.

514
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,140
Even if one day

515
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,900
he wants to divorce me,

516
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,980
he will also respect me

517
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
and treat me well.

518
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,300
I don't believe

519
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,700
he would be loyal to me forever.

520
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,580
I don't even expect

521
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,540
he likes me.

522
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,380
But I'm already satisfied

523
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,140
to befriend him

524
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,900
in the name of husband and wife.

525
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,580
It was a godsent marriage to me.

526
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,390
Mr. Luo,

527
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
please remember,

528
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,900
I will never betray the Gu family

529
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,660
and Gu Jiusi.

530
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,060
Do you know

531
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,230
why the Gu family was so eager to marry you?

532
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,430
Haven't you ever suspected

533
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,300
why a noble family like the Gu family

534
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,260
would simply marry

535
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,390
an ordinary girl

536
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,650
just because of a joke?

537
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,140
Don't you

538
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,020
want to know why?

539
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,740
Today,

540
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,100
I've talked enough with you.

541
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,880
Yinhong, let's go.

542
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,500
Gu Jiusi.

543
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,620
Why do the best things in the world

544
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,220
always belong to you?

545
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,180
I know

546
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,220
the Luo Business is pressing you.

547
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,900
Today, they also invited you

548
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,100
to sign an agreement.

549
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,980
But I came in time.

550
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,540
I still want to ask you

551
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,870
to take a look at the samples of the Gu Shop.

552
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,740
I don't doubt the quality

553
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,580
of the Gu Shop's samples.

554
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,510
The quality is definitely top.

555
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,700
But is there any leeway

556
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,110
to discuss the price

557
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,540
and the delivery date

558
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,980
of the goods?

559
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,500
Mr. Zhou.

560
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,940
To be frank with you,

561
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
there are few profits for me to make.

562
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
I can offer you a 15% discount again.

563
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,380
But the delivery date

564
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,940
can't be advanced.

565
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,700
The price

566
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,190
which the Luo Business charged me

567
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,520
is 20% lower than yours.

568
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,100
Its delivery date

569
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,160
is also one month earlier than yours.

570
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,020
Judging from what you said,

571
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,260
should I

572
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,620
choose the Luo Business?

573
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,180
No.

574
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,110
Please look carefully.

575
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,140
The comforter is made of rough cloth

576
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,620
and is filled with duck down.

577
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,900
It can also resist sandstorms in the north.

578
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,940
It's lighter than ordinary cotton.

579
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,220
It can be folded quickly at any time.

580
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,910
Although the price is high,

581
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,750
it's the best choice for troops who have to march for a long time.

582
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,380
Look at these clothes, shoes, and socks.

583
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,180
They are all made of rough cloth.

584
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,220
A special method was used to weave the cloth,

585
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,340
so it's more solid and durable

586
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,540
than ordinary cloth.

587
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,640
They were dyed dark green and dark brown.

588
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,540
If people wear them, they can walk in mountains or wildernesses

589
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,220
without attracting attention.

590
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,300
They've also been soaked in the herbs which repel insects.

591
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,740
They can prevent not only snakes and insects

592
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,400
but also mould and pandemics.

593
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,540
This step

594
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,780
takes one month.

595
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,400
The time can't be reduced.

596
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,290
The leather had been soaked until it became soft.

597
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,020
It can be decorated with copper and iron.

598
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,340
It can also be worn without any other clothes.

599
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,500
It's soft enough to prevent your skin from being rubbed on.

600
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
It's solid enough

601
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,740
to resist sand, stones, and weapons.

602
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,910
These days,

603
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,800
I've been inspecting many shops.

604
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,140
I was thinking

605
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,180
about your order.

606
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,780
The specification of the comforters, the leather, and the rhino horns

607
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,980
are the same.

608
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,260
The size and the number of

609
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,700
the clothes, the shoes, and the socks

610
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
are not ordinary.

611
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,260
It's strong young men's size.

612
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
I couldn't help thinking about it.

613
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,700
Although you said you're a boss,

614
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
I know you are not a businessman,

615
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,380
but an officer in the armed forces.

616
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,540
You came here to prepare military supplies

617
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,900
for the Youzhou Army.

618
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,980
No wonder Mrs. Gu values you.

619
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,380
You're knowledgeable and meticulous.

620
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,350
Let's sit and talk.

621
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,870
Please.

622
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,820
The military supplies

623
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,910
have always been purchased by the court.

624
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,580
I shouldn't have said it,

625
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,480
but business is business.

626
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,940
If I hadn't explained in detail,

627
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,620
all my efforts

628
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,990
would have been in vain.

629
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,580
You spoke your mind.

630
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,900
You're indeed straightforward.

631
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,290
Since you said so,

632
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,300
let me tell you more truth.

633
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,180
Go on.

634
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,820
I didn't understand

635
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,180
your order

636
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,940
at first.

637
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,900
Your order is very demanding.

638
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,820
Even the clothes have to be eight feet long.

639
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,710
It's so demanding.

640
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,300
You also want a low price and a short timescale.

641
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,180
What's more,

642
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,140
you want to supervise and inspect our work every day.

643
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,580
You also want to pay for the goods in instalments.

644
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,340
Even the old manager

645
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,380
who has been working in our family for many years

646
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,460
said

647
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,740
he had never seen

648
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,670
such a demanding customer before.

649
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,280
But when someone helped me

650
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,340
to figure it out,

651
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,900
I really

652
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,740
admire you now.

653
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,900
This business is so hard.

654
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,500
He demanded a lower price.

655
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,960
He also has many requests.

656
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,060
Mr. Zhou

657
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,180
is really greedy.

658
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,180
Let me see.

659
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,540
Mr. Zhou

660
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,140
may be different from what you think.

661
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,180
You misunderstood him.

662
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,540
You're defending him?

663
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,660
This business is about military supplies,

664
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,220
right?

665
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,860
Yes.

666
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,460
Confucius said,

667
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,420
"To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity;

668
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,540
economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons."

669
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,380
You were also educated.

670
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,980
Do you remember this remark?

671
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,980
Yes.

672
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,660
It means that when a man governs a country, he should be cautious

673
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,780
and tax-saving.

674
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,700
When he needs people to work for him for free,

675
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,300
he has to find a proper time

676
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,420
and avoid the time when people have to farm.

677
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,080
He should protect the people.

678
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,920
Take a look at this order again.

679
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,590
To rule a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and sincerity;

680
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,660
economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the employment of the people at the proper seasons.

681
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,020
You have many requests.

682
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,740
It's because you care about every soldier.

683
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,100
You budget carefully.

684
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,980
It's because you're responsible for every tax.

685
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,910
You want to make every penny count.

686
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,740
It shows that you care about the soldiers

687
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,810
and the people.

688
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,380
I'm flattered.

689
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,420
You think highly of Mr. Zhou.

690
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,420
You're too modest, Mr. Zhou.

691
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,460
Youzhou borders Darong.

692
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,060
Because the soldiers of Youzhou

693
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,500
have been guarding the border for years

694
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,820
and have been protecting Darong,

695
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,880
Yangzhou can be prosperous and safe.

696
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,140
Although I come from

697
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,540
a family of businessmen,

698
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,380
I understand these principles.

699
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,740
To be honest,

700
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,820
after giving you a 20% discount,

701
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,430
there's no profit for me to make.

702
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,300
The reason why I want you to choose us

703
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,990
is that I want to do something for the soldiers

704
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,190
who guard the border.

705
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,430
You're indeed upstanding.

706
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,900
I'm very grateful.

707
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,820
But if you made no profit,

708
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,900
I would feel guilty.

709
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,860
You don't have to

710
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,060
think of me as a saint.

711
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,660
Businessmen pursue profits.

712
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
I'm no exception.

713
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,680
Although I can't make profits this time,

714
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,740
the Gu family

715
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,460
can make friends with you.

716
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
We want you

717
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,700
to help us do business in Youzhou.

718
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,540
You can introduce

719
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,000
some rich customers to us.

720
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,350
There will be ample time ahead.

721
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,480
We'll make profits.

722
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,540
OK.

723
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,100
Mr. Zhou.

724
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,660
At noon tomorrow,

725
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,860
I'll wait for you at a private room named Tian

726
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,190
in Cuiming Restaurant.

727
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,980
If you want to sign an agreement

728
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,950
with the Gu family,

729
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,550
you can come there to find me.

730
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,740
Even if you didn't choose us this time,

731
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,870
when there's a chance of cooperation,

732
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,820
I would definitely welcome you.

733
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,030
Thank you, Boss Liu.

734
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:24,910
Look.

735
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,320
The goods of the Gu family are really something.

736
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,660
Mrs. Gu is capable.

737
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,460
Boss Liu is upstanding.

738
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,820
And she has guessed

739
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,410
what I'm thinking.

740
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,670
Yes.

741
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,900
I underestimated

742
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,500
Young Madam before.

743
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,940
What she has said and done these days

744
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,620
is really impressive.

745
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,030
[Gu Mansion]

746
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,620
Do you know

747
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,300
why the Gu family was eager to let you marry into their family?

748
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,900
Haven't you ever doubted it?

749
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,740
Why did a noble family like the Gu family

750
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,660
let the daughter of a businessman who sells cloth

751
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,380
marry into their family

752
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,640
just because of a joke?

753
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,180
Don't you

754
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,980
want to know the reason?

755
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,420
My Lord.

756
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,500
I want to ask you a question.

757
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Can you answer it honestly?

758
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,180
Sure. Go on.

759
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,310
Young Madam.

760
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,060
The person who went to fish for information is back.

761
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,950
What did he say?

762
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,380
Mr. Zhou

763
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,940
didn't leave the inn this afternoon.

764
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,660
He didn't go to the Luo Business

765
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,260
to sign an agreement either.

766
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,140
He didn't keep the appointment.

767
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,260
I have more chances

768
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,590
of seeing him tomorrow.

769
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,020
Ten to one this business will be a success.

770
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,860
You've got the upper hand.

771
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,060
Let's be happy first.

772
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,160
Now is not the time to be happy.

773
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,740
We'll know the result

774
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,940
tomorrow noon.

775
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,300
Okay.

776
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,220
We succeeded.

777
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,030
By the way, what are you going to ask me?

778
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,420
Nothing.

779
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,940
We succeeded.

780
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,980
Yuru

781
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,100
has been working so hard

782
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,760
for this business these days.

783
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,700
She doesn't even have time to have lunch.

784
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,500
Exactly.

785
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,780
Mom, whether this business succeeds or not,

786
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,660
you should praise her.

787
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,820
Of course.

788
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,420
Look at Yuru.

789
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,340
She's working so hard.

790
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,740
Look at you.

791
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,960
All you know is eating.

792
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,530
You didn't miss any meals.

793
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,740
Gu Langhua.

794
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,270
Is this how you talk to

795
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,020
the future Jieyuan who will rank first

796
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,500
in the Provincial Examination?

797
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,380
I've been studying hard every day.

798
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,020
If I didn't

799
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,300
respect you,

800
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,760
I wouldn't eat with you.

801
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,020
Because Mr. Zhu praised you once,

802
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,540
you got carried away?

803
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
Do you still know your surname is Gu?

804
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,020
Enough.

805
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,680
What are you talking about?

806
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,940
Jiusi.

807
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,420
Good. You're ambitious.

808
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,940
Besides,

809
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,180
I mapped out strategies

810
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,260
for my wife.

811
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,620
I also helped her

812
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,180
to know her opponent

813
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,420
in this competition.

814
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,670
Great!

815
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,640
I also went to investigate the opponent.

816
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,420
He is the one

817
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,190
who tried to compete with my wife for the order.

818
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,940
Luo Zishang.

819
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,940
Luo Zishang.

820
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,140
I've heard about him.

821
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,300
His business keeps developing.

822
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,580
Although Luo Zishang

823
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,700
acts in a direct way,

824
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,020
it's hard to find out

825
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,380
important information about him.

826
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,420
I only heard

827
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,910
that he was born into the Luo family in Jinling.

828
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,540
It used to be a famous family.

829
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,060
In that fire,

830
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,900
the entire Luo family was killed.

831
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,500
He was the only one who escaped.

832
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,150
Later, he began to do business around the world.

833
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,780
He has also been to Southeast Asia and Western Regions.

834
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,780
He's a tough guy.

835
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,310
He's really something.

836
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,659
No wonder Yuru is so nervous.

837
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,820
[Wang Mansion]

838
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:27,020
Stop hitting him, Mr. Wang.

839
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,900
I'm begging for mercy.

840
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,659
Let my husband go.

841
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,980
Stop hitting him.

842
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,179
I... I agreed.

843
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,070
I'm willing to be your concubine.

844
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,739
I'm willing.

845
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,670
Stop hitting him. I'm begging you.

846
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,600
You thought it through?

847
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,430
Honey!

848
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,460
Let go of me!

849
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,660
Why?

850
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,180
Mr. Wang.

851
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,740
Didn't I agree?

852
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,860
Why?

853
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,790
You've already become my woman.

854
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,860
Why do you still care about

855
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,500
his life?

856
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,100
Let go of me!

857
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Wang Rong.

858
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,780
You killed my husband.

859
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,620
People who snatch other people's wives will be cursed.

860
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,150
You'll die a painful death!

861
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,820
Let go of me!

862
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,660
Kill me if you dare!

863
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,900
Otherwise, even if I became a ghost,

864
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,380
I wouldn't let you go.

865
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,910
Take her to her room

866
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,660
and teach her the rules.

867
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,900
Let go of me!

868
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,180
Wang Rong, you'll die a painful death!

869
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,120
Sixth Young Master, the commissioner wants to see you.

870
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,820
Are you giving up Mr. Zhou's order?

871
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,660
Yes.

872
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,900
[Commissioner of Yangzhou, Wang Shanquan]

873
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,260
You told me before

874
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
this order is about Youzhou's military supplies.

875
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,060
As long as we get this order,

876
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,020
we can know more information

877
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,080
about Youzhou's military supplies.

878
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,260
That's right.

879
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,580
We're now at a slight disadvantage

880
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,380
in the competition with the Gu family.

881
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,300
But as long as

882
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,870
they don't sign an agreement,

883
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,350
everything can be turned around.

884
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,500
We can continue to negotiate

885
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,780
with Zhou tomorrow.

886
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,700
Why are you giving up?

887
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,140
This order

888
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,740
doesn't matter anymore.

889
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,660
The rock of the Gu family

890
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,960
is going to lose power.

891
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,340
It's not a trivial matter.

892
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,780
Is the news true?

893
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,870
Within ten days,

894
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,820
the news

895
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,720
will be spread all over Yangzhou.

896
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,430
Commissioner Wang.

897
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,580
Knowing the news

898
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,790
ten days in advance

899
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,950
is advantageous

900
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,100
to you.

901
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,500
Mr. Luo,

902
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,700
who on earth are you?

903
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,100
You're not

904
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,980
an ordinary businessman.

905
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,140
Otherwise, how could you foresee

906
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,720
the emperor's decisions?

907
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,430
You're so resourceful.

908
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,340
You help me for no reason.

909
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,460
How can I repay you?

910
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,180
In this world,

911
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,820
no one helps others for no reason.

912
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,780
The reason why I cooperate with you

913
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,180
is that I want something.

914
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,750
What do you want?

915
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,380
The Gu family is as rich as the country.

916
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,360
You must have been jealous

917
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,660
for a long time.

918
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,710
With my help,

919
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,500
you can have

920
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,160
all the Gu family's property.

921
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,140
As for me,

922
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,320
I want 30% of the property.

923
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,700
30%?

924
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,260
Okay.

925
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,580
Well...

926
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,720
There's one more thing

927
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,160
which is more important than 30% of the property.

928
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,260
I hope you can agree.

929
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,860
What's it?

930
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,350
I want the Gu family

931
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,580
to be destroyed,

932
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,390

00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,820
lose everything

935
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,310

00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,500
What if he doesn't come?

946
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,100
I'll come if he doesn't come.

947
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,070
What's the use of having you there?

948
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,100
My goodness!

949
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,180
Go to sleep.

950
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,700
Recharge your batteries.

951
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,300
Trust me.

952
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,590
He will come tomorrow.

953
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,660
Really?

954
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,860
Young Madam, Mr. Zhou is here.

955
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,220
Boss Liu.

956
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,300
Mr. Zhou.

957
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,610
[Wanjuan Pavilion]

958
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,890
[Money Helps the World]

959
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,060
Hurry up.

960
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,840
It's your turn.

961
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,660
Finish it quickly.

962
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,860
It's rare that Goast Big Sword is not at home.

963
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,510
Let's go and gamble.

964
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,990
Goast Big Sword?

965
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
Watch your mouth.

966
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,180
Jiusi.

967
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Isn't Goast Big Sword

968
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,960
a nickname you gave to her?

969
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,000
Yes. What else should we call her?

970
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,020
She-Devil?

971
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,240
Remorseless Lady?

972
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,130
Female Insect?

973
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,700
Are you saying this on purpose?

974
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,100
Jiusi.

975
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,980
You're defending her now.

976
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,040
We are not allowed to speak ill of her.

977
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,360
Did something happen?

978
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,140
No, I...

979
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,830
She and I are friends now.

980
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,660
Since you call me Eldest Brother,

981
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,660
you should call her Second Brother.

982
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,820
Today,

983
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,780
your Second Brother

984
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,020
does business for the first time.

985
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,660
I'm

986
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,020
a little worried

987
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,910
about her.

988
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,340
Although we made no profit,

989
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,500
this order

990
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,630
is still worth 30,000 taels of silver.

991
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,860
Second Brother

992
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
made no profit.

993
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,150
Why are you so happy?

994
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,500
Am I happy?

995
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,150
You're not happy at all.

996
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,140
You don't understand.

997
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,660
My family doesn't lack money.

998
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,060
If she succeeds in doing this business,

999
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,940
your Second Brother will be happy.

1000
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,540
If your Second Brother is happy, I'll be happy.

1001
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,020
I knew.

1002
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,340
He asked us to fish for information

1003
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,460
about Luo Zishang.

1004
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,260
He did it

1005
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,740
for my Second Brother's business.

1006
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,740
My friend's business is my business.

1007
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,400
My business is your business.

1008
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,230
All right. Stop standing idly.

1009
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,060
Let's go and see your Second Brother.

1010
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,590
Let's go.

1011
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,340
Don't worry, Mr. Zhou.

1012
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,980
Within three months,

1013
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,380
the Gu family will prepare all the supplies.

1014
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,310
By then,

1015
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,500
you can check them again

1016
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,030
according to the contract.

1017
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,360
You can load the ship after confirming there's no problem.

1018
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,820
You're indeed reliable.

1019
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,340
Get the carriage ready.

1020
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,340
Yes, Young Madam.

1021
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,660
On the day you leave Yangzhou,

1022
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,780
I'll see you off at Changfeng Dock.

1023
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,220
Okay.

1024
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,150
Boss Liu, after you please.

1025
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,830
Whose wife are you?

1026
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,950
You're with a man

1027
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,460
in broad daylight.

1028
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,440
You also flirted with each other.

1029
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,700
You blanched.

1030
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,920
What are you afraid of?

1031
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,220
Did you get a guilty conscience?

1032
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Are you here

1033
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,500
to see your lover?

1034
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,940
Watch your mouth.

1035
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,380
This madam and I

1036
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,830
were discussing business matters

1037
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,400
by order of our elders.

1038
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,480
What we said and did

1039
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,950
didn't break the rules.

1040
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,260
The elders of your families

1041
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,910
asked you to do this?

1042
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,180
If you say dirty words again,

1043
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,480
don't blame me for being rude.

1044
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,180
Mr. Zhou.

1045
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,640
He is the son of the commissioner.

1046
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,430
Don't come into conflict with him.

1047
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,740
He's drunk.

1048
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,540
Ignore him. Let's go.

1049
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,030
Even if he is the son of the commissioner,

1050
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:10,870
so what?

1051
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,190
In broad daylight,

1052
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,360
he ruined our reputations.

1053
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,820
Is there no law?

1054
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,660
In Yangzhou City,

1055
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,420
I am the law.
