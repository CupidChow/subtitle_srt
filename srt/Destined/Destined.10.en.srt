I'll make room for you.

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,140
What are you talking about?

00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,400
Just lie on the bed.

8
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,590
You're a girl.

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,620
I can't let you sleep on the floor.

10
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,180
I won't sleep on the floor tonight.

11
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,139
We can lie doubled up.

12
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,470
Let's go. Okay.

13
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,570
Are you happy?

14
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,400
Are you happy

15
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,500
to see Wang Rong apologize to you,

16
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,340

17
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,690
I know

18
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,760

19
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,820
when things like this happened

20
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,880
and suffered a lot.

21
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,079
It doesn't matter

22
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,900
if I suffer.

23
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,070
No way.

24
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,930
I said I'd protect you.

25
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,350
No one can bully you.

26

You not suffering

27
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,540
is the most important thing.

28

What's wrong?

29
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,150
Why are you crying again?

30
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,180
I'm the one who got hit. You...

31
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,060
Did I say something wrong again?

Every single one?

38
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,820
It's as if you're holding a grudge.

39
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,010
It's my duty

40
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,200
to be nice to you.

41
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,950
It's unfair for you

42
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,420
to marry me.

43
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,900
If I treat you badly,

44
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,670
am I still a human?

45
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,610
Stop talking.

don't worry.

54
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,750
I'll help you think of a way out.

55
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,500
I'll write you a divorce letter

56

57

The Yellow River project needs talents.

We should roll out the imperial exam,

82
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,390

Despite the flood,

120
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,410
there should be a yield.

Everything I said is true.

The wound is almost healed.

The physician said he was fine.

130
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,420
Why does he still feel pain?

131
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,610
Or he's unconscious all day.

132
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,910
It looks

133
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,370
more serious than before.

134
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,780
Could it be

sign it yourself for the inspection

178
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,530
before handing it over.

Mr. He, can you go for me?

180
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,360
Why?

181
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,090
My husband's injury is not getting better.

182
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,750
I'm really worried about him.

183
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,820

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,240
is ready.

197
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,370
Please come with me.

198
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,900
I'll be right back.

199
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,420
Please wait for a moment.

200
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,670
I have to go out.

201
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,300
Take good care of him.

202
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,360
Tell me if anything happens.

203
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,820
Do you hear me?

204
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,790
Yes, Young Mistress.

205
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,000
Fan him.

206
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,720
She's gone?

207
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,950
She is.

208
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,670
How cruel.

209
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,060
I'm a patient.

210
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,780
Sir, you...

211
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,200
Come on.

212
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,610
I should

213
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,060
give you some advice.

214
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,860
I treat you well, right?

215
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,590
I think you're loyal and honest.

216
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,350
Can you keep this secret for me?

217
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,590
Good girl, you'll be rewarded.

218
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,880
Go.

219
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,140
Ask Mu Nan to come here.

220
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,450
Yes.

221
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,730
I've suffered so much.

222
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,870
[Sanshiwu]

223
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,640
Young Mistress, that's good.

224
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,340
Leave the rest to me.

225
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,310
Don't worry.

226
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,700
Thank you.

227
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,840
You're welcome.

228
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,100
Yuru.

229
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,580
Mother, why are you here?

230
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,080
I'm here to take you home.

231
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,370
Just a few steps.

232
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,370
You don't have to

233
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,460
come here.

234
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,030
Mother.

235
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,210
I have something to tell you.

236
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,130
Let's go.

237
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,150
Let's go.

238
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,990
What?

239
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,100
Jiusi was supposed to marry

240
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,730
a princess?

241
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,930
Everyone thinks

242
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,350
it's a great honor

243
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,610
to marry the princess.

244
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,390
In fact, it's not a good match

245
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,550
and can be tricky.

246
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,960
The Gu family

247
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,380
has been

248
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,040
a thorn in His Majesty's eyes.

249
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,790
Once we lose power,

250
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,630
we'll also be like lamb

251
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,470
to the slaughter by Wang Shanquan.

252
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,100
Well.

253
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,130
The son of the governor caused trouble

254
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,610
also because he heard

255
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,460
that the Gu family would lose power?

256
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,520
What else can it be?

257
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,210
Wang Shanquan has always flattered

258
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,380
our family.

259
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,609
Everyone is jealous of the Gu family's wealth.

260
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,420
I'm afraid the disaster

261
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,700
has just begun.

262
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,740
What should we do now?

263
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,190
I've discussed this with your father-in-law.

264
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,589
We're leaving Yangzhou.

265
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,880
Leave?

266
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,710
The whole Gu family?

267
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,319
Does Jiusi know?

268
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,510
He can't help much if he knows.

269
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,310
It'll hinder him from studying for the exam.

270
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,010
Let's keep it from him.

271
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,480
We'll talk about it after the exam.

272
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,680
Yuru.

273
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,410
We forced you to marry our family

274
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,590
because of a misunderstanding.

275
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,360
It's not fair to you.

276
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,560
Things are different now.

277
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,890
The Gu family may be in trouble anytime.

278
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,920
I've prepared

279
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,440
30

280
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,700
high-quality fields.

281
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,480
If you want to divorce Jiusi…

282
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,660
What divorce?

283
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,330
I never thought about that.

284
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,820
But you should think...

285
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,370
Yuru.

286
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,970
You're a good girl.

287
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,270
I don't have a daughter.

288
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,520
You've been married to my family for half a year.

289
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,480
I've regarded you

290
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,340
as my daughter.

291
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,390
But the more I like you,

292
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,700
the more I want you to think about it.

293
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,710
Think carefully.

294
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,490
As your mother,

295
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,830
I wanted to

296
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,010
keep you by my side.

297
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,870
But you have your biological mother.

298
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,000
If you leave with us,

299
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,060
your mother will be separated

300
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,940
from her child.

301
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,560
You can no longer meet each other.

302
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,770
I...

303
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,550
I don't think

304
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,360
it'll feel good.

305
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,360
There are

306
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,040
thousands of workers

307
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,020
and hundreds of ships in the Gu family.

308
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,280
It's complicated.

309
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,960
It takes

310
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,060
a long time to move.

311
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,820
Listen to me.

312
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,520
Think about it before making a decision.

313
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,830
Don't just eat. Drink.

314
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,350
Sir,

315
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,370
you worked so hard to pretend to be sick.

316
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,920
You eat less than birds every day.

317
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,930
If I didn't bring you food

318
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,110
every day

319
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,330
when Young Mistress wasn't around,

320
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,390
you'd lose weight.

321
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,770
That's right.

322
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,920
It's more realistic when I lose weight. It looks pitiful.

323
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,310
Pitiful for what?

324
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:46,190
Sir,

325
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,050
your acting is actually pompous.

326
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,140
Me?

327
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,290
Would they believe me if I was pompous?

328
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,130
Nonsense.

329
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,280
But this is not a solution.

330
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,050
If we are exposed,

331
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,090
will Young Mistress spare us?

332
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,630
Sir,

333
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,890
why don't we stop here?

334
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
Are you scared?

335
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,240
We used to act

336
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,540
and lie to my father.

337
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,370
You're afraid of Liu Yuru now?

338
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,360
Master is not as scary as Young Mistress.

339
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,030
But you're right.

340
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,570
What could my father do?

341
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,150
He beat me and scolded me.

342
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,730
But Liu Yuru…

343
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,820
She looks so scary

344
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,430
when her eyes turn red.

345
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,780
Yes, Sir.

346
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,460
So let's stop it.

347
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,770
Okay, I'll find a chance

348
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,820
to tell her that I can walk.

349
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,480
Be back on your feet tomorrow.

350
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,630
If you recover too fast,

351
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,360
it's easy to arouse suspicion.

352
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,290
Fine.

353
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,840
Young Mistress.

354
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,600
What did Madam tell you just now?

355
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,610
Why have you been so absent-minded

356
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,340
since you got off the carriage?

357
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,040
Sir, eat quickly.

358
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,900
Young Mistress will be back soon.

359
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,230
The dock is far away.

360
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,490
She can't be that fast.

361
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,300
Hit me.

362
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,590
Young Mistress, you're back.

363
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,130
She's back so soon.

364
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,360
How is he?

365
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,950
He...

366
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,310
He is fine.

367
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,510
Hide over there.

368
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,280
No. Lie down.

369
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,300
You may leave.

370
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,690
Yes.

371
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,790
Jiusi.

372
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,420
Yuru.

373
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,480
I thought you got out.

374
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,210
Why are you back?

375
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,790
Jiusi.

376
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,070
How do you feel now?

377
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,190
Are you still feeling unwell?

378
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm fine.

379
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,170
I won't die.

380
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,730
Go back to your business.

381
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,740
Jiusi.

382
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,670
Jiusi, you can't die.

383
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,910
If you die,

384
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,710
I would

385
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,350
become a widow

386
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,700
before a lady with an honorary title.

387
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:22,610
Don't worry.

388
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,180
I will live well.

389
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,780
My lord.

390
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,400
Where is Munan?

391
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,110
He has something to do.

392
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,110
He went out first.

393
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,970
Munan is not here?

394
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,020
I thought

395
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,080
he ate the roast chicken on the table.

396
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,680
If it wasn't Munan,

397
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,570
could it be...

398
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,630
It was he who ate it.

399
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,990
But...

400
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,390
he left after eating.

401
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,290
I can't believe Munan.

402
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,230
I used to think

403
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,660
he was loyal.

404
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,680
His master is dying,

405
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,430
but he

406
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,290
had the mood to eat roast chicken.

407
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,170
And he even ran away after eating it.

408
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,430
You can't keep such a person by your side.

409
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,820
My lord.

410
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,320
I'll give the order now.

411
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,390
Demote him to a third-class servant

412
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,190
and send him to clean the toilet.

413
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,800
Young Madam.

414
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,580
Young Madam, please forgive me.

415
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,090
I didn't eat the chicken.

416
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,060
You didn't?

417
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,990
Then who did?

418
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,510
I'm warning you. Don't talk nonsense.

419
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,570
It's Young Master.

420
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,290
Nonsense!

421
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,530
Young Master is so badly injured.

422
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,130
How can he eat roast chicken?

423
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,010
Just wait.

424
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,860
Well...

425
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,300
Someone!

426
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,310
Young Master is faking it.

427
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,360
He recovered long ago.

428
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,990
He eats

429
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,210
roast chicken and braised pork shoulder every night.

430
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,350
There are so many bones

431
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,280
buried in the flower beds outside.

432
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,770
Gu Jiusi.

433
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,850
Didn't I promise you

434
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,660
to live well?

435
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,180
This is also a way

436
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,280
to keep my promise.

437
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,760
Let me explain.

438
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,780
Listen to me.

439
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,310
What else do you want to say?

440
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,640
Is it fun to tease me?

441
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,580
These days,

442
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,060
I was so worried that I couldn't eat or sleep.

443
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,660
I was afraid something bad would happen to you.

444
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,930
But you…

445
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,230
What else can you do

446
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,490
other than teasing me?

447
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,630
Let me explain. I'm not...

448
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,890
Explain? Explain?

449
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,650
Explain what?

450
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,780
It hurts.

451
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm a patient after all.

452
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,440
How can you really hit me?

453
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,070
Well, you might as well hit me.

454
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,040
Just don't cry.

455
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,960
You might as well cry.

456
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,920
I'm more afraid

457
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,250
seeing you half crying.

458
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,070
Liu Yuru, I was wrong.

459
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,300
I... I was wrong.

460
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,350
I didn't mean it.

461
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,360
I didn't mean to tease you.

462
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,810
Jiusi,

463
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,330
when will you

464
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,300
grow up?

465
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,030
When can we

466
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,810
count on you?

467
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,350
I thought

468
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,390
the hardest time is the last lunar December.

469
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,270
But I didn't expect that

470
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,290
every month after that was

471
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,780
even harder than the last.

472
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,400
It's already summer now.

473
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,840
King Liang, my dear nephew.

474
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,210
Yes, Your Majesty.

475
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,210
My beloved courtier Jiang.

476
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

477
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,740
Both of you,

478
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,690
good for you.

479
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,800
I'm afraid…

480
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,020
you have long looked down

481
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,380
on me.

482
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,240
I deserve to die.

483
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,790
I am guilty.

484
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,640
Grains and taxes

485
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,280
cannot be collected.

486
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,400
The appointing and dismissing of provincial officials

487
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,660
cannot be carried out.

488
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,660
I

489
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,600
am old.

490
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,050
But you two are in your prime.

491
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,170
How could you be so incompetent?

492
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,650
I deserve to die 10,000 times.

493
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,210
Die 10,000 times?

494
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,180
Fine.

495
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Since you know you're incompetent,

496
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,860
then you don't need to

497
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,580
be the Minister of Personnel anymore.

498
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,310
The Ministry of Works

499
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,380
has a vacancy for a fifth-rank official.

500
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,030
Go and fill up that vacancy.

501
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,320
Go to build the levees

502
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,260
along the Yellow River for me.

503
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,420
I order you to leave the capital

504
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,450
and take office in three days.

505
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,710
Don't come back

506
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,540
as long as there's

507
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,590
still flood.

508
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

509
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,430
King Liang, my dear nephew.

510
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,100
Y-Yes, Your Majesty.

511
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,190
Considering your late father

512
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,680
contributed to our Darong,

513
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,170
hand back the seal of the Ministry of Revenue,

514
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,980
return to your fief,

515
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,890
guard your father's tomb,

516
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,090
and enjoy your retirement.

517
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,170
Remember,

518
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,560
from now on,

519
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,700
without my summons,

520
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,460
you're not allowed to return to the capital.

521
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,460
Yes,

522
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,150
Your Majesty.

523
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,090
Lu Yong.

524
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

525
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,620
You've devoted yourself to Darong.

526
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,210
You're now promoted

527
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,110
to Minister of Revenue.

528
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,910
Thank you, Your Majesty.

529
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,100
Gao Wei.

530
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

531
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,430
I will promote you to

532
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,570
Minister of Personnel.

533
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

534
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,050
Your Majesty.

535
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,750
Your Majesty.

536
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:00,840
Mr. Luo.

537
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,890
You told me before

538
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,870
His Majesty was very dissatisfied

539
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,880
with Jiang He and King Liang.

540
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,930
The backers of the Gu family

541
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,190
are about to fall very soon.

542
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,240
But now,

543
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,920
they are fine.

544
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,970
But my son

545
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,070
is disabled.

546
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,540
I really...

547
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,060
lost my dignity.

548
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,350
After hearing my information,

549
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,720
you son couldn't wait

550
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,750
and went to provoke Gu Jiusi after drinking.

551
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,990
And you

552
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,880
didn't believe my information

553
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,150
and went to the Gu's mansion

554
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,810
to apologize unnecessarily.

555
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,220
You solicited humiliation.

556
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,710
What does it have to do with me?

557
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,770
Your information.

558
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,120
Is your information accurate or not?

559
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,670
Why hasn't there been any news

560
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,520
from Dongdu until today?

561
00:32:59,260 --> 00:32:59,890
My lord,

562
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,490
if you don't even have this much patience,

563
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,940
how can you

564
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,150
fight for the highest position in the future?

565
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,690
Mr. Luo,

566
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,330
I'm not in the mood

567
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,660
to guess these riddles.

568
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,610
If your information is not accurate,

569
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,000
since Gu Jiusi

570
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
didn't compensate for my son's leg,

571
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,270
then...

572
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,630
Mr. Luo, you'll pay for it.

573
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,050
My lord, news from Dongdu.

574
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,110
Jiang He was degraded to the Ministry of Works,

575
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,670
down three ranks.

576
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,060
King Liang was stripped of the seal of the Ministry of Revenue.

577
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,870
It seems

578
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,850
the situation in Dongdu indeed is going to change.

579
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,380
Governor Wang,

580
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,690
do you still want

581
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,370
my leg?

582
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,060
I was thoughtless just now.

583
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,350
You know

584
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,710
I'm not a stingy person.

585
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,429
I have 19 sons.

586
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,550
Not to mention losing a leg,

587
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,090
even if I lose one or two sons,

588
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,600
it's nothing.

589
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,250
With your help,

590
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,230
I'm really lucky.

591
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,420
My apologies.

592
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,900
Of course all I said was true.

593
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,440
Now that the Gu family's backers have fallen,

594
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,280
as mere merchants,

595
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,320
they're like a child carrying gold in the middle of the market.

596
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,190
We can take the gold

597
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,160
sooner or later.

598
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,100
Young Master.

599
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,570
Young Madam has been

600
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,700
indifferent to you

601
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,230
and ignored you these days.

602
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,060
Is she still mad at you?

603
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,430
You have to find a way to coax her.

604
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,690
No need to remind me.

605
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,830
I've tried everything I can.

606
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,200
I don't know what happened this time.

607
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,290
She didn't cry or make a scene.

608
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,890
I don't even know where to start to cheer her up.

609
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,900
Did she get so disappointed

610
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,150
that she even regrets marrying me?

611
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,960
Maybe.

612
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,040
Do you really need to answer that?

613
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,380
Young Master, you said it yourself.

614
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,850
Why did you hit me?

615
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,020
Young Master,

616
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,150
Mr. Zhou from Youzhou

617
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,490
wants to see you.

618
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Mr. Zhou?

619
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,810
Zhou Ye?

620
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,790
He must be looking for Young Madam.

621
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,140
Tell him she's not in.

622
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,650
No.

623
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,200
He said he came to see you.

624
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:34,960
Me?

625
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,380
Youzhou.

626
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,650
But

627
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,250
compared to other provincial capitals,

628
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,680
Qingzhou is the nearest.

629
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,380
Alright.

630
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,540
You've been discussing this for a long time.

631
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,800
Where should the Gu stores

632
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,020
be moved to?

633
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,530
Is there a conclusion?

634
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,070
Mr. He,

635
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,470
you are the oldest.

636
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,730
You speak first.

637
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,760
Mistress,

638
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,450
the richest place in the whole country

639
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,290
is Yangzhou.

640
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,810
The second richest is Jinzhou.

641
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,810
If we can't go to Yangzhou,

642
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,220
we can only go to Jinzhou.

643
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,480
But it's a long way to Jinzhou.

644
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,580
And there are mountains blocking us.

645
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,090
How can we move

646
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,350
so much stuff there?

647
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,680
It's rather difficult.

648
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,150
Mr. Ma,

649
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,900
what's your opinion?

650
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,910
Mistress,

651
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,220
in terms of distance,

652
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,290
the city next to us, Qingzhou, is the nearest.

653
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,630
But

654
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,270
Qingzhou is contiguous to Cangzhou.

655
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,700
In the past few years,

656
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,420
there have been either floods or droughts in Cangzhou.

657
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,890
Many refugees fled to Qingzhou

658
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,330
and became bandits, killing people and setting places on fire.

659
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,460
It's chaotic there.

660
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,170
It's not a good place to go.

661
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,330
[Wang Mansion]

662
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,300
Mr. Luo.

663
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,610
Since the Gu family

664
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,080
has lost its backers,

665
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,150
what are you still worried about?

666
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,120
The Gu family

667
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,670
are just merchants.

668
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,690
Getting them

669
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,260
is like catching turtles in a jar.

670
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,590
There's no rush.

671
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,820
Right now,

672
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,370
there is a cross-river fish in Yangzhou.

673
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,310
It's not fatty,

674
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,640
but worth our effort to catch.

675
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,340
What fish?

676
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,910
A fish that

677
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,480
comes from Youzhou silently.

678
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,110
Young Madam, bad news.

679
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,040
Young Master...

680
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,800
Why are you in such a hurry?

681
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,900
I'm supposed to

682
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,760
tell Young Madam this in private.

683
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,480
Just say it.

684
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,410
What is it? Tell me.

685
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,050
Just now, Mr. Zhou Ye

686
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,640
came to our mansion

687
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,560
and asked to see Young Master.

688
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,110
Unexpectedly,

689
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,030
after a few words with him,

690
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,090
Young Master left.

691
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,250
It seems he's going…

692
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,110
going…

693
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,790
Going where?

694
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,350
To Lanxiao House

695
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,770
to find Lady Xifeng

696
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,830
to bet seven rounds of Horse Jumping.

697
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,980
This...

698
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,440
At such a critical moment,

699
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,900
why is Jiusi doing this again?

700
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,080
Mom, calm down.

701
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,510
He is not a person who doesn't know his priorities.

702
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,440
These days,

703
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,650
he has changed.

704
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,060
He won't go gambling.

705
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,480
Since Mr. Zhou looked for him,

706
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,880
he must have something urgent.

707
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,970
Yuru, you're right.

708
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,480
Jiusi

709
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,590
is not such a thoughtless person.

710
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,170
We should trust him.

711
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,730
I trust him.

712
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,000
He must have some reasons for that.

713
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,520
If you're worried,

714
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,400
I'll go to Lanxiao House to check now.

715
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,580
If anything happens,

716
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,240
we can take care of each other.

717
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,270
Thank you

718
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,380
for going through the trouble.

719
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,020
Young Madam.

720
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,320
What is Horse Jumping?

721
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,140
Just guessing who has the bigger number of dots.

722
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,870
Start with 2,000 copper coins.

723
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,790
You need to pay more every round.

724
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,430
2,000 for the first round.

725
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,860
4,000 for the second round.

726
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,290
In the third round, it's 4,000 times 4,

727
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,250
and so forth.

728
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,410
Each round is called "One Horse."

729
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,560
So it's called Horse Jumping.

730
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,680
It's not a big bet.

731
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,530
It doesn't look big at the beginning,

732
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,790
but in the fourth round,

733
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,050
you need to put in 16,000 times 16.

734
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,640
For the fifth round,

735
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,650
256,000 times 256.

736
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,710
In the sixth round,

737
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,460
you have to bet

738
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,990
all the Gu family's assets.

739
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:10,900
No,

740
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,600
it's several times of all our property.

741
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,330
It will cost

742
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,070
4.2 billion taels of silver.

743
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,420
What about the seventh round?

744
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,560
For the seventh round,

745
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,410
I'm afraid all the silver in the world

746
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,540
is not enough to pay.

747
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,160
Young Madam, what should we do?

748
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,430
I'm afraid

749
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,650
we can only pay it with our lives.

750
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,140
Hurry up.

751
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:45,800
[Small]

752
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,220
[Big]

753
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:51,970
[Small]

754
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,300
[Big]

755
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,520
[Small]

756
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,890
The fourth round of Horse Jumping.

757
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,910
Three, three, five, big.

758
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,340
Lady Xifeng wins!

759
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,730
Mr. Gu loses!

760
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,730
What should we do?

761
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,710
Gu Jiusi!

762
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,660
Gu Jiusi, stop gambling.

763
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,120
Young Madam Gu is here.

764
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,400
Let Young Madam Gu in.

765
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,080
Let her in.

766
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,420
Gu Jiusi, come back with me.

767
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:38,890
Boss Liu.

768
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,950
Boss Liu, listen to me.

769
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,440
I'm the reason for this.

770
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,050
If it weren't that my cousin

771
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,650
lost Horse Jumping six rounds in a row,

772
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,150
Mr. Gu

773
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,950
wouldn't take any risk

774
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,880
like this.

775
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,350
If you must blame someone,

776
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,270
blame me.

777
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,730
Young Madam Gu,

778
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,300
what are you doing?

779
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,150
Don't scare

780
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,280
a delicate, law-abiding

781
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,750
businesswoman like me.

782
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,690
This Young Master Fan

783
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,240
can't repay the gambling debt.

784
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,710
Mr. Gu insisted

785
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,930
on standing up for him

786
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,770
and gamble on Horse Jumping again.

787
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,450
We haven't finished yet.

788
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,390
So many people are watching.

789
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,100
There's no reason to stop.

790
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,950
Right!

791
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,330
You agreed to gamble.

792
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,090
Otherwise,

793
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,350
we'll need that young master to pay us back.

794
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,110
Am I right?

795
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,660
-Yes.
-Right.

796
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:19,630
Pay the money.

797
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,210
Yes.

798
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,360
Who said we're going to stop?
