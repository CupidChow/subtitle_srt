You women

are so ungrateful.

22
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,360

Then why did you become a bandit?

there's 450,000 kilograms of corn in total.

124

Only 450,000 kilograms?

125
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,430
It's not even ten percent of

127
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,980
Where are the rest of them?

128

No, no.

130
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,400
We haven't had time to sell them.

131
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,150
They are still there.

132
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,620
They're hidden in other caves.

So,

139
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,890
you were forced to become a bandit?

140
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,120
It has nothing to do with you.

141
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,850
Judging from your accent,

142
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,360
you're from Cangzhou, right?

143
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,890
Why did you come to Youzhou?

144
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,720
What happened to the other person

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,850

146
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,580
That man

147
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,180
is just an old bastard.

148
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,770
He took advantage of the chaos in Cangzhou

149
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,240
to humiliate women.

150
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,760
So many people

151
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,270
starved to death due to the famine,

152
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,280
but he still refused to open the granary and distribute grains.

153
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,120
I killed him

154
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,320
without hesitation.

155
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,760
I took my men to distribute all the grains.

156
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,720
In the end, I was wanted by the government.

157
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,810
I had no choice

158
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,900
but to flee from Cangzhou.

159
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
What happened later?

160
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,340
Later,

161
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,280
I thought

162
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,610
since my mother is gone,

163
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,430
it's good to knock around.

164
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,650
I wanted to be a warrior,

165
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,630
but I didn't expect that

166
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,970
I'd become a bandit.

167
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,320
It's okay that I'm a bandit.

168
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,120
The title is not that important.

169
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,890
For one thing, I don't kill good people.

170
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,150
For another, I don't abuse women or children.

171
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,210
No matter if I'm in Cangzhou or Youzhou,

172
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,470
my principles are the same.

173
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,600
Rob the rich and help the poor.

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,530
Suppress the strong and aid the weak.

175
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,000
I also helped the righteous merchants in the city

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,200
to smuggle government grain reserves.

177
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,140
Righteous merchants in the city?

178
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,770
Government grain reserves?

179
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,490
You mean

181
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:19,800
My Lady.

182
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,230
Do you think those who paid the money

183
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,990
simply wanted to

184
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,950
kidnap you?

185
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,920
A message just arrived.

186
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,170
They want you to

187
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,090
disappear completely.

188
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,289
Can the secret that Jiusi found out be

190
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,950
Youzhou's grain reserves?

191
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,780
Where are the grain reserves?

192
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,640
Of course they are in a safe place.

193
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,179
Master said that

194
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,610
next year,

195
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,870
when famine occurs,

196
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,480
they will all be distributed to the people.

197
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,660
If that's the case,

198
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,060
you are really a warrior.

199
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Not at all.

200
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,450
I still have a long way to go.

201
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,130
In my heart,

202
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,970
there's only one person in the world

203
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,950
that deserves to be called a warrior.

204
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,750
She donated all her family fortune for the people.

205
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,730
She's

206
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,130
an extraordinary woman.

207
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,700
Who's that?

208
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,620
Her name

209
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,700
is also extraordinary.

210
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,290
Liu Yuru.

211
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,100
Liu Yuru?

212
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,720
Why is her name

213
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,100
extraordinary?

214
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,400
Anyway, it's extraordinary.

215
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,560
In my heart,

216
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,890
she's my sworn sister that I've never met.

217
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,380
If I'm lucky enough

218
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,780
to be able to work for her,

219
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,410
I will do my best

220
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,540
and perform whatever she asks me to do.

221
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,010
Hey.

222
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,520
Why are you laughing?

223
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,910
Is it that funny?

224
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,080
Well,

225
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,300
do you know

226
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,700
what Liu Yuru looks like?

227
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,660
No.

228
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,540
But what does it matter?

229
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,190
Even if she's as beautiful as Xi Shi,

230
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,860
I won't have

231
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,460
any evil thoughts about her.

232
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,780
If she's really ugly,

233
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,040
she'll still be extraordinary.

234
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,480
As long as she's willing to take me in.

235
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,660
Why would she?

236
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,880
You're muddleheaded.

237
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,540
And you assisted an evildoer.

238
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,320
You helped that wicked,

239
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,120
treacherous villain, Mr. Zhao,

240
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,430
to smuggle the grains

241
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,940
that Youzhou's people live on out of the city.

242
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,490
And then you sold them at a high price,

243
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,350
thinking you did something good.

244
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,440
Tell me, why should I take you in?

245
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,880
You...

246
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,280
What did you say?

247
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,510
I am Liu Yuru.

248
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,340
Oh right.

249
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,060
You're from the south.

250
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,760
I'm from Yangzhou.

251
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,430
That's not right.

252
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,280
My sworn sister's husband

253
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,410
is from the Gu family, the richest family in Jiangnan.

254
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,300
But you're a Yamen runner's wife.

255
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
My husband's name

256
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,650
is Gu Jiusi.

257
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,100
Master Eagle.

258
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,070
I've heard a lot about you.

259
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,010
Who are you?

260
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,770
Yamen runner of Wangdu,

261
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,290
Gu Jiusi.

262
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,950
You really dared to come.

263
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,410
Why not?

264
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,440
There are 5,000 soldiers from Wangdu

265
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
heading to Heifeng Fort now.

266
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,250
When the force arrives,

267
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,610
they will behead you as sacrifice.

268
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,390
Really?

269
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,320
Really?

270
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,070
What should we do?

271
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,620
Exactly.

272
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,290
This...

273
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,630
I'm only here to make peace with you

274
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,310
for my wife's safety.

275
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,660
That's some big talk

276
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,810
from you.

277
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,200
If you don't believe me,

278
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,960
I can wait here with you.

279
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,400
I think

280
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,820
you must have sent someone to scope it out.

281
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm a man of my word.

282
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,680
If you let my wife

283
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,140
down the mountain safely,

284
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,170
I can protect your lives.

285
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,700
But if you don't,

286
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,100
no one in Heifeng Fort

287
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,960
will survive today.

288
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,720
What should we do?

289
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,630
Mr. Gu.

290
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,600
Have a seat.

291
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,550
Sorry that I mistreated you.

292
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,870
Ask Shen Ming to bring her here.

293
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,210
Yes.

294
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,200
Shen Ming.

295
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,370
You call yourself a warrior.

296
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,290
But if you really think

297
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,750
for the people of Youzhou,

298
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,370
then the real whereabouts of the grain reserves,

299
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,100
and the grain safety of Youzhou

300
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,420
is on your shoulders.

301
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,240
But Master Eagle also said that

302
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,240
he was forced

303
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,660
to become a righteous bandit.

304
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,380
He's also been doing this

305
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,930
for the sake of the poor people.

306
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,480
That's why I recognized him

307
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,490
as Master.

308
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,630
Could there be some misunderstanding

309
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,160
here?

310
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,760
Assistant Master.

311
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,100
Master is asking you to

312
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,900
take these two women to the hall.

313
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,980
What for?

314
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,430
Didn't he say I could have them?

315
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,270
Someone from down the mountain is here.

316
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,000
Master wants them to be there as soon as possible.

317
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:40,880
Oh no.

318
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,690
That guy from Wangdu

319
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,870
must be here.

320
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,050
He's trying to

321
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,100
kill both of you.

322
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:52,980
Master Eagle.

323
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,700
According to our men who scoped down the mountain,

324
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,170
there are really 5,000 soldiers

325
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,510
heading to Heifeng Mountain.

326
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,350
They are only a dozen kilometers

327
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,410
away from our fort.

328
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,710
A dozen kilometers away?

329
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,850
Yes, so close.

330
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,560
This...

331
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,570
What should we do?

332
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,220
What should we do?

333
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,150
Master Eagle.

334
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,540
Didn't you agree

335
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,500
to let me have

336
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,640
these two women?

337
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,690
They are mine now.

338
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,630
If anyone dares to touch her,

339
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,780
they'll have to go through me first.

340
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,440
Mr. Gu.

341
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,070
As you can see,

342
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,750
it's not that I don't want to let her go.

343
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,770
It's just

344
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,160
your wife

345
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,760
and my brother are so lovey-dovey.

346
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,860
It's hard for them to say goodbye to each other.

347
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,330
Sister.

348
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,770
No, I...

349
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,540
Did they give you a hard time?

350
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:20,810
It's okay.

351
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,220
Let's go home first.

352
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,650
Wait.

353
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,890
Are you guys

354
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,410
going down the mountain just like that?

355
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,670
Can you guarantee

356
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,770
that your promise still counts?

357
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,220
Master Eagle.

358
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,770
As long as you promise that

359
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,160
my wife can go down the mountain safely,

360
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,960
I will stay here to make sure

361
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,640
you are safe.

362
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,790
You're resolute, Mr. Gu.

363
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,120
Escort Mrs. Gu down the mountain.

364
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,050
Go.

365
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,100
Master Eagle.

366
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,190
May I ask you a question?

367
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,010
Go ahead.

368
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,040
Master Eagle.

369
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:07,960
Are you

370
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,760
working for Mr. Zhao in the city?

371
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,590
Did you kidnap me

372
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,370
because he asked you to?

373
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,190
Right?

374
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,240
Looks like I'm right.

375
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,020
Mrs. Gu.

376
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,500
What do you want to say?

377
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,660
I heard that

378
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,720
you are a righteous bandit, Master Eagle.

379
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,270
Those men you took in at Heifeng Fort

380
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,000
are mostly from poor families,

381
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,000
who were forced

382
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,060
to become bandits.

383
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,600
So I wonder,

384
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,160
why did you

385
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,300
smuggle the life-saving grain reserves of the people of Youzhou,

386
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,360
and ignore the people's well-being?

387
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,960
What? Smuggle?

388
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,750
You must be kidding, Mrs. Gu.

389
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,300
What grains?

390
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,680
I don't know about that.

391
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,880
You don't need to pretend.

392
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,520
That batch of grains

393
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,250
was bought by us.

394
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,050
You know very well in your heart

395
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,450
whether you did it or not.

396
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,040
You paid for it?

397
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,960
How could you afford

398
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,829
the grain reserves of the entire prefecture?

399
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,890
Are you kidding me?

400
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,930
That's right.

401
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,910
Do you know

402
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,710
where we are from, Master Eagle?

403
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,470
Yangzhou.

404
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,369
The Gu family

405
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,300
is the richest family in Jiangnan.

406
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,310
Although I can't say we're fabulously rich,

407
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,870
half of our family wealth

408
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,540
equals

409
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,640
20 years of grain taxes in Youzhou.

410
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,400
My husband and I

411
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,420
are both sworn friends

412
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,730
of General Zhou's third son, Zhou Ye.

413
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,410
You may as well take a guess.

414
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,300
Where's the billions of the Gu family fortune

415
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,970
now?

416
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,020
How much food could we buy?

417
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,000
If it's used for military expenses,

418
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,440
how many bandit suppression soldiers could be provided for?

419
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,280
Mrs. Gu.

420
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,220
Are you messing with me like I'm a three-year-old?

421
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,900
It's such a big deal.

422
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,770
I'm neither deaf nor blind,

423
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,970
so why have we never heard about it?

424
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,990
Well, Mr. Zhao has been imprisoned.

425
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,610
You

426
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,170
don't know about this either, do you?

427
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,400
No way.

428
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,700
How could he be imprisoned?

429
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,250
Exactly.

430
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,380
That's impossible.

431
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,400
That's right.

432
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,410
When you kidnapped me up the mountain,

433
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,740
I was in a hurry to go out.

434
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,760
It was because

435
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,620
Zhou was interrogating Mr. Zhao,

436
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,510
and he asked me to check the amount of money and grains.

437
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,190
Since Zhou didn't see my wife there,

438
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,660
he heard from Mr. Zhao that

439
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,170
you kidnapped my wife.

440
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,320
So he sent a force here for bandit suppression.

441
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,100
Master Eagle, do you know that

442
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,340
if the corn

443
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,520
you smuggled for Mr. Zhao

444
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,610
was really sold,

445
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,710
Youzhou will be desolate

446
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,590
and strewn with corpses of victims of starvation?

447
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,870
Master Eagle.

448
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,220
Is what she said true?

449
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,620
Did you really

450
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,550
sell that batch of grains?

451
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,150
Of course not. The grains...

452
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,730
The grains are meant to

453
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,940
be distributed to the people.

454
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,900
But Mr. Zhao

455
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,850
has confessed everything.

456
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,920
Since you helped Mr. Zhao to smuggle grains

457
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,910
and assassinate the insider,

458
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,030
you could get 30% of the proceeds.

459
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,720
30%?

460
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,570
Master is not that kind of person.

461
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,300
Disgusting.

462
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,090
Master Eagle.

463
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,710
This is a felony that may get you cut in two at the waist or executed publicly.

464
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,550
So what?

465
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm a bandit.

466
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,400
It's already a capital crime to loot and plunder.

467
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,700
Do you think I'm afraid that there's one more crime?

468
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,670
Mr. Zhao only

469
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,730
promised to give me 15% of the proceeds.

470
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,190
Did he say in his statement

471
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,370
that it's 30%?

472
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,060
30%? That much?

473
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,040
Hasn't he already taken that 30%?

474
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,770
Dirty money.

475
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,350
How could he do something like this?

476
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,530
Even 15% is a lot of money.

477
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,120
Exactly.

478
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,960
I didn't expect it.

479
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,550
Yes.

480
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,930
We've been kept in the dark.

481
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,650
We were all fooled.

482
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,190
Right.

483
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,380
So,

484
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,680
it's all true.

485
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,790
You've been lying to me.

486
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,390
You made me work for you,

487
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,800
but what you did is evil and wicked.

488
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,530
Master Eagle.

489
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,370
Say it.

490
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,590
A large force is about to

491
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,920
arrive at the fort gate.

492
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,900
We can't run away.

493
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,790
What should we do?

494
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,540
We can't escape.

495
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,740
What should we do now?

496
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,120
I've told you

497
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,390
I'd destroy Heifeng Fort today.

498
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,310
Do you

499
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,410
still want to resist?

500
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,650
This guy

501
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,930
is Zhou Ye's sworn brother.

502
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,290
If we capture him,

503
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,430
we can still live.

504
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,950
Arrest him!

505
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,380
Stop!

506
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,200
Eagle is dead.

507
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,000
I am the Master now.

508
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,440
Listen to my order.

509
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,970
Put down your swords.

510
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,970
When you went in the fort alone

511
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,940
to trade for me,

512
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
were you sure that

513
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,200
Zhou would bring troops here?

514
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,940
To tell you the truth,

515
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,050
I wasn't sure.

516
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,690
That was a bet.

517
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,990
I only sent a letter to inform him.

518
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,250
Whether he could come,

519
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,220
and how many people he could bring

520
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,350
were out of my reach.

521
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,160
But as long as I could

522
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,180
get you out safely,

523
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,370
that's enough.

524
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,220
How could I

525
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,480
leave you there alone?

526
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,640
You were taking a bet. So was I.

527
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,920
I bet Shen Ming

528
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,760
would defect for justice.

529
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,280
Boss Liu.

530
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,620
Your bet

531
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,320
was much riskier than mine.

532
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,630
I learned it from you.

533
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,920
You learned how to tell lies

534
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,930
from me, too?

535
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,080
How was my story?

536
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,380
The two of us

537
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,270
played that one perfectly.

538
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,770
It's like we had colluded with each other.

539
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,160
Liu Yuru.

540
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,670
I underestimated you.

541
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,640
You're amazing.

542
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,840
If you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.

543
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,870
Jiusi.

544
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,150
Nothing happened

545
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,800
up there.

546
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,910
It's all okay now.

547
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,190
We're both okay.

548
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,400
No.

549
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,420
I mean

550
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,010
I...

551
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,580
Shen Ming is a good man.

552
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,880
I...

553
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
Nothing happened

554
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,920
between us.

555
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,580
Trust me.

556
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,630
You have to trust me.

557
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,590
I trust you.

558
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,180
But I don't care

559
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,090
about any of that.

560
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,970
I only care if you're hurt

561
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,870
and whether you can come back safely.

562
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,190
That's the most important thing.

563
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,490
Liu Yuru.

564
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,400
No matter what happens,

565
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,010
you're my wife.

566
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,670
You always are.

567
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,710
And you always will be.

568
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,530
[Commissioner's Mansion]

569
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,000
[Clean and Sharp]

570
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,520
Your humble servant, Gu Jiusi, is here.

571
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,820
Greetings, Commissioner Fan

572
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
and General Zhou.

573
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,500
Good.

574
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,560
Good.

575
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,670
Young man.

576
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,340
You didn't let me down.

577
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,230
Brother.

578
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,760
What did I tell you?

579
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,900
You lost the bet.

580
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,120
Yamen runner Gu Jiusi

581
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,980
made his contribution to bandit suppression. He's both smart and brave.

582
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,040
A copper seal and a jade pendant will be bestowed upon him.

583
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,040
An exception will be made and he'll be promoted to Magistrate of Wangdu.

584
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,220
Fan.

585
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,700
What should we do

586
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,510
about the captured bandits?

587
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,610
What's your opinion, Brother?

588
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,420
Heifeng bandits have entrenched there for a long time.

589
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,730
Troubled times call for harsh sentences.

590
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,130
They should all be buried

591
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,260
to deter other rebels.

592
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,720
My lords.

593
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,470
I have another humble request.

594
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,100
Go ahead.

595
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,750
Most of the Heifeng bandits

596
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,340
are refugees

597
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,140
who are desperate and cornered.

598
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,490
Of course those who killed innocent people

599
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,550
should be executed, a life for a life.

600
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,600
But there are many of them

601
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,980
who have never hurt anyone.

602
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,440
They don't deserve to die.

603
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,680
Especially their leader, Shen Ming.

604
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,850
At the critical moment,

605
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,510
it's because he defected to us

606
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,010
that we suppressed the bandits successfully.

607
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,820
I'm willing to trade the reward of

608
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,290
my contribution to suppressing bandits

609
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,260
for your mercy on them.

610
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,140
I can also prove that.

611
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,420
Shen Ming did kill

612
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,280
the former bandit leader, Eagle.

613
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,950
He made amends for his crime.

614
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,470
At the same time, I'm willing to incorporate Shen Ming

615
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,600
and those who didn't commit any crime.

616
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,440
If anything goes wrong,

617
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,590
I'll take sole responsibility.

618
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,660
Okay, I'll do as you say.

619
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,100
Thank you, Commissioner.

620
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,720
[Fine Wine]

621
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,320
Nonsense!

622
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,950
You're talking nonsense.

623
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,600
That Eagle,

624
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,700
even with five more people of his,

625
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,130
would have been no match for me.

626
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,680
If there were more people than that, I couldn't handle it.

627
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,560
Cut it out.

628
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,750
Eagle is nothing

629
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,050
compared to me.

630
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,730
But his martial arts skills

631
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,580
are definitely not inferior to you.

632
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,460
Nonsense!

633
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,170
If you don't believe it,

634
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,220
how about we go out and compete?

635
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,480
Don't drink too much, you two.

636
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,410
You're starting to talk nonsense.

637
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,210
OK.

638
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,650
Gu Jiusi.

639
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,960
I need to tell you something.

640
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,880
Go ahead.

641
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,570
Actually,

642
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,210
I've thought about it.

643
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,470
If the commissioner and his people

644
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,730
turned their back on me

645
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,960
and wanted me dead,

646
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,000
I'd accept it.

647
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,310
Because most of our men

648
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,410
are refugees.

649
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,150
They didn't kill anyone.

650
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,770
But after all,

651
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,870
what we did was looting and plundering.

652
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:36,960
It's illegal.

653
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,930
As for Eagle,

654
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,850
his life was taken by me.

655
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,670
So I'm Master now.

656
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,100
If you kill me,

657
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,210
it counts as redemption.

658
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,810
Anything else?

659
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,610
More importantly,

660
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,390
my elder sister,

661
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,930
Warrior Liu.

662
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,370
She's generous in aiding those in need,

663
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,710
and doesn't care about fake fame.

664
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,710
I only respect her

665
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,400
in my life.

666
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,790
Listen, Gu Jiusi.

667
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,720
On the mountain,

668
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,430
I didn't touch her

669
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,360
at all.

670
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,870
But...

671
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,140
But no man

672
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,270
can get over it.

673
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,860
Right?

674
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,880
Fortunately,

675
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,930
those in the main hall

676
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,100
who heard my nonsense

677
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,240
are all dead now.

678
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,810
I'm the only one left.

679
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,670
Kill me,

680
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,600
and my sister's name

681
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,200
will be cleared completely.

682
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,950
Are you done?

683
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,460
Yes.

684
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,930
Do you think I need you to tell me

685
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,770
how great Yuru is?

686
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,800
She is my wife.

687
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,810
No matter what happened,

688
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,010
she's always my wife.

689
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,800
I'll protect everything about her.

690
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,150
Who do you think you are?

691
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,610
Good.

692
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,760
I wasn't wrong about you.

693
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,180
You deserve to be my brother-in-law.

694
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
Bottoms up for me.

695
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,900
I've investigated every bandit

696
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,090
in Heifeng Fort.

697
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,760
Those who don't deserve to die

698
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,270
are all incorporated in the army.

699
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,200
As for you, the head of the bandits,

700
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,940
you have your own place to go.

701
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,970
The new magistrate

702
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,360
suppressed Heifeng Fort all by himself.

703
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,420
The new magistrate

704
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,630
is a bandit suppression hero.

705
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,890
-Of course. -What are you talking about?

706
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:33,880
Boss.

707
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,950
Have you heard?

708
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,740
We have a new immediate superior.

709
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,940
When did this happen?

710
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,840
Last night.

711
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,180
We only heard about it

712
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,360
when we got here this morning.

713
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,450
The new magistrate is said to be

714
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,460
a bandit suppression hero.

715
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,850
He exterminated Heifeng Fort once and for all.

716
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,320
He was promoted on the spot.

717
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,250
The seal was bestowed by the commissioner himself.

718
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,930
Is Heifeng Fort really exterminated?

719
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,770
It can't be fake.

720
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,870
The head of bandits, Eagle, died on the spot.

721
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,510
Assistant Master and hundreds of bandits

722
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,470
were captured alive.

723
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,190
They are all detained in the barracks now.

724
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,120
Great.

725
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,050
The people can finally live in peace.

726
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,320
Who is this new magistrate?

727
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,590
I don't know.

728
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,890
I heard that

729
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,360
he took the lead and went up the mountain himself.

730
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,370
He helped the barracks

731
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,460
to retrieve all the grain reserves,

732
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,550
not even a cart was missing.

733
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,560
He's both smart and brave.

734
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,200
He is no ordinary man.

735
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,710
Being able to work

736
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,800
for this kind of hero

737
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,140
is our honor, too.

738
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,190
Be alert.

739
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,550
Leave a good impression on the new magistrate.

740
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,390
Yes.

741
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Is everyone here?

742
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,470
Only Gu Jiusi isn't present.

743
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,700
Him again?

744
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,590
That loser.

745
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,810
He was absent yesterday.

746
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,660
He didn't go to the city gate for roll calling either.

747
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,040
I don't care what background he has.

748
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,840
I must punish him hard this time.

749
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,310
Who do you want to punish?

750
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,070
Isn't this Gu Jiusi?

751
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,120
-Gu Jiu... -Yes.

752
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,380
This...

753
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,020
Is this our new magistrate?

754
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,150
Gu Jiusi?

755
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,310
He is our new magistrate?

756
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,190
Greet Magistrate Gu.

757
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,170
Greetings, Magistrate Gu.

758
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,750
We're all acquaintances.

759
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,210
No need to be so courteous.

760
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,980
Since I'm taking office,

761
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,730
I'm supposed to be fair in meting out rewards and punishments.

762
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,080
Yesterday, as a Yamen runner,

763
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,010
I was absent due to family matters.

764
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,490
My punishment will be five days' salary, according to the rule.

765
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,750
It'll be deducted at the end of the month.

766
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,440
Huang Longfei.

767
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,350
Yes.

768
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,680
Do you know why I called you?

769
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,190
[Head of Department]

770
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,590
You're quite smart.

771
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,690
You knew I'd retrieve your badge

772
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,200
before I even speak.

773
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,100
[Head of Department]

774
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,100
Stop there.

775
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,900
Huang Longfei, head of the security department,

776
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,280
has always put the people first

777
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,290
and served his duty dedicatedly.

778
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,290
You are now promoted to Lieutenant,

779
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,370
and you'll be in command of all the Yamen runners of the county.

780
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,170
You'll get a raise of two taels of silver per month.

781
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,190
Two taels?

782
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,940
Did I hear it right?

783
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,620
Two taels.

784
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,400
Who would have thought of that?

785
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,490
Lieutenant Huang.

786
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,570
Come and get your new badge.

787
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,830
[Lieutenant]

788
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,560
The other Yamen runners also worked hard.

789
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,990
Your salary will be raised by 20 copper cents per month.

790
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,840
Thank you, Magistrate.

791
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,480
All right, get back to work.

792
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,280
Yes.

793
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,280
Magistrate Gu.

794
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,850
I have something to say to you.

795
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,110
If you regret it after that,

796
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,640
you can take the badge back.

797
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,180
Go ahead.

798
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,050
To tell you the truth,

799
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,250
the person who trapped you with a sack

800
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,900
and beat you up in the north alley early this month

801
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,570
was me.

802
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,010
What a coincidence.

803
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,160
The one who trapped you with a sack and beat you up

804
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,670
in the same north alley the next morning

805
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,380
was my wife.

806
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,790
Magistrate Gu, I'm a vulgar person.

807
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,850
From now on,

808
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,450
I'll try my best to serve you.

809
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,580
All right, take your office.

810
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,130
Yes.

811
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,810
Magistrate Gu,

812
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,410
I have another question that

813
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,040
I can't figure out.

814
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,680
I heard that

815
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,440
you used to be the young master of a rich family. A playboy.

816
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,330
Why did you become a Yamen runner

817
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,460
and live such a humble and hard life?

818
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,230
You know I used to be a playboy.

819
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,320
My money's gone due to that.

820
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,120
Go ahead.

821
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,220
Jiusi.

822
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,530
Didn't you say

823
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,460
you have something to tell Mother?

824
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,930
Go ahead.

825
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,050
Mother.

826
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,540
Try the West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy.

827
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,469
It's very fresh.

828
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,060
It was me

829
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,179
who put the vinegar in it.

830
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:22,880
Try it.

831
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,790
Mother.

832
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,760
I learned the recipe of the braised pork

833
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,429
from the chef

834
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,940
in Chengnan Street.

835
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,130
It's the authentic taste of Yangzhou.

836
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:33,800
Try it.

837
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,610
It's very authentic. Try it.

838
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,370
You can do everything.

839
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,550
You two are really capable.

840
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,790
Something bad almost happened to Yuru,

841
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,800
but I wasn't informed

842
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,060
at all.

843
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,240
I'm not 50 years old

844
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,410
yet.

845
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,260
But you've started to treat me as if I'm deaf and blind,

846
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,020
and started to coax me, right?

847
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,980
No.

848
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,330
We just didn't want you to worry.

849
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,550
Yes, Mother.

850
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,690
Look.

851
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,450
Nothing happened to me.

852
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,920
I'm back safely.

853
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,560
If you weren't back,

854
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,030
I wouldn't have known.

855
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,170
Magistrate Gu.

856
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,930
Magistrate's wife.

857
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,240
You two are really something.

858
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
If we are any good,

859
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,780
it's because we took after you, Mother.

860
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,830
Back then,

861
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,300
you only used a few tricks,

862
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,060
and you unified Jiangnan's business circles.

863
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,940
It was also made possible by your ability

864
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,670
to stay calm in times of crisis.

865
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,600
Right?

866
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:42,680
Yes.

867
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,660
The credit is all yours, Mother.

868
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,050
Yuru.

869
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,400
Why are you also flippant

870
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,720
now, just like Jiusi?

871
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,140
Mother.

872
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,080
You can blame me if you want.

873
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,840
It's all my fault.

874
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,310
It has nothing to do with her.

875
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,240
Are you caring less about me since you have a wife now?

876
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,430
Who was the one

877
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,690
that cried

878
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,220
and refused to get married?

879
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,580
I hadn't made up my mind at that point.

880
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,130
In the past,

881
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,570
I only knew Yuru was capable.

882
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,770
I didn't expect

883
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,520
that one day,

884
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,710
Jiusi would become a magistrate.

885
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,470
There have been

886
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,610
ministers and chancellors in our family.

887
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,360
I'm just a magistrate.

888
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,670
What's there to praise?

889
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,730
That's different.

890
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,490
Jiusi, you got the position

891
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,870
by your own efforts.

892
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,680
Just like Yuru.

893
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,320
You also managed to operate

894
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,380
Huarong so well by your own efforts.

895
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,750
In the first half of my life,

896
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,290
I've been hoping

897
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,050
that my son could be someone important some day.

898
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:51,810
And now,

899
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,390
I can finally rest assured.

900
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,500
I'm happy

901
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,060
that you are so successful, Son.

902
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,120
Let's have a couple of drinks

903
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,300
to celebrate.

904
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:07,520
Cheers.

905
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,060
Cheers.

906
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,430
Come on, eat.

907
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,290
Mother.

908
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,700
Right, the pastries.

909
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,420
The pastries.

910
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,350
I almost forgot.

911
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,390
My Lady, remain seated.

912
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,190
I'll go get it.

913
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,000
What pastries?

914
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,090
So fussy about it.

915
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,150
It's a good thing.

916
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,960
The best pastry shop of Jingdu,

917
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,340
Baiyujing,

918
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,940
has opened a branch

919
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,160
in Youzhou.

920
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,860
It's right across Huarong.

921
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,850
I wanted to buy a box of pastries

922
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,860
for you to try today.

923
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,370
But guess what?

924
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,640
Baiyujing's owner said that

925
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,460
he's heard a lot about the famous merchant, Jiang Rou.

926
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,250
He insisted on gifting you

927
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,180
a box of their signature plum cake.

928
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,450
He wouldn't take my money,

929
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,250
no matter how hard I tried to pay.

930
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,220
Look.

931
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,740
Although you don't show up in public anymore,

932
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,140
you still have admirers.

933
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,590
Baiyujing's pastry.

934
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,190
Even the box is so delicate.

935
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,200
I only ate it

936
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,800
in Eastern Capital when I was little.

937
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,390
Mother.

938
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,830
Such exquisite pastries

939
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,160
require the most exquisite tableware.

940
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,900
Yinhong.

941
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,950
Follow me to the kitchen

942
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,810
to get some fine plates and bowls.

943
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:35,720
Mother.

944
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,480
What's wrong

945
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,090
with the plum cake?

946
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,050
Baiyujing used to be the business of

947
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,810
my maiden family.

948
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,390
How come I didn't know about that?

949
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,030
It's not just a pastry shop.

950
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,920
Actually,

951
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,310
your uncle set up

952
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,190
a big net to deliver important information.

953
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,230
If it's ordinary news,

954
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,720
Baiyujing wouldn't have

955
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,340
done this.

956
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,360
The plum cake was

957
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,120
delivered to me today.

958
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,800
It means

959
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,070
something big had happened.

960
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,370
Yan.

961
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,930
She's still thinking about me and Nianming.

962
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,630
It's a letter from Aunt Chen?

963
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,860
After we succeed,

964
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,250
I look forward to reuniting with you in Eastern Capital

965
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,850
and catching up.

966
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,360
Speaking of her parents,

967
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,920
Yan wasn't lucky enough.

968
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,500
She was still a baby

969
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,740
when her parents died of illness.

970
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,980
My father

971
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,840
was her father's closest friend.

972
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,600
So she was adopted

973
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,530
and raised in our family.

974
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,290
At that time,

975
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,100
she, Nianming,

976
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,110
and I.

977
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,550
The three of us grew up together.

978
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,830
Yan is naive and gentle.

979
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,930
She's only done one thing that's obstinate

980
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,870
in her whole life,

981
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,850
that is to marry Lord Liang.

982
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,770
Check out her letter.

983
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,770
When she becomes the Empress,

984
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,120
Nianming will be Prime Minister,

985
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,700
and I'll be First-class Titled Madam.

986
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,140
If that really happens,

987
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,670
our family

988
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,870
can reunite in Eastern Capital

989
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,270
like when we were little.

990
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,050
So you mean,

991
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,310
we'll turn to Aunt Chen?

992
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,260
Yan...

993
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,610
She won't hurt me.

994
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,280
I also believe that

995
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,620
my aunt must be hoping for our good.

996
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,850
It's just that she trusted the wrong person.

997
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,450
Lord Liang is unscrupulous.

998
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,140
He treats people completely differently when he needs them and not.

999
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,140
Do you still remember that

1000
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,490
he traded my marriage

1001
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,290
and our family

1002
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,420
for bargaining counters in politics?

1003
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,270
He isn't

1004
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,660
a kind and righteous person in the first place.

1005
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,430
The Jiang family, the Gu family,

1006
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,350
and the people

1007
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,680
are all political pawns

1008
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,210
to him.

1009
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,620
Besides,

1010
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,050
the reason why Lord Liang could target at Eastern Capital is that

1011
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,350
all the commissioners

1012
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,110
have been staying put

1013
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,510
and making him stand out.

1014
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,060
Even if he really managed to become the emperor,

1015
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,360
he's still a traitor.

1016
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,700
How long can he hold on

1017
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,430
with all the prefectures eyeing him covetously?

1018
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,460
I'm old.

1019
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,680
I'm short-sighted.

1020
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,610
Fine.

1021
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,550
Now you are in charge of

1022
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,720
the Gu family.

1023
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,070
Where we'll go eventually

1024
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,890
is up to you.
