[Episode 18]

4
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,050
No thanks.

5
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,940
It'll just add to my sadness.

6
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,860
When you get old,

7
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,820
you can’t stand parting.

8
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,660
Madam.

9
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,460
Madam.

10
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,100
Madam!

11
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,060
We are here to say our goodbyes.

12
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,900
Madam.

13
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,740
You must take good care of yourself.

14
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,420
Whether it's three years,

15
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,860
five years,

16
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,940
or ten years...

17
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,900
Wait for us.

18
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,940
We'll meet again.

19
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,740
Madam.

20
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,140
We know

21
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,620
you can't bear to leave us.

22
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,500
We also can't bear to be apart from you.

23
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,090
Yes.

24
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,500
We also can't bear to be apart from you.

25
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,700
Madam.

26
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,220
We are here

27
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,770
to bid you farewell.

28
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,780
Madam.

29
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,500
Take care.

30
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,140
Madam.

31
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,700
Take care.

32
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,800
Did Mother really cry?

33
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,540
I've never seen

34
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,980
Mother cry so sadly.

35
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,900
Not only you,

36
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
I've never even seen her cry before.

37
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,860
I... I'll go check on her.

38
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,420
It's already very late.

39
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,620
Go tomorrow.

40
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,020
What we can do now

41
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,020
is to finish the liquidation as soon as possible

42
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,420
and donate our property,

43
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,480
so we can start a new life soon.

44
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,250
By the way,

45
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,640
I have something to discuss with you.

46
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,780
Go ahead.

47
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,220
I don't want to hand our property over

48
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,950
to Commissioner Fan directly.

49
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,540
Then how should we donate our property?

50
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,460
Right now, the problem in Youzhou

51
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,720
is not only about food.

52
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,780
Now, famine is plaguing all states.

53
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,310
If Youzhou has enough food,

54
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,860
it will surely attract leading troops from all states

55
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,990
to come and rob them.

56
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,460
So,

57
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,340
Youzhou needs troops and military resources.

58
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,420
So I'm thinking if

59
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,500
we should hand our property over

60
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,620
to Youzhou's chief commandant, General Zhou,

61
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,620
and explain to him

62
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,180
that some of it could be used to replenish the military resources.

63
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,460
This will be a double-layered protection

64
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,540
for Youzhou.

65
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,820
However,

66
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,230
I have another selfish motive.

67
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,700
I want to become an official.

68
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,140
I want to be successful.

69
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,630
You don't want to be a warrior anymore?

70
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,510
Great warriors serve the country and the people.

71
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,240
I don't want to just go with the flow anymore.

72
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,900
I don't want to

73
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,230
lose control of my fate,

74
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,120
fail to protect my family,

75
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,500
and even

76
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,900
fail to resolve the suffering of the people again.

77
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,100
I want to go higher.

78
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,420
I want to become someone

79
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,420
capable enough to change the world.

80
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,710
Since we've donated our property,

81
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,740
why don't we also do them a favor?

82
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,260
It's reasonable to hand it over to Commissioner Fan.

83
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,100
At most, he will think

84
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,140
we're honorable.

85
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,909
We're giving our all

86
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,600
while only getting back half of it in return.

87
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,300
Or we can hand it over to General Zhou,

88
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
who is currently worrying about military expenses,

89
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,100
and of a status

90
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,780
that is below that of Commissioner Fan

91
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,310
and hence have fewer people fawning over him.

92
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,740
We can say that

93
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,580
since we're close with Zhou Ye,

94
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,410
we donated it through his father,

95
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,010
and point out that half of it could be used for military expenses.

96
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,420
It's better to provide charcoal in winter

97
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,210
than to add icing to the cake.

98
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,580
I believe

99
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,900
he'll appreciate our well intentions.

100
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,220
That's a good idea.

101
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,100
We can donate our property

102
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,060
and even get a priceless favor

103
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,020
in return.

104
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,190
You're quite good at business.

105
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,700
You are indeed the main disciple of me,

106
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,659
Boss Liu.

107
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,460
Yes.

108
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:36,700
It's all thanks to your teaching.

109
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,180
In fact, there's also another benefit.

110
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,260
We're taking one more step

111
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,190
to hide the truth

112
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,060
and donate our property secretly,

113
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,700
so it won't let

114
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,620
the commissioners of other states get jealous

115
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,060
and have Youzhou be dreaded by others

116
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,780
and become the target of criticism.

117
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,620
It also won't let the merchants in Youzhou

118
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,659
think that the government is imitating Yangzhou's method

119
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,860
of disguised harvest

120
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,100
and cause panic.

121
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,120
Do you remember

122
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,410
the dice rolling bet in the past?

123
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,260
Then, you were afraid

124
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,980
that I would gamble and risk all my assets.

125
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,810
But now,

126
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
I'm really gambling and risking

127
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,980
all my assets.

128
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,100
I think

129
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,470
this is not a gamble.

130
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,860
Then what?

131
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,580
It's a scheme.

132
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,780
Since I was young, I've been doing everything step by step

133
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,840
and meticulously.

134
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,020
This time,

135
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,220
I've calculated everything meticulously too.

136
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,460
Although I can't say that

137
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,320
all my predictions are accurate,

138
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,380
this

139
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,640
is definitely the best choice right now.

140
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,780
What I want

141
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,419
is a place where I can live

142
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,179
and do business in peace.

143
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,460
A home.

144
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,180
No matter what,

145
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,100
we should have a home.

146
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,770
[Be in charge of the business forever]

147
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,700
Wait.

148
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,640
You donated this mansion too?

149
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,260
Since we're donating,

150
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,790
we should do it thoroughly.

151
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,980
But is there a need

152
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,060
to go this far?

153
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,660
Then I...

154
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,700
The Gu family's wealth is equivalent to that of a country.

155
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,940
Even if we donate

156
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,020
all our property,

157
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,880
others may not believe it.

158
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,300
They might think

159
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,300
we're hiding

160
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,060
some treasure in this mansion

161
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,290
and contrarily make others suspicious.

162
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,740
Since we want to protect ourselves,

163
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,500
why don't we do a thorough job?

164
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,420
Liu Yuru,

165
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,980
you're really ruthless.

166
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,360
You just realized that today?

167
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,200
I realized it long ago.

168
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,790
Since I married you,

169
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,800
I should also be considered a brave warrior.

170
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,060
All gone. Everything's gone.

171
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,380
I'm going bankrupt,

172
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,940
with empty hands.

173
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,230
What did you say?

174
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
All the property?

175
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,340
Jiusi.

176
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,360
Why are you doing this?

177
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,540
If we can solve Youzhou's problem,

178
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,400
it'll be a blessing to our family.

179
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,610
-Jiusi...
-Brother.

180
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,940
We've made up our minds.

181
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,480
No need to persuade me.

182
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,140
Jiusi.

183
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,030
I initially invited you to Youzhou

184
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,300
because I'm here

185
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,900
and can take care of your family.

186
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
But now...

187
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,020
Since the Gu family has decided to

188
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,100
settle down in Youzhou,

189
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,060
it's natural to make contributions

190
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,740
to Youzhou.

191
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,300
Now that Lord Liang is plotting a rebellion

192
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,700
and all states are independent,

193
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,290
we also hope

194
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,290
the chaos in this world can end soon.

195
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,820
General Zhou and Commissioner Fan

196
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,740
are ambitious.

197
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,310
I'll give you the money.

198
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,660
Whether you're using it for the military or the people,

199
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,100
we feel at ease.

200
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,700
Put yourself in my shoes.

201
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,540
If you had my property,

202
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,380
what would you do

203
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,560
in this chaotic world?

204
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,260
That's true.

205
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,300
Brother,

206
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,900
I understand now.

207
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,180
You and Third Sister are honorable

208
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,900
and truly benevolent and righteous.

209
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,460
On behalf of the three million soldiers and people,

210
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,260
let me offer my gratitude to you.

211
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,380
Brother.

212
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
You don't have to.

213
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,220
This is what we should do.

214
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,780
Brother,

215
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,860
then, in the future,

216
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,340
you...

217
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,460
Yuru has applied for a business document.

218
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,100
We'll do some small business first.

219
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,630
We haven't figured out what to do exactly yet.

220
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,660
I, Zhou Ye,

221
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,120
offer my gratitude to you.

222
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,940
In the future,

223
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,220
if there's anything

224
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,480
I can help you out with,

225
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,710
even if I have to sacrifice my life, I'll do anything.

226
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,860
Okay.

227
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,630
[Auspiciousness and happiness come together]

228
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,220
Be careful.

229
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,480
Don't break anything.

230
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,420
Yes.

231
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,300
All these items have been inventoried.

232
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,460
They are all to be donated.

233
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
Every one of them.

234
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,820
Yes.

235
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,300
Yinhong.

236
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,030
Go watch them load the cars.

237
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,180
Okay.

238
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,940
You two, come with me.

239
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,660
Put these nonessential things

240
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,940
in the car first.

241
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,170
[Gu Mansion]

242
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,980
Everyone is moving things.

243
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,180
You're the only one who's slacking off.

244
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,580
What's wrong?

245
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,780
You look so defeated.

246
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
After today,

247
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,310
I don't know if there will still be a tomorrow.

248
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,060
What do you mean?

249
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,550
Didn't you hear what they said?

250
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,540
Young Master and Young Madam

251
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,980
donated all their property.

252
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,900
Everything.

253
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,420
I know.

254
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,820
All the servants have been dismissed.

255
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,340
We

256
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,250
will also definitely be kicked out.

257
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,090
Impossible.

258
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,700
Young Madam wouldn't bear to leave me.

259
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,540
You wish.

260
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,020
I heard

261
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,700
Young Madam discussing it with Young Master.

262
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,740
That only one person managing the household affairs

263
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,490
will be kept.

264
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,500
That'll be Ms. Ruixue.

265
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,100
She has to take care of Madam.

266
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,780
Nonsense!

267
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,450
I heard everything clearly.

268
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,500
When I was a kid,

269
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,900
I was brought back from the streets by Young Master.

270
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,300
If he really kicks me out,

271
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,580
I don't know where I can go.

272
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,700
I grew up

273
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,500
with Young Madam since I was young too.

274
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,430
I've never thought of leaving her.

275
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,700
Munan, what should we do?

276
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,950
I don't know.

277
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,620
I don't know.

278
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,710
Yinhong, Munan.

279
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,650
Come here.

280
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,510
Young Master and I have something to tell you.

281
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,540
Oh no.

282
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,740
See?

283
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,500
She looks so serious.

284
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,220
It must be

285
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,300
about firing us.

286
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,780
What?

287
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,060
Learn to do business?

288
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,180
Yes.

289
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,780
You scared me, Young Madam.

290
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,730
I thought

291
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,060
you and Young Master were going to kick me out.

292
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,860
Who said that?

293
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,510
It was Munan. He said it.

294
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,260
I-I just

295
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,850
heard Young Madam say

296
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,080
that she's only keeping one servant.

297
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,300
We're only keeping Ruixue to serve Mother.

298
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,340
Because from now on, you two

299
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,300
will be the employees of the Gu Business.

300
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,430
You'll even be a manager in the future.

301
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,160
More importantly,

302
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,820
we are a family from now on.

303
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,420
Yes.

304
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
Your home is here.

305
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,630
Where can you go?

306
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,180
You scared me, Young Madam.

307
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Young Master...

308
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,100
Enough.

309
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,850
This yard seems nice.

310
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,520
Although it's a little small,

311
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,620
it does look nice.

312
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,060
It's well ventilated and quiet.

313
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,220
In a day,

314
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,760
sunlight can come in for most of the time.

315
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,700
I think

316
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,580
Langhua's flowers and plants

317
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,700
can be placed

318
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,500
in this little room next to it.

319
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,980
Okay, don't worry.

320
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,620
Everyone, please

321
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,740
place the flowers and plants in this room.

322
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,580
Yes.

323
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,380
Let's go tidy up too.

324
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,540
You guys,

325
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,800
come in with the boxes.

326
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,100
Madam.

327
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,400
Have the medicine while it's hot.

328
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,490
Is it too bitter?

329
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,330
It's my fault.

330
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,040
I know you hate the bitter taste the most.

331
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,140
But I didn't think of

332
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,770
preparing

333
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,230
a sweet dried persimmon to go with it for you.

334
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,430
It's not your fault.

335
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,660
We're in a different situation.

336
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,599
How can you be thorough with everything?

337
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,060
By the way,

338
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,180
has everyone else

339
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,260
settled down?

340
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,980
Yes, everyone has their assigned rooms.

341
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,839
Since there are fewer people now,

342
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,920
we must be able to move around easily.

343
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,859
That's good.

344
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,819
From now on,

345
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,060
all of the big and small matters

346
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,020
in the family

347
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,320
will have to be handled by you.

348
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,760
You've been with me for so many years.

349
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,460
Yet at this age,

350
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,600
you have to work even more.

351
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,620
I'm fine.

352
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,860
I just feel sorry for you.

353
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,590
You've lived a luxurious life,

354
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,660
yet you have to live a hard life from now on.

355
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,420
I'm not afraid of hardship.

356
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,180
Now, although there are fewer people at home

357
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,110
and it's lonely,

358
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,960
I still have a son and a daughter-in-law.

359
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,740
In the future,

360
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,660
I'll even have a bunch of

361
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,580
lovely grandchildren.

362
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,230
No matter how hard life will be,

363
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,260
I won't feel bitter.

364
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,090
Didn't you always say

365
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,900
you treat Young Madam

366
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,460
as your own daughter?

367
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,660
It's quite nice to have

368
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,430
a son and a daughter.

369
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,300
Ruixue.

370
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,020
Are you hiding something

371
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,820
from me?

372
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,580
I...

373
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,340
Madam.

374
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,180
I don't know

375
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,060
if I should tell you this

376
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,100
or hide this from you.

377
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,700
Just tell me.

378
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,740
I heard...

379
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,250
heard that Young Master and Young Madam

380
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,660
have yet to consummate their marriage.

381
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,300
They're a fake couple.

382
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,300
What?

383
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,460
Madam.

384
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,900
Just now, when you said you were looking forward to grandchildren,

385
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,090
I was afraid...

386
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,620
I was afraid that

387
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,100
if you got your hopes high,

388
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,960
you'd be even more disappointed.

389
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,980
Madam, don't be upset.

390
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,070
Your health is more important.

391
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,740
How did you find out?

392
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,180
I accidentally

393
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
overheard Young Madam and Ms. Yinhong

394
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,780
talking in private.

395
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,310
Inferring from what I'd heard,

396
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,540
since Young Master and her got married,

397
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,040
they've never consummated their marriage.

398
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,420
And they'd also planned

399
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,100
to get a divorce sooner or later.

400
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,230
That's fine.

401
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,180
Back then, this marriage

402
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,060
happened by accident.

403
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,370
But now that I think about it,

404
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,520
Yuru must have been put to a greater inconvenience.

405
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,050
If they're unwilling,

406
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,940
I can't force them.

407
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,660
You're right.

408
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,580
I'll take it

409
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,110
that I have a son and a daughter.

410
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,060
Which shop

411
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,340
are we going to today?

412
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,780
Let's go to the one at Qijiao Alley,

413
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,710
to see if we can negotiate the rent.

414
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,060
Our family is in a different situation now.

415
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,590
Our capital is quite small.

416
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,620
Mao, are you okay?

417
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,580
Get up.

418
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,500
Are you hurt?

419
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,520
Are you hurt from the fall?

420
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,140
Look.

421
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,540
Look at you.

422
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,780
You're careless again.

423
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,660
You're so scatterbrained

424
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,980
that you bumped into Young Madam.

425
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,620
Hurry up.

426
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,860
Say thank you to Young Madam.

427
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,740
Hurry up.

428
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,620
Forget it.

429
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,820
I'm glad that

430
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,740
my younger brother didn't get hurt.

431
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,860
There are many people and things in the yard now.

432
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,100
Don't let him knock or bump into things.

433
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,380
Take him back to the room.

434
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,020
Yes, Young Madam is right.

435
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,020
Our yard is too small.

436
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,940
Children can't play to their heart's content.

437
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,850
I'll take him back to the room immediately.

438
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,500
Let's go.

439
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,460
Seriously.

440
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,460
What did Madam Yue

441
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,410
mean by that?

442
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,860
"The yard is so small

443
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
that children can't even play to their heart's content."

444
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,700
Why did that sound so awkward?

445
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,860
It's been so many years.

446
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,010
Don't you know

447
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,540
what kind of a person Mother Yue is?

448
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,980
She's always been strange.

449
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,740
Let her be.

450
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,730
But I think...

451
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,500
something's wrong with Mao.

452
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,460
That's right.

453
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,420
It's been so many days,

454
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,060
but he hasn't even

455
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,980
called you sister.

456
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,640
He used to be very close to you.

457
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,940
He sure is Madam Yue's biological son.

458
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,670
He's an ungrateful person too.

459
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,660
I think he's been acting strange.

460
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
He doesn't dare to look me in the eyes

461
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,970
or talk to me.

462
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,650
It's like he's always avoiding me.

463
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,860
It's not about whether we're close or not.

464
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,100
He seems to be afraid of me.

465
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,660
But you are so kind to him.

466
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,380
Why would he be afraid of you?

467
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,100
Maybe it's because Mao is young,

468
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,380
and it was a sudden shift in environment,

469
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,110
that he's not adapted to it yet.

470
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,440
Maybe it'll be fine after a while.

471
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,700
But we've been in Youzhou

472
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,740
for a while now.

473
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,220
He hasn't changed at all.

474
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,280
He's even avoiding you more and more.

475
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,260
Forget it. Let's not think about that.

476
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,790
Let's go check out the shop.

477
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,570
Stop crying. What do you have to cry for?

478
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,180
Mother.

479
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,580
Even if you were frustrated,

480
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,740
why did you hit him?

481
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,700
That's right.

482
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,420
Didn't he just

483
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,820
not thank Eldest Sister?

484
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,300
Now that she's donated all her property,

485
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,900
she's no longer

486
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,740
a noble lady.

487
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,060
We don't have to

488
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,900
be so cautious

489
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,780
and be at her disposal.

490
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,980
Keep your voice down.

491
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,740
Didn't you see

492
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,420
how rashly he behaved?

493
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,580
He's always been intimidated by Yuru.

494
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,620
That girl is so smart.

495
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,770
She will find out about the problem sooner or later.

496
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,100
We are alone here

497
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,580
in Youzhou.

498
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,300
If she finds out about it,

499
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,220
Eldest Sister

500
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,780
must hate us to death.

501
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,180
Do you think that's it?

502
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,220
Are you stupid?

503
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,220
If she finds out about it

504
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,620
and sues our mother in court

505
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,950
for killing her mother,

506
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,540
our mother might

507
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,380
be beheaded.

508
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,600
What nonsense are you talking about?

509
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,840
Who killed her mother?

510
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,610
Who saw it?

511
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,970
Is there a rule in Darong saying that

512
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,650
if someone falls off the cliff,

513
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,780
we have to save them?

514
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,100
Kids, don't be afraid.

515
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,560
When we get to Guazhou Dock

516
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,580
and find the Gu family's merchant ship,

517
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,580
we'll be safe.

518
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,460
Faster! Faster!

519
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,580
Yuying! Yuying!

520
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,740
Are you okay?

521
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,780
Where's Mao?

522
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,580
Mother.

523
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,010
Mother.

524
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,460
I'm here. It hurts.

525
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,460
Mao.

526
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,500
Mother, it hurts.

527
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,300
Help!

528
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,290
Help!

529
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,740
Help!

530
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,740
Help!

531
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,740
Help!

532
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,060
Eldest Madam.

533
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,180
Zhao.

534
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,700
Eldest Madam.

535
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,140
Zhao, help me!

536
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,820
Help!

537
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,980
Eldest Madam!

538
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,100
Help me, Zhao!

539
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,250
Zhao, help me!

540
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,300
Mother! Save Eldest Mother.

541
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,780
Eldest Madam.

542
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,580
Take my hand.

543
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,660
Zhao!

544
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,140
Pull Yuzhao back.

545
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,980
Take care of yourself.

546
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,100
Zhao!

547
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,300
Eldest Madam!

548
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,020
Zhao!

549
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,220
Let's go.

550
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,980
Zhao!

551
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,420
Yuru.

552
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,420
Yuru.

553
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,660
Yuru.

554
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,300
We didn't do anything wrong.

555
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
As long as you two

556
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,040
keep your mouths shut.

557
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,620
No one will know.

558
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,380
But God knows.

559
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,740
You...

560
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,010
Mother.

561
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,660
I can hear it every night.

562
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,490
Eldest Mother was asking us to save her.

563
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,420
I'm scared.

564
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,770
Mao.

565
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,340
Do I

566
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,660
treat you well?

567
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,260
Yes.

568
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,660
Are you willing to leave me?

569
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,780
No.

570
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,740
I've told you many times.

571
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,780
You are my biological child.

572
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,900

by some other person.

574
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,560
As for this matter,

575
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,330
we must

576
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,740
keep it to ourselves.

577
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,860
Otherwise,

578
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,940
you'll lose your mother.

579
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,200
For a child, losing his mother

580
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,790
is even more miserable than death.

581
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,060
You know that?

582
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,180
Good boy.

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,660
Good boy.

00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,380
It's time to cook.

586
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Asking us to cook?

587
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,030
Aren't there maids at home?

588
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,530
Ms. Ruixue has to take care of Madam.

589
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,330
She's tied up.

592
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,720
What about you?

593
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,830
Why don't you cook?

594
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,710
I have to do physical work.

595
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,700
I have to carry water, chop wood and move stuff.

596
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,020
If you want, we can switch.

597
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,540
Hurry up.

598
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,500
Otherwise, you will also have nothing to eat

599
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,580
when it's time.

600
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,160
Life is so unbearable.

601
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,260
I've never cooked by myself

602
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,620
since I was born.

603
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,780
Forget it.

If we offend them,

610
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,180
we'll have nowhere to go.

611
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,460

I'm here to talk business

Please wait here for a moment.

619
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
I'll inform them.

620
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,660
Thank you.

[Commissioner's Mansion]

622
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,900
The Gu family really

623
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,460
donated all their fortune this time

624
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,260
without keeping anything back.

625
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,140
It really surprised me.

626
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,260
I wonder

[Commissioner of Youzhou, Fan Xuan]

628
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,860
what the Gu family wants.

629
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,380
What can they possibly want?

630
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,730
[Commanding General of Youzhou, Zhou Gaolang]

631
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,690
The Gu family just suffered a loss in Yangzhou.

632
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,260
Wang Shanquan deceived everyone

633
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,660
and took advantage of the chaos to rob and kill.

634
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,260
The Gu family is just scared.

635
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,540
So they came to Youzhou, our territory,

636
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,610
and paid their family fortune as tribute

637
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,340
in order to look for protection

638
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,660
and peace.

639
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,020
The Gu family are worldly.

640
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,540
Their request

641
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,140
can't be that simple.

642
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,170
So what do you think, Fan?

643
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,900
Jiang Rou won't show up.

644
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,660
He only sent a young man, Gu Jiusi,

645
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,740
to come and see us.

646
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,380
I guess he wants a position as an official.

647
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,580
Since it's a merchants' family,

648
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,250
what they want must be to be the military supplier

649
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,370
and make a living from it.

650
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,140
Brother.

651
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,020
What Youzhou purchases in ten years

652
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,220
is less than

653
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,860
half of the Gu family's fortune.

654
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,120
They are businessmen.

655
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,060
Of course

656
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,540
they are clear about this.

657
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,380
You're right.

658
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,340

Power.

662
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,660
They can only be pursuing these three things.

663
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,340
Since they don't lack money,

664
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,540
excluding money,

665
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,180
it's most likely to be power.

666
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,300
Or

667
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,090
this young man wants to make a noise in the world

668
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,370
and win people's hearts.

669
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,230
Maybe he wants to build his career

670
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,810
in Eastern Capital in the future?

671
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,810

673
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,620
It's not that complex.

is only at the age of 20.

And I heard that

677
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,580
he's a playboy.

678
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,260
What can he possibly do?

679
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,540
In my opinion,

680
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,540
you don't even have to see him in person.

681
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,740
I'll handle it.

682
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,060
In case he gets too frivolous

683
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,180
or arrogant.

684
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,300
Fine.

685
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,070

But my father

702

asked me to work in the camp.

703
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,760
Today is my day off.

704
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,980
I was going to see you.

705
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,970
I didn't expect to see you here.

706

707
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,500
Of course.

Now is time for me

709
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,600
to do something for my father.

710
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,420

Youzhou's people and troops.

732
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,330
It's the Gu family's honor

733

to be able to

734
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,900
make our humble contribution to Youzhou.

735
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,260
But I do have a request.

736
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,060
I hope you can grant it, General.

737

Mr. Gu.

738
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,500
This time you've donated all your family fortune

739
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,460
and done such a good deed to Youzhou.

740
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,500
I wonder what you want.

741
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,580
I'd like to

00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,100
ask for a position

744
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,940
Mother, maybe General Zhou

745
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,400
had a good chat with Jiusi,

746
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,050
and asked him to have dinner there.

747
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,060
Let's eat first.

748
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,140
Okay.

749
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,300

You're finally back.

752
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,480
You must be hungry.

753
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,690
Have some.

757
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,610
He's pretty solid.

758
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,699
He seems like a reliable official.

759
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,980
Nothing like

760
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,440
Wang Shanquan and his men.

761
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,460
I

762
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,239
asked for a position from him.

763
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,300
Eat slowly.

764
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,179
Tell me,

765
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,820
what position did you get?

766
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
With my position,

767
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,540
the people have to make way

768
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,870
when I'm on the streets.

769
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,739
Are you going to be a county magistrate?

770
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,420
That's not a good trade.

771
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,980
If we trade

772
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,380
our whole family fortune

773
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,860
for a junior position,

774
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,740
not only will this be buying a job,

775
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,460
but it's also beneath us.

776
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,180
A county magistrate

777
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,890
has to read complaints and review documents every day.

778
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,490
His job is not as good as mine.

779
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,700
Tell me.

780
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,440
What position did you get?

781
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,810
Yamen runner.

782
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,760
I'll start my duty tomorrow morning.

783
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,680
[Commissioner's Mansion]

784
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,420
What do you think Gu Jiusi

785
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,020
meant?

786
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,470
He donated all his family fortune

787
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,300
just to be a Yamen runner?

788
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,100
This young man

789
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,900
is quite interesting.

790
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,820
Gaolang.

791
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,620
I'm afraid

792
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,780
we might both have guessed his ambition wrong.

793
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,750
What do you mean?

794
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
Just wait and see.

795
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,610
Gu Jiusi

796
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,630
may be a great talent in the future.

797
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,220
A young man like this can appear

798
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,220
in such a chaotic world.

799
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,780
It's a blessing to our people.

800
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,940
Not necessarily, I think.

801
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,500
Look how fragile he seems to be.

802
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,630
Can he endure the hardship?

803
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,700
Maybe in less than three months,

804
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,180
he'll quit.

805
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,740
You don't believe me?

806
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,220
Let's have a bet.

807
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,460
On what?

808
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,300
I bet Gu Jiusi is a jade.

809
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,580
He can endure the hardship.

810
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,830
And after being polished,

811
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,380
he will definitely be too glorious to be looked directly at.

812
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:50,980
Fine.

813
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,960
But let's make the bet big.

814
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,500
Three glasses of wine.

815
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,540
Okay, it's a deal.

816
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,100
Deal.

817
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,240
-Cheers. -Cheers.

818
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,700
Aren't you going to ask me

819
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,780
why I only asked for

820
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,310
a position of Yamen runner?

821
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,060
You must have your own plan, My Lord.

822
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,080
You trust me like this?

823
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,820
Yes.

824
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,020
Fine, with this attitude,

825
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,140
I'd risk my life to make you

826
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,000
a titled madam.

827
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,910
Don't say "risk your life".

828
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,620
You're my husband.

829
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,920
Be more sedate.

830
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,820
Okay, I will.

831
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,370
Actually,

832
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,580
I've thought about this for a long time.

833
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,700
If I ask for a position too low,

834
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,900
it will be beneath us.

835
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,100
If I ask for something too high,

836
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,340
it'll intimidate others.

837
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,380
So you asked for the position as Yamen runner,

838
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,060
which is completely out of their expectation

839
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,190
and can let them feel that they owe you?

840
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,700
You know me best.

841
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,580
But there's one more thing.

842
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,620
I grew up in a wealthy family.

843
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,140
If I really want to do something

844
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,000
for the people,

845
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,660
I need to climb up

846
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,690
step by step.

847
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,180
This way, they will think

848
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,140
I'm worth it,

849
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,620
or they may think I don't deserve the position.

850
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,780
Do you have my back?

851
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,260
Yes.

852
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,660
I'm just like you.

853
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,050
As a boss,

854
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,620
without a patron,

855
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,950
it's up to my own ability

856
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,140
if I can build my business from scratch.

857
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,740
By the way,

858
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,900
I also got something done today.

859
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,820
What is it?

860
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,620
I rented a shop.

861
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,140
We have

862
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,980
200 taels of silver on our account.

863
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,220
The business document

864
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,260
has just been approved.

865
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,940
Starting tomorrow,

866
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,800
we can prepare for the reopening.

867
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,050
Let's wish us both

868
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,910
a successful comeback.

869
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:42,980
Okay.

870
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,980
Well,

871
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,580
what do you want to do?

872
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,260
I have an idea,

873
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,080
but it's not final yet.

874
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,460
What?

875
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,070
Tell me about it.

876
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,990
I want to sell rouge.

877
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,380
Rouge?

878
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,300
In this chaotic time,

879
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,180
why would you sell

880
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,260
something that isn't a must?

881
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,780
Don't underestimate

882
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,620
things that aren't a must.

883
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,180
When men are farming and running errands outside,

884
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,370
women are doing chores at home

885
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,180
and taking care of

886
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,620
the whole family.

887
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,060
Life is hard for them.

888
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,860
But the harder it is,

889
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,020
the more they'll want to do something

890
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,420
that can cheer them up.

891
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,970
If they don't have a lot of money,

892
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,020
only cosmetics, like rouge,

893
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
are cheap

894
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,900
and can make them feel like

895
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,430
they are living a good life.

896
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,100
Even for a moment,

897
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,300
it can help them forget about the hardship,

898
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,630
and it's also a comfort.

899
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:39,750
You don't know.

900
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,660
For women,

901
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,300
we are unhappy if we don't get to spend money,

902
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,180
but we are even unhappier if we spend too much money.

903
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,740
The thing that makes us

904
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,380
the happiest

905
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,700
is to buy something nice

906
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,500
but useless with a little money.

907
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,940
In that case,

908
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,900
this is really a good business.

909
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,660
You have a bright future, Boss Liu.

910
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,340
I will also

911
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,020
have nothing to worry about.

912
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,540
Just wait and see

913
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,640
me make a comeback.

914
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,520
What are you doing?

915
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,220
You used to be Young Madam Gu.

916
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,060
From now on,

917
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,880
I can also be Young Master Liu.

918
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,980
Are you spineless?

919
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,260
I'm a kept man.

920
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,860
Of course I'm spineless.

921
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,380
Let me tell you.

922
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,020
Not everyone

923
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,700
can be

924
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,300
a kept man.

925
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,980
Get up.

926
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,060
No, I can't.

927
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,820
Get up.

928
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,100
I said I'm spineless.

929
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,010
Get up.

930
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,880
[Youzhou Government]

931
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,620
Boss.

932
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:50,860
Long.

933
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,210
I heard there's a newcomer.

934
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,540
He's from a rich family.

935
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,300
He's not from some

936
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,660
average rich family.

937
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,140
He's the son of the richest man in Yangzhou.

938
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,860
How could such a rich man

939
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,380
end up

940
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,300
competing with us for a job?

941
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,140
Who knows?

942
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,900
Maybe he's a spendthrift.

943
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,600
A starved camel is still bigger than a horse.

944
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,340
Doesn't he have some friend with power

945
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,740
to look after him?

946
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,690
Of course.

947
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,980
Young General Zhou Ye

948
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,780
came to the county government yesterday himself

949
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,620
to notify the higher-ups.

950
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,100
The higher-ups told us

951
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,460
to take good care of him.

952
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,780
Don't treat him badly.

953
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,780
We only earn so little,

954
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,620
but we have so much to do.

955
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,740
We've always been short-handed.

956
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,800
But the higher-ups

957
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,740
appointed a spoiled rich dandy

958
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,100
to join us.

959
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Didn't you say

960
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,060
a starved camel is still bigger than a horse?

961
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,860
I heard that the tip a rich guy

962
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,020
gives to a showgirl or a servant

963
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,260
could equal our annual salary.

964
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,460
They give out money

965
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,090
in ingots.

966
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,940
If he treats us well

967
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,740
and subsidizes us by treating us to dinner often,

968
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,020
we can take care of him.

969
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,140
You all

970
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,840
have aged parents and young children to provide for.

971
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,460
You don't have enough money to spend, do you?

972
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,020
Of course not.

973
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,320
You can play a trick on him.

974
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,260
We don't even have enough time and energy

975
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,380
for our work.

976
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,620
Who has time to take care of an idler?

977
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,020
Exactly.

978
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,750
Who has time to take care of him?

979
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,060
What do you think? Am I handsome?

980
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,060
Is this the official uniform

981
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,420
you'll wear every day?

982
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,190
You look like a night watchman.

983
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,220
Forget it.

984
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,580
I'm just a kept man.

985
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,570
Someone also said that

986
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,500
they don't count on me to be a high official.

987
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,380
But now...

988
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,940
Yes.

989
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,650
I love how talkative and handsome you are.

990
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,820
You are a top-class,

991
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,480
handsome night watchman.

992
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Talking about me.

993
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,940
Your dress is so plain.

994
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,220
You look like Wenjun who was selling alcohol.

995
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,300
We do seem to be

996
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,820
a good match.

997
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,420
How arrogant.

998
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,820
You're comparing yourself to Sima Xiangru.

999
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,740
Well,

1000
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,950
we do have something in common,

1001
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,020
that is our wives both

1002
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,140
have good taste.

1003
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,260
Look at you.

1004
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,980
Sit down and have breakfast.

1005
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,020
Eat.
