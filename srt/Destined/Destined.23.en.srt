[Episode 23]

4
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,780
He's still a traitor.

5
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,170
How long can he hold

6
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,700
with people from so many prefectures keeping a close eye on him?

7
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:56,979
Now that I get old,

8
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,310
I get more sentimental.

9
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,110
Fine.

10
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,000
Now you are in charge of

11
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,230
the Gu family.

12
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,590
Where we should go in the end

13
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,300
is up to you.

14
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,070
These days,

15
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,920
we can see clearly that

16
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,579
Commissioner Fan sincerely devotes himself

17
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,310
and seeks peace for the people.

18
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,060
If we really want to be reunited,

19
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,990
we should

20
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,550
stick to the original idea

21
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,220
and stay in Youzhou.

22
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,510
We will be reunited.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,180
Mother.

24
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,220
When the world is peaceful,

25
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,340
we'll save Uncle

26
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,579
and get all the managers back

27
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,860
and go back to Yangzhou together.

28
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,860
Just like before.

29
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,750
The day will come.

30
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,579
Mother is smart.

31
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,540
She's just being nostalgic for now.

32
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,740
She'll figure it out.

33
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,500
But since we're on Youzhou's side,

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,330
if someone finds out

35
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,930
we are related to Lord Liang,

36
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,630
I'm afraid it'll be to our disadvantage.

37
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,240
My aunt's surname is Chen, not Jiang.

38
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,710
We can still keep it secret for now.

39
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,770
But now Lord Liang

40
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,170
is the enemy of the world.

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,360
This relationship

42
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,220
will be exposed sooner or later.

43
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,170
Instead of

44
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,890
letting others find out themselves,

45
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,650
why don't we

46
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,060
tell Commissioner Fan first

47
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,390
to prove our innocence?

48
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,380
I think so too.

49
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,870
But the stakes are high.

50
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,160
We can't be too straightforward.

51
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,900
I'd better discuss it

52
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,870
with Zhou first.

53
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,790
Zhou,

54
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,620
I have something to tell you.

55
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,680
I have important military affairs to attend to.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,740
Tomorrow. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

57
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,230
Lady Liang is my aunt.

[Commissioner's Mansion]

59
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,380
Zhou.

60
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,560
Can't we tell others about it?

61
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,500
You may not have heard

62
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,740
a few days ago,

63
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,060
my father

64
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,370
caught a spy

65
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,829
who worked for Lord Liang.

66
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,550
He then killed him

67
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,180
and all his family members,

68
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,780
without sparing any of them.

69
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,230
Jiusi.

70
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,100
I know you're an upright person.

71
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,500
Although your Gu family

72
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,060
are related to the Liang family,

73
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,030
you are definitely different.

74
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,110
I know that.

75
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,340
But my father is of suspicious nature.

76
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,750
He leaves no room for others.

77
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
At this moment,

78
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,990
it's somehow a bit awkward.

79
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,630
If you act rashly,

80
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,340
you might get into

81
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,600
unnecessary trouble.

82
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,020
General Zhou and the commissioner

83
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,659
have always been benevolent.

84
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,540
This time, they acted like speed demons.

85
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,180
Looks like

86
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,950
they're really planning to save the Emperor.

87
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,470
This meeting

88
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,360
is specially for this.

89
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,190
But then again,

90
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,460
it might be a good opportunity

91
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,540
for your Gu family.

92
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,190
Play it by ear.

93
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,860
These idiots.

94
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,510
What kind of idiots are those commissioners?

95
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,860
When they asked for titles and rewards,

96
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,900
they all rushed to be the first.

97
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,580
Now His Majesty needs them.

98
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,020
But all of them are being ungrateful.

99
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,220
Indeed a bunch of cowards and bastards!

100
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,909
Brother.

101
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,590
Now,

102
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,740
it's not the time you and I

103
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,780
fought on the battlefield with our fathers.

104
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,040
All the commissioners

105
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,380
are standing idly by

106

while guarding their territories

107
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,780
and gathering troops.

108
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,710
They only want to be local despots.

109
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,310
Zhou Ye.

110
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,330
Why did you involve an outsider

111
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,210
in such important military affairs?

112
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,220
How ridiculous it is!

113
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,420
Gu is not an outsider.

114
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,590
He is my brother.

115
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,630
Come in.

116
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,160
Jiusi, come in.

117
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,620
We need people now.

118
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,200
It's not restricted to the ranking of official positions.

119
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,730
[Clean and Sharp]

120
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Liang that bandit

121
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,710
has seized the throne

122
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,000
and claimed to be the Emperor.

123
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,350
He gathered 300,000 rebels

124
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,340
to besiege Eastern Capital.

125
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,710
How arrogant!

126
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,540
Now,

127
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,860
leaders of all the prefectures are standing idly by with their troops.

128
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,650
They're planning to take advantage of it without any loss.

129
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,420
To share the Emperor's and Father's burden,

130
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,540
we are duty-bound.

131
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,060
We, generals and soldiers of Youzhou,

132
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,220
should deploy troops

133
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,550
to save the Emperor and punish the rebels.

134
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,260
Everyone,

135
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,460
this is a serious matter.

136
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,980
Whatever thoughts

137
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,600
or questions you have,

138
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,950
no need to hold back.

139
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,940
Tell me.

140
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,940
Uncle Fan,

141
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,460
with all due respect,

142
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,060
even if Youzhou deploys all the soldiers,

143
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,780
there are still less than 100,000.

144
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,580
Compared to the 300,000 rebels,

145
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,700
the military power is so little.

146
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,770
If our army can collaborate with

147
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,020
soldiers in other prefectures,

148
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,220
and besiege them from different directions,

149
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,150
there might be more chances to win.

150
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,000
Fight Liang that bandit head-on,

151
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,710
tell me,

152
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,390
what is the likelihood of winning?

153
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,020
Less than 30%.

154
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,380
We have to deploy all the army we have

155
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,230
to get 30% of the chance to win.

156
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,540
Everyone,

157
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,340
do you think

158
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,540
it is worth it?

159
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,860
It's worth it.

160
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,500
Uncle Fan,

161
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,220
whether you can win a battle or not

162
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,030
is a matter.

163
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,250
Whether we should declare a war or not

164
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,310
is another matter.

165
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,900
Brother is right.

166
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,190
We are the people of Darong.

167
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,480
We should defend Darong to death.

168
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,190
Well said.

169
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,230
General.

170
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,740
I took care of your horse when I was ten.

171
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,580
Now I'm at this age,

172
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,300
I would like to fight for Darong once again.

173
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:32,909
Father.

174
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,840
Uncle Zhou.

175
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,580
I'm willing to go too.

176
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,230
Me too.

177
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,350
Good.

178
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,299
You're indeed warriors of Youzhou.

179
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,059
Bravo.

180
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,360
But there's one more problem.

181
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,650
We don't have enough provisions.

182
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,450
That's right.

183
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,230
The provisions in Youzhou

184
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,260
are only enough for people

185
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
to spend a winter.

186
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,100
If 100,000 soldiers are deployed to save the Emperor,

187
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,940
every soldier

188
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,560
will need three logistics soldiers.

189
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,940
In this case,

190
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,310
400,000 people

191
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,030
will be needed in total.

192
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,860
If you want 400,000 soldiers

193
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,580
to not worry about anything,

194
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,030
we also need

195
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,260
about 15,000,000 kilograms of grains.

196
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,340
The Gu family is willing to share the burden of the commissioner.

197
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,030
Brother,

198
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,960
making provision for the war,

199
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,030
somehow,

200
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,660
is a kind of business.

201
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,260
In terms of business,

202
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,570
no one indeed

203
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,570
is more suitable than the Gu family.

204
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,220
But it's a heavy responsibility

205
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,080
to be in charge of the provisions.

206
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,280
How can you treat it

207
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,640
the same way as the usual commercial?

208
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,620
But this is the best way now.

209
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,830
But I heard that

210
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,380
the real person-in-charge

211
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,490
of the Gu Business

212
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,670
is Madam Jiang.

213
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,390
Since she was widowed,

214
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,750
she's not been as energetic as before.

215
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,490
Who else in the Gu family

216
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,740
has

217
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,620
such courage and means

218
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,600
to do it with all strength?

219
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,900
I once went to Yangzhou to purchase necessities for military purposes

220
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,500
with Chief of Staff, Zhou Ye,

221
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,300
and had a transaction with the Gu Business.

222
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,770
The Young Madam of the Gu family, Lady Liu,

223
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,580
is the successor of Madam Jiang.

224
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,910
This girl is quite powerful.

225
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,460
Her means and courage

226
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,740
are rare to be seen.

227
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,460
It's said that

228
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,100
after she came to Youzhou,

229
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,910
she took over the Gu Business.

230
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,470
She and Gu Jiusi together

231
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,020
decided to

232
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,220
donate their assets.

233
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,700
Gu Jiusi's wife

234
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,380
is such a person.

235
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,580
It's best to ask her

236
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,150
to make provision for the war.

237
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,710
Fan.

238
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,180
If you insist on doing so,

239
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,990
the Gu family

240
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,190
must issue a written pledge.

241
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,380
Also,

242
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,260
we can only allow Lady Liu

243
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,500
to go south to collect grains alone.

244
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,220
The Gu family and others,

245
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,060
including Gu Jiusi,

246
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,240
should be detained in Youzhou

247
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,350
as a guarantee.

248
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,830
Brother.

249
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,730
The Gu family

250
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,660
has donated all their assets

251
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,390
to Youzhou.

252
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,890
Now they want to go south

253
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,790
to make provision for the war.

254
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,430
If we still...

255
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,510
Fan,

256
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,240
I know you are benevolent.

257
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,140
You also

258
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,180
don't doubt the people you used.

259
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,440
But the military provisions are related to the war.

260
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,120
You can only succeed but not fail.

261
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,510
We should be more cautious.

262
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,370
All right.

263
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,460
If the Gu family

264
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,870
can really do their best,

265
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,180
they will be a hero in Darong.

266
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,720
I didn't expect

267
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,700
our relationship

268
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,980
with Lord Liang

269
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,660
is riskier

270
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,520
than I thought.

271
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,790
However,

272
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,980
if we can get the provisions

273
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,340
for the soldiers of Youzhou

274
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,100
and guard the rear so that they have no worries,

275
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,130
it'll be the best proof

276
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,130
to prove that our Gu family is loyal.

277
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,380
That's right.

278
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,270
This time,

279
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,380
we owe Zhou

280
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,260
a big favour.

281
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,030
Thanks to his reminder.

282
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,260
Actually,

283
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,470
Zhou

284
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,020
knows how to be scheming.

285
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,100
It's just that he's of kind nature.

286
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,260
He treats people with sincerity.

287
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,460
When he thinks about

288
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,460
the nation and his friends,

289
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,390
he is prudent

290
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,750
and thoughtful.

291
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,350
But

292
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,140
our family is considered an outsider.

293
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,250
If we want to gain the trust

294
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,900
of Commissioner Fan and General Zhou,

295
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,100
it won't be that easy.

296
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,170
If they

297
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,900
ask us to sign a written pledge,

298
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,590
will it work?

299
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,890
Nowadays, the provisions of all prefectures are in short supply.

300
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,750
It's hard to say

301
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,750
whether it will work or not.

302
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,660
However,

303
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,020
even if we have to issue a written pledge,

304
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,350
we must take this job.

305
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,460
Great minds think alike.

306
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,940
Lord Liang's rebellion

307
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,940
will implicate the Gu family eventually.

308
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,340
The only way to protect us

309
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,900
is to rely on Youzhou.

310
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,210
[Commissioner's Mansion]

311
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,620
Madam Gu,

312
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,600
to make provision for the soldiers saving the Emperor,

313
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,380
you have to issue a written pledge.

314
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,710
Are you willing to do so?

315
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,830
Yes, I am.

316
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,460
Madam Gu.

317
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,120
The military order is iron-clad.

318
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,460
If the date is up,

319
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,540
and you don't get 15,000,000 kilograms of grains,

320
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,700
we'll hold the Gu family accountable.

321
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,230
You should think carefully

322
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,670
about the pros and cons.

323
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,060
I understand.

324
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,560
Magistrate Gu.

325
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,420
Your wife is going south to collect grains.

326
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,150
You'd better stay in Wangdu

327
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,580
and assist Young Master.

328
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,880
No mistake is allowed.

329
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,980
Yes, sir.

330
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,070
Good.

331
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,230
Soldiers,

332
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,810
go back to the camp and get ready for the departure.

333
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,820
Tomorrow morning,

334
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,220
depart together

335
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,620
with General Zhou and me.

336
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,540
Yes.

337
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,100
Fan,

338
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,930
do you want to go to the battlefield too?

339
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,030
When we were young,

340
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,050
we fought the enemies together

341
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,180
on the battlefield.

342
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,210
When did we treat each other as outsiders?

343
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,220
No way.

344
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,540
You have to stay in Youzhou

345
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,670
and call the shots.

346
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,770
I can handle

347
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,170
Liang that bandit alone.

348
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,900
Stop acting tough.

349
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,500
You're like an ox.

350
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,610
You think

351
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,420
you're so brave that you can fight countless people.

352
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,620
And you're always fighting in the frontline of the battlefield.

353
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,740
Without me,

354
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,310
who will protect you behind your back?

355
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:15,850
Fan.

356
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,870
Alright.

357
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,420
It's a deal.

358
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,540
Yu

359
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,620
will be in charge of Youzhou.

360
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,940
Father.

361
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,700
I want to go to the battlefield with you

362
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,860
to kill the bandits and punish the rebels.

363
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,670
Yu,

364
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,100
the responsibility of taking care of Youzhou

365
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,300
will be on your shoulders in the future.

366
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,730
[Clean and Sharp]

367
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,830
How about this?

368
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,820
Ye.

369
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,980
You and Yu have always been close.

370
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,870
You stay here

371
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,380
and help Jiusi

372
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,790
to assist Yu.

373
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,340
Fan,

374
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,100
Ye is still a newbie.

375
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,220
He's inexperienced and can't...

376
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,350
I'm willing to do so.

377
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,360
I'm willing to stay in Youzhou

378
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,860
and assist Young Master.

379
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,390
Good.

380
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,780
Soldiers,

381
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,390
when I was young,

382
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,100
I took part in many battles

383
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,060
with my father.

384
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,980
I witnessed how the late Emperor

385
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,980
built this great empire

386
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,080
and created a prosperous era by fighting on horses.

387
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,950
But

388
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:16,980
until now,

389
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,590
just a few decades,

390
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,740
it has already been

391
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,110
in a split state.

392
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,340
Now,

393
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,460
to protect the people of Darong

394
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,760
relies on us, the Youzhou people.

395
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,740
This expedition

396
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,630
will be very dangerous.

397
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,700
Although we are facing a death crisis and our dead bodies may not be treated well,

398
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,500
we must eliminate the enemy,

399
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,030
protect the people,

400
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,700
and bring peace to the world.

401
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,950
Yes.

402
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,110
Zhou Ye.

403
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,060
Gu.

404
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,580
Yuru.

405
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,540
Zhou Ye.

406
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,470
Did I

407
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,540
drag you down?

408
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,700
As a man,

409
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,740
who wouldn't want to go to the battlefield?

410
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,220
Yu.

411
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,710
Don't say that.

412
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,380
Go help your father

413
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,440
pack up his things.

414
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,790
Don't worry about me. Go.

415
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,430
Zhou,

416
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,990
I know why you stay.

417
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,300
Yuru and I

418
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,560
thank you on behalf of our family.

419
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,750
Jiusi, Yuru.

420
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
Get up hurriedly.

421
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,110
You and I

422
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,260
don't have to be that courteous.

423
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,960
I'm not staying

424
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,230
only to keep the secret

425
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,000
and take care of the Gu family.

426
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,940
Uncle Fan is good at calling the shots.

427
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,870
He knows how to deploy people well.

428
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,740
He must have his reasons

429
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,590
to ask me to stay and help Yu.

430
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,370
But your father may misunderstand you

431
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,500
for being a coward staying in Youzhou.

432
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,630
It doesn't matter.

433
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,780
My father has never favoured me since I was a child.

434
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,510
I'm used to it.

435
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,740
In my heart,

436
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,290
I just hope they can

437
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,090
win the battle

438
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,940
and return safely.

439
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,930
I feel uneasy

440
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,660
for you to go to the south alone.

441
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,450
The chaotic world is full of danger.

442
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,980
How can I not accompany you?

443
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,820
Didn't we talk

444
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,020
this matter through?

445
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,590
General Zhou asked you to stay

446
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,150
because he doesn't trust the Gu family

447
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,480
and he wants more guarantees.

448
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,910
They are in high positions.

449
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,510
It's nothing unusual for them to be cautious.

450
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,710
I've thought about it.

451
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,700
I'm going to call back

452
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,940
the old managers of the Gu family

453
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
to form a caravan.

454
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,020
We must bring back

455
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,820
15,000,000 kilograms of grains.

456
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,140
When the mission is completed,

457
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,340
they will believe us.

458
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
I understand, but...

459
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,550
Jiusi.

460
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,060
We are supposed to be united as husband and wife.

461
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,260
Come hell or high water,

462
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,990
I should go through it with you.

463
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,470
I know you're worried about me.

464
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,830
But before this,

465
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,340
we've been through a lot.

466
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,660
Previously, we even faced a death crisis

467
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,590
in Heifeng Fort.

468
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,660
I'm no longer

469
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,260
that weak woman like before.

470
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,940
Didn't you say

471
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,120
you want me to be the real Liu Yuru?

472
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,070
The real Liu Yuru

473
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,160
is supposed to travel around.

474
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,720
Eldest Sister.

475
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,750
Come back early.

476
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Take care of my mother-in-law at home.

477
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,560
Take care of yourself.

478
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,260
Although Huarong is closed for now,

479
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,220
you may go and clean the shop

480
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,670
when you are free.

481
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,190
I know.

482
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,060
Don't worry, Eldest Sister.

483
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,450
You're the most diligent.

484
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,510
I can rest assured.

485
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,600
That's enough.

486
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,270
Go back.

487
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,430
Jiusi.

488
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,810
Take Yuzhao and the others back.

489
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,570
I'll see you off for another mile.

490
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,970
Just one more mile. I'll go back after that.

491
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Brother-in-law.

492
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,640
You said that at the gate just now.

493
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,700
Now you've seen them off

494
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,160
for ten miles from Wangdu.

495
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,980
It seems

496
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,980
we're going to arrive in Jixian very soon.

497
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,470
Why do you talk so much?

498
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,510
Do you want to go?

499
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,530
If you don't,

500
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,460
go back and feed the horses.

501
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,420
I'm a guard assigned by my sister.

502
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,860
What's the use if you don't allow me?

503
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,580
Besides,

504
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,610
everyone knows that

505
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,070
my sister has the final say

506
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,990
in the Gu House.

507
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,940
You have not.

508
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,610
So what if I have not?

509
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,660
I want to be a kept man.

510
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,190
It's none of your business.

511
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,150
Jiusi.

512
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
Go back.

513
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,940
If you miss me,

514
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,260
write to me.

515
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,710
Okay.

516
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,860
Go back.

517
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,820
Sir.

518
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,530
Are you going to

519
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,730
write to Young Madam?

520
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,070
Young Madam just left today.

521
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,340
It hasn't been half an hour

522
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,540
since you came back from seeing her off.

523
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,020
You're talking too much.

524
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,350
Get out.

525
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,390
[Yuru]

526
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,150
Yuru.

527
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,910
15,000,000 kilograms of grains are too hard to achieve.

528
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,190
I regret

529
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,670
letting you go alone.

530
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,390
We plan to

531
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:50,190
♫I borrowed moonlight from fireflies♫

532
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,820

We'll try our best.

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,750
♫I held it in my arms♫

I miss you too.

571
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,000
For the sake of you,

572
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,020
I must go back safely.

573
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,310
Jiusi.

574
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,380
It must be another letter from Yuru, right?

575
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,570
She was so desperate to write me letters every day.

576
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,780
She said she missed me so much.

577
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,640
I'm so annoyed.

578
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,310
I see.

579
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,930
The daughter of Commander Qin from Bingzhou

580
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,050
you mentioned before.

581
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,650
How is she?

582
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,390
What else could she be?

583
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,030
She doesn't like me.

584
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,520
How could it be?

585
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,340
Her family background

586
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,070
is much worse than your family.

587
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,550
I'm just a Chief of Staff.

588
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,430
And...

589
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,910
I'm not as valued by Father

590
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,140
as other brothers.

591
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,620
Commander Qin

592
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,460
doesn't have many children.

593
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,590
When he was 30,

594
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,580
he got his only daughter.

595
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,030
She's the apple of his eye.

596
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,620
It's normal

597
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,310
for him to be reluctant.

598
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,070
Don't worry.

599
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,400
It doesn't matter.

600
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,550
She and I are just strangers.

601
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,800
Even if I failed this time,

602
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,720
there'd be nothing to regret.

603
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,790
It's just that

604
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,380
I disappointed my father again.

605
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,270
Zhou,

606
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,090
I think no matter the personality

607
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,070
or the talents,

608
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,090
you should have been

609
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,380
more standout.

610
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,560
If you are willing to do so,

611
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,460
I can help you.

612
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,340
No need.

613
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,820
Father and Uncle Fan,

614
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,190
along with my brother,

615
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,310
pursue the dream of

616
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,860
ensuring the people of Youzhou

617
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,060
live and work in peace

618
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,320
and the world can be peaceful.

619
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,060
Of course, I think so too.

620
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,260
Since

621
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,520
we share the same thought,

622
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,110
and we do it for the sake of the people,

623
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,340
no matter which position I'm holding,

624
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,800
whether I'm valued or not,

625
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
or whether I'm in charge of the army,

626
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,380
it's not that important.

627
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,220
But what if one day

628
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,340
you are in deep water?

629
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,780
If that day comes,

630
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,820
I won't disappoint everyone.

631
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,670
It's too late.

632
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,150
Hurry.

633
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,060
Hurry up.

634
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,430
Uncle!

635
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,710
Uncle!

636
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,610
What happened that made you so panic?

637
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,180
Sir.

638
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,940
It's going to rain cats and dogs.

639
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,740
If we don't

640
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,420
get the grains out immediately,

641
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,950
it'll all rot in the ground.

642
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,110
I'm leaving.

643
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,040
Let's help him.

644
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,540
Help.

645
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,380
Help!

646
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,700
Come on.

647
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,220
Harder.

648
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,580
-One, two.
-What happened?

649
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,790
Young Madam.

650
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,660
The rain is getting heavier.

651
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,420
Now the carriage is stuck.

652
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,880
It won't be out for a while.

653
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,390
Sister,

654
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,000
it's raining heavily.

655
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
Go back and take shelter.

656
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,950
Leave it to us.

657
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,100
No way.

658
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,300
It's about military provisions.

659
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,620
There's no time to waste.

660
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,500
Let's help each other.

661
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,470
OK.

662
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:56,740
Okay.

663
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,070
Come and help.

664
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,180
Come on.

665
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,020
Come on.

666
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,830
Listen to my order.

667
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,420
Harder together.

668
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,260
One.

669
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,430
Two.

670
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,180
Three.

671
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,290
One.

672
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:10,900
Two.

673
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,990
Three.

674
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,220
Those who are behind, keep it up.

675
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,930
Those who are behind, keep it up.

676
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,030
Hurry up.

677
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,550
Officers,

678
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,500
have some hot soup

679
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,630
to warm yourself up.

680
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,140
Thank you.

681
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,670
Thank you for your help.

682
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,250
Otherwise, the grains

683
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,590
will rot in the ground.

684
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:52,830
Thank you.

685
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,900
Thank you.

686
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,180
Thank you so much.

687
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,600
Come on, brothers.

688
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,330
Have some hot soup to warm your bodies up.

689
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:00,890
Here.

690
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,460
Thank you.

691
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,650
Thank you.

692
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,110
-Thank you for your help.
-We appreciate it.

693
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,030
Young Madam.

694
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,420
All the grains

695
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,670
have been counted.

696
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,570
Other than the grains

697
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,740
ruined by the rain today,

698
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,580
there are

699
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,240
about 12,500,000 kilograms of grains in total.

700
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,160
We still need another 2,500,000 kilograms.

701
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,530
Military orders are iron-clad.

702
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,140
We can't miss any kilogram of it.

703
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,670
Besides,

704
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,780
the generals and soldiers in Youzhou

705
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,380
are still risking their lives

706
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,350
for world peace.

707
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,840
We can't leave them to starve.

708
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:43,980
But

709
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,080
we've been to all the prefectures

710
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,060
where we can collect the grains.

711
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,280
Exactly.

712
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,120
Yes.

713
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,450
There's one more place.

714
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,540
Young Madam.

715
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,940
You can't go to Yangzhou.

716
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,160
Yes, Young Madam.

717
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,970
You can't go to Yangzhou.

718
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,180
You really can't go.

719
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,620
Everyone,

720
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,260
on the way to collecting grains,

721
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,510
without your help,

722
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,580
I won't be able to collect

723
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,990
the 12,500,000 kilograms of grains.

724
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,380
Hence, I would like to

725
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,500
express my gratitude to you all.

726
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,290
Young Madam.

727
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,700
Young Madam.

728
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,230
What are you talking about?

729
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,860
We, a bunch of old men,

730
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,480
are so desperate to gather together every day

731
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,020
and do business

732
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,380
together with you.

733
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Yes, Young Madam.

734
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,710
Now,

735
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,280
I have to trouble you for the last time

736
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,460
to escort the last batch of grains in Yan City

737
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,830
back to Youzhou first.

738
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,350
Well,

739
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,720
what about you?

740
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,740
Yangzhou,

741
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,620
I must go.

742
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,070
Young Madam.

743
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,060
Don't worry.

744
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,500
I'm not making a hasty decision.

745
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,800
Yangzhou is dangerous

746
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,140
not only because Wang Shanquan is cruel,

747
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,150
but also because

748
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
Luo Zishang is scheming behind him.

749
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,270
But now I've received news that

750
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,300
after Wang Shanquan became the sole ruler of Yangzhou,

751
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,240
he and Luo Zishang

752
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,300
had some disputes.

753
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,060
Right now,

754
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,190
Luo Zishang is not in Yangzhou.

755
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,260
With only Wang Shanquan,

756
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,260
there's nothing to be afraid of.

757
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,410
[Yuelai Inn]

758
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:16,710
Sister,

759
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,980
you know what?

760
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,980
With your now dressing,

761
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,040
I couldn't recognize you at a glance.

762
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:21,860

You can't relax even if no one is around.

If anything goes wrong in Yangzhou,

772
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,110
it'll be fatal to us.

00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,740
I've asked Manager He

to escort the grains

783
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,460

784
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,380
I still need to collect

785
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,460
the remaining 2,500,000 kilograms of grains.

we'll reach Yangzhou City in half a day.

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,470
Young Master Su,

790
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,980
are we really going to Yangzhou?

791
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,350
Are you scared?

792
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:47,660
A little.

Now that we're here,

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,240
if I don't cause them a great loss,

795
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,370

Sir,

802
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,640
you can't joke about this.

he recognized me at first sight just now,

872

but he immediately covered it up for us.

873
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,380

00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,780

00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,800
Who do you think my brother is?

955
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,820
He doesn't show any weakness in his accents at all.

956
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,430
No matter

957
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,900
where we go all this time,

958
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,420
in a few days,

959
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,340
he can nearly master

960
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,700
all the local dialects.

961
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:42,990
Unlike me,

962
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,060
I've been in Youzhou

963
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,330
for some time.

964
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,330
Every time I talk,

965
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,660
it still sounds like

966
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,060
the accents in Cangzhou.

967
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,830
I hope Lady Xifeng

968
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,750
won't recognize me.

969
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,390
She won't.

970
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,220
Lady Xifeng owns the Lanxiao House.

971
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,940
She sees countless strangers every day.

972
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,540
She only met you once.

973
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,340
Besides,

974
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,660
it's been so long.

975
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,030
Even a deity should have forgotten it.

976
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,040
Take a break first.

977
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,180
Then, you should go out

978
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
and gather the information we need.

979
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,030
Okay.

980
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,240
Someone sent a letter to this guest room.

981
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,460
[Tonight 7 p.m. at Lanxiao House's private room]

982
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,330
[Tonight 7 p.m. at Lanxiao House's private room]

983
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,850
[Liu Yuru moved into Lanxiao House]

984
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,110
She really came.
