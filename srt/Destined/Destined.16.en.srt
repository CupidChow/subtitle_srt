00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,130
Have a good rest first.

5
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,250
After you're done resting,

6
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,570
I'll personally escort you to Wangdu.

7
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,509
Where is Yuru? How is she?

8
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,110
Don't worry.

9
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,920
I've asked the physician

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,130
to check on Yuru.

11
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,690
He said she was fine.

12
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,000
It's just that her vitality is weak.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,130
She's now resting in the east chamber.

14
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,790
Brother,

15
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,000

You can marry someone who suits you better.

You're right.

If I'm gone,

109
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,820
you will certainly find someone

110

with a brighter future than me,

111
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,910
who dotes on you more than I do.

112
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,240
It's probable to find

113
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,880
someone with a brighter future than you.

114
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,870
But where can I find someone

115
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,050

W-Why are you laughing?

117
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,450
I'm laughing.

118
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,610
Because I think

119
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,190
I won the bet.

120
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,930
I bet you're so faithful

121
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,760
that you won't leave me behind.

122
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,320
I bet you are so responsible

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,920
that you won't put me in danger.

124
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,430
I also bet that you can be competent in the future

125
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,770
so that I can rely on you.

126
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,650
At least,

127
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,000
before we divorce,

128
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,030
as long as I'm your wife for one day,

129
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,040
you can keep out the wind and rain

130
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,000
for me.

131
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,110
I've bet everything I have

132
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,710
on this bet.

133
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,320
So I have to trust you.

134
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,870
I can only trust you.

135

Have you taken the medicine?

137
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:55,990
Yes, I have.

138
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,120
Since you have taken it, go to bed early.

139
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,540
I-I'm leaving.

140
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,180
Aren't you leaving?

141
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,820
Why are you back again?

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,530
We are husband and wife.

143
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,600
Why should I leave?

144
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,410
Let's sleep.

145
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:14,990

151
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,500
What's wrong? Why are you being so mysterious?

152
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,160
Have a seat.

153
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,060

154
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,120
Have you

155
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,040
been resting well lately?

156
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm good.

157
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,950
Not only have I had good meals, but I also have slept well.

158
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,340
Have some tea.

159
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,370
Here.

160
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,470
Have some tea.

161
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,090
I understand.

162
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,960
Her vitality is greatly damaged.

163
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,560
I have witnessed Yuru

164
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,420
take all the medicine she should.

165
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,550
And now she is getting better.

166
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,280
Don't worry.

167
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,120
No, that's not what I meant.

168
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,760
You are a smart one.

169
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,740
I don't understand.

170
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,390
No, it...

171
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,640
I... am not supposed

172
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,330
to say these words.

Jiusi.

174
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,780
There are some things

175
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,080
I shouldn't say

176
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,510
as your elder brother.

177
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,290
I was entrusted by your mother.

178
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,710
The safety and health

179
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,350
of you two here

180
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,990
are all on my shoulders.

181
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,550
So I dare not make any mistake.

182
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,600
Brother,

183
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,420
why are you speaking in a halting way today?

184
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,210
We are brothers.

185
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,770
Just say it.

186
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,370
Or...

187
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,300
Or did I do something wrong?

188
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,100
That's right.

189
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,210
I'll be frank then.

190
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,070
Recently,

191
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,330
have you

192
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,930
left your own room

193
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,270
and moved here

194
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,870
to live with Third Sister?

195
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,590
Yes.

196
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,300
Do you remember what the physician said?

197
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,390
The physician said

198
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,240
before you get well,

199
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,320
you are not allowed to have sexual intercourse.

200
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,990
Right?

201
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,380
You're too impatient.

202
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,660
No, no, no.

203
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,710
What are you thinking about?

204
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,050
No, no, no. I didn't...

205
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,680
Look.

206
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,440
It'd be nothing if you didn't do it.

207
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,450
Why are you panicking?

208
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:28,950
No.

209
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,720
Let me explain.

210
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,810
I moved here because...

211
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,690
You don't have to explain to me

212
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,540
about things that happened between you two, right?

213
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,210
I'm just

214
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,810
kindly reminding you.

215
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,660
You have to listen to my explanation.

216
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,130
I came here just to keep her company

217
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,790
so that I would feel relieved.

218
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,830
You're overthinking it.

219
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:46,970
I understand.

220
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,190
Perhaps

221
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,450
it's because you two

222
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,460
love each other deeply.

223
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,390
Perhaps I gave it too much thought.

224
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,060
Yes.

225
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,290
Thank you for your concern.

226
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,350
I know what to do.

227
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,860
I know how far to go and when to stop.

228
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,540
I'm telling you...

229
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,340
See you later.

230
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,870
Look.

231
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,800
He's already married

232
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,850
but still so shy.

233
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,860
Be careful.

234
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,670
What's wrong with you?

235
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,730
You look flurried.

236
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,620
It's nothing.

237
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,350
There must be something.

238
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,310
What did Zhou tell you?

239
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,540
Nothing.

240
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,470
Don't tell me

241
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,480
it's bad news.

242
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,050
You've heard

243
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,350
much bad news recently.

244
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,860
That's why you are so paranoid.

245
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,620
Nothing.

246
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,900

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,060

Come and have a look.

277
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,220
What are you giggling about?

278
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:35,970
It's been a long time

279
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,570
since I saw this many people.

280
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,500
Me too.

281
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,070
Look.

282
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,460
Women in Youzhou

283
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,970
can even cross the street by riding horses.

284
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,100
That's very cool.

285
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,330
Looks like your riding lessons

286
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,420
were worth it.

287
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,740
I like Youzhou.

288
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,670
Me too.

[Happiness Lies in Giving Help to Others]

290
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,660

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,520
Young Madam.

292
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,869
Jiusi, Yuru.

293
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:26,460
Mother.

294
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,140
Mother.

295
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,100
You are finally back.

296
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,910
You've lost a lot of weight.

297
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,770
Young Madam.

298
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,970
You've suffered a lot along the way.

299
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,660
Yuru.

300
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,270
Greet your mother-in-law.

301
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,790
It's good enough that you're back.

302
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Let's go inside.

303
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,360
I already prepared food for you.

304
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,500
Hurry.

305
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,790
It smells so good.

306
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,650
I'm full.

307
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,700
Have some tea. Don't choke.

308
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,760
Why is Yuru eating so little?

309
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,240
Yes.

310
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,920
Isn't this what we've been looking forward to

311
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,010
all the way here?

312
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,110
I'm eating too.

313
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,660
It's just that I'm not

314
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,150
wolfing it down like you.

315
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,680
Munan.

316
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,880
Wrap up these dishes for me.

317
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,960
I can still eat them after I warm them up tomorrow.

318
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,590
No need.

319
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,810
You can ask the kitchen

320
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,070
to make you new dishes tomorrow.

321
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,950
No, no, no.

322
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,690
We've been starving all the way here.

323
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,950
We were really scared.

324
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,550
Now I feel uncomfortable

325
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,050
when I see someone waste their food.

326
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,070
My son has indeed grown up.

327
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,110
You've become sensible.

328
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,240
Mother,

329
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,520
why didn't you

330
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,580
ask about my father?

331
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,830
Didn't you just

332
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,610
tell what you saw and heard along the way

333
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,420
without mentioning him?

334
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,040
My father...

335
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,140
For the past three months,

336
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,560
I've been waiting for you in Youzhou alone.

337
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,740
I often

338
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,180
couldn't sleep all night.

339
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,490
I was afraid

340
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,850
I couldn't see

341
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,900
you three again.

342
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,220
You must be tired after the journey. You should go to bed early.

343
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,240
Madam.

344
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,650
Please go back to your room early and have some rest.

345
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,010
From now on,

346
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,960
these plants should be moved into

347
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,180
the greenhouse every night.

348
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,030
The weather in Youzhou

349
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,020
is not as good as in Yangzhou.

350
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,860
Yes.

351
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,150
The weather in the north is very dry.

352
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,490
Send some pear soup

353
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,760
to Jiusi and Yuru.

354
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,610
Don't worry, Madam.

355
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:50,970
Madam.

356
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,870
I'm sorry. I shouldn't tell you this.

357
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,020
But why has Young Madam

358
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,340
become so aloof towards you

359
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,090
after a few months of

360
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,310
you not seeing each other?

361
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,250
Since you met,

362
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,310
she hasn't greeted you once.

363
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,250
She's not being aloof

364
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,450
but sad.

365
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,930
Usually,

366
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,180
she calls me, who is her mother-in-law, Mother.

367
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,680
But now,

368
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,280
her own mother is gone.

369
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,760
Tell me.

370
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,820
How could she

371
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,630
still call me Mother?

372
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,000
From now on,

373
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,190
whether she greets me or not,

374
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,250
whatever she calls me,

375
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
it depends on her.

376
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,510
Although I'm not her biological mother,

377
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,450
our home is the same

378
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,360
as her own.

379
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,710
Yes, Madam.

380
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,810
Where's Mother-in-law?

381
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,290
Don't you know?

382
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,340
What?

383
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,660
Didn't Young Madam tell you?

384
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,320
Young Madam's mother

385
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
didn't get to come to Youzhou at all.

386
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,560
On the night of the accident in Yangzhou,

387
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,150
she already...

388
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,840
Does she know?

389
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,180
Of course.

390
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Madam specially ordered

391
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,750
Madam Yue and her children

392
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,810
to stay in the villa

393
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,610
so that Young Madam would avoid the sad memories.

394
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,340
Go back.

395
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,290
You're back.

396
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,880
What's wrong?

397
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,070
Yuru.

398
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,060
We've experienced life and death together.

399
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,260
We're the closest people to each other.

400
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,540
If you have any difficulties,

401
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,510
you must tell me.

402
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,920
Don't always put everything on your shoulders.

403
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,900
Why are you suddenly saying this?

404
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,310
Why didn't you tell me?

405
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,310
Are you talking about

406
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,800
my mother?

407
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,470
All the way we came through,

408
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,350
you supported me and comforted me.

409
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,610
But I didn't know

410
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,270
you also experienced the pain

411
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,600
of losing a close relative like me.

412
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,070
The whole journey was in chaos.

413
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,670
Our lives were in danger.

414
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,510
I didn't hide it from you

415
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,640
on purpose.

416
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,960
But I should be aware of that.

417
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,080
I also want to support you

418
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,920
and comfort you.

419
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,330
I know I was immature.

420
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,660
But it's different now.

421
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,790
I don't want to see you being so stoic.

422
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,770
You don't have to be so tough all the time.

423
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Even if you cry, you'll feel better.

424
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,850
Jiusi.

425
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,550
I'm fine now.

426
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,320
When I arrived home,

427
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,300
I have everything.

428
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,160
Didn't you say

429
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,620
everything will be fine?

430
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,940
Why are you eating so little again?

431
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,230
I got up in a hurry. So, I'm not hungry.

432
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,040
Young Madam suffered gastric pain

433
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,090
twice this morning.

434
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:50,670
Yinhong.

435
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,970
Since you came to Youzhou,

436
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,140
your gastric pain has happened

437
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,190
too frequently.

438
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,040
Did your stomach get damaged

439
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,090
on the way?

440
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,730
Or you're still not used to the new environment?

441
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,190
Or

442
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,830
you don't like the food in the north?

443
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,260
I'm not that delicate.

444
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,940
But it's not a joke

445
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,750
if you have something wrong with your spleen or stomach.

446
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,350
Should we ask a physician to check on you?

447
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,770
Many physicians checked on me before,

448
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,500
but they didn't find anything.

449
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,550
Maybe I'm just not used to the new environment

450
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,650
like you said.

451
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,830
I'll be fine soon.

452
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,730
Don't bother about it.

453
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,060
Go out and have some fun.

454
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,420
Along the way to Youzhou,

455
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,270
I've accumulated a lot of accounting.

456
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,450
Including managers and workers, thousands of people

457
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,220
are waiting to reoperate the shops.

458
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,620
I'm going to be very busy.

459
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:37,960
Go ahead.

460
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,030
Fine.

461
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,640
Preserved fruits.

462
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,660
High-grade preserved plums.

463
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,760
Sir, would you like to try some?

464
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,950
[Preserved Fruits]

465
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,980
These are in-season plums from Huainan.

466
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,750
They're only available after ten times of steaming and nine times of drying.

467
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,880
These are all I have.

468
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,060
No more left if they are sold out.

469
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,150
Would you like some?

470
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,830
How many do you have? I'll take them all.

471
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,500
No problem.

472
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,070
There are 11 counties in Youzhou,

473
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,120
but only ten business permits

474
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,860
[Fortune and Longevity]

475
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,230
are issued every month.

476
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,130
The documents I handed in

477
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,430
in these days

478
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,670
haven't been approved yet.

479
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,640
It's said that the world has been in chaos recently.

480
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,780
There are too many merchants

481
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,640
coming to do business in Youzhou.

482
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,220
They are all lining up.

483
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,500
But if we can't do business,

484
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,600
we'll have to wait day by day.

485
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,240
Thousands of people

486
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,590
rely on our business.

487
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,600
We can't survive

488
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,170
by living off our past gains.

489
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,350
Zhou told me

490
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,580
Commissioner Fan is a man of rules.

491
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,320
He always follows all the procedures and rules,

492
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,210
and he's honest and upright.

493
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,850
Even Zhou Gaolang himself

494
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,170
can't always get what he wants.

495
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,650
Young Master Zhou is a gentleman.

496
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,840
When I was waiting for you

497
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,140
in Youzhou,

498
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,950
he took good care of our family.

499
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,760
He also told me

500
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,350
those words before.

501
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,800
But I didn't take them to heart.

502
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,260
I doubt that

503
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,730
there's such a scrupulous official

504
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,990
in this world.

505
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,550
Even if our Gu family

506
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,060
lost our backer,

507
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,740
we could just spend money to open the way.

508
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,200
Who would have thought

509
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,590
Youzhou

510
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,730
is really a hard nut?

511
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,260
Even if I wanted to trade money

512
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,320
for some benefits,

513
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,700
I couldn't manage to do it.

514
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,360
The government and the politicians

515
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,820
somehow value farmers more than merchants.

516
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,580
It's nothing that

517
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,130
we experienced a setback.

518
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,290
There are no generals who always win in the world.

519
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,070
During my one-year-old catch,

520
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,620
I grabbed an abacus.

521
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,020
I started the business when I was 19.

522
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,050
Later, my younger brother made a smashing hit.

523
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,540
Everything went well

524
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,260
when I was doing business in Yangzhou.

525
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,310
But I learned those skills

526
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,010
from a place of fabulous wealth.

527
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,730
Now that we're in Youzhou,

528
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,000
my previous experience

529
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,440
is of no use at all.

530
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,700
I'm afraid...

531
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,970
I'm really old.

532
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,650
You're not.

533
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,150
The scripts for story-telling said

534
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,880
Madam She led the troops when she was 80 years old.

535
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,030
Did Jiusi tell you that?

536
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,630
Be careful.

537
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,180
What's the matter? Why are you so secretive?

538
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,250
Look.

539
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,140
Preserved plums.

540
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,800
Mother.

541
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,170
I want to eat preserved plums.

542
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,280
Do you have any at home?

543
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,880
Yes, I'll get some for you.

544
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,560
Eldest Madam.

545
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,520
Just ask the maids

546
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,830
to do these things.

547
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,050
No way, they don't know

548
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,980
how much icing Yuru likes to add.

549
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,980
I know you like them since you were young.

550
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,780
You even love to add extra icing.

551
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,490
I saw them on the street today.

552
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,990
It's said that they are in-season plums from Huainan.

553
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,330
You've had a bad appetite recently.

554
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,790
Try one. It's appetizing.

555
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,830
Here.

556
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,680
Yuru, what's wrong?

557
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,900
Are you feeling unwell?

558
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,670
Say something.

559
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,780
Jiusi.

560
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,770
I miss my mother.

561
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,060
I miss my mother.

562
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,980
I miss my mother.

563
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,010
Jiusi.

564
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,630
I miss my mother.

565
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,110
When my mother gave birth to me,

566
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,780
she suffered serious damage.

567
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,770
She had been weak since then.

568
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,280
She was afraid that

569
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,940
if something happened to her,

570
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,270
she couldn't take care of me.

571
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,550
I was precocious.

572
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,570
So my mother didn't care about the taboos

573
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,700
and always taught me

574
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,550
what I should do

575
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,950
and how to survive

576
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,170
after she was gone.

577
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,990
Since I was young,

578
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,260
I've been practising

579
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,180
how to deal with the worst situation

580
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,410
that my mother is gone

581
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,940
and I have no one can rely on.

582
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,490
When I was five,

583
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,190
I could memorize the prescription my mother always took

584
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,990
and decoct the medicine for her.

585
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,960
Once,

586
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,040
I tried the medicine in secret.

587
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,139
It was really bitter.

588
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,170
Then, my mother

589
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,050
put a preserved plum

590
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,929
into my mouth.

591
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,080
It tasted sweet and sour.

592
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,790
That's why

593
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,820
you love preserved fruits so much.

594
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,960
Mother held me and said,

595
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,679
she took the bitter medicine

596
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,199
to keep me company longer.

597
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,270
She also said

598
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
she had suffered all the hardships.

599
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,889
In the future,

600
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,270
I would have a good time after suffering those hardships.

601
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,909
But our days in the Liu family

602
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,239
had always been hard.

603
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,770
It was harder day by day.

604
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,470
There was no charcoal in winter.

605
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,260
No new clothes during New Year.

606
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,490
You know what happened

607
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,390
in the past.

608
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,810
My mother and I

609
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,040
always prepared for the worst

610
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,470
of everything.

611
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,520
We didn't dare to put our faith in luck.

612
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,560
We were afraid that

613
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,670
we would be in a spin by then.

614
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,830
Mother taught me.

615
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,400
No matter how painfully it hurts,

616
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,460
I have to endure it.

617
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,170
I can't indulge in sorrow.

618
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,610
It's even more useless to cry out in pain.

619
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,310
Mother said

620
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,290
I have to survive

621
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,080
and consider the big picture.

622
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,590
When we first met,

623
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,480
you despised me for being scheming and calculative.

624
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,880
I have indeed been like this

625
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,500
since I was a kid.

626
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,200
But now,

627
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,380
I like you very much.

628
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,380
Before we arrived in Youzhou,

629
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,090
I forced myself to hang in there.

630
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,540
But once I reached Youzhou,

631
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,480
I felt relieved.

632
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,980
Only then I realized that

633
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,700
I couldn't eat

634
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,010
or sleep because of the pain.

635
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,550
I tried so hard to bury myself in my work.

636
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,440
Jiusi.

637
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,900
Actually, I'm not tough at all.

638
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,650
Liu Yuru,

639
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,950
you don't have to

640
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,280
be tough alone anymore.

641
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,810
If you are so tough,

642
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,290
what else do you want me to do?

643
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,480
Do you hear me?

644
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,100
When I walked on the street today,

645
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,580
I found that although Youzhou

646
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,190
isn't as rich as Yangzhou,

647
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,470
the people

648
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,640
are always smiling.

649
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,170
They feel blissful from the bottom of their hearts.

650
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,300
So we

651
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,480
will also get better and better.

652
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,000

In the future,

656
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,830
it will be much sweeter.

657
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,170
Just like the preserved fruits.

Really?

659
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,020
Yes.

00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,670
how much icing

I'm not telling you.

674

much better today.

That's great.

00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,950
Usually,

758
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,630
we earn money

759
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,060
without doing any chores.

760
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,790
It was so in the peaceful years.

761
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,540
Now the world is in chaos.

762
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,190
From the perspective of the locals in Youzhou,

763
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,110
we ate

764
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,000
their food,

765
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,090
but none of us

766
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,010
helps them produce grain.
