[Episode 9]

4
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,990
Your elders sent you out

5
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,840
to practice this trade?

6
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,910
Be careful with what you say,

7
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,210
or things will get bad for you.

8
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,020
Mr. Zhou,

9
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,170
he's the commissioner's son.

10
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,870
Don't argue with him.

11
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,750
It's just the booze talking.

12
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,270
Ignore him. Let's go.

13
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,750
He's the commissioner's son.

14
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,590
So what?

15
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,910
He insulted you

16
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,790
in broad daylight.

17
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,630
Is he above the law?

18
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,510
In Yangzhou,

19
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,140
I am the law.

20
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,630
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhou.

21
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,310
Let's go.

22
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,510
We're in Yangzhou after all.

23
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,950
Let's go.

24
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,150
Okay, Boss Liu.

25
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,350
Sweetie.

26
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,500
Don't leave so soon.

27
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,110
You just talked business

28
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,310
with this gentleman.

29
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,780
Why don't you

30
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,990
talk business with me too?

31
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,110
You're so pretty.

32
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,110
Why don't you

33
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,910
be my fifth concubine?

34
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,870
Young Master.

35
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,430
Go away!

36
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,300
How dare you hit me?

37
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,550
Stupid woman. Beat her up!

38
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,190
Go.

39
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,120
Young Madam.

40
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,870
Mr. Wang.

41
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,660
Mr. Wang.

42
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,900
She's the Young Madam of the Gu family.

43
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,030
Don't touch her!

44
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,270
Let go of me! Let go!

45
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,920
Boss Liu!

46
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,510
Wang Rong.

47
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,330
You think you can boss anyone around, don't you?

48
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,430
Then let's see

49
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,380
who's the real boss in Yangzhou.

50
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,720
What are you going to do?

51
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,190
Jiusi!

52
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,870
Jiusi.

53
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,620
There's gonna be big trouble.

54
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,110
Yeah.

55
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,030
I said I'd protect you.

56
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,250
Let me make it clear today.

57
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,510
In the Gu family,

58
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,070
women run the house.

59
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,090
Without my mother,

60
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,430
the Gu family wouldn't

61
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,430
have gained everything we have now.

62
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,430
The women of my family

63
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,950
are a thousand times more capable

64
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,710
than most men.

65
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,030
My wife ventured out for business.

66
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,150
There's no shame in that.

67
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,670
No one gets to judge her.

68
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,750
Before anyone

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,150
speaks ill of her again,

70
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,210
they'd better think about

71
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,990
whether their legs

72
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,850
can endure the pain Wang Rong did.

73
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,690
Do I make myself clear?

74
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,910
Yes. Yes.

75
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,270
Who's the real boss here?

76
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,790
You are. You are.

77
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,030
If you run into my wife again…

78
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,010
I'll greet her respectfully.

79
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,750
Get up.

80
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,230
Send your Young Master back.

81
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,690
Get his leg treated before it's too late.

82
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,790
Hurry up.

83
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,590
Young Master.

84
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,130
-Careful.
-Careful.

85
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,030
Mr. Zhou.

86
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,350
Mr. Zhou.

87
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,390
This all began with me.

88
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,630
I'm sorry

89
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,410
to get you in such trouble.

90
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,830
Not at all, Boss Liu.

91
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,550
That guy is a sleaze.

92
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,320
If it weren't you

93
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,590
but another woman

94
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,710
who was humiliated like that,

95
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,420
I'd not

96
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,880
look the other way either.

97
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,800
You're a righteous man.

98
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,850
But the Wang family is powerful in Yangzhou.

99
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,710
Don't worry.

100
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,130
He doesn't dare do anything to me.

101
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,830
Are you alright?

102
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,230
Mr. Gu,

103
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,830
you're brave

104
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,130
and honorable.

105
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,870
Thank you for your help, Mr. Zhou.

106
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,510
I'll treat you to dinner some other day.

107
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,510
See you next time.

108
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,670
Munan, walk Mr. Zhou out.

109
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,230
Yes.

110
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,950
Liu Yuru.

111
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,460
Are you

112
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,150
angry with me?

113
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,400
Be angry if you want.

114
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,230
I don't think

115
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,430
I did anything wrong.

116
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,250
He messed with you and deserved to be beaten.

117
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,790
I gave you my word.

118
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,470
I said I'd protect you

119
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,390
and I will.

120
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,830
I'll protect you from now on.

121
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,690
If anyone messes with you,

122
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,030
I'll break his leg.

123
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,350
If anyone messes with you…

124
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,550
You'll break his leg.

125
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,080
You've forgiven me?

126
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,800
I never blamed you.

127
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,230
That's not true.

128
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,230
Look at your face.

129
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,390
It's scary.

130
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,860
In my whole life,

131
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,270
this is the first time

132
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,950
that someone has defended me without asking any questions.

133
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,870
T-That's no big deal.

134
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,750
I'll defend you again and again.

135
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,430
But I'm so worried.

136
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,390
No one knows what the future will bring.

137
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,590
Neither adversities

138
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,909
nor good luck

139
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,669
can last for long.

140
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,470
When you're riding high,

141
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,840
you should get prepared for falling hard.

142
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,230
But just now,

143
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,000
you just burned the bridge.

144
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,950
I understand,

145
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,840
but I beat him for a good reason.

146
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,870
He humiliated my wife.

147
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,830
I would've been a coward

148
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,430
if I had looked the other way.

149
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,030
Don't worry.

150
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,110
His father is just the commissioner of Yangzhou.

151
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,910
With my uncle's help,

152
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,310
everything will be fine.

153
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,040
I'll take full responsibility if anything happens.

154
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,790
Gu Jiusi,

155
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,350
didn't you hate me very much?

156
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,720
Why…

157
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,950
W-Why are you…

158
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,390
Why are you

159
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,270
so nice to me now?

160
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,350
I…

161
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,110
Now, I…

162
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,110
I-I treat you as my brother now.

163
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,440
Of course I'd

164
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,120
stand up for my brother.

165
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,600
Are you cold?

166
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,910
Any better?

167
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,750
I do this

168
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,170
with Yang Wenchang and other guys too.

169
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,530
When we're cold,

170
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,230
huddling helps a lot.

171
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,670
So don't read into it.

172
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,710
Gu Jiusi,

173
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,570
you're so nice.

174
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,230
Of course.

175
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,710
I, Gu Jiusi,

176
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,470
am the best man in the world.

177
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,240
You're lucky to be my wife.

[Gu Mansion]

179
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,150
Yuru.

180
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,190
Mother.

181
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,150
I'm so sorry.

182
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,330
I've heard what happened.

183
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,120
Things like that happen

184
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,120
when you do business as a woman.

185
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,470
Wang Rong has always been a rogue.

186
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,110
He's notorious in Yangzhou.

187
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,510
Any sensible person

188
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,840
could tell immediately

189
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,990
what was going on.

190
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,360
Don't worry.

191
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,750
Tomorrow, I'll take you

192
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,230
to visit the commissioner.

193
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,190
Commissioner Wang has to do something.

194
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,830
Actually…

195
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,840
No need for that.

196
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,870
I made Wang Rong pay

197
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,000
by breaking his leg.

198
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,750
What?

199
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,830
He said something he shouldn't have.

200
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,960
I just broke one of his legs.

201
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,020
He deserves worse.

202
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,990
Jiusi.

203
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,110
You're not a kid now.

204
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,390
Why do you always

205
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,590
act on a whim?

206
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,590
We and the Wang family

207
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,270
have always been on good terms on the surface.

208
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,070
When Wang Rong

209
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,280
picked on Yuru today,

210
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,190
he pretended

211
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,670
not to know who she was.

212
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,510
Falling out

213
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,070
with him in public

214
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,210
was humiliating the Wang family.

215
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,230
We had been above reproach

216
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,960
but you made us reprehensible.

217
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,470
Calm down. Have some water.

218
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,710
He humiliated my wife first.

219
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,700
Then I beat him.

220
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,590
It's tit for tat.

221
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,950
Wang Rong is an arrogant fool

222
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,830
who walks around bullying others

223
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,670
because his father is the commissioner.

224
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,590
In my opinion,

225
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,590
we should tell Uncle

226
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,270
to file a complaint against Wang Shanquan

227
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,230
to remove him from his position.

228
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,320
A pest like him

229
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,600
should be got rid of for good.

230
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,390
Nonsense!

231
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,710
You do need

232
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,350
to learn to tame your temper.

233
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,070
I won't call for the guards.

234
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,830
Go to the Buddhist hall

235
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,430
to reflect on your mistakes.

236
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,230
OK.

237
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,470
Jiusi.

238
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,070
Mother.

239
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,080
I'll go with him.

240
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,030
Yuru,

241
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,050
are you blaming me for punishing him?

242
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,000
I dare not.

243
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,030
But what happened today

244
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,310
started with me.

245
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,910
If Jiusi is at fault,

246
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,470
then I'm at fault too.

247
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,110
Mother.

248
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,150
Jiusi shouldn't

249
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,870
have been so impulsive today,

250
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,400
but he did that for a reason.

251
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,470
Wang Rong

252
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,710
messed with me first.

253
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,070
If we had just let him

254
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,070
walk all over us,

255
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,510
we'd have appeared weak.

256
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,660
Let's talk inside.

257
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,830
It hurts like hell!

258
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,110
Quit the waterworks.

259
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,080
Are you an idiot?

260
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,870
Father.

261
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,950
I know I was wrong.

262
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,710
I… I…

263
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,190
Never mind.

264
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,710
He broke your leg.

265
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,950
I'll use it as a chance

266
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,270
to show everyone that the Gu family

267
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,840
is a family of bullies.

268
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,870
When word gets to the Eastern Capital,

269
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,870
Jiang He will be in serious trouble.

270
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,830
Master. Young Master.

271
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,490
The litter is ready.

272
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,190
I've told you what to say

273
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,630
after we meet the Gu family.

274
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,560
You remember it?

275
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,710
Yes.

276
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,080
We've been humbling ourselves

277
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,200
before the Gu family for so many years.

278
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,400
I don't mind doing it for a few more days.

279
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,870
The Gu family is now

280
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,240
like grasshoppers in late autumn.

281
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,750
Their days are numbered.

282
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,470
I'll help you

283
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,350
get back at him sooner or later.

284
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,520
So,

285
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,150
Uncle's status in the Eastern Capital

286
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,360
is not stable now?

287
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,630
Things are different now.

288
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,510
His Majesty is seriously ill

289
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,990
and may draw his last breath soon.

290
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,530
He's getting more and more paranoid.

291
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,110
The Eastern Capital is teetering on the edge of upheaval.

292
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,770
We just refused a royal match.

293
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,470
It must have

294
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,240
aroused resentment

295
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,160
in His Majesty and Lord Liang.

296
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,230
God knows

297
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,470
how many people

298
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,440
are watching Nianming and the Gu family

299
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,470
and wishing to eat us alive.

300
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,310
At this moment,

301
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,590
we need to be very careful

302
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,750
not to catch any attention.

303
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,710
Wang Rong got drunk and picked on me today.

304
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,150
Was it a trap?

305
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,400
Don't be afraid.

306
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,760
Wang Rong has always been fawning over us.

307
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,640
What he did today was abnormal.

308
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,730
That's why I'm a bit unnerved.

309
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,300
Nothing has happened yet.

310
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,470
I just want to inform you

311
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,710
of the current situation.

312
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,570
Don't make trouble for Nianming.

313
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,550
I didn't mean to scare you two.

314
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,390
Mother, we can't

315
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,990
just look on the bright side.

316
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,680
We must take it as a trap.

317
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,790
The Gu family is a big family.

318
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,750
So many people

319
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,190
are watching us like starving wolves.

320
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,110
We must know

321
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,440
that if they want us guilty, they can prove us guilty.

322
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,200
We can't afford

323
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,870
to lose Uncle's protection.

324
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,030
We can't give the Wang family an excuse to destroy us.

325
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,910
You're right.

326
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,270
We need to handle this carefully.

327
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,510
After your father comes back,

328
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,390
we'll take Jiusi

329
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,390
to apologize to the Wang family

330
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,550
tomorrow morning.

331
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,440
We must appear sincere.

332
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,550
Even if Jiusi wouldn't go…

333
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,310
No. That's too late.

334
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,190
I have to go now.

335
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,270
If this were a trap,

336
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,230
that idiot

337
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,400
wouldn't get off my back after I broke his leg.

338
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,800
There'll be more tricks.

339
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,760
If I were him,

340
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,400
I'd immediately drag my broken leg

341
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,640
down here to apologize

342
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,920
and kick up a fuss.

343
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,390
If Wang Rong

344
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,200
came to apologize with a broken leg tonight,

345
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,589
rumors would spread

346
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,920
that we are bullies

347
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,520
who throw our weight around.

348
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
By then, some people

349
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,270
would surely take advantage of this matter

350
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,830
to make false accusations in the Eastern Capital.

351
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,030
Uncle would be in serious trouble then.

352
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,550
Okay. Let's go now.

353
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:39,950
Ruixue.

354
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,190
Get the carriages ready.

355
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,910
Yes.

356
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,060
Well, it's no big deal.

357
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,230
At worst, I'd go to his house

358
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,950
and come back

359
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,150
with a broken leg too.

360
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,640
I regret it so much.

361
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,640
I should've…

362
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
I don't regret it.

363
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,150
No matter what the Wang family got up their sleeve,

364
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,950
he humiliated you

365
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,360
and had to pay for it.

366
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,070
I understand what Mother said.

367
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,110
I've grown up.

368
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,830
It's time for me

369
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,230
to protect my family.

370
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,270
Don't look so sad.

371
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,630
It's not a big deal.

372
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,310
It's just one leg

373
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,280
for one leg.

374
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,040
I've heard that frowning

375
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,640
makes you grow old fast.

376
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,720
Jiusi.

377
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,350
Don't worry.

378
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,670
Actually, when my mother was young,

379
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,550
she was even more capable than you.

380
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,040
It seems that she could

381
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,590
take anything in her stride

382
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
and overcome any obstacles.

383
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,340
Before today, I've never…

384
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,470
I've never seen her

385
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,670
so anxious.

386
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,550
Jiusi.

387
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,550
No matter what happens,

388
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,150
I'll stay by your side

389
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,990
and take you home.

390
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,720
Commissioner Wang.

391
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,830
What a surprise.

392
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,950
We're on our way to your residence

393
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,150
but ran into you here.

394
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,760
Mrs. Gu.

395
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,520
It's a surprise for me too.

396
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,760
I was going to your residence

397
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,990
to apologize to you and Mr. Gu.

398
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,680
You stupid boy!

399
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,510
How drunk did you have to be

400
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,120
to take such liberties

401
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,190
and mess with Mr. Gu?

402
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,190
Kneel down before Mrs. Gu now!

403
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,520
Father, it was a misunderstanding.

404
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,040
Mr. Gu was not there.

405
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,270
Moreover,

406
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,910
how would I know

407
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,040
that Young Madam Gu

408
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
would walk along with a strange man?

409
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
I just gave her some compliments

410
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,350
and my leg…

411
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,120
Shut up!

412
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,070
Who cares if it was a misunderstanding?

413
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,950
In Yangzhou, the Gu family

414
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,520
is the most powerful

415
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,350
and influential.

416
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,190
You messed with Young Master Gu

417
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,850
and ended up with a broken leg.

418
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,110
You had it coming.

419
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,440
Today,

420
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,250
if you can't get the Gu family's forgiveness,

421
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,590
there's

422
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,490
nothing I can do to save you.

423
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,190
The Gu family is so imperious.

424
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,640
-So imperious.
-No one dares to mess with them.

425
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,100
That old sod Wang Shanquan

426
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,710
is throwing mud at us.

427
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,040
Jiusi, calm down.

428
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,490
Let's go out when Mother asks us to.

429
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,760
Commissioner Wang.

430
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,030
My son lost his mind

431
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,790
and put your son through such pain.

432
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,800
What you just said

433
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,950
made me

434
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,520
feel so ashamed.

435
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,470
That's not my intention.

436
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,720
My son offended Young Master Gu.

437
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,840
It makes perfect sense that you're mad

438
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,520
and need a punching bag.

439
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,240
Take it out on me.

440
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,670
Please spare my son.

441
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,240
This is definitely not your son's fault.

442
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,190
To be honest,

443
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,790
if I had raised Jiusi better,

444
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,920
he wouldn't have been so impulsive.

445
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,710
I've scolded him.

446
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,560
After all, Mr. Wang

447
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,640
was just attracted by my pretty daughter-in-law

448
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,830
and said she was his type

449
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,630
and offered

450
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,790
to make her his fifth concubine.

451
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,470
He honored my daughter-in-law with his attention.

452
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,750
She should be grateful.

453
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,830
What a womanizer!

454
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,120
That's humiliating!

455
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,150
That's right.

456
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,310
Besides,

457
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,500
no matter how angry Jiusi was,

458
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,910
he shouldn't have resorted to violence.

459
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,870
He must be punished severely.

460
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,960
Do you agree?

461
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,910
Well…

462
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,040
I…

463
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,440
The Gu family is just a family of merchants.

464
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,620
Women in this family are all very hard-working.

465
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,270
The livelihood

466
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,670
of the whole household

467
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,360
depends on us.

468
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,760
After my daughter-in-law married my son,

469
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,560
she seldom got any leisure time

470
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,560
to enjoy her life as the Young Madam.

471
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,790
I sent her out every day

472
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,050
for business affairs.

473
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,650
Poor girl. She was devoted to the Gu family

474
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,900
and worked so hard,

475
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,630
but in the end,

476
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,490
she became an object of ridicule.

477
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,430
It turns out

478
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,550
that she was there for family business.

479
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,390
Someone so hard-working

480
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,120
doesn't deserve such insults.

481
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,160
Mrs. Gu,

482
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,320
you misunderstood.

483
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,040
My son

484
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,790
had no intention

485
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,910
to stain Young Madam Gu's reputation

486
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,670
and would in no way harass her for no reason.

487
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,570
Was it a misunderstanding?

488
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,830
Look at his leg.

489
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,040
Fine.

490
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,920
Mrs. Gu,

491
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,750
it seems that you've decided

492
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,360
that my son is at fault

493
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,520
and nothing I say

494
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,310
can change your mind.

495
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,800
I'll swallow my pride

496
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,320
and beg you

497
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,270
to spare my son.

498
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,510
If

499
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,920
you still wouldn't let go of it,

500
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,110
you could

501
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,400
break one of my legs too.

502
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,200
Jiusi.

503
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,320
Mrs. Gu.

504
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,080
Allow me to apologize on my knees.

505
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,450
Commissioner Wang!

506
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,690
Commissioner Wang.

507
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,160
You're the commissioner of Darong.

508
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,690
You made great contributions to our country.

509
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,800
You can kneel

510
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,350
before His Majesty and the law

511
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,950
but never

512
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,560
before merchants like us.

513
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,670
If you

514
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,840
kneeled before my mother today,

515
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,560
what would that make the Gu family?

516
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,690
My mother would be landed in hot water.

517
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,480
Young Master Gu.

518
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,320
I've had enough humiliation for one day.

519
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,560
So please,

520
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,590
just cut me some slack.

521
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,390
Jiusi.

522
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,760
Jiusi, let go!

523
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,350
Let go, Jiusi!

524
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,830
Jiusi!

525
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,080
Apologize to the commissioner!

526
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,920
Jiusi.

527
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,400
Commissioner Wang,

528
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,880
I acted on impulse

529
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,200
and hit your son.

530
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,570
I won't complain no matter how you punish me.

531
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,840
But everyone deserves justice.

532
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,880
Mr. Wang

533
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,110
humiliated my wife in broad daylight.

534
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,030
Shouldn't he apologize too?

535
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,840
You're lying!

536
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,160
I… I just

537
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,560
paid her my compliments.

538
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,150
Besides, I didn't even know who she was.

539
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
You know better than anyone else

540
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,190
whether I'm lying!

541
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,680
Jiusi.

542
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,710
When my wife was out doing business

543
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,640
and dealing with customers,

544
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,700
I always had Munan follow her around.

545
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,190
You might not know my wife,

546
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,760
but after spending so much time

547
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,470
sucking up to me,

548
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,280
how could you not recognize

549
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,230
my servant?

550
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,520
I was drunk.

551
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,030
Fine. Let's say you were drunk

552
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,600
and couldn't recognize anyone.

553
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,920
But does that mean

554
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
you could harass any woman

555
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,040
you met on the street

556
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,070
and stain her reputation?

557
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,950
Wang Rong,

558
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,560
are you saying

559
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,800
that only powerful people

560
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,550
can be spared your harassment

561
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,480
and ordinary people

562
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,310
are not the people of Darong

563
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,350
and not protected

564
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,190
by the laws and rules?

565
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,150
-He's right!
-He's right!

566
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,950
Well said!

567
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,960
Mr. Gu is right.

568
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,640
So you can do whatever you want

569
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,640
and bully whoever you want?

570
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,640
Gu Jiusi,

571
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,320
drop the act!

572
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,190
Everyone knows

573
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,400
that the Gu family

574
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
makes the rules in Yangzhou.

575
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,210
So stop being so hypocritical.

576
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,640
Don't you remember bragging

577
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
that your uncle is the Minister of Personnel

578
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,080
and you're filthy rich?

579
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,040
My father is just

580
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,970
an insignificant local official.

581
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,440
You called me a bully

582
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,360
but I'm nothing

583
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,740
compared to you!

584
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,710
Wang Rong,

585
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
do you dream

586
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,920
of having an uncle like mine?

587
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,750
You…

588
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,680
What?

589
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,040
You're a scumbag

590
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,880
who thinks only about

591
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,190
how to throw your weight around

592
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,990
and expect me to be a scumbag too?

593
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,960
My uncle is indeed the Minister of Personnel.

594
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,720
But this is not a country without law and order.

595
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,640
What made you think my uncle

596
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,840
could bend and break the law?

597
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,240
Mr. Gu is right.

598
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,680
No matter what,

599
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,790
everyone has to abide by the law.

600
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,390
Wang Rong,

601
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,280
stop making excuses

602
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,240
and innuendos.

603
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,720
I beat you.

604
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,440
I violated the law.

605
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,970
I'll accept any punishment I deserve.

606
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,920
But this woman is my wife.

607
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,880
If I had looked the other way

608
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,280
when she was humiliated,

609
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,370
I wouldn't deserve to be her husband!

610
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,560
Apologies should be made and punishments should be imposed.

611
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:08,960
Today,

612
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,440
I broke your leg.

613
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,560
I'll break my leg too

614
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,260
to make it even.

615
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,280
But before that,

616
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,790
Wang Rong,

617
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,840
do you admit

618
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,830
that you've done something wrong?

619
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,480
If having a few words

620
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,400
with an ordinary woman is wrong,

621
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,400
yes, I did something wrong.

622
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,560
Good.

623
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,100
Since you've admitted your mistake,

624
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,630
apologize to my wife now!

625
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,310
Gu Jiusi.

626
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,720
You're out of line!

627
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,470
Jiusi.

628
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Jiusi, forget it.

629
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,680
I'm not out of line.

630
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,640
I just want justice!

631
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,150
Jiusi.

632
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,360
Mr. Gu, you take responsibility for what you did.

633
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,760
You're an honorable man.

634
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,800
I really admire you.

635
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,800
Mr. Zhou.

636
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,440
Boss Liu.

637
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,920
Greetings, Commissioner Wang.

638
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,640
I

639
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,840
was talking business with Boss Liu

640
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,170
when your son ran into us

641
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,620
and misunderstood us.

642
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,120
I was there

643
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,560
when it happened during the day.

644
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,520
I witnessed

645
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,880
the whole process.

646
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,150
It was indeed your son

647
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,540
who picked the fight.

648
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,520
Laws should be made harsh

649
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,520
but enforced with leniency.

650
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,400
Mr. Gu

651
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,730
is a protective husband

652
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,560
who stood up

653
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,800
to protect his wife's reputation.

654
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,080
What he did is reprehensible

655
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,190
but defensible.

656
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,560
Moreover,

657
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,400
I've made a deal

658
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
with the Gu family

659
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,440
and will need Mr. Gu to escort the goods.

660
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,790
He wouldn't be able to do that

661
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,960
with a broken leg.

662
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,950
According to the laws of Darong,

663
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,490
the punishment for assault

664
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,840
is 20 lashes.

665
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,630
If you don't punish Mr. Gu

666
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,800
based on the laws

667
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,730
and insist on breaking his leg,

668
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,140
you'll be taking the law into your hands.

669
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,520
So I think he should be punished according to the law.

670
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,360
Who are you?

671
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm Zhou Ye,

672
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,440
son of Zhou Gaolang in Youzhou.

673
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,400
Your father is a great general.

674
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,280
So the Gu family has made friends

675
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,200
with the Zhou family too.

676
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,280
With Mr. Zhou as the mediator,

677
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,360
I see no reason to inflict any suffering

678
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,080
on Young Master Gu.

679
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,360
Let's call it a day.

680
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,320
How can I let

681
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,150
Young Master Gu get whipped?

682
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,130
The Gu family went easy on you.

683
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,030
It's so kind of them.

684
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,560
I got nothing more to say.

685
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,200
Let's go.

686
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,760
Wait.

687
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,920
Mr. Gu,

688
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,350
what more do you want?

689
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,840
As I said, apologies should be made

690
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
and punishments should be imposed.

691
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,960
Mr. Zhou.

692
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,280
May I borrow your whip?

693
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
My lord.

694
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,280
As a husband,

695
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,100
I failed to protect my wife

696
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,560
and subjected her to idle gossip.

697
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,040
It's my first mistake.

698
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,760
My lord.

699
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,480
As a son,

700
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,160
I acted recklessly,

701
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,400
made my mother worry,

702
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,160
and a caring father upset.

703
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,800
It's my second mistake.

704
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,800
As a citizen of Darong,

705
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,800
I committed assault.

706
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,280
I did it to defend my wife,

707
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,340
but it's undeniable that I violated the law.

708
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,830
This is my third mistake.

709
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,680
Enough.

710
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,410
-Jiusi.
-Jiusi.

711
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,760
Jiusi.

712
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,480
Jiusi.

713
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,400
Wang Rong,

714
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,960
you humiliated my wife.

715
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,560
Apologize to her.

716
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,520
You humiliated my wife.

717
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,400

♫The world is so big♫

764
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,300
♫You're my sun and moon♫

765
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,380
♫Lighting my way through the dark♫

766
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,240
♫How can I forget you♫

767
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,650
♫Forget us, and forget the days we spent together?♫

768
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,900
♫How can I move on as if you were never in my life?♫

769
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,290
♫I miss you♫

770
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,510
♫I still love you♫

771
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,740
♫But I can't hold you in my arms again♫

772
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:18,120
♫I reach out but only feel the wind between my fingers♫

773
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,690
♫When the wind picks up and the moon shines♫

774
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,840
♫I see you everywhere and nowhere♫

775
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,090
♫Memories of you flood back to me♫

776
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,780
♫If I still love you the same♫

777
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,930
♫Will we meet again in my dreams?♫

778
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:43,720
♫Will it be like the first time we met?♫

779
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,600
Wang Rong.

780
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,130
You humiliated my wife.

781
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,400
Apologize to her.

782
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,240
I… I'm sorry!

783
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,920
I apologize.

784
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,960
I'm sorry, Young Madam.

785
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,520
I shouldn't have humiliated you.

786
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,500
I apologize, Young Madam.

787
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,160
Well done, Mr. Gu!

788
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,000
Yuru.

789
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,060
You're quite a man!

790
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,250
So responsible!

791
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,220
Well done!

792
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,020
He apologized.

793
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,520
He apologized to you!

794
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,080
Jiusi.

795
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,640
-Jiusi.
-Jiusi.

796
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,080
Jiusi.

797
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,730
Jiusi.

798
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,320
Jiusi.

799
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,800
You're crying again.

800
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,680
I hate to make you cry.

801
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,440
Don't cry, will you?

802
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:38,970
Jiusi.

803
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,720
Hurry! Get him back.

804
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,440
Send for a doctor!

805
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,320
Young Master.

806
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,310
[Gu Mansion]

807
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,600
Hurry up.

808
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,000
Doctor.

809
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,120
Doctor, how is he?

810
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,650
Madam. Young Madam.

811
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,600
Don't worry.

812
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,720
Young Master is in his prime.

813
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,850
He's strong

814
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,240
and practices martial arts.

815
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,620
His wounds got treated immediately.

816
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,400
He's fine.

817
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,600
Thank God.

818
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
I'll give him a prescription

819
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,700
that helps with the recovery.

820
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,440
He just needs enough rest.

821
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,320
Okay.

822
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,480
Munan,

823
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,400
go with the doctor to get the prescription.

824
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,730
Okay.

825
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
Doctor, this way.

826
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,320
Let me hold it for you.

827
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,690
Please.

828
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,120
Mr. Zhou.

829
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,560
Thank you

830
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,760
for helping us today.

831
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
Otherwise,

832
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,220
Jiusi would suffer much more.

833
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,810
You're welcome.

834
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,840
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

835
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,680
That was 20 lashes.

836
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,800
Few civil officials in court

837
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,050
can fully recover from just 10 lashes.

838
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,720
I didn't expect you

839
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,650
to excel in medicine too.

840
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,450
Thank you very much.

841
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,570
You're welcome.

842
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,120
I used to dress wounds for the soldiers

843
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,730
in the military camp in Youzhou,

844
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,060
so I learned how to do it.

845
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,320
It's getting late.

846
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,280
Now that Mr. Gu is out of danger,

847
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,560
I'll take my leave.

848
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,680
Madam, someone from the Eastern Capital wants to see you.

849
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,770
Yuru,

850
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,160
walk Mr. Zhou out.

851
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,600
Mr. Zhou, this way.

852
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,160
Please.

853
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,000
Sorry for

854
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,260
making you endure such a farce.

855
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,450
Not at all.

856
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,380
The Wang family did go too far.

857
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,040
I witnessed the whole thing.

858
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,400
Sorry that I didn't reserve my strength

859
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,200
when I whipped Mr. Gu.

860
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,240
Laws are laws.

861
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,680
You should be impartial.

862
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,480
Otherwise,

863
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,890
Jiusi would have to break his leg

864
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,440
to end this matter.

865
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,740
We'll forever be grateful

866
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,200
for your kindness.

867
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,260
Don't say that.

868
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,960
Mr. Gu

869
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,090
is caring and brave.

870
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,320
I admire him very much.

871
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,040
I wonder

872
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,880
if I can be friends with him.

873
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,200
Actually, Jiusi has long wanted to know you

874
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,660
and make friends with you.

875
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,210
I can't ask for more.

876
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,320
After he gets better,

877
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,960
I'll invite you over for dinner

878
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,040
to express our gratitude.

879
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,720
By then,

880
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,760
we'll have a good chat over drinks.

881
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,570
Okay, it's a deal.

882
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,760
You two are kind and righteous people.

883
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,400
You care and look out for each out.

884
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,840
I really envy you.

885
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,890
You flatter me.

886
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,460
I'll wait for your invitation

887
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,440
to have a wonderful time with you.

888
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,280
Goodbye.

889
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,090
Let's go.

890
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:02,590
Don't move.

891
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,000
I'll leave the bed to you.

892
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,200
Don't talk nonsense.

893
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,480
Just stay in bed.

894
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,760
You're a girl.

895
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,830
I can't let you sleep on the floor.

896
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,900
I won't sleep on the floor.

897
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,040
We'll sleep on the bed together.
