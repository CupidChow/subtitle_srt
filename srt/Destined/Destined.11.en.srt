[Episode 11]

4
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,240
Young Madam Gu,

5
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,820
what are you doing?

6
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,530
Don't scare

7
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,539
a weak businesswoman

8
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,020
like me.

9
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,820
Young Master Fan here

10
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,420
can't pay the gambling debt.

11
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,140
Young Master Gu insisted

12
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,180
on standing up for him.

13
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,220
So we're playing another set of dice rolling.

14
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,740
We haven't finished yet.

15
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,100
So many people are watching.

16
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,700
How can we possibly stop the game?

17
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,500
That's right!

18
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,220
You agreed to the gamble.

19
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,820
Otherwise,

20
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,180
that young master needs to pay.

21
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,139
Everyone, am I right?

22
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,139
Yes!

23
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,160
He needs to pay!

24
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,740
Yes.

25
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,820
Who said we're stopping?

26
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,460
Mr. Gu.

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,700
I’m already grateful that you came.

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,300
But

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,060
this bet is a serious matter.

30
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,500
Besides, your wife is here too.

31
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,579
I think we should forget it.

32
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,900
Don't worry.

33
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,500
I always call the shots

34
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,780
in our family.

35
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,020
If I ask her to go east,

36
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,620
she wouldn't dare to go west.

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,140
Come here.

38
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,300
Come here.

39
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,030
I was wrong.

40
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,560
But saving him is more important right now.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,990
Give her a smile first.

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,970
Be natural.

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,650
Young Madam,

44
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,180
what do you think?

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,010
My husband knows what he's doing.

46
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,530
I trust him.

47
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,950
There must be a reason.

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,960
Why?

49
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,600
What reason?

50
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,360
I'm just a woman.

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,180
Everything is up to my husband's decision.

52
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,740
Was this Madam Gu

53
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,210
not the legendary strict wife

54
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,350
who hunted her husband with a big sword?

55
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,950
Why did she suddenly change?

56
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,140
Lady Xifeng, let's continue.

57
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,950
[Big]

58
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,700
[Small]

59
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,970
Go ahead.

60
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,960
The fifth round of dice rolling.

61
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,750
One, three, and three. Small.

62
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,280
Lady Xifeng won.

63
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,970
Young Master Gu lost.

64
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,270
It’s already the fifth round.

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,110
Yeah.

66
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:31,990
We already lost

67
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,080
over 60,000 taels.

68
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,550
No matter how rich our family is,

69
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,180
that's not

70
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,110
a small amount.

71
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,120
Let's hope that the Young Master will

72
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,320
give up and stop here.

73
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,880
This is interesting.

74
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,700
Young Master Gu.

75
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Why don’t you admit defeat earlier?

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,190
Since we've come this far,

77
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,820
another two rounds won't matter.

78
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,670
What? You've been in the

79
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,310
gambling business for many years.

80
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm not afraid yet.

81
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,020
But you're already afraid?

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,300
I’m just

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,160
worried for you, Young Master Gu.

84
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,470
You have lost five rounds in a row.

85
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,810
The wager for the next round is

86
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,410
4.2 billion taels of silver.

87
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,550
Is he really going to do it?

88
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,400
Do you really want to keep going?

89
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,510
Even you dare to

90
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,810
gamble with your hard-earned

91
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,320
family assets on the line.

92
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,350
I didn't earn any of this money myself.

93
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,480
Why wouldn't I dare?

94
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,780
Count me in this time.

95
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,110
If Mr. Gu loses the bet,

96
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,920
even if I lose everything,

97
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,550
I'll pay for it.

98
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,690
No need, no need.

99
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,390
I know what I'm doing.

100
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,610
Wait.

101
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,430
I suddenly realize that

102
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,570
the gambling house and gambling tools are all yours.

103
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,280
Isn't it a little

104
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,630
unfair to me?

105
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,170
How about this?

106
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,830
Starting from the sixth round,

107
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,790
we will let my wife

108
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,100
roll the dice instead.

109
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,000
You worry too much, Young Master Gu.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
My reputation as

111
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,310
Lady Xifeng of Lanxiao House

112
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,450
is out there.

113
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,500
I would never

114
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,760
do anything shady.

115
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,110
Since you're upright,

116
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,070
you shouldn't care

117
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,630
who rolls the dice.

118
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,480
My wife is a noble lady.

119
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,610
She has never touched a die before.

120
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,370
She's most unlikely to cheat

121
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,720
compared to all the pros here.

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,100
In my opinion,

123
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,410
it's most fair

124
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,750
to let my wife roll the dice.

125
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,050
Everyone, am I right?

126
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,400
Yes.

127
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,310
You.

128
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,420
Yes, you. Teach her a little.

129
00:06:58,909 --> 00:06:59,490
Yes.

130
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,840
Harder.

131
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,330
These two are acting so strangely.

132
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,440
They must be up to something.

133
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,380
Young Master Gu, you first.

134
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,290
Letting me go first?

135
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,320
[Big]

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
[Small]

137
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,830
The sixth round of dice rolling.

138
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,640
Two, two, and three. Small.

139
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,730
Lady Xifeng won!

140
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,960
Young Master Gu lost.

141
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,700
It's already the sixth round.

142
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,230
Young Master Gu lost again.

143
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,030
I’m so unlucky today.

144
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,470
Come on, let's continue.

145
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,929
The next round is the seventh round.

146
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,909
If you lose,

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,580
no one can afford to pay it.

148
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,179
According to the rules,

149
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,909
your limbs will be chopped off.

150
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,159
Young Master Gu.

151
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,690
Are you sure you want to continue?

152
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,080
Yes.

153
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,540
Yuru.

154
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,150
Let's begin.

155
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,930
After this round,

156
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,460
we can go home for dinner.

157
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,890
Wait.

158
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,500
What’s wrong?

159
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,780
Young Master Gu.

160
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,790
Your gambling skills are always excellent.

161
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,550
Even when you played against me on other days,

162
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,310
we would take turns winning and losing.

163
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,030
Today,

164
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,930
you lost six rounds in a row for no reason.

165
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,740
So?

166
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,270
Young Master Gu, you've put your life and wealth on the line,

167
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,950
yet you're so calm and composed.

168
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,000
I really admire

169
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,430
your composure.

170
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,760
You flatter me.

171
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,810
In gambling,

172
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,570
you'll win some and lose some.

173
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,750
When it comes to dice rolling,

174
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,930
the outcome isn't decided until the last round.

175
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,030
The seventh round hasn't started yet.

176
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,780
How could you say that

177
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,840
I've already lost my life and wealth?

178
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,330
There are so many people watching.

179
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,430
Don't waste our time.

180
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,180
Let's begin.

181
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,500
No, wait.

182
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,730
He lost every single round.

183
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,480
Could it be that he was

184
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,010
luring me to the last round?

185
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,020
He listened to the dice

186
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,160
and made six wrong choices on purpose.

187
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,490
He succeeded each time.

188
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,680
This means

189
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,390
his skill is unfathomable.

190
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,550
This must be a trap.

191
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,870
If I admit defeat now, it would be a tie.

192
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,820
But if I lose the last round,

193
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,190
I will...

194
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,020
[Small]

195
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,710
I'll lose everything.

196
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,090
If that happens, how will I face Master?

197
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,340
[Big]

198
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,820
I admit defeat.

199
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,110
Admit defeat?

200
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,460
I quit the seventh round.

201
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,180
Lady Xifeng.

202
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,700
This is the last round.

203
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,920
Before we started the game,

204
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,760
we agreed that

205
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,860
anyone can admit defeat anytime

206
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,580
during the seven rounds.

207
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,540
The result of the seventh round isn't revealed yet.

208
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,300
I didn't

209
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,430
break the rules.

210
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,500
You've won six rounds in a row.

211
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,800
You're on a roll.

212
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,000
You're really stopping here?

213
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,870
Young Master Gu.

214
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,480
We’ve known each other for years.

215
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,420
Let's forget about it today.

216
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,490
As we agreed before,

217
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,790
if I lose,

218
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,290
it will cancel out Young Master Fan's debt

219
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,870
from losing six rounds of dice rolling.

220
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,010
We'll be even.

221
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,540
Sounds good?

222
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,170
How disappointing.

223
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,690
Let's go, my lady.

224
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,090
Let's go home for dinner.

225
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:29,980
Let's go.

226
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,260
Yu. Thank your savior.

227
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,780
Thank you for saving us!

228
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,350
You...

229
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,110
Learn to be good.

230
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,920
Don't come to gambling houses.

231
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,470
Study hard, okay?

232
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,620
I never thought there'd come a day

233
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,680
when I would say something like this.

234
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,710
We're not very familiar

235
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,630
with Yangzhou.

236
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,240
My only friend here

237
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,660
is Boss Liu.

238
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:08,790
But Boss Liu

239
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,760
is a lady.

240
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,760
She must not be familiar

241
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,160
with gambling houses.

242
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,680
So I took the liberty

243
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,150
to ask you for help, Mr. Gu.

244
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,670
Mr. Gu and I

245
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,310
had never met before.

246
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,740
I thought

247
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,340
Mr. Gu wouldn't come to help.

248
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,720
I didn't expect him to come immediately.

249
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,360
My wife's friend

250
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,200
is my friend.

251
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,720
No need to stand on ceremony since we are friends.

252
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,350
Didn't you say

253
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,610
to drink together last time?

254
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,080
Let's get drunk tonight.

255
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,640
Alright. Thank you so much.

256
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,150
Mr. Gu, you were willing

257
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,030
to risk your life and wealth

258
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,750
to help us.

259
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,010
I...

260
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,220
No.

261
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
The whole Youzhou

262
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,760
will surely remember it.

263
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,500
Tell me.

264
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,940
Mr. Zhou is so sensible and reliable.

265
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,650
Why does he have

266
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,110
such a insensible cousin?

267
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,850
What cousin?

268
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,070
You really believed it?

269
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,870
They seem

270
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,040
to be brothers.

271
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,850
Mr. Zhou is also in charge of him.

272
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,690
But in fact,

273
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,840
that child is the young master.

274
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,520
His surname is Fan.

275
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,650
He's about the same age.

276
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,620
Which means, he's most likely the

277
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,050
son of Fan Xuan, the Commissioner of Youzhou.

278
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,650
The son of the Commissioner?

279
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,720
Isn't that the same as Wang Rong?

280
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,780
That's different.

281
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,910
Wang Shanquan has 19 children.

282
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,170
Even he can't remember all of them.

283
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,010
But Fan Xuan

284
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,470
has only one precious son.

285
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,750
He is the young master of Youzhou.

286
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,090
How did you know

287
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:39,950
about all that?

288
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,440
I read some idle books.

289
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,290
The ones you confiscated.

290
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,220
You're smiling.

291
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,980
You're not mad at me anymore?

292
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,600
Yuru.

293
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,320
When you heard that

294
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,620
I went to gamble,

295
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,220
were you really scared that

296
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,760
marrying me was a mistake?

297
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,550
Yes.

298
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,770
I was very scared.

299
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,440
But you still chose to trust me.

300
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,660
You are an optimistic person.

301
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,790
So you dare to gamble

302
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,850
and you enjoy it.

303
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,950
But I'm always pessimistic.

304
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
So I don't dare to gamble.

305
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,970
I'm afraid of gambling.

306
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,370
In fact, I hate gambling.

307
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,580
Whatever I do,

308
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,050
I must be extra careful.

309
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,850
I believe that slow and steady is the only way.

310
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,710
I'm afraid of the unpredictable.

311
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,470
That's because I can't afford to make mistakes.

312
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,150
Now that I think about it,

313
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,800
I have only gambled once in my life.

314
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,260
And that was marrying you.

315
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,530
I bet that you'd be loyal

316
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,870
You won't abandon me.

317
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,920
I bet that you you'd be responsible.

318
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,380
You won't put me in danger.

319
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,070
I also bet that you'll succeed in the future.

320
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,400
So I could depend on you.

321
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,210
At least,

322
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,640
before our divorce,

323
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,670
as long as I'm your wife for one day,

324
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,680
you can shelter me from

325
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,810
the rain for one day.

326
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,450
I wagered everything

327
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,310
on this bet.

328
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,960
So I have to trust you.

329
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,470
I can only trust you.

330
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,270
Do you regret it?

331
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,510
I want the truth.

332
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,220
The truth?

333
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,830
I don't know.

334
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,570
I always found you to be smart

335
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,870
and knowledgeable.

336
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,380
Why were you

337
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,270
fooled by

338
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,420
such a trick today?

339
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,460
I was careless

340
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,930
and affected your plan.

341
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,870
I failed to capture the young master of Youzhou.

342
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,870
Please punish me.

343
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,680
Forget it.

344
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,770
It's not your fault.

345
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,460
If it only took a few rounds of gambling

346
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,270
to turn

347
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,950
the tides of the world,

348
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,940
I wouldn't be here in Yangzhou.

349
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,180
Go.

350
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,990
Don't mess up again

351
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,329
in the future.

352
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:22,589
Yes.

353
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:37,880
Mr. Gu.

354
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,530
It's all in the wine.

355
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,820
[Gulin Hall]

356
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,520
Mr. Gu.

357
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,730
In the North,

358
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,410
if we use such a small cup

359
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,220
to make a toast of gratitude,

360
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,680
people will laugh at us.

361
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
That's why I changed it to a big bowl.

362
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,680
Okay.

363
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,700
I’ll accompany you.

364
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,860
Brother Gu,

365
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,210
how did you manage

366
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,490
to lose six times in a row today?

367
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:33,780
This is the brilliance

368
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,290
of Mr. Gu's plan.

369
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,260
He knew

370
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,030
he can't win Lady Xifeng

371
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,210
in gambling.

372
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,110
So in the six rounds,

373
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,130
Lady Xifeng betted first in the first three rounds.

374
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,220
Then, in the last three rounds,

375
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,480
Mr. Gu just needed to bet on the opposite.

376
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,880
That's right.

377
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,560
When it comes to listening to the dice,

378
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,100
I can

379
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,780
win one or two rounds occasionally.

380
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,790
But I most definitely

381
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,710
can't win every round.

382
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,230
But Lady Xifeng can do it.

383
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,610
Back in the gambling house,

384
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,540
she once won all ten rounds

385
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,070
and never failed even once.

386
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,610
Lady Xifeng could be considered

387
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,670
the goddess of gambling in Yangzhou.

388
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,470
What about the sixth bet?

389
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,360
Actually, by that round,

390
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,040
winning or losing didn't matter anymore.

391
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,390
If Mr. Gu lost,

392
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,150
Lady Xifeng would think that

393
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,610
Mr. Gu was a great gambler,

394
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,670
and that he deliberately lost to her

395
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,590
to set her up.

396
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,490
And if Mr. Gu won,

397
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,510
Lady Xifeng would think

398
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,240
that he wanted to turn the tide.

399
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,160
So that's why you pretended to be relaxed.

400
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,690
You told me to smile at her

401
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,950
and let me roll the dice

402
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,420
to distract her.

403
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,650
You acted recklessly,

404
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,330
diverted her attention,

405
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,390
and remained calm despite losing six rounds in a row.

406
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,650
You even included me,

407
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,420
a innocent-looking newbie

408
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,210
who had

409
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,140
never entered a gambling house.

410
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,360
All of it was to

411
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,290
mess with Lady Xifeng's judgment.

412
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,470
So,

413
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,660
under the strong pressure,

414
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,030
she could only choose the safest way

415
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,440
and give up on the seventh round.

416
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,000
If it weren't for you

417
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,630
playing along with my

418
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,550
strategy today,

419
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,080
I wouldn't have been able to fool Lady Xifeng.

420
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,590
The two of you

421
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,190
worked together seamlessly

422
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,160
and pulled off the plan perfectly.

423
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,220
It wasn't exactly seamless.

424
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,570
When I stepped into Lanxiao House today,

425
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,450
I didn't know

426
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,970
what he was up to at all.

427
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,900
So...

428
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,000
It was all improvised?

429
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,350
What a great display of your chemistry.

430
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
You trusted me that much?

431
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,990
Actually, at the beginning,

432
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,990
I was shocked too.

433
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,350
But when I calmed down and thought about it,

434
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,810
I managed to figure it out.

435
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,620
If you were really going to gamble,

436
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,420
why did you ask Munan

437
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,600
to inform me?

438
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,120
Besides, Mr. Zhou is a respectable man.

439
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,140
Since you did it to help him,

440
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,290
you must be doing something serious too.

441
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,260
He is a respectable man.

442
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,760
Am I not respectable?

443
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,110
In that case,

444
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,460
Lady Xifeng was betting on points.

445
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,400
But Mr. Gu was betting on people's hearts.

446
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,090
Brother Zhou knows me well.

447
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,430
Here, a toast to you.

448
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,020
Here.

449
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,660
Brother Gu, a toast to you too.

450
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,760
Okay.

451
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,440
Why are you drinking?

452
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,570
You're still young.

453
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,160
Have you forgotten

454
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,000
what your father told you?

455
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,600
You're not allowed to drink.

456
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,860
I'm not young anymore.

457
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,000
You're not young?

458
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,260
Would an adult do the things

459
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,310
you did today?

460
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,880
Don't worry about the things

461
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,930
you did in Yangzhou.

462
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,310
I will tell your father

463
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,120
all about it.

464
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,820
Well, we're here to enjoy ourselves.

465
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,000
Let's not talk about this.

466
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,600
Young man.

467
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,480
Come on. Let’s drink together.

468
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,460
Brother Zhou.

469
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,770
Okay.

470
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,250
[Gulin Hall]

471
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,240
Now that I think about it,

472
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,740
Yangzhou

473
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,590
is indeed full of formidable individuals.

474
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,160
Lady Xifeng

475
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,960
is indeed extraordinary.

476
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,600
Lady Xifeng

477
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,150
came from a brothel.

478
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,880
I don't know

479
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,720
how much suffering

480
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,680
and pain she had to endure

481
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,400
to finally

482
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,860
afford the Lanxiao House.

483
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,920
That's how people are.

484
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,160
The harder they worked for something, the more they fear losing it.

485
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,620
I made use of her weakness.

486
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,900
But I shouldn't have.

487
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,910
Mr. Gu comes from a prominent family,

488
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,160
but you still have such a kind heart.

489
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,990
It’s hard to find someone like you.

490
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,010
Mr. Zhou.

491
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,410
Don’t praise him so much.

492
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,200
With his nature,

493
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,960
he could barely settle down for a few days.

494
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,800
If you praise him too much,

495
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,690
he'll become proud and unruly again.

496
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,110
Hey.

497
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,160
Why are you always tearing me down

498
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
in front of other people?

499
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,270
My words come from

500
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,950
the bottom of my heart.

501
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,840
None of it is fake.

502
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,610
Mr. Gu, with your talent,

503
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,580
you'll become someone prominent sooner or later.

504
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,790
Here, Brother Zhou.

505
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,460
Cheers.

506
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:03,960
Here.

507
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,290
But people seek fame

508
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,850
merely to earn more money.

509
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,150
They want to climb higher

510
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,210
so others would think highly of them.

511
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,480
But I was born

512
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,540
the son of the richest person in Jiangnan.

513
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,970
There's nothing I can't buy,

514
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,300
and nothing I can't get.

515
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,140
Why do I need to climb higher?

516
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,690
Climbing higher

517
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,750
is not for money or power.

518
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,260
But the higher you go,

519
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,490
the more you can do for the people.

520
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,530
Look at the moon in the sky.

521
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,630
Only when it's high up

522
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,510
can it light up the wider mountains and rivers.

523
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,320
Maybe

524
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,800
it's just what I think.

525
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,360
Youzhou

526
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,320
is not rich like Yangzhou.

527
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,390
Externally, we're constantly at war.

528
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,070
Internally, we battle with poverty.

529
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,340
Our resources are not as rich as Yangzhou too.

530
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,260
Sometimes,

531
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,000
even finding drinking water is a struggle.

532
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,210
My trip to Yangzhou this time

533
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,380
has helped me realize that

534
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,110
Yangzhou is truly the bustling capital of the world.

535
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,970
The people here live in comfort

536
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,020
and lead a joyful and peaceful life.

537
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,190
If one day,

538
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,870
Youzhou

539
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,590
could become like this,

540
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,310
I could die with no regret.

541
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,660
Actually, the resource shortage in Youzhou

542
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,720
is not only limited by its landscape.

543
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,990
It's mainly due to the underdeveloped trade

544
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,550
infrastructure that prevents it from connecting with

545
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,610
the outside world.

546
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,330
Mr. Gu, go on.

547
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,400
If Youzhou could

548
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,660
develop land and water trade

549
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,060
routes as Yangzhou does,

550
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,900
we can transport the cow and horses from the north

551
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,160
to trade for rice and grains in the south.

552
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,230
We can also trade the northern fur and herbs

553
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,240
for Jiangnan's silk and satin.

554
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,180
If this goes on,

555
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,980
the advantage of Youzhou will be utilized.

556
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,440
Then Youzhou will be rich.

557
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,960
You're right.

558
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,520
Whether it's war

559
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,610
or business,

560
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,490
transportation is of utmost importance.

561
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,500
Actually, the situation in Northern Liang

562
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,170
is the same.

563
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,270
If they can learn how to farm

564
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,820
and consistently

565
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
produce something

566
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,020
to trade with Darong,

567
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,520
they could be self-sufficient in terms of food supply

568
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,980
and won't have to instigate war all the time.

569
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,590
At the end of the day,

570
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,860
everyone's fighting to live.

571
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,050
You're right.

572
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,030
The war between Youzhou and Northern Liang

573
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
persists because

574
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,050
everyone wants to

575
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,100
live a good life.

576
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,590
Mr. Gu,

577
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,400
you live a good life

578
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,470
and you're in a high position.

579
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,100
Yet, you can see through people's hearts

580
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,630
and be considerate of the people.

581
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,250
I'm glad to be able

582
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,270
to call you my friend.

583
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,220
We're all human. What's there to not understand?

584
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,450
In the end,

585
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,130
I just got lucky

586
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,700
when I was reincarnated into this life.

587
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,950
For me, my wish

588
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,460
is for

589
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,440
the people to be fed and clothed.

590
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,710
So they won't freeze

591
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,690
or starve to death.

592
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,910
I hope they could lead a good life

593
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,850
and live with dignity.

594
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,280
Then I wish you get what you want.

595
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,440
Don't worry.

596
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,180
I won't let you down.

597
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,550
Let's drink.

598
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,290
Cheers.

599
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,700
Here.

600
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,220
-Here.
-Cheers.

601
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,190
Actually,

602
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,590
I was greatly influenced by

603
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,930
the words of my father,

604
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,360
and Commissioner Fan, my uncle.

605
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,950
Although they have

606
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,210
never said it out loud,

607
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,970
everything they do

608
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,900
is for the people.

609
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,430
They work very hard

610
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,560
and always put the people first.

611
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,280
I also heard that

612
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,880
Youzhou may be in a remote area,

613
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,690
but the governance is upright

614
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,750
and the people live and work in peace.

615
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,440
The people there are more united than in other states.

616
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,230
So it's because

617
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,250
there are diligent and people-loving civil servants

618
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,430
like the commissioner and the general.

619
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,230
That's right.

620
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,410
Since I was young,

621
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,260
I learned from their words and actions.

622
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,310
For me,

623
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,280
my father and Uncle Fan

624
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,750
are my role models.

625
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,150
You've been discussing this for a long time.

626
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,240
Where should we

627
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,710
move our business operation to?

628
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,140
Is there a conclusion?

629
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,420
In the end,

630
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,850
nowhere else is suitable for us.

631
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,080
Youzhou.

632
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,160
The Youzhou that everyone overlooked.

633
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,990
Mr. Gu.

634
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,140
It's hard to find a bosom friend.

635
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,140
I'm not talented.

636
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,540
But I wish to be

637
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,090
sworn brothers with you.

638
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,820
What do you think?

639
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,400
I'd love to.

640
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,080
I wanted to ask the same thing just now.

641
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,010
But I was too shy.

642
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,190
Okay.

643
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,910
I'm two years older than you.

644
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,480
From now on, we'll call each other brothers.

645
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,200
Brother Zhou.

646
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,930
Brother Gu. Here.

647
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,200
Wait.

648
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,560
We can't just change how we call each other.

649
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,660
I read in the novels that

650
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,130
there should be a ceremony to become sworn brothers.

651
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,330
What else do you want?

652
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,870
We have the moon, some wine,

653
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,250
and some trees over there.

654
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,170
This is enough to be considered a ceremony.

655
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,720
When Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei became sworn brothers,

656
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
they prayed to a peach tree.

657
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,980
We happen to have a peach tree here.

658
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,120
How about we pray to the peach tree too?

659
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,430
Okay, as you said.

660
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,150
Let's pray to the tree.

661
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,370
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

662
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,970
Let's pray to the peach tree.

663
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,240
Why are you sitting here?

664
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,330
Come on. Let's do it together.

665
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,510
I'm just a lady.

666
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,600
The two of you are becoming sworn brothers.

667
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,480
Why should I go?

668
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,190
Who said girls can't be sworn brothers?

669
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,120
Come on. Let's do it together.

670
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,570
Today,

671
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,750
we are all brothers.

672
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,250
Yes.

673
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,740
Slow down.

674
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,240
There's a doorsill.

675
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,340

00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,400
have been gambling for so many years.

678

or going bankrupt,

I'm not afraid of her.

680

I know, I know.

681
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,450
How dare she gamble with me?

682
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,150
-Lady Xifeng.
-Slowly.

683
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,550
I don't care if she's Lady Xifeng

684
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,650
or Lady Dongfeng.

685
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,740
They'll all lose to me.

686
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,830
Watch your step.

687
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,430
How dare they gamble with me.

688
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,830
I'm not afraid of anyone.

689
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,830
Be careful. Sit.

690
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,430
I'm not afraid of anything.

691
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,280
Wait for me here.

692
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,460
I'll get you some hangover soup.

693
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,360
Wait.

694
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
I've been gambling for so many years.

695
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,230
I've never been afraid.

696
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,170
But I was afraid today.

697
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,220

00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,300
You came at the right time.

762
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,830
We are praying for you.

763
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,460
Come and pray.

764
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,860
Praying for me?

765
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,350
The examination

766
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,030
is a test of the results of my studies.

767
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,420
There's no need to pray.

768
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,900
Don't talk nonsense.

769
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,740
Be good.

770
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,690
-Come on.
-No.

771
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,140
Let them go.

772
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,150
It's scary.

773
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,930
There's no harm in praying.

774
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,880
Yes.

775
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,430
I'd rather believe it

776
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,830
than believe in nothing.

777
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,060
Are you guys taking the exam

778
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,190
or am I?

779
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,670
Of course it's you.

780
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,570
It'll only work if you pray yourself.

781
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,490
Come on.

782
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,390
No.

783
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,800
You go ahead.

784
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,340
Jiusi!

785
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,980
Let's not delay the auspicious time.

786
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,910
Let's continue.

787
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,030
Rise.

788
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,300
Pray.

789
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,900
Gu Jiusi.

790
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,710
Come here.

791
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,210
Look at your handwriting.

792
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,940
The more you wrote, the uglier it got.

793
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,270
Even I can write better.

794
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,790
And then there's the ink.

795
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,430
Sometimes it's dense, sometimes it's light.

796
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,560
People can go blind from reading this.

797
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,590
If I were marking this script,

798
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,600
based on the handwriting alone,

799
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,660
I won't have a good impression of you.

800
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:37,800
Why am I being bothered

801
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,970
wherever I go?

802
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,860
What's wrong?

803
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,070
I came to see you out of kindness.

804
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,670
But you don't appreciate it?

805
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,570
What kindness?

806
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,650
I think you're making things worse.

807
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,380
I think you're feeling guilty.

808
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,540
Why would I be guilty?

809
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,080
I know what you're capable of.

810
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,600
You seem to have changed.

811
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,950
But there's no way you can pass the exam.

812
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,170
Stop finding excuses

813
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,170
for your failure.

814
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,680
Is this what a father should say to his son?

815
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,190
What if I pass?

816
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,620
What then?

817
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,300
Enough. Don't flatter me.

818
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,970
We don't produce scholars in this family.

819
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,640
Goodbye.

820
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,730
What's wrong?

821
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,650
Jiusi.

822
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,660
All I did was nag at you a little,

823
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,260
and now you're running away?

824
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,470
Why are you shouting?

825
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,290
Jiusi is right.

826
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,640
Don't disturb his studies.

827
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,540
You should stop nagging at him so much.

828
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,170
He finally has the resolve

829
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,220
to study hard.

830
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,110
You should encourage him.

831
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:34,620
Okay.

832
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,240
This is the paper written by your son.

833
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,240
Have a look.

834
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,390
Good luck encouraging him.

835
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,340
Little brat.

836
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,810
I wonder

837
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,610
how his studies are going.

838
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,450
Why are there so many fallen leaves today?

839
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,110
What has fallen?

840
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,040
What has fallen?

841
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,710
Master.

842
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,860
From now on, stop using the word "fallen".

843
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,390
You have to say "high pass".

844
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,050
You're so clueless.

845
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:14,990
Don't question me.

846
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,830
Pass my message.

847
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,850
From now on, no one in the mansion

848
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,270
is allowed to say "fallen" or "low"

849
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,130
You have to say "high" and "pass".

850
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,960
Do you hear me?

851
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:27,960
Master.

852
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,430
If it rains

853
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,070
or if someone has lost something,

854
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,080
how should we say it?

855
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,290
Yes, Master.

856
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,630
How should we say it?

857
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,120
It's hard to get used to the sudden change.

858
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,260
Cut the complaints.

859
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,270
Just do as I said.

860
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,340
Get back to work.

861
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:05,970
Young Master.

862
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,080
This again?

863
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,600
Even if it's tasty, I can't eat it everyday.

864
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,290
Young Master, this is called a high-pass cake.

865
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,250
It's auspicious.

866
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,850
All the students in the city

867
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,650
have been eating this recently.

868
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,400
This must be my mother's idea too.

869
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,360
She likes these.

870
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,850
I don't want it.

871
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,100

874
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:42,970
Jiusi

875
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,650
won't listen to anyone else now.

876
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,980
He only listens to Yuru.

877
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,340
It's not hard to get him

878
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,200
to eat the cake.

879
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,290
Just ask Yuru to help you.

880
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,640
I need my daughter-in-law's help

881
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,240
to get my son to eat some cake?

882
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,710
I'm the head of the Gu family after all.

883
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,180
What of my pride and image?

884
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,520
I prepared the cake myself.

885
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,810
Don't tell anyone about this.

887
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:25,980
Such a big scene.

888
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,590
All right, you don't have to see me off.

889
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,930

You have to stay there for nine days.

894
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,130
Fortunately,

895
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,810
I prepared some thick clothes for you.

in the lowest compartment of the case.

899
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,360

Mother, do you know

917
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,980
what he told me last night?

918
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,840
What did he say?

919
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,760
He said he has memorized

920
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,270
all the Confucian classics.

921
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,540
He can rank first in the Provincial Examination this time.

00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,590
Really?

923
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,160
I wonder

924
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,840
where he got the confidence.

925
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,490
But I didn't want to discourage him either.

926
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,040
It's a good mindset.
