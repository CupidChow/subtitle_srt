00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,990
Again.

194
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,540
Come on.

195
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,130
Here.

196
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,160
Drink this.

197
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,850
Candied haws.

198
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,660
My Lady, someone is coming out.

199
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,550
Umbrellas! Umbrellas for sale!

200
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,020
Mr. Gu,

201
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,070
I'll prepare a carriage for you.

202
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,310
My Lady, it seems to be him.

203
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,290
Go.

204
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:24,880
Yes.

205
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,170
Are you Mr. Gu?

206
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,770
Who are you?

207
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
My master has something to tell you.

208
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,910
Who is your master then?

209
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,830
I've seen

210
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,880
her several times in Ye Mansion.

211
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,680
Ye Mansion?

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,260
Mr. Gu, did you

213
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,100
just buy

214
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,070
a white fox fur?

215
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,410
That's right.

216
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,750
Then...

217
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,510
That belongs to my master,

218
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,650
who put it in the garment-making shop

219
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,910
and sold it by mistake.

220
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,220
Your master's?

221
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,700
Yes, it wasn't supposed to be sold.

222
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,000
So...

223
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,040
Where is your master?

224
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,150
Right there. He's not far.

225
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,850
It's snowing heavily.

226
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,850
Why didn't he go in

227
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,550
to find me on such a cold day?

228
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,970
It's inconvenient

229
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,320
for my master to come here.

230
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,590
It's inconvenient for him?

231
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,200
Ye Shi'an

232
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:32,870
is the only gentleman

233
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,530
in the whole Yangzhou, right?

234
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,170
It's inconvenient for him.

235
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,950
Let me tell you.

236
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,150
My father always sets him as my example.

237
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,520
He's just good at studying.

238
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,650
What's the big deal?

239
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,870
He even asked a maid

240
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,070
to dress up like a man.

241
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,060
What?

242
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,440
Can't women be seen?

243
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,800
Mr. Gu.

244
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,720
Mr. Gu.

245
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,770
Mr. Gu.

246
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,370
Are you done?

247
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,200
Umbrellas for sale.

248
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,740
What?

249
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,750
Mr. Ye is

250
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,170
too decent to

251
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,600
see my face?

252
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,630
I'm sorry.

253
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,430
I didn't know you were a girl.

254
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,630
I thought you were...

255
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,370
Good to see you, Mr. Gu.

256
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,720
It's just a misunderstanding.

257
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,520
It's nothing.

258
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,150
But that white fox fur

259
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,210
is important to me.

260
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,220
Please help me

261
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,490
and return it to me.

262
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,100
I can't afford it now.

263
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,540
But I can sign a pledge.

264
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,810
But that fox fur

265
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,480
is a man's style.

266
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,390
Why is it yours?

267
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,500
I made it…

268
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,900
For Ye Shi'an?

269
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,830
I was wondering why your maid

270
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,290
always came to Ye Mansion.

271
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,550
Do you like Ye Shi'an?

272
00:13:59,310 --> 00:13:59,690
I...

273
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,150
Does she like Ye Shi'an?

274
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,040
What? Does she like Ye Shi'an?

275
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,630
Mr. Gu, don't talk nonsense.

276
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,310
How is that nonsense?

277
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,900
If it was,

278
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,340
why would you be nervous?

279
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,770
Mr. Gu,

280
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,370
although I'm a normal merchant,

281
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,880
I'm a decent lady

282
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,390
after all.

283
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,040
Mr. Gu is rich.

284
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,870
You're different from me.

285
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,610
Why do you have to humiliate me?

286
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,050
I'm not humiliating you.

287
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,620
I...

288
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,640
I sincerely want to ask you

289
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,280
why you like Ye Shi'an.

290
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,760
You...

291
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,180
All the ladies in the city

292
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,320
want to marry Ye Shi'an.

293
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,370
I don't understand.

294
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,040
What's so good about Ye Shi An?

295
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,850
Tell me.

296
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,650
It's not embarrassing

297
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,740
to have a bad taste.

298
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,890
Mr. Gu,

299
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,440
do you

300
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,370
not want to return the fox fur to me?

301
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,540
If you answer me,

302
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,260
I'll give you

303
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,100
even ten furs.

304
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,950
Mr. Gu,

305
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,420
please do me a favor.

306
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,980
Fine.

307
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,030
I gave your fox fur

308
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,030
to someone else yesterday.

309
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,110
What did you say?

310
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,880
I said I gave it to someone else.

311
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,300
Where is he?

312
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,730
How would I know?

313
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,520
It's just a dress.

314
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,150
[Jin]

315
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,070
Buy another one.

316
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,030
Take it.

317
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,020
Why are you doing this?

318
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,610
I...

319
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,370
Mr. Gu,

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,130
don't you want to know

321
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:49,640
why Mr. Ye

322
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,770
is better than you?

323
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,010
Let me tell you.

324
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,880
He is an upright

325
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,640
and well-educated man.

326
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,230
Also,

327
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,860
people like you

328
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,120
serve as a foil to him.

329
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,260
How could you

330
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,520
criticize me with Ye Shi'an?

331
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,200
I finally know

332
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,860
why your reputation is so bad.

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,220
You come from a wealthy family

334
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,140
and are unrestrained,

335
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,240
like a jinx.

336
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,500
Who wants to marry you?

337
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,550
Let's go.

338
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,870
Make it clear.

339
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,790
Who is a jinx?

340
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,420
Enough.

341
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,400
Don't lower yourself to her level.

342
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,660
Everyone is watching.

343
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,180
Alright.

344
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,230
Stop looking.

345
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,360
-Go back.
-Stop looking.

346
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,040
-Stop looking.
-Get dismissed.

347
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,900
Get dismissed.

348
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,890
I'm a jinx?

349
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,280
I gave her money and I'm a jinx?

350
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,080
I...

351
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,630
Alright, don't be angry.

352
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,530
I know the Liu family

353
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,460
who sells cloth.

354
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,480
I heard that her father dotes on the concubine and looks down on his wife.

355
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,740
She is the legitimate daughter,

356
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,500
but she's living a worse life

357
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,300
than her illegitimate sisters.

358
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:47,890
Don't

359
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,490
mind her.

360
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,670
No wonder.

361
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,610
It's cold and she's wearing so thin.

362
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,410
She made a white fox fur

363
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,870
but it's for someone else.

364
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,720
Didn't you give that white fox fur

365
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,040
to the little beggar?

366
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,119
Mu Nan.

367
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,310
Thank you.

368
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,550
Hide it well.

369
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,120
Wen Chang.

370
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,550
Go find another dress

371
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,130
and get the fox fur back.

372
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,540
Why?

373
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,760
Give it back to her.

374
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,390
She?

375
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,540
She likes Ye Shi'an

376
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,420
and was mean to you.

377
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,880
You're still helping her?

378
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,480
I don't mind her.

379
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,460
As you said,

380
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,960
it's not easy for her.

381
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:58,910
Yes.

382
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,940
My Lady, the fox fur is gone.

383
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,690
What about Madam's medicine?

384
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,350
I can only borrow some

385

Only she will help me

387
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,040

next month,

394
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,420
how about

395
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,690
not going?

396

398
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,310
I hope you can marry a good guy

399
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,650
and have a good future.

400
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,880
All these years,

401
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,220
you've done so much

402
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,350
for Mr. Ye.

403
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,710
You put all your heart on him.

404
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,850
I know it.

405
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,690
But there are

406
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,240
so many girls

407
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,090
from prestigious families,

who want to

409

Besides,

Madam Ye

412
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,370
might have someone chosen

413

for her granddaughter-in-law.

414
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,150
It's useless for you to go.

415
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,060
I'm afraid you'll feel sad when you fail.

416

Mother.

417
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,540
Just let me go.

I don't think you should go to

She has a special identity

438

You offer

535
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,200

Thank you, Madam.

are new styles of this year.

There are many colors.

547
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,110
Take a look.

548
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,700
I ordered two bolts.

549
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,370
This hairpin is so beautiful.

550
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,710
Yuru.

551
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,530
Who are you drawing?

552
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
It's you.

553
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,680
I once heard

554
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,570
you were born in a general's family.

555
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,010
When you were young, you went to the border with your father

556
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,740
and could wield the sword well.

557
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,570
I took the liberty

558
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,250
and drew a painting based on my imagination.

559
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,950
Why did you draw this?

560
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,350
Because…

561
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,160
Because I envy you.

562
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,240
Most women

563
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,270
are trapped in the mansion.

564
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,890
They can't travel around

565
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,860
like a man.

566
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,860
But you've seen the land

567
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,330
and served the country.

568
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,530
That makes me envious.

569
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,520
Since

570
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,960
I got married at 17,

571
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,240
I've never touched a sword

572
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,500
ever again.

573
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,960
Other people's presents

574
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,630
are for

575
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,540
the matron of the Ye family.

576
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,420
And the painting you gave me

577
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,400
is for me,

578
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,220
Liang Qingyu.

579
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,780
Good girl.

580
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,000
Go.

581
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,030
Go talk to Yun.

582
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,310
Got it.

583
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,170
What are you doing?

584
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,190
Don't worry.

585
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,270
You'll know soon.

586
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,450
You've been dilly-dallying

587
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,800
and dressed me like this.

588
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,350
I'll hit you if you don't tell me.

589
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,230
We're here

590
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,490
to take you to see your wife.

591
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,600
Wife?

592
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,790
Your parents went to Ye Mansion

593
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,540
to propose marriage to you.

594
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,400
Don't you know?

595
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,910
Since you're here,

596
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,700
let's meet her before we go.

597
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,200
No.

598
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,220
Someone is here.

599
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,020
Someone is here.

600
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,820
Let's go.

601
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,170
Yuru.

602
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,850
What should I do

603
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,320
about the proposal with Gu Jiusi?

604
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,210
What?

605
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,800
Gu Jiusi?

606
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,030
The notorious

607
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,200
playboy?

608
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,450
After you left yesterday,

609
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,460
the matron of the Gu family

610
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,920
came to propose marriage.

611
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,240
My family has been a scholarly one.

612
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,710
[Ye Yun, the legitimate daughter of the Ye family]

613
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,800
The only official in my family

614
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,200
just worked at an unimportant department.

615
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,620
Why would the Gu family

616
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,170
like me?

617
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,230
I'm afraid

618
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,250
Gu Jiusi had a crush on you

619
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,010
at a festival of lanterns or an outing.

620
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,850
What did your family say?

621
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,440
What else can they say?

622
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,880
The Gu family is wealthy and prominent.

623
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Even a governor

624
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,320
has to put on a smile for them.

625
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,580
My parents dare not refuse them.

626
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,810
They just put it off

627
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,170
and don't dare to reply.

628
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,460
I'm afraid my parents

629
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,560
would make me

630
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,360
marry him.

631
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,920
Yuru,

632
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,440
what should I do then?

633
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,250
I understand.

634
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,140
If I were you,

635
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,610
I would rather

636
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,490
kill myself.

637
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,720
How about this?

638
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,840
Since your family doesn't dare to reject him,

639
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,420
let's force him to break off the engagement.

640
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,780
How?

641
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,210
Go opposite of all his preferences.

642
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,830
I heard Gu Jiusi

643
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,380
adores martial arts and loses his study.

644
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,480
He hates the classics of saints.

645
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,760
After you go back today,

646
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,850
read

647
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,980
the Four Books and The Five Classics

648
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,540
especially about the principles of living.

649
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,210
Remember.

650
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,850
When you see him,

651
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,360
advise him.

652
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,340
Besides,

653
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,570
he is absurd

654
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,870
and rude,

655
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,610
so he hates the polite ladies from

656
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,860
noble families

657
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,860
who speak gently,

658
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,750
thinking they're pretentious.

659
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,480
If you see him,

660
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,210
put on a thready throat

661
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,220
and show him

662
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,420
all the formalities.

663
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,870
If he makes a mistake,

664
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,050
cry.

665
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,440
Don't be too rational.

666
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,820
Don't be too normal.

667
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,320
Act like you can't speak

668
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
or do things well.

669
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,070
Anyway, the more pretentious, the better.

670
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,270
I don't think

671
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,740
it's proper.

672
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,300
Why not?

673
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,240
You just need to meet him in private

674
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,890
and disgust him a few times.

675
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,260
His reputation

676
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,690
is ruined.

677
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,660
Even if he blames you,

678
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,050
others will think

679
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,690
he's slandering you.

680
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,110
You're right.

681
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,720
If I don't disgust him,

682
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,290
he'll disgust me in the future.

683
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:56,950
Yes.

684
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,680
Not only is Gu Jiusi

685
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,820
a rascal,

686
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,990
but he's jealous of

687
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,750
a gentleman

688
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,090
like Shi'an.

689
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,810
If you see him,

690
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,330
you can praise Shi'an's

691
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,710
knowledge and character

692
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,100
in front of him

693
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,030
and compare him to Shi'an,

694
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,790
saying

695
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,550
he's not as good as Shi'an.

696
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,200
If he still wants to

697
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,590
marry me,

698
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,150
what should I do?

699
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,040
What are you dreaming about?

700
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,300
Who wants to marry you?

701
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,100
You...

702
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,740
Who are you?

703
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,680
Help!

704
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,400
-Help!
-Help!

705
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,110
Whose servants are you?

706
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,870
How dare you break into the backyard?

707
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,470
Hurry. Beat them out.

708
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,440
Hurry!

709
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,350
Stop.

710
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,110
Go.

711
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,780
Stop.

712
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,750
I'll kill you.

713
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,520
Hurry.

714
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,130
Hurry up.

715
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,890
Yuru.

716
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,960
They are not servants.

717
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,550
They are

718
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,920
playboys that hang out together.

719
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,200
The man in the middle

720
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,380
must be Gu…

721
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,460
You've never seen Gu Jiusi.

722
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,150
Those three people

723
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,690
are just bad servants.

724
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:23,930
Jiusi.

725
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,690
Jiusi.

726
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,700
Gu Jiusi.

727
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,260
You ran fast.

728
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,800
The girls were too timid.

729
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,460
They called for help without saying anything.

730
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,520
It's not like that.

731
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,230
She was just

732
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,280
playing dumb.

733
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,710
She was afraid we'd ruin her reputation.

734
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,210
She did it on purpose?

735
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:40,870
Of course.

736
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,950
She's seen us.

737
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,750
What's her name again?

738
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,840
Liu... Liu...

739
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:44,970
Liu Yuru.

740
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,240
Liu Yuru.

741
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,300
Even the name is vulgar

742
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,140
and annoying.

743
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,480
She looks

744
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,740
elegant.

745
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,090
In fact,

746
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,430
she has many evil thoughts.

747
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,860
What a bad girl.

748
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,200
What bad luck.

749
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:58,960
Bad luck.

750
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,180
You asked me

751
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,440
to find her the fox fur.

752
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,450
Luckily, I didn't find it.

753
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,550
No wonder.

754
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,530
She is the daughter of a cloth merchant.

755
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,699
If she wasn't capable,

756
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,760
she wouldn't dare to covet Ye Shi'an.

757
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,489
Why are you laughing?

758
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,610
I'm laughing at her for her plain appearance

759
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,400
and scheming.

760
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,080
Sh's a perfect match

761
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,880
with the pretentious Ye Shi'an.

762
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:22,480
OK.

763
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,540
Shi'an?

764
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,850
I agree with

765
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,550
this marriage.

766
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,179
Madam.

767
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,620
How could you hit her?

768
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,610
You whore.

769
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,909
Have you lost your mind?

770
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,510
How can you offend Mr. Gu?

771
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,889
Who is he?

772
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,239
Who are you?

773
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,000
You are not afraid of death.

774
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,929
But we're afraid of being implicated by you.

775
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,030
Today, I shall teach you a lesson

776
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,429
on behalf of your mother.

777
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:57,880
Stop!

778
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,360
Madam.

779
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,330
Grandmother.

780
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,750
She hit Yuru.

781
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:24,850
Madam.

782
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,850
Here's the thing.

783
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,910
As we all know,

784
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,510
no one in Yangzhou dares to

785
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,230
offend the Gu family.

786
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,040
It's not a big deal

787
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,300
that she doesn't know the rules

788
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,300
and disgraces us.

789
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,230
But she's caused a big trouble

790
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,530
in the mansion.

791
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,630
If I don't teach her a lesson,

792
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,760
how can we solve it

793
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,230
in the future?

794
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,510
Put away

795
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,440
your dirty tricks and thoughts.

796
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,840
Yuru is my guest

797
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,310
in my mansion.

798
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,290
How dare you

799
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,430
hit my guest?

800
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,780
Do you know how to behave yourself?

801
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,200
I...

802
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,040
What?

803
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,060
Do you even respect the Ye family?

804
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,000
Speaking of shame,

805
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,680
I think you, the concubine mother,

806
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,740
have disgraced the Liu family.

807
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,380
Get out.

808
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,450
Get out!

809
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,710
Yes, Madam.

810
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,160
Mother.

811
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,750
Go home.

812
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,350
Kid.

813
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,120
Come here.

814
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,230
Let me see.

815
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,120
Did she hurt you?

816
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,860
It doesn't matter.

817
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,470
She's just a concubine.

818
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,710
How dare she hit the legitimate daughter?

819
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,930
She hit you so hard

820
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,200
and spoke so harshly.

821
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,060
She doesn't usually scold me.

822
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,430
Today, she was afraid of the Gu family's power

823
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,980
and got impatient.

824
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,110
But this is in someone else's house.

825
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,210
She even beat you in front of others.

826
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:11,940
Even if

827
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,960
she didn't care about your feelings,

828
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,100
shouldn't your father say something?

829
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,910
My father?

830
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,870
Since my father married Concubine Yue,

831
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,630
I don't seem to have a father anymore.

832
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,010
I don't care about that anymore.

833
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,830
I'm the most shameless

834
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,880
legitimate daughter in Yangzhou.

835
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,080
Everyone knows that.

836
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,920
Kid,

837
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,870
you must have suffered a lot

838
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,840
in such a house.

839
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,130
Madam.

840
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,980
It's good

841
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,820
that we can settle it down.

842
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,390
Don't worry.

843
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,730
Yuru.

844
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,080
Did you kick out

845
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,470
Mr. Gu?

846
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,520
No.

847
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,830
Grandmother.

848
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,040
That was my idea.

849
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,960
It has nothing to do with Yuru.

850
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,120
Punish me if you want.

851
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,450
I dare not lie to you.

852
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,010
It was my idea.

853
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,900
Please punish me.

854
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,350
I want to ask you,

855
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,370
what were you thinking?

856
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,380
I just thought

857
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,270
there were many guests

858
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,120
in the front and backyard today.

859
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,430
If the word got out,

860
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,600
I was afraid it'd disgrace the Ye family

861
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,430
and Yun's reputation.

862
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,540
So I pretended not to recognize him

863
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,890
and shut their mouths.

864
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,610
I kicked them out

865
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,090
before they had the chance to reveal themselves.

866
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,440
If anyone asks us in the future,

867
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,130
just say it's a misunderstanding.

868
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,940
Even if word gets out,

869
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,320
it will just become

870
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,880
a laughingstock.

871
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,940
The Gu family can't look into it.

872
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:24,910
Here.

873
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,880
Madam.

874
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,180
This is too expensive.

875
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
I can't accept it.

876
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,910
It's my duty

877
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,170
to help Yun.

878
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,880
You don't have to thank me.

879
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,700
This

880
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,010
is not a reward for you.

881
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,690
Here.

882
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:51,240
Your marriage should be settled.

883
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,560
An will be back soon.

884
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,370
Go back

885
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,300
and tell your parents.

886
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,120
I'll prepare the betrothal gifts

887
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,750
and propose marriage in your house.

888
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,000
Thank you, Madam.

889
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,590
Great.

890
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,940
My Lady, you finally got what you wanted.

891
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,050
It feels like

892
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,510
a dream.

893
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,700
But your face is swelling even more.

894
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,700
Can you tell at a glance?

895
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,270
I can tell

896
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,400
you were slapped.

897
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,190
We can't let my mother find out.

898
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,860
Let's go to

899
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,950
the rouge shop Nuanshuang

900
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,040
beside Qinhuai.

901
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,340
Okay.

902
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,890
Xun…

903
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,020
No way.

904
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,440
I can't let it go.

905
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,330
She just

906
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,860
treated us like this today.

907
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,860
We can't just let it go.

908
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,590
Tell me

909
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,980
what do you want?

910
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,180
Think about it.

911
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,180
She's going to marry Ye Shi'an.

912
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,390
Ye Shi'an

913
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,650
has been overshadowing us

914
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,650
for so many years.

915
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,880
Now even his wife

916
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,730
slapped us in the face.

917
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,710
If we don't fight back now,

918
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,970
are we still men?

919
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,070
She might not be able to

920
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,200
marry the Ye family.

921
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,590
Trust me.

922
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,740
With her scheming and tactics,

923
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,400
I think highly of her.

924
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,550
Anyway,

925
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,480
if I catch her,

926
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,540
I'll take it out on her.

927
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,010
Tell me

928
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,290
what do you want to do?

929
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,700
An eye

930
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,640
for an eye.

931
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,230
We'll deal with her

932
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,960
the way she does with us.

933
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:16,730
Let's behave

934
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:17,690
the way she hates

935
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,620
and disgust her.

936
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,790
But the problem is

937
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,350
Liu Yuru

938
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,150
knows clearly

939
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,610
what Jiusi hates the most.

940
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,920
Do we know

941
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,690
what Liu Yuru hates the most?

942
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,910
Go ask around.

943
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,500
In Yangzhou,

944
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,890
there is nothing

945
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,900
I can't find out.

946
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,580
No need.

947
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,430
I know what she hates.

948
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:38,400
What?

949
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,890
Me.

950
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,530
Didn't she say

951
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,590
if I fell in love with her,

952
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,450
she would jump into the lake and kill herself?

953
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,430
Good for you.

954
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,940
Yes, let's go find her.

955
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,020
Steamed buns, take a look.

956
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,040
Steamed buns.

957
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,560
Miss Yuru is coming.

958
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,550
Please come in.

959
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,370
Excuse me.

960
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,680
Is there any rouge

961
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:31,440
I can use to cover my face with?

962
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,110
You used to like

963
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,540
light colors.

964
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,760
Why are you...

965
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,090
Okay, My Lady.

966
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,800
Please.

967
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:40,850
Thank you.

968
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,210
Here.

969
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,800
This is called “A perfect match”.

970
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,890
[A perfect match]

971
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,110
The ointment is dense.

972
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,240
Dip it with silk brocade

973
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,290
and apply it to your face.

974
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,140
It can cover up scars and swelling.

975
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,030
It's good for daily use.

976
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,580
How much?

977
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,700
It's always 1150 copper cash.

978
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,820
You are a regular.

979
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,910
We won't count the small change.

980
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:04,960
1000 copper it is.

981
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,540
Do you have any cheap rouge?

982
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,760
The ones I normally use.

983
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,290
Let me show you something else.

984
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,160
Thank you.

985
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,060
Yuru, are you buying rouge?

986
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:25,580
Madam.

987
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,920
I'm afraid it's inappropriate

988
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,980
to have men in here.

989
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,270
Sir,

990
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,830
this is a rouge shop.

991
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:31,920
With you here,

992
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:32,630
my customers…

993
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:33,360
Don't worry.

994
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,790
It won't affect your business.

995
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,840
I'll buy all the rouge

996
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:39,950
in the store today.

997
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:40,820
But...
