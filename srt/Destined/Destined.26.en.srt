Young General, how can you make him

21
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,420
It's inappropriate.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,180
Why is it

31
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,790
that we could afford

32
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,550
to build new hospitals,

why have the food prices in Youzhou

37

stayed stable instead of rising

38

to those questions?

41
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,160
The answer

42
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,980
is the guy you called an outsider,

43
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,860

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,350
we should

197
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,400
die for our people, shouldn't we?

198
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,660
Yes. That's right.

199
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,780
You're right, Young Master Ye.

200
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,660
We were

201
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,350
out of our minds.

202
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,790
We were out of our minds.

203
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,060
We were out of our minds.

204
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,110
What?

205
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,800
Are you surprised?

206
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,300
Since young,

207
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,700
you've only seen me

208
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,610
follow the rules

209
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,010
and keep a straight face.

210
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,200
I'm surprised,

211
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,380
but it made sense.

212
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,040
I'm glad you said that.

213
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,420
Young Master.

214
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,450
Young Master.

215
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,380
Young Master.

216
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,910
Lord Liang's army arrived.

217
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,950
So soon?

218
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,360
[Liang]

219
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,000
How do you feel?

220
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,320
Are you scared?

221
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,100
Facing such an intimidating army,

222
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,360
anyone will be scared.

223
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,660
When you lashed out just now,

224
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,100
I thought

225
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,900
you were not afraid of anything.

226
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,680
This is different.

227
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,850
I meant every word

228
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,840
I said just now.

229
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,500
My family had a good reputation for generations.

230
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,300
Even my sister

231
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:35,740
values her reputation

232
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,800
more than her life.

233
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,470
In the past,

234
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,990
I was just like them.

235
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,380
But you straightened me out.

236
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,440
You were right.

237
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,980
It's easy to die for empty fame,

238
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,230
but much harder

239
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,390
to take responsibility

240
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,140
and strive to stay alive.

241
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,310
What are you going to do?

242
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,820
Now that they're at our door,

243
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,140
we have to face them head-on.

244
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,510
Don't panic.

245
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,420
Go clean the wing for the homeless to move in.

246
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,900
Yes.

247
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,150
Wait.

248
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,420
Go to the Ye Mansion

249
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,580
to bring Miss Ye here.

250
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,790
If she refuses again,

251
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,100
bring her here by force. Go.

252
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,590
Yes.

253
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,150
Go to Huarong

254
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:29,900
to see if there are girls

255
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,980
who can't find shelter.

256
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,140
Bring them back.

257
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:32,820
Yes.

258
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,160
[Youzhou]

259
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,590
[Youzhou]

260
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,950
[Youzhou]

261
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,020
Lord Liang, the traitor,

262
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,340
you're finally here.

263
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,070
Who are you?

264
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,300
I'm your distant grandfather.

265
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,510
You despicable rat

266
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,280
don't deserve to know my name!

267
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,300
You young lout!

268
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,820
Guard your tongue!

269
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,700
Open your eyes!

270
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,740
His Highness has 100,000 men

271
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,980
at his command.

272
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,350
Leveling Wangdu

273
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,470
will be a walkover.

274
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,510
If you open the gate

275
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,860
and surrender,

276
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,110
we may spare your life.

277
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,740
If I offer you a big pancake,

278
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,700
will you take it?

279
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,210
You're just a bunch of low-life weasels

280
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,620
who fled here after losing the war.

281
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,080
Who are you to threaten me?

282
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,580
Find a mirror and take a look

283
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,590
at your wicked

284
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,420
and unfaithful face!

285
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,390
Take my word.

286
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,340
Drop your weapons

287
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,740
and abandon madness for reason,

288
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,180
so that when you get hit by lightning,

289
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,780
you can look to a quick death.

290
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
You're audacious!

291
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,830
I am audacious. So what?

292
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,060
Hit me if you can.

293
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,540
I dare you to try!

294
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,230
Attack!

295
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:40,940
Kill! Kill! Kill!

296
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:48,940
Kill! Kill! Kill!

297
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,220
Run!

298
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:01,870
Kill! Kill! Kill!

299
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,900
Open the gate!

300
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,350
Yes.

301
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,750
Open the gate!

302
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,340
Open the gate!

303
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:19,980
Draw!

304
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,740
Secretary Ye,

305
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,220
they're very close to the gate.

306
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,980
If we don't shoot them now…

307
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,670
Not yet.

308
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,040
Stick to Jiusi's plan.

309
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,570
Secretary Ye,

310
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,700
they're getting closer!

311
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,860
Wait until they reach the wall.

312
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,250
If we wait until they reach the wall,

313
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,250
it'll be too late.

314
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,430
Halt.

315
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,710
Retreat!

316
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,610
♫It's a time of unrest♫

317
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,000
♫Memories of the good old days flood back at times♫

318
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,060
♫He writes order in chaos♫

319
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,750
♫Dark hair turns grey and escapes from the hairpin♫

320
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,340
♫Mountains crumble, and the beacon fires fade♫

321
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,300
♫I miss playing chess and drinking wine with you♫

322
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,360
Close the gate!

323
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,060
Close the gate!

324
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,250
♫It was autumn when we parted ways♫

325
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,680
♫We sang songs about a brighter future♫

326

♫Riding alongside you, I see the world unfold♫

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,580

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,570
♫In the dust stirred up by the wind, we write our own fates♫

329
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,240
[Liang]

330
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,990
[Liang]

331
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,740
Gu.

332
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,660
They camped as you expected.

333
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Lord Liang's army

334
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,300
was defeated by the Youzhou Army.

335
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,860
After traveling thousands of miles

336
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,460
with frayed nerves,

337
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,260
his soldiers are all exhausted.

338
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,780
Unless they're confident of victory,

339
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,030
they won't attack.

340
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,750
Besides, Lord Liang

341
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,550
is paranoid.

342
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,210
The more fearless we appear,

343
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:53,820
the more

344
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,020
uncertain he becomes.

345
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,220
The first attack is usually the fiercest.

346
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,940
The following attacks only wear the soldiers' spirits out.

347
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,660
They've missed

348
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,060
the best chance to attack.

349
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,580
After we reinforce the gate,

350
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,540
it'll be hard for them

351
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,600
to attack us again.

352
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,240
Reinforce the wall and gate tonight.

353
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,620
We'll hold our position

354
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,280
and wait for reinforcements.

355
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,970
[Youzhou]

356
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,790
Should we attack or not?

357
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,460
It's so tough a decision.

358
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,150
Report!

359
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,700
Your Highness,

360
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,300
no troop came out of the gate.

361
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,270
Again…

362
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,700
Tell the soldiers in the front camps to rest.

363
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,430
The back camps will keep watch.

364
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,110
Yes.

365
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,400
Your Highness,

366
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,060
this is the third time this night

367
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,060
that our enemies sounded the war drum

368
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,860
without commencing the attack.

369
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,350
Seems that Wangdu

370
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,690
is just doing that

371
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,290
to disconcert our soldiers.

372
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,030
It's almost dawn.

373
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,190
Soldiers in the back camps

374
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:14,860
have been up all night.

375
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,070
I don't need you to tell me that.

376
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,870
But the Youzhou Army

377
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,990
has guarded Darong's border for decades

378
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,630
and won countless battles.

379
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,030
We can't underestimate them.

380
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,420
You're right, Your Highness.

381
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,470
The guy leading the troops in the day,

382
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,580
I wonder

383
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,670
what his name is.

384
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,340
His way of doing things

385
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,000
is completely different from

386
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,560
Fan Xuan and Zhou Gaolang.

387
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,260
I can't see through him.

388
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,070
I've sent someone to look into him.

389
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,100
We know nothing about

390
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,340
the manpower and military supplies in Wangdu.

391
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,100
I…

392
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,100
I'm not sure

393
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,330
whether we should take a chance.

394
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,860
I understand.

395
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,400
Your Highness,

396
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,090
this is

397
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,470
our last chance.

398
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,730
We have

399
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,310
an army of 100,000.

400
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,660
If we don't take down Wangdu,

401
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,580
won't you regret it?

402
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,090
Your Highness.

403
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,420
They're doing it again.

404
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,100
Your Highness, please give the order.

405
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,930
Your Highness, please give the order.

406
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,060
-Your Highness. Your Highness.
-Please give the order.

407
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,550
Pass my order on.

408
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,900
The soldiers in the back camps can rest too.

409
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,300
Have a good sleep

410
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
before dawn.

411
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,750
Tomorrow,

412
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,270
we'll commence the attack.

413
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,980
Yes.

414
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,310
Gu.

415
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
It's almost dawn.

416
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,380
It's time.

417
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,020
I gathered you here today

418
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,950
to tell you

419
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,180
that the enemies

420
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,830
are right outside the wall.

421
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,890
We're all able-bodied people.

422
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,300
We can't stand by and watch our soldiers

423
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,160
bleed and fight on the front line.

424
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,710
We have to do something.

425
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,220
The soldiers will fight on the front line.

426
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,020
We'll support them from behind.

427
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Let's join forces

428
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,790
and guard Wangdu!

429
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,590
Guard Wangdu!

430
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,020
Guard Wangdu!

431
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,350
Guard Wangdu!

432
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,860
Guard Wangdu!

433
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,270
Guard Wangdu!

434
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,510
Guard Wangdu!

435
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,940
Guard Wangdu!

436
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,250
[Liang]

437
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,460
The enemies are attacking!

438
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,620
The enemies are attacking!

439
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,420
Run! The enemies are attacking!

440
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,190
The enemies are attacking!

441
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,240
Stop shouting!

442
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Can't a man sleep?

443
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,030
The enemies are attacking!

444
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,260
The enemies are attacking!

445
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,620
Your Highness!

446
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,020
Your Highness! Bad news!

447
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,580
The enemies are attacking!

448
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,190
Your Highness, be careful!

449
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,900
Jiusi, be careful, they're surrounding us.

450
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,470
Retreat!

451
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,500
Go after them!

452
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,230
Hurry!

453
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,080
After them!

454
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,000
Your Highness!

455
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,550
Hurry!

456
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,630
Hurry!

457
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,700
Your Highness, are you alright?

458
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,630
Report!

459
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,960
Your Highness.

460
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,940
We've investigated it.

461
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,660
The general guarding the city

462
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,890
is Gu Jiusi,

463
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,290
the previous county magistrate of Wangdu.

464
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,590
Who?

465
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,270
Gu Jiusi.

466
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,100
Do you mean

467
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,230
the nephew of my legitimate wife,

468
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,290
the eldest son of the Gu family of Yangzhou?

469
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,460
That Gu Jiusi?

470
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,470
Yes.

471
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,030
Good on you.

472
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,270
Good on you, Gu Jiusi.

473
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,180
Lord Liang sent a message

474
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,470
inviting you out of the city for a chat.

475
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,350
Looks like my uncle

476
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,540
finally found out about our relationship.

477
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,140
Very well.

478
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,740
I'll meet him.

479
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,450
Are you really going?

480
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,420
But there are so many of them.

481
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,880
If anything goes wrong...

482
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,460
If he were confident,

483
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,620
why would he talk to me?

484
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,880
He would be attacking.

485
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,940
Right now,

486
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,490
the more fearless we are,

487
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,660
the more they will be unsure

488
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,860
about our situation.

489
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,560
In this situation,

490
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,020
we can only gamble

491
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,620
that he doesn't actually dare to attack the city.

492
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,680
That is the only way

493
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,820
for Wangdu to have any chances of survival.

494
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,830
I'll go with you.

495
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,990
Just in case.

496
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,470
Brother Fan,

497
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,710
the attendants sent to intercept the Crown Prince's return

498
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,140
from his southern inspection tour to take over affairs in the capital

499
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,540
only brought back a body.

500
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,540
The Crown Prince is dead?

501
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,660
The Crown Prince died of poisoning.

502
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,300
There were no wounds on his body.

503
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,900
It couldn't have been faked.

504
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,880
It must have been that bandit, Liang.

505
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,380
What a cruel traitor!

506
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,220
Now, Liang's son

507
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,780
is still leading the remnants of their forces

508
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,380
and standing guard outside the gate to the Eastern Capital.

509
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,020
They're fighting like cornered wild beasts.

510
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,950
Inside the city,

511
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,900
only the Empress Dowager and the orphan are left,

512
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,020
trying desperately to hold out.

513
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,540
If news gets out,

514
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,540
the officials in the capital

515
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,100
will be restless

516
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,700
and panic.

517
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,910
Brother Fan.

518
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,220
At this point,

519
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,500
we can only bear down on the Eastern Capital with the full force of our army

520
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,630
and wipe out the remnants of the rebels

521
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,590
in order to stop the decline of our dynasty

522
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,180
and stabilize the hearts of the people.

523
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,710
If so,

524
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,980
we won't be able to return to Wangdu in time.

525
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,300
Brother Fan.

526
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,140
Need I elaborate on the saying,

527
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,000
"Mercy does not an army command"?

528
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,940
This time, that bandit Liang

529
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,500
split his forces and escaped to Youzhou.

530
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,070
Why?

531
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,580
Their tactic is "surrounding Wei to save Zhao."

532
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,860
They want to force the Youzhou Army

533
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,530
to divide our troops in order to send reinforcements.

534
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,910
If we do as he wishes

535
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,530
and put ourselves at a disadvantage,

536
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,790
it will curtail our play from here on out.

537
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,980
Brother Fan.

538
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,230
Youzhou

539
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,710
is our home.

540
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,270
I know you can't bear it.

541
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,060
Neither can I.

542
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,500
But now,

543
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,060
the Eastern Capital is in chaos.

544
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,900
If the Imperial City is completely destroyed,

545
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,340
every provincial commissioner

546
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,670
will begin to harbor excessive ambition.

547
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,030
All of the commoners

548
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,300
will suffer.

549
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,980
Moreover,

550
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,570
we traveled a long way to the Eastern Capital.

551
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,380
There are only

552
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,340
about 10,000 soldiers guarding Wangdu.

553
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,860
I'm afraid they're already...

554
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,710
Don't forget.

555
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,260
Gu Jiusi

556
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,230
is in Wangdu.

557
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,390
That brat?

558
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,310
He deceived the Gu family.

559
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,330
He's also a blood relation of the bandit, Liang.

560
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,620
I have yet to settle those scores with him.

561
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,780
I will recognize his merit

562
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,510
in collecting grain this time.

563
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,080
It’s fine

564
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,680
if he dies in the line of duty.

565
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,330
If he turns out to be a coward

566
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,730
and surrenders to Liang,

567
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,870
I will take his life personally.

568
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,300
Brother.

569
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,660
Even if you don't trust Ye's judgement,

570
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,230
you should trust mine.

571
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,220
I'll play

572
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,070
the bad guy.

573
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,910
Brother Fan.

574
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:06,590
You

575
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,840
will be a benevolent emperor.

576
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,720
Open the city gate!

577
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,500
General Zhou is back!

578
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,620
Open the city gate!

579
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,790
General.

580
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,420
Commissioner.

581
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:37,950
General.

582
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,490
Young Master Zhou

583
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,220
brought Young Master Fan here.

584
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,230
Yesterday, I was wondering

585
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,340
where Fan Xuan had found

586
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,790
such a clever young man.

587
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,100
It looks like

588
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,310
you take after Nianming.

589
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,940
Don't hold it against me for not recognizing you.

590
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,740
I remember

591
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,330
the last time I saw you,

592
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,930
you were only five years old.

593
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,260
The life of a soldier is tough.

594
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,180
I have nothing

595
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
to offer you.

596
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,180
This is the Lüyangchun

597
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,700
that Yangzhou sent to the palace this year

598
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,660
as tribute.

599
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,330
It can't compare

600
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,790
to what you used to drink,

601
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,460
but

602
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,740
it is passable.

603
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,140
In the past, whenever tea leaves were harvested in Jiangnan,

604
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,860
your mother would personally choose

605
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,030
the best batch

606
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,460
to gift to your aunt.

607
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,020
As for me,

608
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,810
I got to enjoy some

609
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,940
thanks to your aunt.

610
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,830
Now,

611
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,510
everything has changed.

612
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,810
When I was young,

613
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,010
I was indeed ridiculous and frivolous.

614
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,180
But now that I see the suffering of the world,

615
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,980
I no longer want to seek pleasure

616
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,730
in things like this anymore.

617
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,080
Your Highness.

618
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,660
Just get to the point.

619
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,140
There's no need to beat around the bush.

620
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,870
Jiusi.

621
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,460
You are my nephew.

622
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,270
Don't be so distant.

623
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,190
If you hadn't started a war and caused chaos,

624
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,290
of course I'd be happy

625
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,890
to call you "Uncle-in-law."

626
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,220
But now,

627
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,310
things have indeed changed.

628
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:22,990
Jiusi.

629
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,730
If I told you

630
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,210
that at first,

631
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,100
I didn't want to become the emperor,

632
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,300
would you believe me?

633
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,790
It doesn't matter

634
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,100
whether I believe you or not.

635
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,010
I don't know

636
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,610
if you want to be the emperor.

637
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,360
I only know that you started a rebellion,

638
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,670
dragged the kingdom into a war,

639
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,500
and caused people to suffer.

640
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,340
If you really want to ask,

641
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,460
why don't you ask

642
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,140
the commoners

643
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,700
whose lives are in peril,

644
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,100
who can't eat three meals a day,

645
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,940
and even have to sell their children for food?

646
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,140
Go and ask the bodies on the battlefield

647
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,950
if they believe

648
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,580
you don't want to be the emperor.

649
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,980
Jiusi.

650
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,090
You are still

651
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,980
a vigorous young man.

652
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,020
When I was your age,

653
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,070
I was passionate like you.

654
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,690
But at my age,

655
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,890
having seen the ways of the world,

656
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:14,670
I know that

657
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,550
only having passion

658
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,500
is not enough.

659
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,330
Even if you defend Wangdu to the death for Fan Xuan,

660
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,940
what good would it do?

661
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,830
You say you want to help the people,

662
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,380
but you know very well

663
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,010
you are outnumbered.

664
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,820
The city will be destroyed sooner or later.

665
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,350
The longer it takes, the more people will die.

666
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,670
How do you know

667
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,340
we are outnumbered?

668
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,860
Jiusi.

669
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,780
You're still too young.

670
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,330
It's no use

671
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,870
trying to trick me.

672
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,260
You despise me,

673
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,060
but you think Fan Xuan

674
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,310
is a wise ruler.

675
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,860
He managed to become

676
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,790
a commissioner.

677
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,230
I really don't see

678
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,180
how he could be better than me.

679
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,270
I advise you not to

680
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,750
judge other people

681
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,710
with your own mean measure.

682
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,610
Since we can't reach an agreement,

683
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,699
let's not waste our time.

684
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,940
Jiusi.

685
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,620
You can't change the way the world works.

686
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,810
It'll be the same

687
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,290
no matter who takes the throne.

688
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,150
Remember,

689
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,550
you and I are related.

690
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,030
If I win,

691
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,219
you will become a royal relative.

692
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,420
There is a life of wealth and nobility waiting for you.

693
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,980
Fan Xuan needs you now,

694
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,460
so he treats you well.

695
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,980
But once this has all ended,

696
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,929
you'll be a relative of the rebel.

697
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:41,030
By then,

698
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,280
it'll be too late for you to regret it.

699
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,139
You can't give up your life and prospects

700
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,699
for the sake of

701
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,780
a moment's passion for the so-called commoners.

702
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,310
Jiusi.

703
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,860
It's not worth it.

704
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,420
So in your eyes,

705
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,910
at the end of the day,

706
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,380
the lives of the nobility

707
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,700
are more important

708
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,900
than the lives of commoners?

709
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,500
This is the way it has been since ancient times!

710
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,030
But in my eyes,

711
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,860
the lives of the people of Wangdu

712
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,630
are as valuable as my own life.

713
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,770
The kingdom is made up of its people.

714
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,900
You don't understand

715
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,300
such a simple principle,

716
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,180
yet you want to be emperor?

717
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,460
You think of the people as weeds,

718
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,660
but in my eyes,

719
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,420
you're less than a weed.

720
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,990
Gu Jiusi.

721
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,110
I tried to give you the easy way out.

722
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,220
Listen up.

723
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,870
You are outside the city now.

724
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,380
If we really start fighting,

725
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,270
the reinforcements from the city

726
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,000
won't come as quickly as mine.

727
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,940
Since I dared to come,

728
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,880
how could I not have a backup plan?

729
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,900
If you really think

730
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,770
there are only old and weak soldiers

731
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,460
left in Wangdu,

732
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,220
why don't you attack us?

733
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,940
Believe it or not,

734
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,390
I can kill you right now!

735
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,400
Your Highness,

736
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,700
when two armies are at war,

737
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,860
they do not kill envoys.

738
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,810
He's merely

739
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,430
a pawn.

740
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
I'm afraid there are countless formidable generals

741
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,300
left in the city.

742
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,070
If we kill him,

743
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,020
it will only stoke the righteous fury

744
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,350
of the people in the city

745
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,090
and make them see you as the enemy.

746
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:24,930
Even if one day,

747
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,300
we conquer Wangdu,

748
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,200
I'm afraid we won't be able to win back their hearts.

749
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,670
Let him go.

750
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:43,980
Yes.

751
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,740
Let him go.

752
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,700
Gu Jiusi.

753
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,220
After you walk out of this pavilion,

754
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,670
my nephew

755
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,910
will really be dead.

756
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:18,900
Old Mo,

757
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,220
am I eating so early today?

758
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,190
Master Zhao,

759
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,900
I'm here to set you free.

760
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,420
Gu Jiusi taught you that?

761
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,510
Tell me.

762
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,400
What trick are you playing today?

763
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,500
I don't lie.

764
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,470
You don't lie?

765
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,510
I didn't know you

766
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,140
before I was imprisoned.

767
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,150
Who are you to save me?

768
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,940
Master Zhao, you've never met me,

769
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,100
but I've always remembered

770
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,230
your kindness.

771
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,050
If it weren't for you,

772
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,210
dispensing aid money

773
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,360
to us veterans

774
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,340
every month,

775
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,630
I wouldn't have lived to this age.

776
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,950
Master Zhao.

777
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,390
Go, quickly.

778
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,450
Change into the common clothes I prepared for you.

779
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,150
Now,

780
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,060
Lord Liang is attacking Wangdu.

781
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,710
The city is in chaos.

782
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,170
That's how I found a chance to set you free.

783
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,430
If you wait any longer,

784
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,980
I'm afraid Magistrate Gu will find out.

785
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,060
Then...

786
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,790
What about your family?

787
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,190
They're all gone.

788
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,110
My wife died early.

789
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,510
My two sons...

790
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,910
My two sons

791
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,500
joined the Youzhou Army.

792
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,020
They died in the battles

793
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,180
against the Northern Liang's invasions.

794
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,300
I'm the only one left.

795
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,960
There's no one who will get into trouble with me.

796
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,670
Master Zhao.

797
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,150
Reselling grain

798
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,740
is a capital crime.

799
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,520
Magistrate Gu isn't wrong

800
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,790
for sentencing you.

801
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,550
After you escape,

802
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,430
let it go.

803
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,670
Settle down somewhere else

804
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,540
and live a peaceful life.

805
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,230
Old Mo.

806
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,860
You said I was wrong.

807
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,180
Let me ask you.

808
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,620
The people in your family

809
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,100
worked to the death for Youzhou.

810
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,960
In other words,

811
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,830
you're all heroes.

812
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,310
But in the end,

813
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,940
all you got in return in your old age

814
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,740
is living on the aid rations

815
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,870
sent by a profiteer like me.

816
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,750
Is this right?

817
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:39,790
This...

818
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,500
Do you know

819
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,870
where the money you got from me

820
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,340
came from?

821
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,460
Where does the

822
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,650
peaceful life I want to lead

823
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,830
come from?

824
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,190
Youzhou owes me.

825
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,110
Youzhou owes all of us.

826
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,750
No...

827
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,990
I didn't do anything wrong.

828
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,460
Even if

829
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,750
I am beheaded

830
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,110
and go to hell,

831
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,310
when I see King Yama,

832
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,000
I'll still say the same thing.

833
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,020
I did nothing wrong!

834
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:21,080
[Zhou]

835
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,550
For me, my wish

836
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,670
is for the people

837
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,830
to have enough food and clothing,

838
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,060
to not freeze to death

839
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,040
or starve to death,

840
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,380
and to live well,

841
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,140
to live with dignity.

842
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,620
Father.

843
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,140
Is he still kneeling?

844
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,260
Since Father gave the order,

845
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,340
for six hours,

846
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,150
he has been kneeling there.

847
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,600
Ignore him.

848
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,700
He's kneeling today.

849
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,780
Tomorrow, someone else will kneel.

850
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,180
Who will lead the troops?

851
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,260
Military orders must be obeyed.

852
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,500
He doesn't even understand

853
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,630
such a simple thing.

854
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,700
To think he is my son!

855
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,380
Brother.

856
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,820
Get up.

857
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,180
Don't make Father angry.

858
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,200
Is Father giving up on Wangdu?

859
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,570
Father and Uncle Fan

860
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,370
are more farsighted than we are.

861
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,620
They're prioritizing the people of the kingdom.

862
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,390
Is Father giving up on Wangdu?

863
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,990
Is Father giving up on Wangdu?

864
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,750
Is Father giving up on Wangdu?

865
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,110
Zhou Ye.

866
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,740
Is Father giving up on Wangdu?
