[Episode 29]

4
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,160
Commander-in-chief, don't worry.

5
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,420
We'll come back immediately

6
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,750
after we harvest wheat.

7
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,400
Okay.

8
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,900
Good boy.

9
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,300
You did a great job.

10
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,460
We can go home.

11
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,020
We can finally go home. Thank God.

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,610
From now on,

13
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,180
Wanzhi will be my mentor.

14
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,200
You're going to learn to fight?

15
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,790
No.

16
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,340
I want to learn medicine

17
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,270
from Wanzhi.

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,690
Originally,

19
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,210
Wanzhi was a combat medic.

20
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,520
She dressed wounds for countless soldiers

21
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,720
and saved many lives.

22
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,040
Then she became

23
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,500
a general who led troops on the battlefield.

24
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,360
In this battle to guard Youzhou,

25
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,290
I saved lots of people too.

26
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,480
So in the future,

27
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,730
I want to be a combat medic too.

28
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,260
This is great.

29
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,430
You, my friend,

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,950
are both beautiful and kind.

31
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,370
You're an angel

32
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,260
who will definitely save lots of lives.

33
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,650
You can use money to do the same.

34
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,850
Stop making fun of me.

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,980
Well, I need to ask you for a favor.

36
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,310
No one else can help me.

37
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,180
It's hard to do business with the highborn ladies in the Eastern Capital.

38
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,780
I can't afford any mistakes.

39
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,050
Even the best rouge

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,090
needs someone pretty

41
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,520
to advertise it.

42
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,110
I think

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,940
on the opening day of Huarong,

44
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,060
if I can get a beautiful girl from Jiangnan

45
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,410
to use my rouge,

46
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,170
all the highborn ladies in the Eastern Capital

47
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,100
will come to know

48
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,360
what true elegance is like.

49
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,810
Then all my rouge will be sold out!

50
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,450
Young Madam is full of business ideas.

51
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,710
I've got a lot to learn.

52
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,700
Yuru.

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
You're pulling my leg again.

54
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,440
What did I do?

55
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,740
You don't believe me?

56
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
Ask Wanzhi what she thinks about it.

57
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:55,960
Not bad.

58
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,110
You're indeed gorgeous.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
If I were a man,

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,790
I wouldn't take you as my student

61
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,470
but

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,060
would marry you!

63
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,410
Your Majesty,

64
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,600
the Yellow River's flood season has arrived.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,990
The floods have done great damage.

66
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,130
[Zhao Yang, the Minister of Works]

67
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,830
Yongzhou suffered the greatest loss.

68
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,770
All the farmlands were flooded.

69
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,960
People there became homeless.

70
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,430
Numerous families were ruined.

71
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,830
Our people are living in hot water!

72
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:33,970
Your Majesty,

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,159
damming the Yellow River

74
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,190
has been delayed since the previous dynasty.

75
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,380
Now that we've embarked on a new era,

76
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,030
damming the Yellow River must be prioritized!

77
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,159
Your Majesty,

78
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,890
I heard that after the deluge last year,

79
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,550
atrocities

80
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,500
like eating children happened.

81
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,270
It was hell on Earth.

82
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,530
Now,

83
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,120
a new dynasty has started.

84
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,270
As policymakers,

85
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,120
[Zheng Shuhe, the Minister of Rites]

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,170
we should prioritize the well-being of our people.

87
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,900
Besides, the Yellow River overflows every year.

88
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,910
Your Majesty,

89
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,440
we really can't delay building the dam.

90
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,650
Damming the Yellow River

91
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,610
will be the most important task

92
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,450
this year.

93
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,700
Therefore,

94
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,440
the Ministry of Revenue will assess the funds needed

95
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,670
and allocate them for immediate construction.

96
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,070
Thank you, Your Majesty.

Your Majesty.

99
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,050
Lord Liang, the traitor,

100
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,380
was in control of the Ministry of Revenue for over ten years.

101
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,920
He appropriated taxes

102
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,890
to recruit a private army,

103
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,450
which resulted in a great loss in the treasury.

104
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,500
To make things worse,

105
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,020
frequent droughts and floods

106
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,050
have completely depleted the coffers.

107
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,110
We don't have money to build the dam.

108
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,100
The previous administration left a real mess

109
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,100
after years of war.

110
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,500
Official Lu,

111
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,920
I understand your dilemma.

112
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,370
But every course needs a start.

113
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,850
If everything beneficial to the people

114
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,230
is to be delayed

115
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,110
because we don't have money,

116
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,920
Won't Da Xia repeat the tragedy

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,320
of the previous dynasty?

118
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,800
You're right, Your Majesty.

119
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,770
The country pays me

120
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,080
but I failed to solve its problems.

121
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,510
I feel ashamed.

122
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,110
I'm willing to

123
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,630
cut my salary by half.

124
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,520
It's not much money

125
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,159
but can be used

126
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,420
to buy a few more bricks

127
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,940
for the dam.

128
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
Your Majesty,

129
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,450
I'm willing to cut my salary by half too.

130
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,400
Good.

131
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,960
Approved.

132
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,070
Thank you, Your Majesty.

133

Official Gu,

134
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,950
why are you laughing?

135
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,210
Your Majesty,

136
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,150
in my opinion,

137
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,240
the coffers were depleted

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,470
because there was corruption in the previous dynasty.

139
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,560
To reclaim the money,

140
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,530
shouldn't we check the ledgers

141
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,960
and analyze the expenditures?

142
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,010
I never thought about

143
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,980
using my salary

144
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,530
to make up for such a big hole.

145
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,450
I feel ashamed

146
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,680
compared to my selfless colleagues.

147
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,740
So I mocked myself.

[Liu Chun, the Deputy Minister of Revenue]

150
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,360
you made a great point.

151
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,460
But the previous dynasty left countless ledgers

152
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,810
which are very complicated.

153
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,360
During years of war,

154
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,800
many documents were lost.

155
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,430
I'm afraid

156
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,750
we're not able to do that.

157
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,110
Your Majesty, you said just now

158
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,030
that every course needs a start.

159
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,190
I'd feel honored

160
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,570
if I could be the start.

161
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,380

162
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,110

165
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,380
This is an important matter.

166
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,760
No one is more suitable

167

Yes.

173
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,470
Official Gu will be in charge

174
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,530
of checking the old ledgers.

175
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,180

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,090
When will we

195
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,520
start the inspection?

196
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,220
It's an arduous task.

197
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,470
There's no need

198
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,630
to start it in a rush.

199
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,740
Deputy Minister Gu,

200
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,540
if you got things to attend to at home,

201
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,510
just clock in

202
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,390
and go back.

203
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,860
We can talk about it

204
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,660
tomorrow.

205
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,020
There's nothing I need to attend to at home.

206
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,770
I see.

207
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,660
Young people like you

208
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,860
are so hard-working.

209
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,920
You can stay and walk around

210
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,540
to get familiar with the environment.

211
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,110
Thank you, Minister Lu.

212
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,380
But the ledgers…

213
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,120
No hurry.

214
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,060
The ledgers you want to check

215
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,790
are in the charge

216
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,170
of Liu Chun from the Granaries Bureau.

217
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,720
He won't come to work until two in the afternoon.

218
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
Two in the afternoon?

219
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,620
But it's only nine-thirty in the morning.

220
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,420
Two…

221
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,270
Nine thirty?

222
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,750
My bad.

223
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,510
I forgot to tell you

224
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,910
that from 10 am to 1 pm,

225
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Deputy Ministers

226
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,640
and other clerks

227
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,770
will have a break.

228
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,330
Deputy Minister Gu,

229
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,400
you've been bustling around for so long.

230
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,870
Why don't you take a break?

231
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,520
It's my first day here.

232
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,240
I don't think it's proper for me

233
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,970
to slack off.

234
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,110
Young man,

235
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,070
don't be so rigid.

236
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,720
This is not slacking off.

237
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,170
Working hard is commendable

238
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,990
but breaks are necessary too.

239
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,980
Go take a rest.

240
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,160
Okay.

241
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,190
I don't remember seeing you before, madam.

242
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,120
Is this your first time in Huarong?

243
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,720
Manager Yin is busy.

244
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,850
Do you want me

245
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,280
to give you an introduction?

246
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,940
No, thanks.

247
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,010
I'll walk around myself.

248
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,310
Okay.

249
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,610
Ladies,

250
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,740
this way, please.

251
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,010
The peony is better.

252
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,160
It's graceful and implies the prosperity of the capital.

253
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,670
The rouge exclusive to the Eastern Capital

254
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,800
will use this pattern.

255
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,310
Yes.

256
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,020
Young Madam.

257
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,850
Manager Yin.

258
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,430
You've been so busy.

259
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,630
I finally caught you.

260
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,530
Her Ladyship

261
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,540
has been talking about your new product

262
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,340
for days.

263
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,930
Today,

264
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,440
you must sell one to me.

265
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,060
The Right Counsellor's wife.

266
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,560
Go.

267
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,240
Let's go.

268
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,020
[Granaries Bureau]

269
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,720
[Granaries Bureau]

270
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,000
Why is time passing so slowly?

271
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,040
Deputy Minister Gu.

272
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,010
Deputy Minister Liu.

273
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,020
You came.

274
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,600
You must've waited for a long time.

275
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,170
[Granaries Bureau]

276
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,570
Sorry.

277
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,220
Unlike you young people,

278
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,470
I feel lethargic

279
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,850
when it's noon.

280
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,830
If I don't take a nap,

281
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,140
I'll be drowsy the whole afternoon.

282
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,610
It doesn't matter.

283
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,670
It doesn't matter.

284
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,480
[Granaries Bureau]

285
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,940
You've had the review document signed, right?

286
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,270
Don't forget to copy it.

287
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,810
It needs to be kept on file in the Tax Bureau.

288
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,190
Document?

289
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,540
What document?

290
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:22,880
Wait.

291
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,100
Deputy Minister Gu,

292
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,990
I was so afraid

293
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,830
of impeding the important task given by His Majesty

294
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,800
and hurried back

295
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,310
to open the archive room for you.

296
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,240
But you haven't even finished the procedures.

297
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,300
Are you kidding me?

298
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,510
No, no, no.

299
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm new here

300
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,500
and not familiar with the procedures.

301
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,700
Please enlighten me.

302
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,870
You flatter me.

303
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,300
I asked you for the document

304
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,830
not because I want to make things hard for you.

305
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,460
This is the rule

306
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,330
of the Ministry of Revenue.

307
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,570
The ledgers

308
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,920
contain the flows of the treasury.

309
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,850
If anyone

310
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,320
could have a look at them

311
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,210
just by asking,

312
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,060
those with ulterior motives

313
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,790
would be able to learn the movements of the court.

314
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,220
It would be disastrous.

315
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,530
You're right.

316
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,580
Thank you for telling me.

317
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,210
Well,

318
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,680
let me tell you

319
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,440
what you need to do.

320
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,490
Okay. Go ahead.

321
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,630
You need to file a document

322
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,350
which contains the amount

323
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,230
and categories

324
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,990
of the ledgers you want.

325
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,190
The application time

326
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,650
should also be included.

327
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,450
You should also state why you need the ledgers,

328
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,920
who are involved in the process,

329
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,180
and who will read them.

330
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,280
All the papers need two copies.

331
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,010
Then send the document to the Granaries Bureau,

332
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,850
the Treasury Bureau,

333
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,030
Salt-and-Iron, Grain Transport, Remittance, and so on.

334
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,460
14 bureaus in total.

335
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,350
After the Directors sign it,

336
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,750
submit it to Minister Lu for further review.

337
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,220
Then you…

338
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,610
Deputy Minister Gu.

339
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,470
Do you…

340
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,600
Do you understand?

341
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,330
Yes.

342
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:08,670
Yes.

343
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,470
Good.

344
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,910
Thank you.

345
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,890
See you around.

346
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,670
Minister Lu,

347
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,070
this is Meishou made by Lefeng Restaurant.

348
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,360
Since Old Master passed away,

349
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,720
it's been low on stock.

350
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,160
It's very hard

351
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,050
to buy it in Jingdu.

352
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,570
I went to great lengths

353
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,070
to finally get a jar of it

354
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,940
and have been reserving it for you.

355
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,820
You're so considerate, Deputy Minister Liu.

356
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,070
Has Gu Jiusi

357
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,840
gone to you for the ledgers?

358
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,500
He came to wait for me before one in the afternoon.

359
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,700
I sent him to go through the procedures.

360
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,250
I guess, at this time,

361
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,220
he should be drafting the review document

362
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,200
in the Tax Bureau.

363
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,640
He's so audacious,

364
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,160
dreaming of checking our accounts.

365
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,760
I'll make his legs sore

366
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,190
from running from bureau to bureau.

367
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:14,490
Yeah.

368
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,750
That's not enough.

369
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,099
Let him do such legwork for one month.

370
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,319
If one month is not enough,

371
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,490
make it two.

372
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,490
After dealing with you,

373
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,359
he'll be faced with me.

374
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,920
Checking the ledgers

375
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,320
is a great matter.

376
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,030
Rules must be followed.

377
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,190
If he can't even go through

378
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,590
the basic procedures,

379
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:38,760
I'm afraid

380
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,190
he's not qualified to be the Deputy Minister of Revenue.

381
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,340
He's too young

382
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,280
and needs a lesson.

383
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,020
Undergoing some ordeal

384
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,720
can do him lots of good.

385
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,200
-That's right.
-That's right.

386
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:09,800
Who's it?

387
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,210
Deputy Minister Gu.

388
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,440
I'm Chen Qianzhong, the Director of the Treasury Bureau.

389
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,690
[Chen Qianzhong, the Director of the Treasury Bureau]

390
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,210
I saw the lights in the Tax Bureau still on

391
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,390
and thought some colleague was working late,

392
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,590
so I came to check out.

393
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,790
I didn't mean to disturb you.

394
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,980
Please forgive me.

395
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,440
It's okay.

396
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,880
I used to work in the Tax Bureau.

397
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,640
If you need any help,

398
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,160
just ask.

399
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,850
Do you know how to write a review document?

400
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,820
Yes.

401
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,050
Deputy Minister Gu.

402
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,130
There's no need to rewrite it.

403
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,510
The part about the Granaries and Inspection Bureau is all right.

404
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,190
The omitted date

405
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,170
and rotation document for the Treasury Bureau

406
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,500
need additional proof.

407
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,190
After the Treasury Bureau reviews,

408
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,580
signs, and stamps it,

409
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,400
it can go to the next bureau.

410
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,680
I don't need to rewrite it?

411
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,220
Then how should I revise it?

412
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,370
I worked in the Tax Bureau for a year

413
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,750
before I finally made out the procedures

414
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,630
and got all the files required

415
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,670
to check the ledgers.

416
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,940
A year?

417
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,240
Yes.

418
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,710
A whole year.

419
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,830
Then I was transferred to the Treasury Bureau

420
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,210
and no longer had use for this knowledge.

421
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,410
Now,

422
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,550
what's your job in the Treasury Bureau?

423
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,940
At first, I kept accounts

424
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,140
of the taxes collected from each state.

425
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,380
Later,

426
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
they wouldn't let me do that either.

427
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,130
Now I send salaries

428
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,730
to officials in different Ministries.

429
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,260
I have lots of leisure time.

430
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,220
Since that's the case,

431
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,250
why haven't you gone home? It's already nine.

432
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,960
Deputy Minister Gu,

433
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,910
I heard that you want to check the old ledgers.

434
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,090
Are you serious?

435
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,220
Several inspections were conducted in the past

436
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,150
but they were all just for appearances.

437
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,130
I always wanted to do this

438
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,810
but there were too many obstacles ahead

439
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,450
preventing me from making progress.

440
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,800
I gave up checking the old accounts

441
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,350
and started keeping new accounts.

442
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,810
But out of my expectation,

443
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,280
the new accounts could be tampered with too.

444
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,870
Even if you have His Majesty's support,

445
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,710
once you try to check the ledgers,

446
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,900
you'll inevitably antagonize many people.

447
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,700
No one knows how many obstacles

448
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,900
you'll be faced with.

449
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,970
My words carry little weight.

450
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,130
There's nothing much I can do for you,

451
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,750
but I can help with these trivial things

452
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,120
and give you warnings.

453
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,610
Hope I can save you unnecessary detours

454
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,780
and as much trouble as possible.

455
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,060
How many years

456
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,320
have you been working in the court?

457
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,550
Over 20 years.

458
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,210
Then you must know

459
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,740
other officials very well.

460
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,140
I do know a lot about them

461
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,620
and have a lot to say.

462
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,800
I wonder

463
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,480
what you want to ask.

464
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,230
I have only one question.

465
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,060
How on earth

466
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,890
can I check the old ledgers?

467
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,850
I mean a serious inspection.

468
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,490
If that's your question,

469
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,120
I can give you

470
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,090
three names.

471
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,670
Xiong Zhiquan from the Ministry of War.

472
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,140
Wen Ruxu from the Ministry of Rites.

473
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,770
Han Guangyuan from the Ministry of Personnel.

474
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,500
These three people are critical

475
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,630
to the inspection.

476
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,690
They've all been working

477
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,990
in the court for many years.

478
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,960
They're both well-informed

479
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,160
and well-connected.

480
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,610
Most importantly,

481
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,790
they all got their positions through exams

482
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,260
instead of inheritance.

483
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,110
They don't have much to do with Empress Dowager and the dignitaries

484
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,510
in the previous dynasty.

485
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,360
Those people

486
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,480
are all from a distinguished ancestry

487
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,240
and look down on

488
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,590
those who newly found their footing in the court through exams.

489
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,020
Although they serve the country together

490
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,190
and smile when they meet,

491
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,250
they never get along with one another

492
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,780
and have nothing in common.

493
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,980
In this case,

494
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,490
they may really be willing to

495
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,790
give us a hand.

496
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,560
But to win

497
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,890
these three guys' trust

498
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,000
is not gonna be easy.

499
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,250
Xiong Zhiquan from the Ministry of War

500
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,440
is a brave and decorated warrior.

501
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,910
He only respects

502
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,710
those who fight better than him.

503
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,840
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

504
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,940
Wen Ruxu from the Ministry of Rites

505
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,780
is a distant relative of the Ye family.

506
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,430
He was a famous scholar in the previous dynasty.

507
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,180
He couldn't bear

508
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,650
the corruption of the previous dynasty

509
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,210
and has been on medical leave for years.

510
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,050
Mr. Wen,

511
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,300
it's a great honor to meet you.

512
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,520
Are you Ye Zhiqiu's only grandson?

513
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,500
Yes.

514
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,560
It's a pity that I didn't get to spend much time with my grandfather.

515
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,660
He passed away

516
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,840
when I was very young.

517
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,660
A good end for him.

518
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,810
At least he was spared the chaos

519
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,800
before the demise of the previous dynasty.

520
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,250
"I'm happy that I don't have much time left.

521
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,350
I won't suffer as many hardships as you young people will."

522
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,570
Grandfather wrote these words

523
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,790
in a letter to me.

524
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,600
So I guess you're right.

525
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,910
Young man,

526
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,330
you came to me

527
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,020
because you need my help in the court.

528
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,190
You probably think your grandfather and I

529
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,150
used to be classmates,

530
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,750
so you can easily ask me for a favor.

531
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,910
Actually, I already learned

532
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,130
that you cut ties with my grandfather

533
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,590
and never saw him again.

534
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,570
Since you know,

535
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,390
why did you come to see me?

536
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,350
Aren't you afraid that I'll kick you out?

537
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,870
I also know

538
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,210
why you fell out

539
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,790
with my grandfather.

540
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,780
Han Guangyuan from the Ministry of Personnel

541
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,380
is smooth,

542
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,120
greedy,

543
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,220
and tactful.

544
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,060
He knows the secrets

545
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,410
of many officials,

546
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,340
but no one

547
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,140
has ever gotten anything on him.

548
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,770
Your uncle used to be my superior.

549
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,170
We worked together for years.

550
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,090
Since you're his nephew,

551
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,350
I'll treat you as my own nephew.

552
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,780
Just tell me how I can help you.

553
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,150
I'll do my best.

554
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,120
What if I'm here

555
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,890
for the Book of Officials

556
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,750
which you put great effort into compiling?

557
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,000
That's a treasure.

558
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,010
I'm afraid you didn't bring enough money.

559
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,100
I understand.

560
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,680
[Bank of Darong]
[One thousand brass coins]

561
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,030
Still not enough.

562
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,400
Huarong Rouge Shop

563
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,610
is famous in Youzhou

564
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,420
and also in the Eastern Capital.

565
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,020
It makes a fortune every day.

566
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,400
With this,

567
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,830
you'll have a cash cow.

568
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,400
Not enough.

569
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,510
Far from enough.

570
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,130
Deputy Minister Gu,

571
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,070
If you can't offer

572
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,160
a higher price,

573
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm afraid I have to

574
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,030
bid you farewell.

575
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,070
Han Guangyuan

576
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,000
is such a sly dog.

577
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,510
I tried my best to tempt him

578
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,110
but he wouldn't relent a bit.

579
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,430
I've told you the names

580
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,230
of the three guys.

581
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,050
What to do next

582
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,020
and how to persuade them

583
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,580
will be problems

584
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,760
you need to solve.

585
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,890
It's getting late.

586
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,410
I'll take my leave.

587
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,810
Director Chen,

588
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,880
did my uncle

589
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,430
send you to me?

590
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,350
Minister Jiang said

591
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,110
if his nephew

592
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,260
can't even tell

593
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,460
such an obvious move,

594
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,210
I don't need to tell you his last warning.

595
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,780
Han Guangyuan is hard to understand.

596
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,800
Whether he's good or wicked,

597
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,350
a friend

598
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,120
or a lethal snake,

599
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,550
Minister Jiang is not sure either.

600
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,890
You have to decide

601
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,610
by yourself.

602
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,670
[One month later]

603
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,020
Your Majesty,

604
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,230
I've finished examining the old ledgers.

605
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,140
According to ledgers offered by the Ministry of Personnel,

606
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,020
Ministry of Rites,

607
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,200
and Ministry of War,

608
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,460
I found

609
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,390
that there is15 million missing.

610
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,440
Unbelievable.

611
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,540
There's actually

612
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,340
15 million missing!

613
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,940
The loss of the treasury is shocking.

614
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,990
The Ministry of Personnel, Rites,

615
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,290
War, and Revenue

616
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,510
will submit a joint petition

617
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,730
for a more thorough investigation.

618
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:30,940
Official Gu,

619
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,430
you led the inspection.

620
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,570
What do you think we should do?

621
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,640
Just be frank.

622
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,280
I think

623
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,550
we should delve into it and reclaim the lost money.

624
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,830
The previous administration was poor

625
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,360
and there were years of war,

626
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,070
so the huge loss of the treasury

627
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,270
can't all be attributed to corruption.

628
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,510
Those in the court

629
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,900
are all pillars of the country

630
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,100
and men of integrity.

631
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,290
I suggest

632
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,800
investigating the treasury thoroughly,

633
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,650
rewarding the upright ones,

634
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,210
and punishing the corrupt ones.

635
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,550
With rewards and punishments,

636
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,890
order can be restored.

637
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,560
Great idea.

638
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,090
Official Gu,

639
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,890
there's no need to give this case to someone else.

640
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,070
You'll continue

641
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,470
the inspection and reclamation.

642
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

643
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,220
I

644
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,990
have another request.

645
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:26,990
Go ahead.

646
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,050
Investigating the treasury

647
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,140
is a complicated task.

648
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,030
May I

649
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,160
ask for

650
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,800
a few assistants?

651
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:35,730
Okay.

652
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,950
Approved.

653
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:38,960
Officials,

654
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,560
will anyone

655
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,590
help Deputy Minister Gu?

656
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,300
Well…

657
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,440
I will.

658
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,160
I will.

659
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,170
I will.

660
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,080
Anyone else?

661
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,370
♫It was autumn when we parted ways♫

662
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,180
I will.

663
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,800
♫We sang songs about a brighter future♫

664
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,940
♫Sharing a boat with you, we drift down the rivers♫

665
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,650
♫Walking the path with you, we travel the martial world♫

666

667

668
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,300
Bravo! Bravo!

669
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,800
♫Riding alongside you, I see the world unfold♫

670
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,440
♫Fighting alongside you, I no longer fear the unknown♫

671
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,090
He's good.

672
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,680
Amazing.

673
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,980
Unbelievable.

674
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,630
♫In the dust stirred up by the wind, we write our own fates♫

675
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,490
Yeah.

676
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,750
You fought well.

677
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,710
Who did you train under?

678
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
No one trained me.

679
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,640
No one trained you?

680
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,820
When I was young,

681
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,700
I picked up moves here and there.

682
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,670
All unorthodox skills.

683
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,420
Can't believe

684
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,820
someone can be so talented in martial arts.

685
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,600
To be honest,

686
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,240
I came to fight with you

687
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,720
because I need your help.

688
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,760
If I win,

689
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,440
can you do me a favor?

690
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,240
If you win,

691
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,630
let alone one favor,

692
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,890
I can do you ten favors!

693
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,020
No need.

694
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,070
Just one.

695
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,360
Stop.

696
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,560
I will, Your Majesty.

697
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,890
I read

698
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,740
the letters you and my grandfather exchanged

699
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,130
when you were young.

700
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,600
My grandfather

701
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,910
didn't care much about court affairs

702
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,960
and just wanted to bury himself in books.

703
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,180
But you thought

704
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,450
scholars should serve their country

705
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,840
and make the world better.

706
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,970
You were close friends

707
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,440
but had different life goals.

708
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,530
It's understandable

709
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,830
that you parted ways.

710
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,920
It was all in the past.

711
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,110
Actually, your grandfather and I

712
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,510
were not that different.

713
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,960
I devoted my life to making Darong thrive

714
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,330
but it met its doom all the same.

715
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,100
Now I stay out of the court

716
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,570
like he did

717
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,890
and wait for death to arrive.

718
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,980
You're different from him.

719
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:54,890
Sir,

720
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,780
you've lived in seclusion for so long.

721
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,980
You may not have heard

722
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,630
that I and my younger sister

723
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,830
are the only ones left

724
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,900
of the Ye family.

725
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,900
All my family and distant relatives,

726
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,100
more than 100 of them,

727
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,670
were slaughtered

728
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,270
by rebels

729
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,780
during the Rebellion of Yangzhou

730
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,440
before Darong was subverted.

731
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,580
Back then,

732
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,910
to escape the darkness of politics,

733
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,660
my grandfather left for Jiangnan to focus on his studies.

734
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,720
Who'd have thought

735
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,600
it would end so tragically?

736
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,430
The rise and fall of the country

737
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,070
affect everyone's life.

738
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,310
So I think

739
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,740
if we could rewind the clock,

740
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,520
my grandfather would definitely choose

741
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,900
to stand with you

742
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,170
and fight for the people

743
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,980
to the last moment.

744
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,860
But…

745
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,640
But Da Xiang

746
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,320
is faced with so many uncertainties.

747
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,340
The court is full of

748
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,020
fools and leeches.

749
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,290
Both you and I

750
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,199
are just powerless scholars.

751
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,570
What big changes can we make?

752
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,530
What if…

753
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,500
What if it'll be a wild goose chase again?

754
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,380
"We should devote ourselves to our country

755
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,770
without expecting anything in return.

756
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,620
That's the only way to live without regrets."

757
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,250
I read

758
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,760
these words

759
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:35,850
in an article you wrote

760
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,280
when you were young.

761
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,340
It was those words

762
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,100
that lit my way

763
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,230
out of the darkness.

764
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,040
Today,

765
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,010
I repeat your words to you

766
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,020
in the hope of getting your help.

767
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,790
Sir, I need you.

768
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,260
Da Xia

769
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,560
needs you even more.

770
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,820
We all need you

771
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,880
to hold on to hope.

772
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,060
Director,

773
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,820
if I offer you

774
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,990
a thorough investigation of the treasury

775
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,350
and a peaceful country

776
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,680
with clean governance,

777
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,660
will it

778
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,070
be a satisfying offer to you?

779
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:28,940
Good.

780
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,710
Great.

781
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,480
I feel honored

782
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,450
to have you in my court.

783
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,590
It's a blessing for Da Xia.

784
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,300
Your Highness.

785
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,160
Mind your step.

786
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,310
Father hasn't asked about

787
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,660
my school performance in a long time.

788
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,830
I've improved a lot lately.

789
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,130
I'll tell him what I've learned.

790
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,460
I'm sure he'll be happy.

791
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,500
Wang Hong.

792
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,510
Your Majesty.

793
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,520
You know.

794
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,320
It didn't take long

795
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,340
for Gu Jiusi

796
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,000
to make headway on the case.

797
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,240
I think

798
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,960
before long,

799
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,650
he'll be able to reveal the truth.

800
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,760
Deputy Minister Gu is indeed very capable.

801
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,160
I hope I could have a son like him.

802
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,010
He's competent

803
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:36,980
and loyal.

804
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,070
Yes.

805
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,890
I heard that his father died before his time.

806
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,780
He's loyal to Your Majesty.

807
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,120
Perhaps

808
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,420
he has more or less

809
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,100
regarded you as his father.

810
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,880
You think so?

811
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

812
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,120
Good.

813
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,640
Actually,

814
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,060
I do wish

815
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,700
he were my son.

816
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,060
If Yu'er

817
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,120
could be as able as him,

818
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,980
it'd be wonderful.

819
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,980
Just some old, messy tallies

820
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,510
from the previous dynasty.

821
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,930
No one can find any solid proof.

822
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,530
There's nothing to worry about.

823
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,390
Gu Jiusi

824
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,530
made some small waves

825
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,310
and you panicked?

826
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,830
Why did you lose your cool so easily?

827
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,470
Minister Lu,

828
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,480
Gu Jiusi is indeed something.

829
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,030
I've never seen

830
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,710
anyone so efficient.

831
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,220
In just a few days,

832
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,430
he finished the procedures

833
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,210
and checked the ledgers.

834
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,310
Now,

835
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,650
he joined hands with the other five Ministries

836
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,380
to conduct the investigation.

837
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,930
I…

838
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,320
I'm really…

839
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:08,960
Scared.

840
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,140
If

841
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,760
they reconcile the expenses together,

842
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,220
the hole we made

843
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,440
can't be covered anymore.

844
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,430
Gu Jiusi wants to hit the ground running.

845
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,550
Let him

846
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,690
ride on his high horse for a few more days.

847
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:35,980
Don't worry.

848
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,920
The one who can help us

849
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,790
will be here soon.

850
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,180
By then,

851
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,740
he'll make sure that Gu Jiusi

852
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,980
hits the ground hard.

853
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,520
I didn't expect things

854
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,900
to go so smoothly.

855
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,370
Exactly.

856
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,550
Too smoothly.

857
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,350
Will something

858
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,400
go wrong?

859
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,540
Don't jinx it.

860
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,910
Luo Zishang, the Grand Tutor, may come in.

861
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,960
[Changgeng Palace]

862
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,480
[Changgeng Palace]

863
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,010
Jiusi.

864
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,300
I already know.

865
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,320
Let's leave the court first.

866
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,600
I specially ordered the imperial chefs

867
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,260
to make some Yangzhou dishes.

868
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,830
I hope

869
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,140
you'll like them.

870
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

871
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,670
You're welcome.

872
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,100
Since I became the Crown Prince,

873
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,100
everyone has been

874
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,200
so polite to me.

875
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,850
Grand Tutor, you're a righteous man.

876
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,280
You led Yangzhou to pledge allegiance to Da Xia.

877
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,630
I should thank you.

878
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,160
I love my country

879
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,440
and respect you

880
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,520
because it's my duty as a citizen.

881
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,650
You treat me

882
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,410
amicably

883
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,430
and friendly

884
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,600
because you're benevolent.

885
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,360
There's a huge difference

886
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,490
between the two.

887
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,370
You're right, Grand Tutor.

888
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,490
I understand.

889
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,580
Your Highness,

890
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,480
you have His Majesty's aura.

891
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,140
You're self-possessed

892
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,070
and will definitely become a great ruler.

893
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,240
Grand Tutor,

894
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,250
do you mean it?

895
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,480
Of course.

896
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,770
But Father always treats me like a child.

897
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,670
Men

898
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,560
even after they reach thirty years old

899
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,870
are still boys in their fathers' eyes.

900
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,410
His Majesty is a loving father

901
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,530
and sees you as the apple of his eye.

902
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,320
It's understandable that he still dotes on you as if you were a kid.

903
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,490
I guess Deputy Minister Gu also treats you

904
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,130
as his own brother, right?

905
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,530
I also wish

906
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,680
that Gu were my elder brother.

907
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,640
Deputy Minister Gu is a shining star.

908
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,030
He's accomplished at a young age

909
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,500
and showered with praises.

910
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,300
He also has His Majesty's trust.

911
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,820
Any family will see it as a blessing

912
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,040
to have him as a son.

913
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,790
Of course.

914
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,340
Grand Tutor.

915
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,080
I want to grow up quickly

916
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,300
to share my father's burden

917
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
and win his trust.

918
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,680
You Highness, I'll help you

919
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:18,890
get what you want.

920
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:36,740
Here,

921
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,520
I want to drink to you, Grand Tutor.

922
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,250
Thank you, Your Highness.
