00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,030
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,500
We really

5
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,690
have no choice.

6
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,860
We can't break the rules.

7
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,660
I do have some dowry assets.

8
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,020
I own a few shops on South Street too.

9
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,660
If Mr. Wan

10
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,200
really can’t pay the debt,

11
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,259
you can use my shops as a mortgage.

12
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,020
No, no.

13
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,610
Young Madam.

14
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,100
How can we use

15
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,180
your dowry as a mortgage?

16
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,420
You can't do that.

17
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,940
No.

18
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,600
Manager He.

19
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,900
The Gu family business

20
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,160
has such a rule, right?

21
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,500
If you can get a mortgage, you can get credit.

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,020
There is such a rule, Young Madam.

23
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,260
If there is, just follow the rule.

24
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,500
Well...

25
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,580
Young Madam.

26
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,780
Why are you doing this for me?

27
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,500
I... I can’t bear it.

28
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,940
Mr. Wan, you can.

29
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,060
This is what I should do

30
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,990
as a member of the Gu family.

31
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,260
Although the Gu family is prosperous,

32
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,500
our wealth is only made possible by

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,160
the recurring purchases from

34
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,460
old customers

35
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,900
and business partners like you.

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,380
It is an accumulation of everyone's support.

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,210
Business is tough these days.

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,060
Which is why we can't just think about ourselves.

39
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,320
Although I'm a junior,

40
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,980
I understand the principle of interdependence.

41
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,380
The thousands of merchants out there

42
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,260
all seem to have their own business.

43
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,020
But in fact, they are all connected,

44
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,220
sharing weal and woe.

45
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,740
Mr. Wan,

46
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,420
if you can overcome this crisis

47
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,620
and make great fortune in the future,

48
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,280
you'll come to our firm again.

49
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,660
But if your business is closed,

50
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,620
our Gu family

51
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,420
will lose an old customer.

52
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,880
If hundreds of old customers like Mr. Wan

53
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,220
stop doing business,

54
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,820
I'm afraid our Gu family's business

55
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,260
will come to an end too.

56
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,750
Young Madam,

57
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,010
everything you said is true.

58
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,100
But the Gu family

59
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,820
has business dealings

60
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,579
with hundreds of merchant in Jiangnan.

61
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,380
If every merchant is in trouble,

62
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,530
and you're so kind to all of them,

63
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,540
how much

64
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,500
dowry can you afford to give

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,960
by helping so selflessly?

66
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,980
It’s not appropriate.

67
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,100
Manager He, don’t worry.

68
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,940
I’m not reckless.

69
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,710
I'm willing to mortgage

70
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,380
my private assets for Mr. Wan

71
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,140
not only because of

72
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,500
what I said just now.

73
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,380
To be honest,

74
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,000
I read the account book carefully today.

75
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,180
I found that even though

76
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,620
Mr. Wan's orders are not very big,

77
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,060
he would order from us every month.

78
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,020
He is a loyal customer of the Gu family.

79
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,940
Not only that,

80
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,100
for the past three years,

81
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,020
every order

82
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,380
was paid on time.

83
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,180
When business was good,

84
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,510
he even paid in advance.

85
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,500
It shows that he's a man of honor and integrity.

86
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,380
Such a person

87
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,019
would never ask for credit

88
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,060
unless he's in a desperate situation.

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,060
Such credibility

90
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,040
is already worth ten thousand taels of gold.

91
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,460
Young Madam, I...

92
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,540
Thank you.

93
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,300
But you

94
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,590
are newly married into the family.

95
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,920
I’m afraid it’ll be hard for me

96
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,400
to explain to the Master when she's back.

97
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,340
Young Madam has given the order.

98
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,790
Just do as she said.

99
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,260
Master, you're back.

100
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,780
Mother, you are back.

101
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,230
You've lost weight.

102
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,500
Me too.

103
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,830
My cheeks are caving in.

104
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,460
Mother.

105
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,260
I'm to be blamed

106
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,300
for the decision today.

107
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,990
You did the right thing.

108
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,620
Manager He.

109
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,220
Take Yuru

110
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,490
and Mr. Wan with you

111
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,620
to run through the procedures with them.

112
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,010
Get them to sign and stamp the papers.

113
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,620
Yes.

114
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,930
Mr. Wan, Young Madam.

115
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,020
This way, please.

116
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,610
Okay.

117
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,740
Good.

118
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:30,930
Good.

119
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,020
Yuru is a good girl.

120
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,740
She's knowledgeable,

121
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,540
decisive,

122
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,740
and responsible.

123
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,659
Yes.

124
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,659
She's like me back in the day.

125
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,900
In the future,

126
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,500
she'll accomplish great things.

127
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,140
Indeed.

128
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,020
The Gu family's business

129
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,659
will be handed over to her sooner or later.

130
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,460
That's right.

131
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,560
Wait, then what do I...

132
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,700
Don't tell Yuru

133
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,500
what I said just now.

134
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,780
All gone.

135
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,790
Okay, the mortgage is completed.

136
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,420
You may pay the debt in return for the mortgage

137
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,740
before the 25th of next month.

138
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,900
I have made three copies of the contract.

139
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,560
Please take care of your copy.

140
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,540
Young Madam.

141
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,420
Please accept my bow.

142
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,420
Please rise.

143
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,340
If it weren't for you,

144
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,980
my 100-year-old shop

145
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,510
would have ended in one day.

146
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,250
My family

147
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,710
and my employees for years

148
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,500
would have suffered with me.

149
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,290
How will I ever repay

150
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,020
your kindness today?

151
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,740
It's my duty. You don't have to repay me.

152
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,360
Don't worry, Young Madam.

153
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,580
I won't misplace

154
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,740
your trust in me.

155
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,190
I'll go back to the inventory and raise money.

156
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,940
See you, Boss Liu.

157
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,740
Boss Liu?

158
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,540
Boss Liu.

159
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,100
Lanxiao House gambling revenue,

160
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,420
8,000 taels in total.

161
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,300
The capital debt is 63,000 taels,

162
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,100
with 5% interest.

163
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,860
Wait.

164
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,700
The capital debt is 63,000 taels?

165
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,740
The number is wrong.

166
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,100
Mr. Wan is in a pinch.

167
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,230
He should be here to borrow money soon.

168
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,480
We'll lend him 5,000 taels

169
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,150
with a 6% interest rate.

170
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,820
He won't refuse.

171
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,220
Otherwise,

172
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,540
his 100-year-old shop will be ruined.

173
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,540
I heard that

174
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,440
the Gu family gave Mr. Wan credit.

175
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,140
Where did he get the collateral for that?

176
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,270
It's a strange tale.

177
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,380
The Young Madam

178
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,460
who is newly married into the Gu family

179
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,820
used her dowry assets

180
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,680
as collateral.

181
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,700
Master,

182
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,860
don't you think this is strange?

183
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,520
It's practically unheard of.

184
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,100
It’s Young Madam Gu again.

185
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,220
It’s getting interesting.

186
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,500
Go.

187
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,110
Check her background.

188
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,660
Yes.

189
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,850
Liu Yuru.

190
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,900
Why are you smiling

191
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,220
in the middle of the night?

192
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,900
Your shops have been mortgaged.

193
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,360
Why are you still so happy?

194
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,940
It's completely worth it.

195
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,100
Do you know

196
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,820
what Mr. Wan called me today?

197
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,150
What did he call you?

198
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,340
He called me Boss Liu.

199
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,220
So what?

200
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,820
You don't understand.

201
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,660
No one called me that before.

202
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,420
When I signed my name

203
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,260
on the contract today...

205
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,390
I wrote it stroke by stroke.

206
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,780
At that time,

207
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,750
my heart was like...

208
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,980

209
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,700

210

I can't put it into words.

211
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,420
It just felt different.

212
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,540
In the past,

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,420
"Eldest Miss Liu" and "Young Madam Gu"

214
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,260
were not about me.

215
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,380

the stature of other people.

217
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,970
But today,

218
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,740
they didn't care about others' stature.

219
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,300
They only cared about me.

220
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,540
They respected me

221
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,530
and called me Boss Liu.

222
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,220
OK, Boss Liu.

223

Are you happy, Boss Liu?

226
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,100
Yes.

227
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,920
But what's the use of you calling me that?

228
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,580
From now on,

229
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,010

I want to learn how to do business.

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,880
What's so hard about that?

233
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,890
If you want to study knowledge,

234
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,170
it's kind of boring.

235
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,620
But if you want to do business,

236
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,350
you have married the right guy.

237

Do you think I can do business?

238

Am I good enough for it?

239
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,180
I think you are.

240
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,180

241

What did she say?

242
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,820
Nothing much.

243
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,940
She also thinks you can do it.

244
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,220
That's great.

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,960
I don't have a meek nature.

383
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,340
I didn't suffer any injustice.

384
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,400
I won't bear any humiliation either.

385
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,710
Sorry for making you worry.

386
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,220
Little Yuru.

387
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,300
Mr. Ye.

388
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,580
You should address my lady

389
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,940
as Young Madam Gu.

390
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,340
You’re right.

391
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,570
I made a mistake.

392
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,580
Mr. Ye.

393
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,070
I haven’t congratulated you on acing the Provincial Examination.

394
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,040
Congratulations to you too, Young Madam Gu,

395
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,650
for your wedding.

396
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,440
Congratulations.

397
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,700
Thank you.

398
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,980
Are they done?

399
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,580
What did they talk about?

400
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,780
I couldn't hear much.

401
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,180
I just heard something about...

402
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,420
Congratulations on acing the Provincial Examination.

403
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,900
Acing the Provincial Examination?

404
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,380
What's so great about that?

405
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,420
Look at him.

406
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,060
He's the worst.

407
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,730
Are you done?

408
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,060
Go to the shop.

409
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,180
I'm going to school.

410
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,780
My lord.

411
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,120
Aren't you going to ask

412
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,740
what I talked about just now?

413
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,030
What is there to ask?

414
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,600
That's good. I'm leaving.

415
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,660
Study hard.

416
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,590
Sooner or later,

417
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,710
I'll make you congratulate me for acing the Provincial Examination too.

418
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
No, wait. I...

419
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,660
Young Master didn't order me

420
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,060
to eavesdrop on you.

421
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,880
He guessed it himself.

422
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,180
Yes.

423
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,910
I knew he would talk about that.

424
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,500
Yes, of course.

425
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,130
Liu Yuru.

426
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,580
Must the perfect match

427
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,660
for you in your heart

428
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,320
ace the Provincial Examination no matter what?

429
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
Not really.

430
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,420
But you used to admire Ye Shi'an a lot.

431
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,820
That was in the past.

432
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,180
Now that you are my husband,

433
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,940
it's fated to be.

434
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,310
Be it a perfect match or not,

435
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,190
I will live a good life with you.

436
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,750
You don't have to compare yourself to others.

437
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,980
Be it a perfect match or not,

438
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,710
I will live a good life with you.

439
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,060
What did she mean by that?

440
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,780
Did she mean...

441
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,580
"I'm already married. I'll make do with it."

442
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,860
"Even if I don't like it,"

443
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,060
"I won't say it."

444
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Did she mean this?

445
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,300
I think so.

446
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,220
She reluctantly married me.

447
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,150
How offputting.

448
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,500
Young Master,

449
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,140
you reluctantly married her too.

450
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,070
You're even now.

451
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,540
Gu.

452
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,900
Gu.

453
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,900
We've known each other for a long time now,

454
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,060
and we used to be classmates.

455
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
I don't know if I should say this...

456
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,500
Then don't say it.

457
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,430
Go ahead.

458
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,020
Then, I'll be frank.

459
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,730
I won't beat around the bush.

460
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,700
You've been doing whatever you want since young

461
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,300
and don't care about trifles.

462
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,530
But now that you're married,

463
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,980
shouldn't you be self-disciplined

464
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,540
and treat your wife well?

465
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,220
What happens with me and my wife

466
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,620
is none of your business.

467
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,390
Your wife and my younger sister are best friends.

468
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,490
She was loved by my Grandmother as well.

469
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,140
I

470
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,580
watched her grow up.

471
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,260
If she suffers any injustice

472
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,580
because she married you,

473
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:12,970
then...

474
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,420
Since she married me,

475
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,940
I won't let her

476
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,200
suffer any injustice.

477
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,540
I'll treat her as my beloved.

478
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,140
She'll be the apple of my eye.

479
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,670
I will regard her as my life.

480
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,700
If she wants it,

481
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,580
even if it's the stars and the moon,

482
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,900
I'll pick them for her.

483
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,260
Ye Shi'an.

484
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,420
I may not be good at

485
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,780
studying or achieving fame.

486
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,780
But when it comes to being a husband,

487
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,780
you're in no place to lecture me.

488
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,980
Goodbye.

489
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,420
Young Master.

490
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
Your aura just now

491
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,220
made Ye Shi'an speechless.

492
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,900
It sounded so real.

493
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,910
What do you mean by that?

494
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,540
You know, the bit you said about Young Madam.

495
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,060
It sounded

496
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,460
like you really meant it.

497
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,060
Hearing it

498
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,300
touched me a little.

499
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Young Master, did you

500
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,900
really mean it?

501
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,760
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

502
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,900
By the way, Young Master.

503
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,570
Where shall we go play

504
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,420
when we skip lessons later?

505
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,300
I'll get ready.

506
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,780
Who said anything about playing?

507
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,540
Study hard.

508
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,220
The young admires the parents.

509
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,530
The lover admires the beauty.

510
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,620
This quote by Mencius means that,

511
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,140
when we were young,

512
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,370
we admired and respected our parents.

513
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,420
But when we grow up

514
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,460
and begin to experience romantic love,

515
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,420
we start to long for

516
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,900
and admire beautiful women.

517
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,980
Why are you laughing?

518
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,380
You're ignorant.

519
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,740
According to the Book of Poems,

520
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,580
"A gentleman likes a lady."

521
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,440
To know and admire beauty is a great elegance in itself.

522
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,500
Gu Jiusi.

523
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,540
Gu Jiusi!

524
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,260
Gu Jiusi!

525
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,340
Jiusi. Jiusi!

526
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,220
Jiusi!

527
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,430
The teacher.

528
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,180
Your heart is elsewhere,

529
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,420
you're distracted,

530
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,900
and you are ignorant.

531
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,460
Focus on the class.

532
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,020
You, come up here.

533
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,570
Recite this page.

534
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,580
Mencius.

535
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,900
The young admires the parents.

536
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,700
Enough.

537
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,020
The lover...

538
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,420
If you can't recite it today,

539
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,460
copy it 20 times.

540
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,710
The young admires the parents.

541
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,660
The lover admires the beauty.

542
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,900
The married admires the wife.

543
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,660
The official admires the Emperor.

544
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Yet one's heart becomes anxious if the Emperor does not favor him.

545
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,580
Filial piety is to admire the parents forever.

546
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,580
To admire his parents even at age 50.

547
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,240
I have seen such dedication from Shun the Great.

548
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,390
The sun is rising from the west.

549
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,300
Gu Jiusi recited everything?

550
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,900
He got it all correct too.

551
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,180
Do you know

552
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,710
why he has improved so much?

553
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,540
Why?

554
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,740
Because

555
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,030
his wife knows how to wield a big sword.

556
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,460
Jiusi

557
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,940
must have suffered a lot.

558
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,540
You, carry on.

559
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,420
Shun went to the fields.

560
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,940
Shun went to the fields.

561
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,270
I have heard about that.

562
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
He cried to the heaven about his parents.

563
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,140
I did not know about that.

564
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
Gong Minggao replied,

565
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,780
it is not something you can understand.

566
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,780
Gong Minggao explained that the filial son's heart

567
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,060
must not be indifferent.

568
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,820
I plough the fields with all my efforts

569
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,550
because that is my duty as a son.

570
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,530
Even if my parents do not love me,

571
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,920
it is nothing I should be concerned with.

572
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,420
Good.

573
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,300
Great.

574
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,580
Great!

575
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,700
-Good.
-Good job!

576
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,490
-Good.
-Good!

577
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,290
Me?

578
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,900
Yes.

579
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,700
But in business,

580
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,660
I've only learned the basics

581
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,660
by observing my mother-in-law at work.

582
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,380
I still have a lot to learn.

583
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,020
Mr. Zhou from Youzhou

584
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
has a big order.

585
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,060
It concerns thousands of items.

586
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,500
This is a big deal,

587
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,030
not an ordinary purchase.

588
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,320
It's fine if it's just this order.

589
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,580
But if we can use this opportunity

590
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,180
to access the Youzhou market,

591
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,710
we'll receive even more orders in the future.

592
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,820
If I lose

593
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,380
such a big deal

594
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,580
or fail to do a good job,

595
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,110
you'll suffer a great loss.

596
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,780
I'm just a beginner.

597
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,540
I...

598
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,940
I'm afraid I can't do it.

599
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,220
Will you do it or not?

600
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,150
If you don't want to,

601
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,420
I won't force you.

602
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,380
I'll do it.

603
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,900
Greetings, Mrs. Gu.

604
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,500
Mr. Zhou, sorry to keep you waiting.

605
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,160
Have a seat.

606
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,680
Please.

607
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,180
I've long heard that Mrs. Gu comes from a noble family

608
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,580
and is exceptionally intelligent.

609
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,420
You helped the Gu family

610
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,220
accumulate great wealth and assets.

611
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,740
You're the top

612
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,580
business talent of Jiangnan.

613
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,820
I greatly admire you too.

614
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,420
Now that I see you in person,

615
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,280
I didn't expect

616
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,060
you to be so young.

617
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,560
Mr. Zhou, you misunderstood.

618
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,660
Madam Jiang is my mother-in-law.

619
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,910
I'm the eldest daughter-in-law of the Gu family.

620
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,460
Please excuse me.

621
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,250
Mr. Zhou, you are our distinguished guest.

622
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,490
I will do my best

623
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,620
to do this business.

624
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,180
Thank you.

625
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,620
This is my purchase list.

626
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,870
Please have a look.

627
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,440
Young General,

628
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,420
shall we check out other shops?

629
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,020
The Gu family's firm has a good reputation

630
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,060
and a splendid variety of goods.

631
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,660
It is unrivaled in Yangzhou.

632
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,260
It is the best choice.

633
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,890
It’s a heavy responsibility to purchase military supplies.

634
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,580
The Gu family

635
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,300
let such a young lady

636
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,980
handle this deal.

637
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,780
I'm still worried.

638
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,660
What's wrong with sending a lady?

639
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,920
The matron of the Gu family is also a lady.

640
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,510
As for being young, it doesn't matter either.

641
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,810
When I was talking

642
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,380
with the Young Madam,

643
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,140
I found that

644
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,540
she is a quick thinker

645
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,300
and a sensible person who expresses herself clearly.

646
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,210
Even if the Gu family is reliable,

647
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,860
they shouldn't let the Young Madam take over.

648
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,660
If she can't make

649
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,050
those old managers and employees heed her orders,

650
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,860
she won't be able to achieve anything.

651
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,980
Haven't we seen plenty

652
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,710
of such situations in the army?

653
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,380
We embarked

654
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,860
on this trip as businessmen.

655
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,790
As businessmen,

656
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,820
we need to weigh our options.

657
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,010
From tomorrow on,

658
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,790
we will approach more shops

659
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,960
as a backup choice.

660
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,420
Yes.

661
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,220
Let's go.

662
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,940
Young Madam.

663
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,660
How did it go?

664
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,440
The managers sent a reply.

665
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,380
They said they are too busy

666
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,440
so they can't come.

667
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,970
None of them can come?

668
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,700
When they replied,

669
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
did they mention when they can come?

670
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,180
They all said they are busy lately

671
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,440
and cannot be certain.

672
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,140
Young Madam, they...

673
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,380
They are clearly bullying us.

674
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,580
The shop managers

675
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,110
are elders of the Gu family.

676
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,260
They are knowledgeable and experienced.

677
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,900
We're so young, so they're bound to want to

678
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,960
put us in our place.

679
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,530
We have no choice but to deal with it.

680
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,780
Forget it.

681
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,260
I'll ask them one by one tomorrow.

682
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,740
As long as we can get things done,

683
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,540
everything else is negotiable.

684
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,380
But they were so reluctant.

685
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,060
I'm afraid they won't cooperate

686
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,260
even if you ask them in person.

687
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,520
What should we do then?

688
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,980
There's always a way.

689
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,160
We just have to find it.

690
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,050
Here, Yuru.

691
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,340
Eat more.

692
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,160
Thank you, Mother.

693
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,340
Yes, eat more.

694
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,820
How is the

695
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,750
business matter going these days?

696
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,700
It's going quite smoothly.

697
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,580
That's good.

698
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,460
Our daughter-in-law

699
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,630
is really capable.

700
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,060
Yes.

701
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,700
We've been worrying

702
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,900
for half our lives.

703
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,940
I can finally look forward to

704
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,600
feeling at ease in the future.

705
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,780
Yuru, try this.

706
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,540
Here, Yuru.

707
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,970
Have some ribs.

708
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,340
Yuru, here.

709
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,080
Have some fish.

710
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,620
Why are you

711
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,230
studying so hard recently?

712
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,180
I can't believe

713
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,240
I never caught you slacking off once.

714
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:43,810
Can't I?

715
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,940
Of course you can.

716
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,700
But there must be a reason

717
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,130
for your sudden change in attitude.

718
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,820
Of course I have a reason.

719
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,540
But I won't tell you.

720
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,300
What are you grinning about?

721
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,980
You can barely sit still.

722
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,420
Something good happened?

723
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,150
Something very good happened.

724
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,969
I accepted a business deal recently.

725
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:21,010
It's a big deal.

726
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,120
He's a merchant from Youzhou.

727
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,940
In one order, he asked for

728
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,420
8,000 bull horns,

729
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,020
20,000 leather straps,

730
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,050
60,000 pieces of short leather jackets,

731
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,110
and countless miscellaneous items.

732
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,219
I suspect

733
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,300
they're military supplies for the province.

734
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,250
Such a good deal

735
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,020
will be handled solely by me.

736
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,900
If it goes well,

737
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,409
guess how much net profit

738
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,380
I can make from this order alone?

739
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,460
How much?

740
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,900
30,000 taels!

741
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,470
Is 30,000 taels too little for you?

742
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
30,000 taels?

743
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,930
That is about

744
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,840
half a year's pocket money for me.

745
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,140
That's different.

746
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,530
Your money came from your parents.

747
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,940
I earned it myself.

748
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,270
Can it be compared?

749
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,880
You haven't earned it yet.

750
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,050
You think I can’t?

751
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,020
I had a great conversation

752
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,150
with Mr. Zhou today.

753
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,920
The deal will be settled soon.

754
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
Do you really think

755
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,820
running a business is this easy?

756
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,650
Let me tell you.

757
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,420
The bigger the order, the more it is prone to changes.

758
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,010
The customer's mind is like the weather in June.

759
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,900
No matter how good the negotiation is,

760
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,300
the customer can change his mind at any time.

761
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,300
As long as the deposit isn't paid,

762
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,830
the deal cannot be settled.

763
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,190
Even after the deposit is paid,

764
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,060
if we miscalculate something along the way

765
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,210
or can't deliver the goods on time,

766
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,860
you can kiss your profit goodbye.

767
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,700
In fact, you'll have to pay them instead.

768
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,360
Forget earning 30,000 taels.

769
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,540
You're good as long as you don't

770
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,670
make a loss instead.

771
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,860
Even so,

772
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,420
as long as I work hard,

773
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,000
there will always be a way.

774
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,870
Let alone 30,000 taels,

775
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,900
I'm capable of earning 100,000...

776
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,960
No, even a million.

777
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,170
I'm confident.

778
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,490
A million?

779
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,320
It's good to be confident.

780
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,300
Are you crying?

781
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,410
Why are you crying?

782
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,770
I have no confidence at all.

783
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,660
You're crying just because you're not confident?

784
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,130
Well...

785
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,760
I don't want to make a loss.

786
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,290
It's such a big deal.

787
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,550
How could I possibly pay for the loss?

788
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,300
Who cares if you make a loss?

789
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,530
We have plenty of money.

790
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,990
I don't want to lose money.

791
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,180
I want to earn money.

792
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,140
Okay, sure, we'll earn money.

793
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,670
We'll earn all their money.

794
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,470
But I'm afraid I can't do it.

795
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,510
They don't listen to me

796
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,400
because I'm young.

797
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,380
They won't cooperate with me either.

798
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,540
The past few days, I went to the shops to ask for prices.

799
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,670
But the managers wouldn't even see me.

800
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,180
Then why didn't you

801
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,130
tell Mother the truth today?

802
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,540
One word from her,

803
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,780
and those old managers

804
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,180
won't dare to ignore you.

805
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,660
I can't ask her

806
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,390
to stand up for me immediately.

807
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,300
Otherwise, they will

808
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,560
always look down on me.

809
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,100
You're quite ambitious.

810
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,180
It's not ambition.

811
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,440
Then what is it?

812
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,990
I know even if you don't tell me.

813
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,170
How do you know?

814
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,730
You wanted to prove yourself.

815
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,940
You didn't want to disappoint our mother.

816
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,870
That's why you acted tough, right?

817
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,180
You hope that you can do it,

818
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,300
that you're good at doing business.

819
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,300
But you've never done it before.

820
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,820
So you're nervous, right?

821
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,210
You

822
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,900
want others to feel at ease.

823
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,820
So you pretend that you can do it.

824
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,780
But you've already promised it,

825
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,180
yet you can't achieve it,

826
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,740
so you don't know what to do anymore. Right?

827
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,860
How did you know?

828
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,500
Everyone

829
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,830
has driven themself into a corner before.

830
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,740
Didn't I promise you

831
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,800
to take the examination on a whim too?

832
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,010
Actually, I don't know

833
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,900
if I can do it.

834
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,420
So you're

835
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,880
studying so hard recently

836
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,420
for me?

837
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,840
You're afraid I'll be disappointed?

838
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,700
W-well... not exactly.

839
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,700
I have to be

840
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,900
a man of my word.

841
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,620
Actually, I used to study well.

842
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,980
It's just a matter of reviewing the materials.

843
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,130
Gu Jiusi.

844
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,820
Thank you.

845
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,090
Liu Yuru.

846
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,570
Shall we

847
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,020
make a bet?

848
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,870
What kind of bet?

849
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,020
I bet that you'll become Boss Liu

850
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,150
and earn a million.

851
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,020
As for me...

852
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,540
I'll rank first in the Provincial Examination.

853
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,820
You? Rank first?

854
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,310
What? You don't believe me?

855
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,300
I do.

856
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,000
Actually, not really.

857
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,110
♫I forgot the things in the world all of a sudden♫

858
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,110
If you don't believe me, let's have a bet.

859
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:14,390
♫Everyone thinks life is like a dream♫

860
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Let's see if you'll earn your million first,

861
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,260
or I'll ace the exam first.

862
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,950
♫I looked back inadvertently♫

863
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,260
Fine.

864
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,570
♫A stranger impressed me♫

865
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,000
How about this?

866
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,050
Whoever

867
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,540
achieves the goal first

868
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,900
will be qualified to propose a divorce.

869
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,280
♫We've been with each other for another day♫

870
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,140

♫Another spring and autumn came♫

872
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,420

♫Who will deliver letters to me?♫

874

♫Everyone thinks life is like a dream♫

No need to hurry.

Take your time.

881
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,900
Gu Jiusi.

♫I've seen you here before♫

885

I wouldn't dare underestimate you.

Everyone in the city knows that

887
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,780
I am not afraid of anything

888
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,810
♫One night, we sat together to write poems and drink alcohol♫

889

except you and your big sword.

00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,860
Not only can you wield a big sword,

891

♫Another spring and autumn came♫

892
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,120
you know how to cry too.

893

When you cry,

894
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:57,820
all the hair on my skin stand up.

895
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,890
♫I saw the sun, the moon, and the stars outside the window♫

896

00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,180
I think of your crying eyes.

898

♫The wind blows and the moon sways. My heart is beating♫

899
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,810
I think I am traumatized.

00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,100
Fine.

901
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,900
I'll earn my first million and you'll rank first in the Provincial Examination.

902
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,620
It's a deal.

903
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,600
Give me a five to seal the deal.

904
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,780
Sure, and the deal is sealed.

905
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,550
Young Madam, you're awake.

906
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,340
You've been troubled these days.

907
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,400
It's rare for you to sleep until dawn.

908
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,040
Where is the Young Master?

909
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,140
He went to school.

910
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,340
No one woke him up.

911
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,670
He got up early himself.

912
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,140
Before he left,

913
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,540
he was reading while having his breakfast.

914
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,340
What is this?

915
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,780
A silk pouch?

916
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:11,980
Business is all about

917
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,980
the right time, the right place, and the right people.

918
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,140
You're in Yangzhou,

919
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,060
you married into my family,

920
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,010
and you received my mother's approval.

921
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,740
You have the right time and place.

922
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,200
As for the right people...

923
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I have an idea

924
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,700
to help you overcome the obstacles.

925
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,100
Manager Ma of the timber yard

926
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,620
has recently been promoted and lacks experience.

927
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,580
Maybe the other old foxes

928
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
really want to put you in your place.

929
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,550
But he might not.

930
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,220
What he wants most right now

931
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:44,900
is support.

932
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,300
You just need to avoid the others

933
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,740
and draw him in privately.

934
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,140
He will come to greet you.

935
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,620
Young Madam.

936
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,900
About the other day, the messenger

937
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,100
did not make it clear.

938
00:42:59,340 --> 00:42:59,860
If I knew

939
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,320
it was you who summoned me,

940
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,180
I would have come to meet you

941
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,700
even if I had to forgo sleeping.
