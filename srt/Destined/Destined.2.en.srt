[Episode 2]

4
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,789
Little Yuru, are you buying rouge?

5
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,310
Sir,

6
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,570
I'm afraid it'll be inappropriate

7
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,120
if there's a male customer here.

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,920
Young Master,

9
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,390
this is a rouge shop.

10
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,740
As soon as you came in,

11
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,410
my customers...

12
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,140
Don't worry.

13
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,450
I won't affect your business.

14
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,490
I'll buy all the rouge

15
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,680
in the store today.

16
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,510
Well...

17
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,230
Little Yuru,

18
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,850
if any rouge takes your fancy,

19
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,510
just pick it

20
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,920
and ask Jiusi to buy it for you.

21
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,780
Young Master, please mind your language.

22
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,500
My young miss

23
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,380
is a decent lady

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,710
from an eminent family.

25
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,490
You being like this...

26
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,620
Y-You being like this...

27
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,460
What's wrong with me?

28
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,100
Girl, tell me.

29
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,550
What's wrong with me?

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,130
Young Master Gu,

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,310
I have no idea

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,320
why you're looking for me today.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,510
But we are poles apart.

34
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,079
We never had much interaction.

35
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,880
If my family

36
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,690
offended you,

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,450
Young Master Gu,

38
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,130
please be magnanimous

39
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,940
and forgive them.

40
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,960
I apologize to you on their behalf.

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,620
Please stop

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,290
making things difficult for me today.

43
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,570
Don't believe her. She's just pretending.

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
That's right. She's very scheming.

45
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,460
Little Yuru,

46
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm not giving you a hard time.

47
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,810
I like you.

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,990
Young Master Gu,

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,620
please don't joke around.

50
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,720
This is not a joke.

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,890
I fell in love with you at first sight,

52
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,770
then fell more deeply at second sight.

53
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,120
From now until I die,

54
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,200
I won't marry anyone but you.

55
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,300
Young Master Gu.

56
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,830
I apologize to you

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,550
for what happened at Ye Mansion today.

58
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,730
I had no choice.

59
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,050
Ladies always value reputation the most.

60
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,100
But even so,

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,520
it's my fault

62
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,079
for displeasing you.

63
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,459
Today, you've already

64
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,510
fooled me once.

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
We should be even now.

66
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,830
Young Master Gu,

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,370
please let me off this time.

68
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,090
Didn't you say

69
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,800
if Jiusi

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,850
took a liking to you,

71
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,740
you'd kill yourself by drowning in the river?

72
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,670
That's right.

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,390
Now, he has proposed to you.

74
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,950
Time waits for no man, Little Yuru.

75
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,630
The moat is over there.

76
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,810
Go quickly and jump into it!

77
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,470
Go and jump!

78
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,210
Are you trying to drive her to a corner?

79
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,010
You bully a young lady like this.

80
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,640
It is way overboard.

81
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,570
Young Master Gu,

82
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,460
must you force me to jump into the river

83
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,340
to end all this?

84
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,950
Jump! Jump!

85
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,610
How about this?

86
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,120
You just have to say,

87
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,360
"Ye Shi'an is a bastard.

88
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,390
He isn't as good as Gu Jiusi, who is very handsome,

89
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,110
elegant, smart,

90
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,210
and upright."

91
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,409
This will put an end

92
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,950
to the matter.

93
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,720
Young Master Ye... is not as good as you,

94
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,250
who are elegant,

95
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,510
h-handsome...

96
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,600
Cool.

97
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,750
Handsome and cool.

98
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,200
Not as smart as you.

99
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,720
And also not...

100
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,070
Upright.

101
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,500
Upright.

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,380
Louder.

103
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,400
He's not as upright as you.

104
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,520
All right, you may go now.

105
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,520
Wait.

106
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,360
Everyone,

107
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,320
take a box of rouge.

108
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,530
Consider it a gift from me.

109
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,110
Thank you, Young Master Gu.

110
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,220
Thank you.

111
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,750
Thank you, Young Master Gu.

What?

114
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,120
Are you looking down on me?

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,920
If you don't take it,

116
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,300
it means you don't want me to spend money.

117
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,760
You are concerned about me, and you fancy me.

118
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,570
If you marry Ye Shi'an in the future,

119
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,360
teach him a lesson for me.

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,270
That little brat.

123
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,150
Young Miss Ye is so courteous and good-looking.

124
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,360
Not only did he refuse,

125
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,960
but he also went to her house

126
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,420
and made a fool of himself.

127
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,410
We were so eager to get him engaged.

128
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,680
Guess what he said.

129
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,940
He said

130
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,250
he wants to make his own decisions on marriage.

131
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,640
He wants to marry

132
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
someone he likes as his wife.

133
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,309
Otherwise, he'll pack up his things and rove all over the world.

134
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:33,980
Listen.

135
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,919
What nonsense is that?

136
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,309
Jiusi's got a point.

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,280
After all, this is

138
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,289
his own marriage.

139
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,059
He should marry

140
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,780
a girl he likes.

141
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,710
We took the liberty of

142
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,840
getting him engaged.

143
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,480
That was indeed not appropriate.

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,330
What do you think is appropriate?

145
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,720
Is it appropriate to marry the princess in Eastern Capital?

146
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
We're not in the same league as the royal family.

147
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,770
If anything goes wrong,

148
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,380
it will

149
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,780
cause the whole family to be exterminated.

150
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,210
The emissary who is going to bring up the proposal of marriage

151
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,680
will arrive soon.

152
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,490
What should we do?

153
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,790
Master.

154
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,180
Madam.

155
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,830
Young Master has a crush on someone.

156
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,820
Jiusi has a crush on someone?

157
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,490
Young Master said

158
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,690
he would marry no one but the young lady.

159
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,570
Did Jiusi really say that?

160
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,130
Of course.

161
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,190
He said it himself.

162
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,780
Many people heard it.

163
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,450
Then...

164
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,290
Which family is she from?

165
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,410
Well...

166
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,030
Go and find out.

167
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,590
Yes.

168
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,830
So she is the legitimate daughter

169
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,050
of the Liu family which owns a clothing business.

170
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,560
Her family is indeed a little low-class.

171
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,040
No wonder Jiusi didn't mention it.

172
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,650
Although her family is a little low-class,

173
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,290
it's a decent family.

174
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,720
The most important thing is

175
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,020
Jiusi likes her.

176
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,420
Thank goodness.

177
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,730
He's always wandering around outside.

178
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,700
I thought

179
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,000
he would marry

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,380
a prostitute.

181
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,880
How about this?

182
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,970
We will bring up the proposal of marriage tomorrow.

183
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,320
My husband and I have heard

184
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,000
what happened yesterday.

185
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,860
Madam.

186
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,760
My eldest daughter

187
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,350
was so impolite yesterday

188
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,880
that she offended your son.

189
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,540
My master will surely teach her a lesson

190
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,520
after he finishes checking the ledgers.

191
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,520
I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.

192
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,470
Don't say that.

193
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,240
We're here today

194
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,800
to propose to Young Miss Liu

195
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,310
on behalf of my son, Jiusi.

196
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,570
Let's have a seat to talk about it.

197
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,550
This is the list of betrothal gifts from the Gu family.

198
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,860
It includes 100 mu of farmland in the western suburbs,

199
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,040
15 shops in Guangling East Street,

200
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,640
15 houses,

201
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,610
seven fishing villages in Zhuhu,

202
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,740
pleasure boats...

203
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,570
Ten pleasure boats?

204
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,100
Ten pairs of coloured glaze lamps from the Western Regions,

205
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,670
and ten pairs of mutton fat jade.

206
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,230
Please give the list to Master Liu

207
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
so that he can have a look.

208
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,620
But we heard that

209
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,010
the Ye family and your family are going to be united by marriage.

210
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,270
Is that true?

211
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,410
Madam,

212
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,420
you've misunderstood.

213
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,810
Here's the thing.

214
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,330
My eldest daughter

215
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,960
and Young Miss Ye

216
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,100
are close friends.

217
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,400
So she naturally gets along well

218
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,460
with the Ye family.

219
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,890
But they never mentioned

220
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,310
marriage.

221
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,310
Those

222
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
are just rumours.

223
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,090
If Master agrees,

224
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,180
I wonder

225
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,810
when we can get the betrothal gifts.

226
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,040
If he says yes today,

227
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,230
we'll give you the betrothal gifts tomorrow.

228
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,490
We also think that the sooner the better.

229
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,150
Madam.

230
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,130
You can't be

231
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,400
tricking us, can you?

232
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,210
A noble family like the Gu family

233
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,730
is not something

234
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,700
we can be in the same league with.

235
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,740
My son, Jiusi,

236
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,300
has a crush on your daughter, Young Miss Liu.

237
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,520
We sincerely came here to propose marriage.

238
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I was even worried that Young Miss Liu would disagree.

239
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,680
I see.

240
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,140
If so, it's a godsent marriage.

241
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,600
Yuru

242
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,280
often said that Young Master Gu,

243
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,000
who is good-looking and warm-hearted,

244
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,100
is a rare young talent.

245
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,960
Did Young Miss Liu really say that?

246
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,720
Of course.

247
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,520
Yuru has always

248
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,750
praised Young Master Gu

249
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,080
for his literary talent and personality.

250
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,160
That's great.

251
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,110
But the most important thing

252
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,120
about marriage is sincerity.

253
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,100
Although I'm an illegitimate mother,

254
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,440
I always treat Yuru

255
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,530
as my own daughter,

256
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,340
like the flesh in my hand.

257
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,350
All these years,

258
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,950
many people came

259
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,320
to propose marriage.

260
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,980
But I think the most important thing

261
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,700
is to marry her

262
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,650
off to a family full of sincerity.

263
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,230
Of course,

264
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,910
we sincerely came to propose.

265
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,060
These betrothal gifts

266
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,740
are precious

267
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,190
for ordinary people.

268
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,720
But the Gu family is noble and wealthy.

269
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,080
These are just a drop in the ocean.

270
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,760
I'm afraid

271
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
I can't see much sincerity in these.

272
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,940
What is your opinion about it?

273
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,360
I think 100 mu of farmland

274
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,340
and 15 shops

275
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,560
are not enough.

276
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,370
At least,

277
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,270
120 mu of farmland

278
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,280
and 18 shops.

279
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:13,960
In this way,

280
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,260
it also shows that our daughter

281
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,060
has prestige.

282
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,530
Moreover, it will earn respect

283
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,530
for the Gu family.

284
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,780
That's no big deal.

285
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,860
But your master isn't here today.

286
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,280
Also, Eldest Madam is feeling unwell.

287
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,510
We'll come

288
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,710
once again tomorrow.

289
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,660
Madam,

290
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,350
the matter is of great importance.

291
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,740
I'm afraid Master will blame me

292
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,070
if the matter is held up.

293
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,020
How about this?

294
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,740
I'll now send someone to Maritime Trade Superintendency

295
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,660
to deliver the message

296
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,520
and ask for the Master's opinion.

297
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,530
The Maritime Trade Superintendency is not far from here.

298
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,210
When you arrive at your mansion,

299
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,070
you will have received the reply.

300
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,150
Good.

301
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,210
By the way,

302
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,520
you have to ask for an opinion

303
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,240
from Young Miss Liu's birth mother,

304
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,500
the Eldest Madam, too.

305
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,400
Of course.

306
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,900
We'll now take our leave first.

307
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,110
Take care, Madam.

308
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,040
Madam.

309
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,180
Maritime Trade Superintendency is under strict supervision when checking the ledgers.

310
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,650
Aren't we not allowed to deliver messages to Master?

311
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,030
Are you stupid?

312
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,130
Who would really ask for his opinions?

313
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,730
It was just an act.

314
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,580
After twenty minutes,

315
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,960
you go and reply to them

316
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,290
that Master has agreed.

317
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,740
Young Miss.

318
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,420
Young Miss, bad news!

319
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,260
What's wrong?

320
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,530
Our family has made an engagement with the Gu family.

321
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,110
You are married off

322
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,290
to Gu Jiusi.

323
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,130
No way.

324
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,980
What nonsense are you talking about?

325
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,860
It's true.

326
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,120
Madam Yue ordered you

327
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,650
to be grounded in your room.

328
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,350
She also said

329
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,080
no one is allowed to tip you off.

330
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,790
Fortunately, the carter who went to deliver the message to the Gu family

331
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,640
was Eldest Madam's dowry servant.

332
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,360
That's why he told me secretly.

333
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,030
Well...

334
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,310
No matter how rich and powerful the Gu family is,

335
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,070
they should care about their reputation.

336
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,790
Old Madam Ye

337
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,380
already fixed her mind on me.

338
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,260
She even asked a matchmaker

339
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,390
to inquire about my Eight Characters.

340
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,330
Go!

341
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,880
Go to Ye Mansion to find Yun.

342
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,420
Ask her to think of a way.

343
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,570
If Old Madam Ye

344
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,920
can speak for me,

345
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,810
maybe there's still room to turn things around.

346
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,600
Go now.

347
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,070
Yes.

348
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,560
Grandmother!

349
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,740
Grandmother!

350
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,810
Grandmother.

351
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,860
The Gu family wants to forcefully marry Yuru.

352
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,160
Please help her out.

353
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,630
Grandmother.

354
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,230
Say something.

355
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,750
Don't you

356
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,300
like Yuru very much too?

357
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,490
Don't you also want

358
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,460
my brother to marry Yuru?

359
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,430
We can't stand by and do nothing

360
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,760
while watching her jump into the fire pit.

361
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,609
Grandmother!

362
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,250
Grandmother!

363
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,339
Yun'er.

364
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,760
We can't help her.

365
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,780
Why can't we help her?

366
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,260
The Gu family

367
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,030
took a fancy to you at first.

368
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,070
If she doesn't jump into the fire pit,

369
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,770
you will be the one who has to jump.

370
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,880
Even so, I can't stand idle by

371
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
watching her jump into the fire pit.

372
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,860
Yuru and I are as intimate as sisters.

373
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,130
I don't want her

374
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,560
to suffer for me.

375
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,750
She's smart, stoic,

376
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,300
and thoughtful.

377
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,500
Even if she encounters adversity,

378
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,130
she can somehow

379
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,560
find a way out.

380
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:19,990
But...

381
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,840
Can you do it?

382
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,270
I...

383
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,740
Girl,

384
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,030
you've been spoiled since young.

385
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
If you marry a playboy,

386
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,620
can you endure those hardships

387
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,430
and sufferings?

388
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,760
Yuru has already

389
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,340
had a hard life when she was young.

390
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,890
No one could protect her.

391
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,530
So she's now stoic,

392
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:03,960
capable,

393
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,690
and thoughtful.

394
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,200
But if

395
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,110
someone could protect her,

396
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,080
wouldn't she be just like me?

397
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,120
Just because

398
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,520
she has been suffering since she was young,

399
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,790
she should keep suffering in the future?

400
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,150
This is not fair, Grandmother.

401
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,300
I'd rather marry the Gu family

402
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,650
than have her

403
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,820
suffer for me.

404
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,060
Girl,

405
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,290
do you think

406
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,230
I didn't try to think of a way?

407
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,840
No matter what,

408
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,200
first come, first served.

409
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,790
If the Gu and Liu families

410
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,670
had not issued official documents,

411
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,490
I would have gone to the Gu Mansion

412
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,090
to set the record straight.

413
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,060
But...

414
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,700
it's too late.

415
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,430
This morning,

416
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,660
the marriage

417
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,620
was certified by the official documents.

418
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,480
There's no turning back anymore.

419
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,430
Yuru.

420
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,910
Grandmother said

421
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,180
the Gu and Liu families

422
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,660
have issued the official documents.

423
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,600
There's nothing she could do anymore.

424
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,050
How could it happen?

425
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,590
It was...

426
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,710
Everything was fine.

427
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,520
You almost

428
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,000
married my brother.

429
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,070
Brother...

430
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,870
Oh yeah.

431
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,760
Yuru.

432
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,280
I'll now write a letter to my brother

433
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,380
and ask him to come back soon.

434
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,040
So he can help us think of a way.

435
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,940
Yun'er.

436
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,720
The die is cast.

437
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,040
If you tell him now,

438
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,290
you're just causing him more trouble.

439
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,050
Yinhong,

440
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,080
send Yun back home.

441
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,460
I need to think about it alone.

442
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,670
Go.

443
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,520
Yuru.

444
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,620
Go.

445
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,660
Perhaps

446
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,850
it might have been my wishful thinking

447
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,160
from the beginning.

448
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,510
Eldest Miss.

449
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,450
Eldest Miss.

450
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,070
Something bad happened.

451
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,870
Your father was detained by the Maritime Trade Superintendency

452
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,430
and is now in prison.

453
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,980
They said he transported

454
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,240
several ships of cloth

455
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,210
but evaded the tax.

456
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,870
He will be severely punished.

457
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,480
If he evaded the tax,

458
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,160
you would just have to pay the overdue tax.

459
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,300
Easy for you to say.

460
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,430
It's different this time.

461
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,350
This time, the commissioner

462
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,280
intervened and said

463
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,710
if someone evaded the tax,

464
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,090
the person would either be executed

465
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,810
or pay 100 times the fine.

466
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,410
100 times the fine.

467
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,300
Do you know how much it is?

468
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,200
To pay 100 times the fine,

469
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,820
just sell the shops,

470
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,400
houses, and the land we own,

471
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,640
that'll be enough.

472
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,780
Are you crazy?

473
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,130
If we sell them all,

474
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,340
what else can we rely on

475
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,680
for a living?

476
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,610
That's why you want to sell me

477
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,540
to the Gu family?

478
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,890
Eldest Miss.

479
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,330
What are you talking about?

480
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,740
Are you trying to

481
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,950
hurt my feelings?

482
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,890
I tried so hard to help you get married to a rich family.

483
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,900
How could you say

484
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,540
it's my fault?

485
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,460
Besides, the Gu family has already given us the betrothal gifts.

486
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,390
If you are reluctant to get married,

487
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,650
no decent family

488
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,150
will dare to accept

489
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,660
a girl who has broken off an engagement.

490
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,340
The reputation of the Liu family will be ruined.

491
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,560
And you will also

492
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,060
implicate your younger sisters by doing so.

493
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,810
Guixiang.

494
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,900
Close the door.

495
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,380
Hurry up.

496
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,810
Look out the land deeds and farmland deeds

497
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,570
we own.

498
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,320
Yes.

499
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,300
Mother, what's wrong?

500
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,430
I'm afraid the Liu family will be in trouble soon.

501
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,210
In these few days,

502
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:07,960
we should trade

503
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,160
these valuable things for money first.

504
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,450
If anything happens,

505
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,630
we'll leave

506
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,930
Yangzhou immediately.

507
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,600
We can't be implicated

508
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,730
by them.

509
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,570
Okay.

510
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,840
Young Miss,

511
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,850
do you really want to

512
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,940
marry Gu Jiusi?

513
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,740
For the time being,

514
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,310
do I have another choice?

515
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,050
The Gu family is of great influence.

516
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,380
For the sake of dignity,

517
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,500
they won't allow their relative by marriage

518
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,130
to stay in prison.

519
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,210
To exempt Father from punishment

520
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,070
is just a piece of cake for the Gu family.

521
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,030
From now on,

522
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,770
the Liu family will be safe and sound.

523
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,340
Isn't that

524
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,230
what Madam Yue expected?

525
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,910
How despicable.

526
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,110
Not only is she satisfied

527
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,560
with this,

528
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,920
but she has also been coveting

529
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,750
the betrothal gifts from the Gu family.

530
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,120
After I get married,

531
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,280
Mother will still live under her thumb

532
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,610
and depend on her for a living.

533
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,150
To support Mother

534
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,380
to live in the Liu family,

535
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,230
I have to ask the Gu family

536
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,710
to register the shops and farmhouses

537
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,680
under my name.

538
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,810
Young Miss, if you do so,

539
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,990
will the Gu family look down on you?

540
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,130
Now, there's no time for me

541
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,130
to care so much.

542
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,360
Besides,

543
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,670
what if Gu Jiusi

544
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,600
is not as bad as

545
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,440
the rumours?

546
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,710
What if...

547
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,110
What if he's willing to help me?

548
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,320
Here you are. Go

549
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,480
and ask a trustworthy servant

550
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,310
to send this letter

551
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,860
to Gu Jiusi.

552
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,000
Remember,

553
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,690
ask him to open it himself

554
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,470
and tell him what I mean.

555
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,370
Yes.

556
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,230
[A Godsent Marriage]

557
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,090
Cheers.

558
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,020
Come on.

559
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:41,910
Jiusi.

560
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,160
Let me ask you something.

561
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,000
Go ahead.

562
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,210
You...

563
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,250
Young Master Gu.

564
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:50,920
My young miss

565
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,090
asked me to send you a letter.

566
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,560
She also asked me to deliver you a message.

567
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,780
Your young miss?

568
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,710
Who is it?

569
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
My young miss said

570
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,980
since you are going to be husband and wife,

571
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,040
please give her a little protection.

572
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,030
Did you get the wrong person

573
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,290
or are you making fun of me?

574
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,550
What husband and wife?

575
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,570
So it's true.

576
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,670
What do you mean?

577
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,970
I heard

578
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,490
your family has given betrothal gifts.

579
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,330
They are going to

580
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,800
marry you to a young lady.

581
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,020
I thought it was

582
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,490
an untenable rumour.

583
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,120
So it's true.

584
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,800
I heard about it too.

585
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,670
But the news came so suddenly.

586
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,530
I didn't take it seriously.

587
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,210
Right? Me too.

588
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,560
Since it's true,

589
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,610
I should congratulate you, Jiusi.

590
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,270
You're getting married soon.

591
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,850
I didn't expect that

592
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,280
you are the first person

593
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,240
to get married among us.

594
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,870
Yes.

595
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,510
Young Miss Liu

596
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,850
even wrote you a love letter

597
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,990
before you get married.

598
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,490
Wait.

599
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,210
Young Miss Liu?

600
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,790
Which Young Miss Liu?

601
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,700
Who else?

602
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,130
Liu Yuru.

603
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,310
Gu Langhua that old man

604
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,710
simply ignored my words.

605
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,450
Take it.

606
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,670
Young Master Gu.

607
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,340
The land deeds.

608
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,260
What deeds?

609
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,490
How could she say yes to such a thing?

610
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,290
Was Liu Yuru

611
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,210
out of her mind?

612
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,980
-Young Master.
-Look.

613
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,860
He's shy.

614
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,140
Keep up.

615
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,030
After all the detours,

616
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
we have to arrive in Yangzhou today.

617
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,100
[Gu Mansion]

618
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,490
Now that the marriage of Jiusi is settled,

619
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,770
I truly feel

620
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,930
at ease.

621
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,770
Gu Langhua.

622
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,370
You old man.

623
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,370
I knew you'd be hanging around here.

624
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,580
Little brat,

625
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,590
you haven't been home for days,

626
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,570
and now you're talking nonsense.

627
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,210
Why am I getting married?

628
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,490
What's wrong with Young Miss Liu?

629
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,910
What are you doing

630
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,870
behind my back?

631
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,490
Hold on. What do you mean?

632
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,130
Do you really want to go to the Eastern Capital

633
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,520
with the emissary of Lord Liang?

634
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,230
Besides,

635
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,620
isn't Young Miss Liu

636
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,960
the girl you like?

637
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,440
Who likes Liu Yuru? I...

638
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,280
You don't like her?

639
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,950
You don't like her,

640
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,250
but you said in public that

641
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,380
you would marry no one else except her.

642
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,820
I...

643
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,390
I was just joking.

644
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,080
How could you joke about your marriage?

645
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,950
You got me engaged without my permission.

646
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,050
Anyway, I won't marry Liu Yuru.

647
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,810
I want to break off the engagement.

648
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,450
You little brat.

649
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,300
The betrothal gifts have been given and the wedding has been confirmed.

650
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,820
The bridal sedan chair will

651
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,330
fetch the bride from Liu Mansion tomorrow.

652
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,010
If you break off the engagement now,

653
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,480
what do you want her to do?

654
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,570
But if she marries

655
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,450
someone she doesn't like,

656
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,980
it will ruin her whole life.

657
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,410
Master.

658
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,210
Father.

659
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:37,790
Go away.

660
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,220
No.

661
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,740
Liu Yuru and I

662
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,000
dislike each other.

663
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,430
She looks down on me,

664
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,760
and the same goes for me.

665
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,670
I hate

666
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,330
hypocrites like her the most.

667
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,440
Besides,

668
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,510
she already has someone she likes.

669
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:55,980
If we get married,

670
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,580
neither of us will feel good.

671
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,130
I know

672
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,640
you are in such a hurry

673
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,570
to protect me from the misfortune.

674
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,040
But if I really

675
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,510
break up the couple who likes each other,

676
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,240
it... it's not so appropriate.

677
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,560
What should we do?

678
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,400
In my opinion,

679
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,870
just break off the engagement.

680
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,200
It's easy for you to say.

681
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,940
Even if we do not consider Lord Liang,

682
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,960
the engagement has gone through all the procedures,

683
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,930
and the government has also issued the certificates.

684
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,780
You can't just break it off.

685
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,990
Then, what do you think we should do?

686
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,660
Master.

687
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,090
Master.

688
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,270
Lord Liang's emissary is here.

689
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,280
Madam asked you to go to the main hall

690
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,450
to discuss something important.

691
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,970
Go, go, go.

692
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,390
Hurry up.

693
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,080
Little brat.

694
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,850
What have I done wrong

695
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,580
to have such a son?

696
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,880
Why was he so agitated all of a sudden?

697
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,740
This old man...

698
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,860
What?

699
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Young Master Gu is already engaged?

700
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,510
When did that happen?

701
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,550
Unfortunately,

702
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,020
two days ago,

703
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,460
the procedures and official documents

704
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,920
have just been completed.

705
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,270
We didn't expect

706
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,190
you would come here today.

707
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,550
That's really a pity.

708
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,420
His Majesty has approved

709
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,320
the marriage proposal of the princess.

710
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,560
Is this

711
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,460
really a coincidence?

712
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
Yes, it is.

713
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,250
The wedding of my son and his beloved

714
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,760
is known to everyone in Yangzhou City.

715
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,160
He is going to escort the bride tomorrow.

716
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,810
What beloved?

717
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,350
Don't tell me he is getting engaged hurriedly

718
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,840
to disobey His Majesty's order

719
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,430
and fool His Majesty.

720
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,540
Listen.

721
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,590
If you lie to me,

722
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,510
it'll be a crime of deceiving His Majesty.

723
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,380
That makes no sense.

724
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,739
We, the Gu family, have always been upright

725
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,739
and loyal.

726
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,969
Everything I said is true.

727
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,820
If I lie to you,

728
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,210
I'll accept the punishment.

729
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:25,960
Master is here.

730
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,920
If you don't believe me,

731
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,409
you can ask him yourself

732
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,260
whether my son, Jiusi,

733
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,810
has a crush on someone

734
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,489
and is getting married.

735
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:36,920
Exactly.

736
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,480
My son is getting married tomorrow.

737
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,409
You must be tired from the journey.

738
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,320
How about you stay here and join the wedding dinner tomorrow?

739
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,620
We tramped over mountains and through ravines

740
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,260
and rushed to Yangzhou every moment.

741
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,590
But it's still too late.

742
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,380
Before the wedding,

743
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,560
we have a lot to do.

744
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,600
Please have a seat, sir.

745
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,110
I'll get back to work.

746
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,740
Sir, please.

747
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,200
Father, how is it?

748
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,460
When will we break off the engagement?

749
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,050
Master.

750
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,100
Why are you here?

751
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,080
It hurts.

752
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
I'll forgive you if you let me go now.

753
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,920
Master has issued an order.

754
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,880
Don't blame me.

755
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:41,850
I'll get you

756
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,280
a lamb leg tonight.

757
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,240
Why do I need a lamb leg?

758
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,080
It hurts.

759
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,840
Lock him up.

760
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,530
Keep a close watch on him.

761
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,110
Yes.

762
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,790
Father,

763
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,640
you can't force me to get married.

764
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,360
Lock him up.

765
