4
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,480
Jiusi!

5
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,360
Jiusi!

6
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,560
Jiusi!

7
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,970
Jiusi!

8
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,880
Jiusi!

9
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,560
Jiusi!

10
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,690
Jiusi!

11
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,040
Jiusi!

12
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,050
Jiusi!

13
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,440
Jiusi!

14
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,630
From now on, I'll have the same food

15
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,950
as the soldiers.

16
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,750
No special preparation is needed.

17
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,120
Yes.

18
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,640
Pass my order.

19
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,540
Tomorrow, the entire army will

20
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,800
retreat 15 kilometers

21
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,320
and turn attack into defense.

22
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,720
All of you, send the message back

23
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,540
and get ready to strike camp.

24
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,330
Yes.

25
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,800
Father.

26
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,200
Jiusi and Yuru will find a way.

27
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,950
I trust them.

28
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,290
Father,

29
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,760
please be patient.

30
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,280
Father.

31
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,620
Your health is more important.

32
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,360
Please

33
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,120
have a good rest.

34
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,610
Great.

35
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,890
The late emperor wanted me to die.

36
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,810
My son wants me to die too.

37
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,529
Great.

38
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,700
You're awake.

39
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,330
Where are we?

40
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,520
Don't worry.

41
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,060
That night, we

42
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,540
made it out of Jingji very quickly.

43
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,800
This is an ordinary inn in the mountains.

44
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,000
How long did I sleep?

45
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,400
Two days.

46
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,680
We've delayed for so long.

47
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,940
General Zhou can't wait any longer.

48
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,870
You're injured.

49
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,040
Let's wait till dawn.

50
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,360
Can I borrow a lighter?

51
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,910
We don't have a lighter.

52
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,110
Go ask someone else.

53
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,420
Second brother Liu.

54
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,600
Chen Xun.

55
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,120
It's me.

56
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,270
Sister-in-law.

57
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,610
Jiusi.

58
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,430
Chen Xun.

59
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,650
Jiusi.

60
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,400
How did you find us?

61
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,620
I went to the place

62
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,420
you told me in the letter.

63
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,100
I waited for you all night, but you didn't show up.

64
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,890
I guess

65
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,210
you were attacked.

66
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,530
So I took my men to search

67
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,600
all the hospitals and inns nearby.

68
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,920
I finally found you.

69
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,110
It's been so many years.

70
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,720
You've changed a lot.

71
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,930
I can't believe

72
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,990
you could be the head of the ship gang.

73
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,150
I can't imagine that

74
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,280
you could

75
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,710
be Grand Councilor of the Left either.

76
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,570
Now, all the people in court who can assist me

77
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,630
are being watched.

78
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,470
Only your men

79
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,240
can help me.

80
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,000
Escorting provisions

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,300
for the soldiers in the front line.

82
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,830
Although we are commoners,

83
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,220
we should do our best.

84
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,200
From now on,

85
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,980
I'll personally escort you with my men.

86
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,310
I'll be at your disposal

87
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,740
and do my best to help you.

88
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,780
Thank you so much.

89
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,070
You're welcome.

90
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,420
It's what I should do.

91
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,690
No trace at all?

92
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,730
Yes.

93
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,250
Master.

94
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,780
Should we inform Jingzhou?

95
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,820
Forget it.

96
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,800
Miss Shiyu

97
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,040
has a strong foundation in the south.

98
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,660
Her wealth and connections are both top class.

99
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,210
We can't stop her

100
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,200
from raising provisions.

101
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,480
Gu Jiusi

102
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,380
may also receive

103
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,180
assistance from the commoners.

104
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,260
Zhao Gaolang can't be trapped

105
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,940
by provision shortage anymore.

106
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,210
If Zhou Gaolang's army really...

107
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,410
Zhou Gaolang's army must be destroyed.

108
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,200
I have another way.

109
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,100
Zhou Gaolang and his sons

110
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,000
are the last stumbling block.

111
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,200
After getting rid of them,

112
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,280
I will succeed very soon.

113
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,960
Others

114
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,590
are nothing to be afraid of.

115
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,290
My wife is really resourceful.

116
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:45,860
You raised so many provisions

117
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,280
in such a short time,

118
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,610
and you sent them to the front line continuously

119
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,340
so that everything is in order.

120
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,330
How many women like you

121
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,659
are there in this world?

122
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,810
No wonder you are titled Miss Shiyu.

123
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,890
By the way,

124
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,180
the title of Miss Shiyu was bestowed

125
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,210
by His Majesty.

126
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,210
Do you know what it means?

127
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,790
Do you remember

128
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,060
my first birthday in Eastern Capital?

129
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,610
His Majesty bestowed the style name "Chengjue" on me.

130
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,810
So, in His Majesty's eyes,

131
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,420
you and I are both

132
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,280
raw jades that need to be refined.

133
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,150
"Jue" means a pair of jades.

134
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,000
You and I are a couple

135
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,049
with shared values and beliefs.

136
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,830
Without you,

137
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,440
I wouldn't be

138
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,809
the Gu Jiusi I am now.

139
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,010
Me too.

140
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,200
Without you,

141
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,920
I wouldn't be the Liu Yuru I am now.

142
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,170
Father.

143
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,400
Father.

144
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,940
We've got military provisions.

145
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,680
It arrived?

146
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,330
Yes.

147
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,770
It's Jiusi and Yuru who dodged

148
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,640
all the passes with the horse gang

149
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,480
and went over mountains

150
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,460
to send a large number of military provisions.

151
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:06,960
Great.

152
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:07,930
Great.

153
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,330
Gu Jiusi

154
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,610
didn't let me down.

155
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,780
Pass my order.

156
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,780
In three days,

157
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,970
we'll have a fight to the death with the Nanzhao Army.

158
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,900
We won't return until we defeat the enemy.

159
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,570
Yes!

160
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,900
Your Majesty.

161
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,060
Have you read the report?

162
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,520
Report?

163
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,540
Zhou Gaolang achieved great victory in the southwest.

164
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,260
The border issue of Nanzhao has been resolved.

165
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,160
His troop

166
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,500
will return to the capital soon.

167
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,610
He won?

168
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,670
He's returning?

169
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,290
The longer Zhou Gaolang and his Youzhou Army

170
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,010
exist,

171
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,540
the greater the threat it poses to you, Your Majesty.

172
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,340
I have told you

173
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,510
about this long ago, Your Majesty.

174
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,490
But

175
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,930
Uncle Zhou watched me grow up.

176
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,210
He's like my family.

177
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
When I was little,

178
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,940
he was the one who took me to ride horses

179
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,200
and taught me hunting.

180
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,530
You always say

181
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,350
he'd take my throne.

182
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,320
But he won such a difficult battle

183
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,830
against Nanzhao for me.

184
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,160
I don't think

185
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,040
he seems disloyal

186
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,120
to me.

187
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,240
Family?

188
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,340
Not to mention you are not blood-related,

189
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,740
but even if you are blood-related, so what?

190
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,940
Since ancient times,

191
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,900
when the royal family fights for the throne,

192
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,290
even father and son, or brothers,

193
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,560
would turn against each other.

194
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,160
Besides,

195
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,060
Your Majesty,

196
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,500
have you forgotten about

197
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,900
the late emperor's will?

198
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,740
You may leave.

199
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,980
Let me think about it.

200
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,780
Your Majesty!

201
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,620
This is a serious matter.

202
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,720
You can't take any chances.

203
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,820
You need to make plans beforehand.

204
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,220
There can't be any delay.

205
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,730
Grand Tutor.

206
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,000
Are you telling me what to do?

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,560
I'm

208
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,200
just sharing your burden, Your Majesty.

209
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,060
What do you want me to do exactly?

210
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,540
You asked me to fake Father's will

211
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,620
and send them to Nanzhao to fight a suicide battle.

212
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,620
I listened to you.

213
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,630
But they didn't die in Nanzhao.

214
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,180
Now they are returning to the capital after winning the battle.

215
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,440
How can I stop them now?

216
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,100
Your Majesty may not be able to stop them,

217
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,450
but God can.

218
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,510
What do you mean?

219
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
On Zhou Gaolang's army's way back to the capital,

220
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,360
they'll have to pass Black River Valley.

221
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,550
That valley has a mysterious terrain.

222
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
Above the valley,

223
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,050
there's a century-old Yongshui Lake.

224
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,120
You mean...

225
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,620
If when Zhou Gaolang and his troop

226
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,640
pass there,

227
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,220
and Yongshui Lake happens to burst its banks...

228
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,020
Your Majesty,

229
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,890
you can rest easy

230
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,680
on the throne.

231
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,930
There'll be no future troubles.

232
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,850
You want me

233
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,260
to issue an order to kill the entire army?

234
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,410
What if it gets out?

235
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,990
What if people find out?

236
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,830
In the future history book,

237
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,420
I will be

238
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,150
the most fatuous emperor ever.

239
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,040
After I die,

240
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,210
how can I

241
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,240
face Father in the underworld?

242
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,040
Your Majesty.

243
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,950
Those who achieve great things

244
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,640
don't care about trifles.

245
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,930
Enough!

246
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,600
Shut up!

247
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,200
Grand Tutor Luo.

248
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,070
You're Grand Tutor,

249
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,310
but I'm no longer Crown Prince.

250
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,460
I don't need to listen to every word you say.

251
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,080
Get out!

252
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,880
I said get out!

253
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,880
[All-embracing Walls for Worldly Matters]

254
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,570
My dear.

255
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,260
What do you think?

256
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:27,930
If...

257
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,960
If Zhou Gaolang

258
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,900
really defeated Nanzhao

259
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,590
and returns to the capital,

260
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,450
by then,

261
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,310
what should

262
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,760
I do?

263
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,170
By then,

264
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,940
I should be congratulating Your Majesty

265
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,000
on achieving unprecedented merits.

266
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,580
Zhou Gaolang is Your Majesty's official.

267
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,820
It's Your Majesty who knows well about his abilities

268
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,550
and sent him to conquer Nanzhao

269
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,480
to expand Da Xia's territory.

270
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,200
It's just that on the surface,

271
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
the credit goes to the late emperor.

272
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,330
What you said

273
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,320
makes great sense.

274
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,390
Your Majesty, you just ascended the throne a few months ago,

275
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,530
and Da Xia has been

276
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,220
prosperous and the people have been living in peace.

277
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,350
Now, you even resolved the border issue in the southwest

278
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,590
and reclaimed the lost territory.

279
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,170
It shows that

280
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
Your Majesty is powerful and smart.

281
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,690
You are no doubt

282
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,680
a great emperor that will go down in history.

283
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,080
But...

284
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,800
If Uncle Zhou

285
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,520
knows some day that

286
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,500
it wasn't Father's will

287
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,510
to send him to conquer Nanzhao,

288
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,690
this

289
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,370
is still a threat to me.

290
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:02,840
You know.

291
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,410
I don't want to kill my uncle

292
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,200
who watched me grow up.

293
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,460
And I certainly don't want to take so many people's lives.

294
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,320
But I'm scared.

295
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,170
My dear.

296
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,360
I'm in such a dilemma.

297
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,530
How can a dying wolf

298
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,770
compete with

299
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,100
the new wolf king that is young and strong?

300
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,240
You are in the flower of your youth, Your Majesty.

301
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,440
You are in your prime.

302
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,490
Zhou Gaolang is already old.

303
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,010
He's been sleeping rough

304
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,620
in the woods in the southwest.

305
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,900
Even though he was lucky enough to win the battle,

306
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,840
he won't live long.

307
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,270
You don't have to get your hands dirty, Your Majesty.

308
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,650
You are right, my dear.

309
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,750
It's Grand Tutor who worries too much.

310
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,410
Report!

311
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,210
General Qin.

312
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,470
Someone sent a letter.

313
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,720
[To Wanzhi. I know you're busy in the army. I shouldn't disturb you, but I have something important to discuss with you. May I invite you to the Zhou Mansion tonight?]

314
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,840
Mrs. Zhou, you invited me here.

315
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,620
Is there something you need my help with?

316
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,300
I brought some bodyguards

317
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,410
who are waiting outside the courtyard.

318
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,380
We're at your disposal.

319
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,690
Early this morning,

320
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,480
I received a family letter

321
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,690
from Nanzhao.

322
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,520
I heard the news too.

323
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,970
Are they on their way back?

324
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,440
Yes, they've set off.

325
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,520
There's another thing in the letter.

326
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,930
General

327
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,700
wants me to

328
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,230
prepare in advance at home.

329
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,000
Once they are back,

330
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,580
the Zhou family

331
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,860
will propose marriage to the girl Ye likes

332
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,010
on behalf of him.

333
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,890
Therefore,

334
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,650
I want to ask you in advance

335
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,240
about how you feel about Ye, General Qin.

336
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,840
I should be talking

337
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,730
with your family

338
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,120
about this.

339
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,220
But your parents are not in Eastern Capital.

340
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,740
I'm worried that this may be Ye's wishful thinking.

341
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,140
I don't want to catch you off guard, General.

342
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,850
So...

343
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,839
He and I are both soldiers.

344
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,640
There's nothing to be shy about.

345
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,490
It's just

346
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,040
I still

347
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,180
want to wait for him

348
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,040
to ask me this question in person.

349
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,140
I don't want others to ask on behalf of him.

350
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,890
Great.

351
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,609
I know what you mean.

352
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,880
When he comes back,

353
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,480
I'll let him ask you himself.

354
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,600
Master.

355
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,540
No news from His Majesty yet.

356
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,200
We...

357
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,000
Who said that?

358
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,090
Hasn't His Majesty

359
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,490
already issued an edict?

360
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,780
Zhou Gaolang maintained an army and defied orders from the government.

361
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,780
He colluded with the enemy and is guilty of treason.

362
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,180
As for his father's, mother's, and wife's family,

363
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,710
they shall all be executed.

364
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,720
Come on, let's drink.

365
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,520
[Zhou]

366
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,140
Eldest brother. Second brother.

367
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,540
We can have a blast today.

368
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,170
Yes.

369
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,760
Third brother.

370
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,930
Don't let Miss Qin

371
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,390
wait any longer this time.

372
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,340
Eldest brother is right.

373
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,050
General Qin.

374
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,000
The Zhou family colluded with the enemy, and is guilty of treason.

375
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,440
His Majesty issued a decree to execute them.

376
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,490
It has nothing to do with others.

377
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,550
Please step aside.

378
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,630
The whole Zhou family is loyal.

379
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,490
How dare you rats slander them?

380
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,270
We are following the order.

381
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,680
If you refute the order,

382
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,140
then you are the Zhou family's confederate.

383
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,210
As long as I'm here,

384
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,000
no one

385
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,050
can hurt the Zhou family.

386
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,530
I'm sorry then.

387
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,250
What are you

388
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,650
fellas murmuring about?

389
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,160
Father.

390
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,500
My younger brother has been keeping something

391
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,890
from you.

392
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,040
Father.

393
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,940
My two older brothers are making fun of me.

394
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,540
Don't talk about personal matters in the army.

395
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,970
Come on.

396
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:00,810
What are you keeping from me?

397
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,640
Tell me.

398
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,940
Don't make it about me.

399
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,000
You guys drink too.

400
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,370
Our troop will return to the capital tomorrow.

401
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,570
Tell Father already.

402
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,440
That's right.

403
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,570
Tell him.

404
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,020
What are you waiting for?

405
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,450
Hurry.

406
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,330
Hurry up.

407
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,440
Okay.

408
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,360
I'll say it.

409
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,240
Father.

410
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,370
I insist

411
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,060
on marrying Qin Wanzhi.

412
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,200
I hope you can approve it, Father.

413
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,200
Please take care of my family.

414
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,590
Come here. Sit down.

415
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,220
Sit down.

416
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,530
Good for you.

417
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,480
This is great news.

418
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,090
Listen.

419
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,850
If you can bring home

420
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,010
such a good

421
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,090
daughter-in-law,

422
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,360
how can I say no?

423
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,860
I'm just worried that she won't be willing to marry you.

424
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,060
How is that possible?

425
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,940
We already...

426
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,500
Thank you, Father.

427
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,330
Good boy.

428
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:04,890
Come on.

429
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:05,580
Let's drink.

430
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,120
Come on.

431
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,000
Cheers.

432
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,770
♫Lamenting how lonely, withered and ravaged the world is♫

433
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,420
♫Asking Heaven about life and death, hesitation and desperation♫

434
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,890
♫Wind and snow crumpled the starlight♫

435
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,940
♫Shadows of the crescent moon were blown away♫

436
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,150
♫Watching the setting sun shining on the earth. What a dreary sight♫

437
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,760
♫Crying about how checkered and desolated the souls are♫

438
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,700
♫The hubris of the youth♫

439
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,920
♫Can't let go of a soldier's responsibility♫

♫No reason can be explained♫

Wanzhi.

I'll say

♫When I look back♫

446
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:18,500
♫I can't see through the vanity of the world♫

♫Watching the flowers bloom and wither. I can't escape from the void of life♫

449
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,960

♫I remember how the stars shined for us when we met♫

My Lord.

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,600
Hurry!

458
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,820
Inform Jiusi.

459
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:06,810
Yes.

460
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:11,970
It was you.

461
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,620
It was you who issued the order

462
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,420
to execute Uncle Zhou's family!

463
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,560
It was not my order,

464
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,650
but yours, Your Majesty.

465
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,720
I didn't.

466
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,170
I didn't!

467
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,750
I never wanted to kill them.

468
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,940
Aunt Zhou held me in her arms when I was little.

469
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,800
Mrs. Zhou

470
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,930
made delicious leaf-wrapped rice cakes

471
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,080
for me.

472
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,050
It was you.

473
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,520
You faked the imperial edict.

474
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,550
Luo Zishang,

475
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,200
I will kill you

476
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,820
to avenge the deaths of the Zhou family!

477
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,620
Of course you can kill me, Your Majesty.

478
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,610
But after killing me,

479
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,250
who you'll face

480
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,910
is Zhou Gaolang, who controls

481
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,730
the army of 300,000 soldiers of Da Xia,

482
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,160
longing for revenge.

483
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,130
I think Your Majesty

484
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,450
must be ready

485
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,570
to hand

486
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,220
the country and your life

487
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,800
over to your Uncle Zhou.

488
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,400
You set me up.

489
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,820
You pushed me

490
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,970
into this corner.

491
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,730
I won't listen to you.

492
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,930
I won't listen to you.

493
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,920
I will explain everything

494
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,620
and confess everything to Uncle Zhou.

495
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,280
Will Zhou Gaolang believe it?

496
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,360
Also,

497
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,690
even cutting off the military provisions for the front line

498
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,170
was Your Majesty's idea

499
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,500
in Zhou Gaolang's view.

500
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,800
But you are the one who did it.

501
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,460
But Your Majesty acquiesced.

502
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,600
Also,

503
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,740
don't forget that

504
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,360
even the pacification itself

505
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,820
was also Your Majesty's order.

506
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,680
You faked the late emperor's will

507
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,560
and forced him to fight a suicide battle.

508
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,420
Your Majesty.

509
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,930
There's no turning back.

510
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,000
I guess

511
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,410
I don't have to

512
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,300
tell you what you should do

513
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,920
and say in court tomorrow, right?

514
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,020
Your Majesty.

515
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,150
Was it Your Majesty's order

516
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,240
to execute the whole Zhou family?

517
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,540
Your Majesty!

518
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,930
Your Majesty!

519
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,760
We

520
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,100
implore Your Majesty to answer.

521
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,210
Minister Ye.

522
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,930
How dare you encroach like this?

523
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,360
Are you leading the officials

524
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,780
to press His Majesty?

525
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,620
Your Majesty.

526
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,770
General Zhou

527
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,380
has been loyal and discreet his whole life.

528
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,010
He devoted himself to Da Xia.

529
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,970
If he had any disloyal intention,

530
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,250
he would have

531
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,490
ascended the throne

532
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,740
after the battle against Lord Liang to save the late emperor.

533
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,000
But he still chose

534
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,100
to be a local general for the late emperor.

535
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,680
Also,

536
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,260
when Your Majesty recklessly issued the order

537
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,530
to conquer Nanzhao,

538
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,860
General Zhou and his sons

539
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,130
could have refuted the order.

540
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,450
But they still chose to

541
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,710
garrison the frontier

542
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,180
and attack the enemies together.

543
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,300
They've been working for the army their whole life.

544
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,230
And they are the pillar of the army.

545
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,360
Without them,

546
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,300
how could Your Majesty, we officials,

547
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,090
and the people of Da Xia

548
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,480
live in peace?

549
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,980
The letters of General Zhou and his sons colluding with the enemy

550
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,720
have been found.

551
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,290
Minister Ye.

552
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,060
How dare you speak in the rebel's favor?

553
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,250
Are you

554
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,000
one of the rebels, too?

555
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,400
General Zhou and his sons are not rebels!

556
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,740
This is obviously

557
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,100
a false accusation made by the evil.

558
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,700
Executing the Zhou family was His Majesty's order.

559
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,030
Are you questioning His Majesty's order?

560
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,100
Your Majesty.

561
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,280
I know

562
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,490
Your Majesty must have been bewitched

563
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,490
and trapped in the swamp by the evil.

564
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,060
As long as Your Majesty nods

565
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,680
and tells me

566
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,910
that was not Your Majesty's order,

567
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,480
I'm willing to do anything for you.

568
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,060
It's not too late

569
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,370
to be saved!

570
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,320
Enough!

571
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,000
That was my order.

572
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,330
This...

573
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,680
Listen carefully.

574
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,920
This is my throne,

575
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,160
and my country.

576
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,880
No one

577
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,890
can tell me

578
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,480
what to do.

579
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,490
Zhou Gaolang

580
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,080
is suspected of treason.

581
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,200
The evidence is irrefutable.

582
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,520
If anyone dares to say anything more,

583
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,120
I will

584
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,200
purge

585
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,460
all the remnants of the Zhou party

586
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,320
from the court.

587
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:27,840
This...

588
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,450
This...

589
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,360
Stop it.

590
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,640
You...

591
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,090
What are you laughing about?

592
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,600
I was laughing because

593
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,490
you are a stupid coward

594
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,660
who doesn't know good from evil.

595
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,080
What?

596
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,770
Exactly.

597
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,830
How dare he accuse His Majesty?

598
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,990
How dare you!

599
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,730
Rebellion!

600
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,360
This is rebellion!

601
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,050
Arrest him!

602
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,490
This...

603
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,450
The whole Zhou family

604
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,340
was executed,

605
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,470
except the eldest grandson, Zhou Dan,

606
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,810
who was hidden in a dry well by the nanny.

607
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,810
General Qin died in battle to protect the Zhou family.

608
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,110
Ye Shi'an was framed as an accomplice,

609
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,700
and will be executed in ten days.

610
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,610
How could this be?

611
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,180
How soon can we

612
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,260
get back to Eastern Capital?

613
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,220
Five days.

614
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,580
Five days are enough.

615
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,310
We still have time.

616
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,650
You mean...

617
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,260
The whole Zhou family

618
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,660
and General Qin are dead.

619
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,250
We can't let Ye Shi'an die a victim of injustice as well.

620
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,180
Let's go storm the execution site.

621
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,940
Storming the execution site is too risky.

622
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,380
But I must save Ye Shi'an.

623
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,660
I failed to save Wenchang back then.

624
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,600
All these years,

625
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,950
I've been dreaming of that day.

626
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,960
Me too.

627
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,770
I'll go with you.

628
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,740
It's dangerous in Eastern Capital. You don't have to go.

629
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,980
With my ship gang and convoy,

630
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,740
I can help you enter the city in disguise.

631
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,370
Luo Zishang

632
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,580
must be waiting for you to throw yourself into the trap now.

633
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,370
Can you

634
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,910
get past on your own?

635
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,880
Luo Zishang is meticulous.

636
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,810
Your convoy won't get past either.

637
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,950
Don't worry.

638
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,750
I have my way to enter the city.

639
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:18,770
OK.

640
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,190
I'll go downstairs to arrange it.

641
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,200
Yuru.

642
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,100
Go back to Lingnan with Chen Xun

643
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,300
and wait for me there.

644
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,780
Eastern Capital is an extremely dangerous place now.

645
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,620
I don't want anything to happen to you.

646
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,450
Jiusi.

647
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,980
Assisting the emperor to govern Da Xia

648
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,370
is not only your responsibility,

649
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,250
but also mine.

650
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,570
Just like you,

651
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,920
I will do anything

652
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,990
to fulfill His Majesty's will.

653
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,570
Besides,

654
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,650
we have so many

655
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,910
friends we can rely on.

656
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,160
Jiusi.

657
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,520
We finally reunited.

658
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,420
I don't want to leave you again, even for a moment.

659
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,020
As long as we have each other,

660
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,450
we can overcome

661
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,800
any difficulty.

662
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,530
Okay.

663
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,720
Father.

664
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,000
What's your plan

665
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,800
after returning to the capital?

666
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,000
All these years,

667
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,680
I've been thinking about retiring and going back home.

668
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,550
I'll go back to Youzhou.

669
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,720
I can spend

670
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,470
the leisure time with my grandchildren happily.

671
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,840
Unfortunately,

672
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,160
there's no one I can play Go with anymore.

673
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,760
As the saying goes,

674
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,330
it's lonely at the top.

675
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,800
Now that Nanzhao is pacified,

676
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,440
Father, it's time

677
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,280
for you to have a good rest.

678
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,120
Yes.

679
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,290
I've devoted my life to

680
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,420
resolving the external issues for His Majesty

681
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,250
with you three

682
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,920
and the soldiers.

683
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,200
I think

684
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,210
he should have no doubts

685
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,270
about the Zhou family anymore.

686
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,960
Father!

687
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,020
Why are you so flustered?

688
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,720
Father!

689
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,910
[The whole family of Zhou was executed, except the eldest grandson, Zhou Dan, who was hidden in the dry well by the nanny. General Qin died in battle to protect the Zhou family. Ye Shi'an was framed as an accomplice and will be executed in ten days.]

690
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,840
Where did you get this letter?

691
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,570
It must be fake.

692
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,810
This is a message from Baiyujing!

693
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,210
[The whole family of Zhou was executed, except the eldest grandson, Zhou Dan, who was hidden in the dry well by the nanny. General Qin died in battle to protect the Zhou family. Ye Shi'an was framed as an accomplice and will be executed in ten days.]

694
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,250
Why...

695
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,160
This can't be true.

696
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,240
This can't be true!

697
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,880
Why!

698
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,480
A few days ago,

699
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,410
I had a dream.

700
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,670
I dreamed that our whole family

701
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,000
is back in Youzhou.

702
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,580
We take care of the farmland

703
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,120
left by my grandfather.

704
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,980
We plant and harvest, and live a peaceful life.

705
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,410
We don't care about the rise and fall of the world.

706
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,560
We are so happy.

707
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,250
General.

708
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,760
After you come back from Nanzhao,

709
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,240
you can retire and we can go back home.

710
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:57,890
OK?

711
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,360
Look, your grandchildren

712
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,220
have all grown up.

713
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,219
They already know how to walk and read.

714
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,800
It's time for you to rest

715
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,650
and watch your grandchildren grow up.

716
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,159
Ran'er and Zhuo'er

717
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,739
are both married and already have children.

718
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,130
Only Ye is still single.

719
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,380
It's time for us

720
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,040
to arrange a marriage for him.

721
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,170
It's time

722
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,000
for our family to have a wedding.

723
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,440
Right?

724
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,210
Yes.

725
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:40,880
My Lady.

726
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:41,980
I promise you.

727
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,530
I'll retire

728
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:46,620
after coming back from Nanzhao this time.

729
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,409
Our family

730
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,360
will live a peaceful life.

731
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,540
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

732
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,730
Seek justice

733
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,370
from Fan Yu's stupid son!

734
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,340
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

735
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,660
Seek justice!

736
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,010
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

737
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,340
Seek justice!

738
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,610
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

739
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,940
Seek justice!

740
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,260
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

741
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,570
Seek justice!

742
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,860
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

743
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,330
Seek justice!

744
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,700
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

745
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,090
Seek justice!

746
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,460
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

747
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,780
Seek justice!

748
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,980
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

749
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,220
Seek justice!

750
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,380
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

751
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,580
Seek justice!

752
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,690
Fight our way back to Eastern Capital!

753
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,050
Seek justice!

754
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,520
Still no news

755
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,890
of Gu Jiusi?

756
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:29,980
I've ordered our people

757
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,570
to guard all the gates of Eastern Capital.

758
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,460
Everyone coming in and going out,

759
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,170
no matter they are commoners,

760
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,460
officials' families or merchants,

761
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,920
will be strictly checked.

762
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,240
No news of Gu Jiusi yet.

763
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,020
Keep investigating.

764
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,700
Get the word of

765
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,700
Ye Shi'an's execution out.

766
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,630
Gu Jiusi will come back overnight.

767
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,130
Yes.

768
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,260
As for the imperial prison,

769
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,860
go check the security again.

770
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,170
If Gu Jiusi dares to break into the prison,

771
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,500
take him down directly.

772
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,630
Understood.

773
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,670
Minister Ye.

774
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,160
It's almost time to go.

775
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,140
You were still an official this morning,

776
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,540
but you are in prison now.

777
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,570
I wonder if you regret

778
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,770
that you acted on impulse, Minister Ye.

779
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,060
Seeking justice is what an upright man should do.

780
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,120
I have no regrets.

781
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,940
Minister Ye, you are very talented.

782
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,730
If you can work for my master,

783
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,060
I'm sure you'll achieve something great.

784
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,890
What a pity.

785
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,720
Mingyi.

786
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,960
You are smart and capable,

787
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,170
but you became

788
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,900
Luo Zishang's right-hand man.

789
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,140
Not only is your ability unrecognized, you also abet the evildoer

790
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,480
and work for the rebel.

791
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,330
Isn't it a pity?

792
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,010
I don't care if my master

793
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,650
is a tyrant or a rebel.

794
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,640
He has my life.

795
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,410
Master is a poor man.

796
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,200
So am I.

797
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,220
He just wants the world

798
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,680
to return what it owes him.

799
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,610
And I'm all alone.

800
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,370
As long as his wish is fulfilled,

801
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,480
I'll be satisfied.

802
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,300
I don't care

803
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,210
even if I have to go to hell together with him.

804
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,770
Did you say this much to me

805
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,720
because I'm about to die?

806
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,200
Maybe.

807
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,120
You're truly a loyal servant.

808
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,780
It's just your loyalty is dedicated to the wrong person.

809
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
Is there anything else

810
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,380
you want to say, Minister Ye?

811
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,130
I do have a request.

812
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,040
After I die,

813
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,700
can you cremate my body

814
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,160
and leave nothing behind?

815
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,900
Also, I don't want a tombstone or inscription.

816
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,410
This way,

817
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,200
my sister

818
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,160
won't have to think about

819
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,340
coming back from Xihuang

820
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,270
to collect my body.

821
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,260
She won't have to mourn in front of my grave as well.

822
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,800
Okay.

823
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,200
I'll do my best.

824
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,880
Master, a secret letter from the southwest.

825
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,140
[The Youzhou Army led by Zhou Gaolang passed Black River Valley. There happened to be a landslide since Yongshui Lake bursted its banks. The entire army has been annihilated.]

826
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,120
Good.

827
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,680
This day

828
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
has finally come.

829
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,360
Grand Tutor.

830
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,180
You rarely come here now.

831
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,170
What?

832
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,660
Are you here to urge me to go to court,

833
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,830
or urge me to review the memorials?

834
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,800
My dear.

835
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,050
What time is it now?

836
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,060
I'm here to report to Your Highness that

837
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
the Youzhou Army led by Zhou Gaolang

838
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,990
passed Black River Valley.

839
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,100
They happened to encounter Yongshui Lake bursting its banks.

840
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,230
The entire army has been annihilated.

841
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,760
The Youzhou Army

842
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,160
was annihilated?

843
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,000
Zhou Gaolang is finally dead.

844
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,650
No one in this world

845
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,120
can tell me what to do!

846
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,480
No one cares about me anymore.

847
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:11,970
Uncle Zhou.

848
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,240
I...

849
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,800
The only family I got

850
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,520
is gone.

851
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,640
He's gone.

852
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,180
Your Majesty, you are drunk.

853
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,530
Guards!
