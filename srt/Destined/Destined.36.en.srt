[Episode 36]

4
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,440
There's something

5
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,420
I haven't told you

6
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,630
for all these years.

7
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,509
Gu Jiusi

8
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,940
is my husband.

9
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,039
Of course I'm proud of him.

10
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,060
One more thing.

11
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,950
My real name

12
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,260
is Liu Yuru.

13
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,590
From now on,

14
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,660
you can also call me Boss Liu.

15
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,470
Why are you crying?

16
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,480
Wipe the tears.

17
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,560
I'm so excited.

18
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,320
The dam is finally completed.

19
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,579
Our three years of hard work

20
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,640
didn't go to waste.

21
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,750
Yes.

22
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,579
The people on both sides of the Yellow River

23
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,910
don't have to be afraid of floods anymore.

24
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,220
But it's strange.

25
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,230
Now the day has come,

26
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,660
yet I feel very calm.

27
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,980
Young Master.

28
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,820
There will be a celebration party

29
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,950
in the city tonight.

30
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,420
Everyone is waiting for you.

31
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,300
Aren't you going?

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,960
No, I'm not.

33
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,420
Tomorrow morning,

34
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,550
we have to depart for Eastern Capital.

35
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,260
I'll go pack up first.

36
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,230
Oh yeah.

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,150
Here is an invitation card.

38
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,920
What invitation card?

39
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,950
Miss Shiyu said

40
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,890
she'd hold a banquet tonight

41
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,260
and wanted to invite you to go alone.

42
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,220
She said she wanted to

43
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,130
take you to meet an important person.

44
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,140
An important person?

45
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,670
Who is it?

46
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,900
I have no idea.

47
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,690
It's not mentioned in the invitation card.

48
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,440
No matter who it is,

49
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,880
since Miss Shiyu sent me an invitation,

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,670
I must go.

51
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:28,990
Without her,

52
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,340
we couldn't have completed the dam.

53
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,390
Greetings, Miss Shiyu.

54
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,150
Thank you so much

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,680
for your kind invitation.

56
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,520
Supervisor Gu.

57
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,940
Please wait for a moment.

58
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,740
She's dressing up.

59
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,870
She'll be here soon.

60
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,940
Do you want me

61
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,110
to meet someone?

62
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,630
Here's the thing.

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,750
I have a niece.

64
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,800
She's young and beautiful

65
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,070
and she has admired you for a long time.

66
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,390
Miss Shiyu,

67
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,660
I'm already married.

68
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,430
But didn't your wife

69
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,250
die

70
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,670
three years ago?

71
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,910
With her no longer around,

72
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,580
are you not going to marry someone else?

73
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,880
Only my late wife is

74
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,710
the love of my life.

75
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,940
She is my wife,

76
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,620
always

77
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,030
and forever.

78
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,909
Please forgive me

79
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,100
for offending your niece today.

80
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,870
I will

81
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,520
visit you another day.

82
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,420
Hold on.

83
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,190
She has a token for you.

84
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,990
It won't be too late to leave after you've seen it.

♫ You still look like the first time I saw you after the long journey♫

90

♫ The horses are running fast and the willows are blooming, and you turn back ♫

91
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,770
♫ Thousands of people are surprised ♫

92
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,710
♫ How many people have sunk in the mud? ♫

93
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,850
♫ Or survive the flames ♫

94
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:03,740
♫ And how many are trapped by fame? ♫

95
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,270
♫ I only wish you ♫

96

♫ The blood is still hot ♫

103
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,900
Unexpectedly, so many things

104
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,760
happened in the past three years.

105
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,460
You devoted yourself to the regulation of the Yellow River

106
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
and were so single-minded.

107
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:42,270
♫ May you still be a young man ♫

108
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,640
Of course you don't know this.

109
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,510
Liu Yuru.

110
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,210
It turns out that you are

111
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,580
the real Miss Shiyu.

112
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,900
Those pastries

113
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,580
and the familiar fragrance of rouge

114
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,100
and

115
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,340
the cotton-padded clothes which were sent to be mended

116
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,800
were actually made by you.

117
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,220
For the past three years,

118
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,230
you have suffered a lot.

119
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,340
I'm fine.

120
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,660
Because I knew

121
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,740
we'd meet again one day.

122
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,030
When I have hope,

123
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,830
I don't feel bitter.

124
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,900
Jiusi.

125
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,380
You're the one

126
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,790
who has been suffering.

127
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,540
I always thought that

128
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,230
time would wash away all the pain.

129
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,390
But I was wrong.

130
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,730
So I spent all my time

131
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,500
and energy

132
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,190
on the regulation of the Yellow River.

133
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,700
Because only in this way

134
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,580
I could try not to miss you.

135
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,030
If you didn't come back,

136
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,670
I really wouldn't know

137
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,130
how to live

138
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,190
the rest of my life.

139
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,430
Jiusi.

140
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,110
I'm back.

141
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,420
Yes.

142
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,510
You're back.

143
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,940
It seems that

144
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,750
I am still lucky.

145
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,300
By the way,

146
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,160
the evidence of

147
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,940
Luo Zishang committing numerous murder cases in Yangzhou

148
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,270
in the past three years,

149
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,210
have been collected by me

150
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,740
under His Majesty's order.

151
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,980
When we return to Eastern Capital,

152
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,310
we will get even with him

153
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,940
for all that happened recently and in the past

154
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,200
in front of His Majesty

155
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,340
and let the evil pay the price

156
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,500
so that we can avenge the deaths of our families

157
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,420
and friends.

158
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,030
We can finally see

159
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,220
a peaceful Da Xia.

160
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,980
The darker and more dangerous

161
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,220
the past is,

162
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,900
the brighter and more brilliant

163
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,350
the future will be.

164
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,230
Jiusi.

165
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,350
Everything is fine now.

166
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:37,820
I didn't expect

167
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,750
His Majesty to arrange all of this.

168
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,780
Deep down,

169
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,510
I've hated him for three years.

170
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,830
Even when I left,

171
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,020
I didn't meet him once

172
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,940
or write him a letter.

173
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,680
His Majesty didn't blame you.

174
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,660
His Majesty even asked me

175
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,190
to deliver a message to you.

176
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,070
He said

177
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,220
when he was young,

178
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,740
just like us,

179
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,620
he didn't understand why there were so many restrictions.

180
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,380
Later, he gradually understood

181
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,110
so he could only use his old body

182
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,100
to pave the way

183
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,430
so that young people like us

184
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,230
can walk on it with dignity.

185
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,510
The future of Da Xia

186
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,900
will eventually

187
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,430
belong to us, young people.

188
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,660
Yuru.

189
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,180
I want to go back to Eastern Capital.

190
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,480
I think His Majesty

191
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,900
misses you too.

192
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,980
Didn't you always want

193
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,020
Gu Jiusi to die?

194
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,670
Yes, I did.

195
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,620
But when her body was buried

196
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,140
three years ago,

197
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,620
I would like him to live a little longer.

198
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,020
You mean...

199
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,030
Back then,

200
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,180
it was my set-up

201
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,380
that led to her being implicated and having to drink the poisonous wine.

202
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,390
I thought

203
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,980
I would never

204
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,110
have any pity on her.

205
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,380
But after she died,

206
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,110
I realized that

207
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,190
every day

208
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,350
I feel like I'm living in an ice cellar.

209
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,860
Every morning when I wake up,

210
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,540
the first thing I think of

211
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,530
is that Liu Yuru

212
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,530
doesn't exist in the world anymore.

213
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,260
How can I suffer

214
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,860
the pain alone?

215
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,550
I want Gu Jiusi to live

216
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,020
until I succeed.

217
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,220
I want to witness him

218
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,170
lose everything

219
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,390
like a stray dog.

220
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,470
It's a pity

221
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,430
for him to die now.

222
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,290
Master,

223
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,260
we have found something about Miss Shiyu.

224
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,790
Go ahead.

225
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,740
That old woman is just a substitute.

226
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,800
The real Miss Shiyu

227
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,950
is a young girl.

228
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,380
She's from Yangzhou.

229
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,310
Besides,

230
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,910
as Master expected,

231
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
Baiyujing is now under her control.

232
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,460
Could it be...

233
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,230
No.

234
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,740
That's impossible.

235
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,740
One more thing.

236
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,380
A few days ago, you ordered someone

237
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,240
to dig Liu Yuru's grave secretly.

238
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,780
The coffin was empty.

239
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,230
By God's will,

240
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,950
the Emperor said,

241
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,510
"Gu Jiusi from Yongzhou's Directorate of Waterways

242
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,980
devoted himself to the regulation of the Yellow River

243
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,640
and made great achievements.

244
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,590
I

245
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,500
would like to commend him for that.

246
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,820
His virtue has been appreciated

247
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,290
and his talent has been valued.

248
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,860
To show the virtue and the grace of the Emperor

249
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,520
and for the sake of the people,

250
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,580
now,

251
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,380
he shall be conferred as Grand Councilor of the Left

252
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,860
to help the Emperor

253
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,340
lead the officials.

254
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,620
Hope he can

255
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,300
be cautious and disciplined

256
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,810
while assisting the Emperor
wholeheartedly.

257
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,220
Don't he ever slack off.

258
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,540
Miss Shiyu,

259
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,270
who is a merchant from Lingnan,

260
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,990
is generous

261
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,190
and has made great contributions.

262
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,820
I

263
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,260
will now bestow her a death-exemption plate.

264
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,580
It can be passed down from generation to generation.

265
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,860
That's all."

266
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

267
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,140
Grand Councilor Gu,

268
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,340
please return to the capital as soon as possible to take up the new post.

269
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,940
Thank you.

270
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,220
General,

271
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,670
His Majesty is here.

272
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
He came in person.

273
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,420
What brings him here?

274
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,450
Perhaps it's because you're going on an expedition.

275
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,650
He came to see you off.

276
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,430
General,

277
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,270
please go out quickly to meet His Majesty.

278
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,180
No need.

279
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,620
But...

280
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,900
His Majesty is still feeling unwell.

281
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,500
Yet he came here personally.

282
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,700
Greetings,

283
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,180
Your Majesty.

284
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,360
Greetings,

285
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,430
Your Majesty.

286
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,070
It's my duty

287
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,940
to go on an expedition for the Emperor.

288
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,140
Your Majesty, you don't have to condescend to walk me out.

289
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,870
You don't have to be that courteous

290
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,550
in your own house.

291
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,940
Thank you, Your Majesty.

292
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

293
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,390
You may leave first.

294
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,980
I need to talk to him.

295
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,220
Yes.

296
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,550
I

297
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,180
have come in person.

298
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,150
Don't you want to see me?

299
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,070
Gaolang,

300
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,670
now you're going

301
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,990
to a distant place,

302
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,270
I wonder

303
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,830
if we can

304
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,430
meet again.

305
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,990
We are

306
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,140
close like biological brothers, aren't we?

307
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,220
Are you really reluctant

308
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,700
to see me?

309
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Your Majesty and I

310
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,720
are the Emperor and the official.

311
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,350
Your Majesty.

312
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,310
General.

313
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,920
Why are you doing this?

314
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,620
You and His Majesty had such a close relationship.

315
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,190
How did it become like this?

316
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,350
He and I

317
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,500
had been friends for over 30 years.

318
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,220
We had been close for half of our lives.

319
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,470
But five years ago,

320
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,020
after he became the Emperor,

321
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,300
we couldn't go back to the past anymore.

322
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,500
We couldn't go back anymore.

323
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,140
We couldn't go back anymore.

324
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,200
[Changgeng Palace]

325
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,940
Your Majesty.

326
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,230
Slow down.

327
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,860
Your Majesty, are you alright?

328
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,920
Imperial physician! Call the imperial physician!

329
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,980
Your Majesty.

330
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Your Majesty.

331
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,630
You worked so hard a few days ago

332
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,860
and now you're travelling in a bumpy way every day.

333
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,460
How about we rest for two days

334
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,420
after we arrive at the next lay-by

335
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,280
to recuperate?

336
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,100
What are you talking about?

337
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:22,980
Your husband

338
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,500
is in good health.

339
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,180
Now, His Majesty's condition is getting worse.

340
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,460
It'd be good to see him earlier.

341
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,310
I miss him.

342
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,100
The imperial physician said

343
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,780
His Majesty can live on

344
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,300
if he rests well.

345
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,610
Don't worry too much.

346
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,890
I do have a lot

347
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,020
to tell His Majesty.

348
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,540
Munan.

349
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,470
Faster.

350
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,420
Okay.

351
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,150
How is it?

352
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,300
His Majesty has to take care of himself.

353
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,180
If he keeps worrying so much,

354
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,470
his condition will get worse.

355
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,980
His Majesty has something

356
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,110
in his mind,

357
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,940
but there's no one to talk to.

358
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,910
How can he not worry?

359
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,780
You may leave.

360
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,250
Your Majesty,

361
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,580
news from the lay-by outside the city said that

362
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,550
His Highness...

363
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,230
Keep it down.

364
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,760
His Majesty is asleep.

365
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,700
Wait outside.

366
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,590
Is the Crown Prince back?

367
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,780
Your Majesty.

368
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,270
Yes.

369
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,780
The Crown Prince's carriage

370
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,530
has arrived outside the city.

371
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,420
His Highness can meet you

372
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,470
in the evening.

373
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,550
Good.

374
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,510
Good.

375
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,100
Wang Hong.

376
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

377
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,590
Hurry up

378
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,220
and ask the imperial chef

379
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,020
to cook

380
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,780
Yu'er's favourite

381
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,140
roasted lamb

382
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,270
and fish soup,

383
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,830
and make Yu'er's favourite

384
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,460
white sugar cake.

385
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,540
Make more.

386
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,980
Yes.

387
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,020
Your Majesty.

388
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,390
Yu'er is back.

389
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,910
You've grown up.

390
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,700
My child has grown up.

391
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,820
Now you look

392
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,540
a bit heroic,

393
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,340
like your mother.

394
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,340
You're like your mother.

395
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,910
Father has

396
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,710
so much grey hair now.

397
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,840
It's been three years.

398
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,300
I'm sorry for not being able to

399
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,550
accompany you and take care of you.

400
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,590
Every day,

401
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,380
I miss you deeply.

402
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,390
Good boy.

403
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,070
It's good that you're back.

404
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,190
It's good that you're back.

405
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,870
These are your favourite dishes.

406
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,820
Come on.

407
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,790
Have a sugar cake.

408
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,660
Here.

409
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,300
This is your favourite.

410
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,710
Eat more.

411
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,520
Thank you, Father.

412
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,740
I was really worried that

413
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,750
you wouldn't want me

414
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,340
to come to you.

415
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,220
It's a happy occasion today.

416
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,990
Let's not talk about this.

417
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,340
Tell me

418
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,740
what interesting things happened

419
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,100
in Youzhou.

420
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,180
Any changes there?

421
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,750
I

422
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,900
haven't been to Youzhou for five years.

423
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,060
I really miss the place.

424
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,670
I...

425
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,480
don't know.

426
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,600
You don't know?

427
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,600
During my three years in Youzhou,

428
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,030
I kept your words in mind

429
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,860
to restrict myself in the room and reflect on my mistakes.

430
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,060
I studied the classics

431
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,520
and strategies every day,

432
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,970
and I was unaware of what happened outside.

433
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,310
That's why I don't know

434
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,980
what interesting stories

435
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,380
and changes Youzhou has.

436
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,700
Did you really

437
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,990
live in that way in Youzhou?

438
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,580
Of course.

439
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,420
As a son,

440
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,300
I don't want to disappoint you.

441
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,430
As the Crown Prince,

442
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,900
I don't want to let the people of Da Xia down.

443
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,580
Father.

444
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,420
Good.

445
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,940
Good.

446
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,740
If that's the case,

447
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
it's really good.

448
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,300
Dig in.

449
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,460
Did Your Highness really answer like that?

450
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,060
Yes.

451
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,180
After Father listened to my answer,

452
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,780
he said "good" twice in a row.

453
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,700
And he said...

454
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,940
"If that's the case, it's really good."

455
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,700
Didn't I ask someone

456
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,230
to send you a secret letter,

457
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,100
saying when you meet His Majesty,

458
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,690
you should admit that you neglected your studies

459
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,460
in Youzhou

460
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,900
and indulged yourself in drinking and whoring?

461
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,030
How could I admit it?

462
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,220
Father will know about Xifeng sooner or later.

463
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,140
If Father also knows

464
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,270
about other things,

465
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,000
Father will be mad at me

466
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,960
and won't forgive me anymore.

467
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,740
But if you don't do as I say,

468
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,060
he will definitely

469
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,590
consider to dethrone you as the Crown Prince.

470
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,190
You are his only son.

471
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,140
No matter how angry he is,

472
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,170
he won't want to

473
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,820
give the throne to others easily.

474
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,950
If you admitted that

475
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,250
you indulged yourself

476
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,460
in drinking and whoring in Youzhou,

477
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,420
giving yourself up,

478
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,620
he would only think you are honest and trustworthy

479
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,350
and wonder if

480
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,220
the decision

481
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,940
to exile you to Youzhou

482
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
was wrongly made,

483
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,900
if he didn't

484
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,330
fulfil his duty as a father,

485
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:48,960
and furthermore,

486
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,110
he would feel guilty for you.

487
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,830
Once he feels guilty,

488
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,420
he won't listen to any of the criticisms

489
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,790
from others.

490
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,820
Your position as the Crown Prince

491
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,480
will then be as solid as a rock.

492
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,310
Father won't know that.

493
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,340
He won't?

494
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,580
Do you really think your doings in Youzhou

495
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,900
were kept very secret?

496
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,020
How many eyes of the officials

497
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,440
are watching you?

498
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,900
Especially Zhou Gaolang.

499
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,460
He is of great influence in Youzhou.

500
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,390
He must have kept a close eye on you.

501
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,340
Do you think after he's

502
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,260
got a hold over you,

503
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,450
he wouldn't reveal those secrets

504
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,550
to His Majesty?

505
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,590
Even if Father

506
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,670
knows I lied,

507
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,240
he will forgive me.

508
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,900
He won't dethrone me

509
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,460
just because I lied.

510
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,820
No matter how absurd you are in private,

511
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,940
he's at most a father

512
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,340
being angry with his son.

513
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,940
But you lied in front of him

514
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,840
and cheated him on purpose,

515
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,570
it proves that you are disloyal and unfilial,

516
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,170
and you even have no remorse.

517
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,930
Then, the Emperor would be disappointed by

518
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,420
you, his successor,

519
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
the Crown Prince.

520
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,750
If you don't believe me,

521
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,390
why don't you ask him yourself?

522
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,280
No, it can't be.

523
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,080
No, it can't be.

524
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,060
Father won't dethrone me.

525
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:41,940
There's no

526
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,740
such a cruel father in the world.

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,060
You're awake.

578
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,540
Where is

579
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,510
Gu Jiusi now?

580
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,340
He's almost here.

581
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,500
He will arrive in Eastern Capital

582
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,630
in three to five days

583
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,310
to see Your Majesty.

584
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,620
Okay.

585
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,860
Where's Gaolang?

586
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,320
Where is he?

587
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,980
When will he arrive?

588
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,460
I

589
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,140
want to see him again,

590
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,310
talk to him,

591
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,030
and play chess with him.

592
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,700
Just like...

593
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,750
Just like what we did before.

594
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,670
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

595
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,150
The urgent decree to summon General Zhou back

596
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,590
has been sent out that very night.

597
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,470
General Zhou

598
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,030
hasn't gone far yet.

599
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,380
Perhaps

600
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,420
he might be able to come back and see you tomorrow morning.

601
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,070
Good.

602
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,230
Good.

603
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,590
When Gaolang comes back,

604
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,620
you must give him the decree

605
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,660
about transferring the ruler's authority

606
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,550
personally.

607
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,820
Your Majesty.

608
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,700
Isn't Gu Jiusi

609
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,380
arriving soon too?

610
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,550
Jiusi

611
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,150
is reliable and trustworthy.

612
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,710
If the transfer

613
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,270
of the ruler's authority is hindered,

614
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,230
with his help,

615
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,020
I can rest assured.

616
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,300
Yu'er.

617
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,720
They will treat

618
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,270
my Yu'er nicely.

619
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,420
Your Majesty.

620
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,280
The Crown Prince wants to see you.

621
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,310
Reject him.

622
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,350
Yes.

623
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,980
Wait.

624
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,590
Wait for a while.

625
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,780
Let him in.

626
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,239
Yes, Your Majesty.

627
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,219
Summon the Crown Prince.

628
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,020
Yes.

629
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:47,389
Your Majesty

630
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,000
really dotes on the Crown Prince.

631
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,350
I

632
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,500
am seriously ill.

633
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,310
I don't have much time left.

634
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,740
He is no longer

635
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,190
the Crown Prince.

636
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,350
But he is still

637
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,500
my son.

638
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,660
It's my fault

639
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,780
for him to be like this.

640
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,030
Your Majesty.

641
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,190
Yu'er.

642
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,150
Feng'er.

643
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,380
Don't worry.

644
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,230
Father will like you.

645
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,690
[Changgeng Palace]

646
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,280
Your Highness.

647
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,350
His Majesty asked you to go inside.

648
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,140
Feng'er.

649
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,480
Your Highness.

650
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,340
His Majesty didn't allow

651
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,580
others to enter.

652
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,650
Feng'er is not an outsider.

653
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,220
She is the woman I want to marry,

654
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,820
Father's daughter-in-law.

655
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,980
How would Father not

656
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,660
want to see

657
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,780
his daughter-in-law?

658
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,270
Well...

659
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,100
Let's go.

660
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,430
Well...

661
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,680
Your Highness.

662
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,790
[Changgeng Palace]

663
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,550
Greetings, Father.

664
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,630
Yu'er.

665
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,220
Come and sit.

666
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,030
Sit.

667
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,070
Father.

668
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,320
Father, what's wrong?

669
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,020
Yesterday,

670
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,900
weren't you still energetic enough

671
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,750
to have a meal

672
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,430
with me?

673
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,310
Yu'er,

674
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,470
why are you just like your younger self,

675
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,300
always crying

676
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,820
when you're scared?

677
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,020
Stop crying.

678
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,630
People

679
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,950
will die.

680
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,830
Even the Emperor is a human too.

681
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,830
Father,

682
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,500
I have something

683
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,510
that I feel guilty about

684
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,460
and I couldn't sleep well because of it.

685
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,070
So I must tell Father.

686
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,590
Go ahead.

687
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,100
I lied

688
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,100
yesterday.

689
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,280
During my three years in Youzhou,

690
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,300
I've been drinking to drown my sorrows,

691
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,580
and I was always dispirited.

692
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,230
Yesterday,

693
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,500
I lied

694
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,120
because I was concerned about your illness.

695
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,440
Now I realize that I was wrong.

696
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,310
Father.

697
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,230
Father.

698
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,260
Don't be angry.

699
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,630
Your health is more important.

700
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,740
Good.

701
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,740
Good.

702
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,500
Son,

703
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,700
you are willing to tell the truth

704
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,580
so you're a good child.

705
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,900
Also,

706
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,900
I've met a woman

707
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,100
whom I want to marry for sure.

708
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,270
Let me have a look.

709
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:09,910
Feng'er.

710
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,580
Greetings, Your Majesty.

711
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,990
Father.

712
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,670
Xifeng

713
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,350
was a prostitute.

714
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,790
She will be gossiped by others.

715
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,580
I'm

716
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,430
willing to turn against others

717
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,540
to be with her.

718
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,020
Son.

719
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,380
As long as you like it.

720
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,790
I

721
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,460
allow you to do so.

722
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,550
Rise.

723
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,140
Wang Hong.

724
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:03,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

725
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,390
All of you, leave.

726
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,660
I want to talk to Yu'er alone.

727
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

728
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,820
Yu'er, come here.

729
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,430
Yu'er.

730
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,100
I plan to...

731
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,700
give the throne

732
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,150
to Zhou Gaolang.

733
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,300
He is now on his way back.

734
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,140
Yu'er,

735
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,830
Uncle Zhou dotes on you very much.

736
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,950
When you were young,

737
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,310
he taught you archery

738
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,430
and horse riding.

739
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,120
He even hunted wild deer for you to play with.

740
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,300
Do you remember?

741
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,660
Although he is strict with you,

742
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,220
it's for your own good.

743
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,140
When I'm gone,

744
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,950
you must treat Uncle Zhou

745
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,310
the same way you treated me,

746
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,750
okay?

747
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,860
Father.

748
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,940
do you know

749
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,470
what you are talking about?

750
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,540
Yu'er.

751
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,070
Your Uncle Zhou

752
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,640
will take charge of Eastern Capital for you.

753
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,550
Zhou Ran and Zhou Zhuo

754
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
will take charge of Youzhou for you.

755
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,790
Gu Jiusi and Ye Shi'an

756
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,830
will help you manage the internal affairs

757
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,420
so that the country is prosperous and the people are at peace.

758
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,760
I've arranged everything for you

759
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,980
for the time after I leave.

760
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,700
Just be

761
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,710
a rich idler

762
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,230
and live

763
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,870
a peaceful life happily.

764
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,300
Sounds good?

765
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,470
Father.

766
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,900
Let me ask you.

767
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,350
Deep down,

768
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,950
which is more important, me

769
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,860
or the world?

770
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,430
Father,

771
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,270
what's my problem?

772
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,790
Why can't I be the Emperor?

773
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,510
Yu'er,

774
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,110
if you can be like Gu Jiusi,

775
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,970
I will surely...

776
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:39,900
Enough!

777
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,070
Shut up!
