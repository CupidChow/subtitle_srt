[Episode 34]

4
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,780
Fine.

5
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,960
I don't want to hear it either.

6
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,520
Let's just play chess.

7
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,259
Your Majesty.

8
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,710
I don't understand.

9
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,259
This time, the Crown Prince committed a serious crime.

10
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,570
But Your Majesty demoted Gu Jiusi

11
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,670
to Yongzhou.

12
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,560
Gu Jiusi has great talent and potential.

13
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,970
He also has contributed a lot

14
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,380
to Youzhou.

15
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,950
Your Majesty.

16
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,580
Are you not acknowledging this?

17
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,590
Do you think

18
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,620
I don't know that Gu Jiusi

19
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,420
has great talent and potential?

20
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,910
But what we need to control now

21
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,150
is not just Youzhou,

22
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,220
but the whole world.

23
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,540
Moreover,

24
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,350
managing floods

25
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,270
has always been a great merit.

26
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,180
I sent him to Yongzhou as the Directorate of Waterways.

27
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,860
to let him

28
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,350
make some achievements there.

29
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Only in this way

30
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,980
can he convince people

31
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,910
that he can be entrusted with important tasks

32
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,940
when he returns to the court.

33
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,510
That's also a way.

34
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,620
Not only that,

35
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,410
those kids

36
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,810
who are close to Gu Jiusi,

37
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,510
especially Ye Shi'an, Shen Ming,

38
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,350
and your third son,

39
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,940
Zhou Ye,

40
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,260
are all

41
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,950
promising talents.

42
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,260
They have both moral integrity and talent,

43
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,660
and are very passionate.

44
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,060
They'll all be Da Xia's most trustworthy ministers

45
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,310
in the future.

46
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,230
What they lack now

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,550
is just some experience.

48
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,700
So,

49
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,620
the current situation

50
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,560
is not necessarily

51
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,990
bad.

52
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,380
Was this all

53
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,300
part of Your Majesty's plan?

54
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,910
No.

55
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,130
This was just a concept

56
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,150
I had before,

57
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,950
that I didn't discuss with you.

58
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,860
But because the Empress Dowager is domineering

59
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,920
and demanded an explanation from me,

60
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,030
I had no choice

61
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,960
but to strive for the best of both worlds.

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,380
So,

63
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,790
I had to sacrifice Liu Yuru

64
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,580
to appease the Empress Dowager

65
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,990
and protect Gu Jiusi

66
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,750
so that he can stay away from this chaos

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,899
and stay alive.

68
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,260
But Your Majesty,

69
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,030
this huge blunder

70
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,280
was caused by the Crown Prince after all.

71
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,909
In the future, if Gu Jiusi

72
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,620
really becomes a high-ranking official,

73
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,750
is Your Majesty sure

74
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,430
he won't have

75
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,800
a feeling of animosity towards you because of this?

76
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,270
Zhou.

77
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,060
When this kid Gu Jiusi

78
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,110
was in Youzhou,

79
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,060
you should have had gotten to know him well.

80
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,180
He harbors great wisdom.

81
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,530
There's no way

82
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,060
he'd take personal revenge

83
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,200
because of personal grudges.

84
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,670
If not,

85
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,170
I wouldn't have entrusted the court

86
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,150
to him.

87
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,270
About punishing Yu'er,

88
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,740
I also listened to

89
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,900
his suggestion.

90
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,870
Now,

91
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,470
although he resents me,

92
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,270
it doesn't matter.

93
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,380
When I'm gone,

94
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,120
Yu'er will ascend the throne.

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,590
He'll still be by Yu'er's side

96
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,020
as a high-ranking official.

97
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,740
Zhou.

98
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,380
In this life,

99
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,710
the person I trust

100
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,860
and depend on the most

101
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,380
is you.

102
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,390
Other than me,

103
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,980
you're the one

104
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,300
that those kids admire

105
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,230
the most too.

106
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,150
In the future,

107
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,620
if Yu'er is no longer of great use,

108
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,590
I hope

109
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,550
you can replace him

110
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,780
to protect the whole of Da Xia

111
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,310
for a long time.

112
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,940
Your Majesty.

113
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,500
I have absolutely no intention to be disobedient.

114
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,940
Please understand this, Your Majesty.

115

116
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,870
Do you really think

117
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,030
I was testing you?

118
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,060
Right now, in front of you,

119
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,300
it's not the emperor

120
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,470
that's speaking to you,

121
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,310
but your sworn brother,

122
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,070
Fan Xuan.

123
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,430
My days are numbered.

124
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,860
I hope I can just be Fan Xuan...

125
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,860
for the rest of my life.

126

is the Emperor now.

128
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,900
His Majesty and his subjects are different after all.

129
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,830
Hence,

130
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,800
I hope Your Majesty

131
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,040
wouldn't mention that again.

132
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,900
Get up.

Let's play chess.

134
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,980

You're going someplace far away,

138

and you don't know when you can come back.

139
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,860
Are you really not going to say your goodbyes

140

to Madam and Madam Su?

141
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,060
I already

142
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,020
said my goodbyes yesterday.

[Baojin Pavilion]

151
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,570
I told you there's no need to send us off.

152
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,730
You're going someplace far away,

153
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,980
so I must send you off.

154
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,540
Why did you suddenly decide to go to Yongzhou?

155
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,630
I'm worried.

156
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,660
I'm a grown man.

157
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,700
It's the same for me wherever I go.

158
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,430
Don't worry.

159
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,190
I'm mainly worried about Yuru.

160
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,000
She's already weak to begin with,

161
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,610
and Yongzhou has a bad climate.

162
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,540
She'll definitely get sick there.

163
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,500

164
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,070
You have to take good care of her

165
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,060
and bring her back well.

166
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,020
Don't worry.

167
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,660
I'll do

everything I can

169
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,060
to take good care of her.

170
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,190
I won't let her suffer in the least bit.

171
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,630
That's good.

172

That's good.

What time is it?

174
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,430
Why is the weather so bad?

175
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,780

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,730
Her mother-in-law is bedridden from illness,

196
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,510
and her mother went crazy.

197
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,220
Gu Jiusi and Shen Ming

198
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,700
are also busy preparing to leave the capital.

199
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,500
There's so much going on.

200
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,780
I've let them focus on their own business in peace.

201
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,520
As for the funeral,

202
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,180
I took the servants of the Gu family

203
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,670
and held a decent ceremony.

204
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,870
I just wanted Sister Yuru

205
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,800
to leave with dignity.

206
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,470
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,710
You and Yuru

208
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,140
were best friends since childhood.

209
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,980
You must be

210
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,980
at least as sad as me.

211
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,980
But as her brother,

212
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,960
I only cared about my own venting.

213
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,350
I'm fine.

214
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,990
I've already cried.

215
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,100
I still have to get back up

216
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,830
and do

217
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,910
what I have to do.

218
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,260
I used to think you

219
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,360
were a child who couldn't grow up.

220
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,820
Now it seems

221
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,260
you're all grown up.

222
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,500
You're even quite like Yuru.

223
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,020
After going through so many things,

224
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,860
how could I be the same as before?

225
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,670
If Sister Yuru were in my place,

226
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,940
what would she do?

227
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,900
No matter how sad she was,

228
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,270
she would definitely not break down.

229
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,920
She also would definitely

230
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,870
stay composed.

231
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,590
Now,

232
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,470
I have to

233
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,220
protect her loved ones in her stead.

234
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,240
You have to be well too.

235
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,780
Brother.

236
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,010
It's time to take your medicine.

237
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,320
In the past,

238
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,850
I was complacent and thought

239
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,180
you needed protection,

240
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,080
and I worried about this and that for you.

241
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,470
Now it seems

242
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,110
you've already become

243
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,300
a lady of indomitable spirit like Yuru.

244
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,940
Speaking of which,

245
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,030
I have a decision

246
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,150
to tell you.

247
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,950
Grand Tutor.

248
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,650
I followed your instructions

249
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,380
on what to say

250
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,070
and do.

251
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,220
When I went to say goodbye to Father,

252
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,220
I didn't say a word to defend myself.

253
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,660
I just listened to him

254
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,780
and admitted to my mistake

255
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,580
and repented.

256
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,580
And I said common things that a son would to his father,

257
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,510
asking him to take care of himself.

258
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,590
At first,

259
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,640
Father treated me coldly.

260
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:51,900
Later,

261
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,510
he showed some signs of affection.

262
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,060
It seemed like

263
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,330
he wasn't that mad at me anymore.

264
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,780
Nothing can come between

265
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,710
a father and son.

266
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,670
Even if it's for Gu Jiusi,

267
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,940
I doubt His Majesty would be angry at you

268
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,940
for a long time.

269
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,070
From now on,

270
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,620
I'm also no longer your Grand Tutor.

271
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,900
This time, His Majesty greatly blamed me

272
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,360
for not teaching you well.

273
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,060
He has ordered me

274
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,620
to not follow you

275
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,540
to Youzhou.

276
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,250
All the more am I not allowed

277
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,650
to keep in touch with you.

278
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,360
Your Highness, in the future,

279
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
please take care.

280
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,110
I've implicated you.

281
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,070
From now on,

282
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,700
I'll really be alone.

283
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,860
Don't worry, Your Highness.

284
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,830
I

285
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,860
will always be your subject.

286
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,050
I've volunteered to be

287
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,700
demoted to the Ministry of Works

288
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,530
to supervise the renovation of the Yellow River.

289
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,580
When Your Highness ascends the throne,

290
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,640
you'll have less to be worried about.

291
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,150
Grand Tutor.

292
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,300
You'll always be my teacher and friend.

293
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,240
Yun'er.

294
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,510
This time,

295
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,900
I'm going to

296
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,210
the garrison at the frontline of Xiliang in Bingzhou.

297
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,140
Over there, it's so windy that sand and stones are flying,

298
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,270
jackals come and go,

299
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,570
and we often have to go without food and clothing.

300
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,370
It's the toughest place to be at.

301
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,240
Have you really made up your mind?

302
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,820
Yes.

303
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,200
I've learned medicine

304
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,750
from Wanzhi for so long,

305
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,650
and I've learned how to ride

306
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,590
from Yuru.

307
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,180
Now that I think about it,

308
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,150
they're all for today.

309
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,020
Aren't you afraid of hardships?

310
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,340
I'm not.

311
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,590
Because for me,

312
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,190
it's not suffering.

313
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,600
It's a kind of comfort,

314
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,390
and a dream.

315
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,350
Do you know?

316
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,860
Bingzhou

317
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,130
was where my grandmother led troops

318
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,020
and made outstanding military achievements.

319
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,940
That's why I want to go to Bingzhou with you.

320
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,380
I'm going to the frontline

321
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,040
to treat the soldiers' illnesses and injuries.

322
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,820
I'm going everywhere

323
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,190
for Yuru

324
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,670
to see

325
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,830
Da Xia's vast rivers and mountains

326
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,620
and the desert frontier.

327
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,630
Good.

328
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,490
[Jiang Mansion]

329
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,060
Minister Jiang.

330
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,120
Come to think of it,

331
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,310
we were officials in the same court.

332
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,990
Today,

333
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
let's just be colleagues

334
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,540
having a casual chat.

335
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,100
I don't

336
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,260
quite remember the past anymore.

337
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,550
Do you know that

338
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,380
Gu Jiusi highly recommended you to me

339
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,460
to my face?

340
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,250
He said you're a loyal official

341
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,270
of Da Xia.

342
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,630
I know of that.

343
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,349
Then, let me ask you.

344
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,829
Are you?

345
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,339
After today,

346
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,060
I will be loyal to Da Xia

347
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,590
and will do anything

348
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,950
at all costs.

349
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,500
If today,

350
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,540
I'm not dealing with the Crown Prince

351
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,270
but with Gu Jiusi,

352
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,620
your answer

353
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,870
would be different, right?

354
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,580
I only act

355
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,550
to achieve results.

356
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,720
I don't deal with hypotheticals.

357
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,190
Right now, I don't know

358
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,550
whether I should trust you.

359
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,000
I have one definite reason

360
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,460
for Your Majesty

361
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,380
to believe me.

362
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,570
The Crown Prince of the previous dynasty

363
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,910
was killed by me.

364
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,540
When Lord Liang besieged Eastern Capital,

365
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,980
the Crown Prince of the previous dynasty fled hastily.

366
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,820
So I

367
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,500
waited along the route that he has to take,

368
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,900
and sent him to his death.

369
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,460
Why did you...

370
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,530
That person was mean and ungrateful,

371
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,020
jealous of others' virtues and abilities,

372
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,550
and unworthy of the throne.

373
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,820
When Your Majesty missed the opportunity,

374
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,900
you garrisoned Youzhou

375
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,620
without knowing what was going on in the court.

376
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,500
Just because my cousin Jiang Cheng,

377
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
who's upright,

378
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,930
didn't want to be in a clique

379
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,860
with the Crown Prince of the previous dynasty,

380
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,660
he was randomly

381
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,460
charged with a crime and killed,

382
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,400
and his body was tossed into a mass grave.

383
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,860
The Crown Prince of the previous dynasty

384
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,140
deserved it.

385
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,660
Minister Jiang.

386
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,990
Do you know

387
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,180
what kind of crime this is?

388
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,110
Now, Your Majesty

389
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,620
knows my biggest secret.

390
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,980
You can execute me

391
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,990
in the name of treason anytime.

392
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,030
So...

393
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,260
Your Majesty,

394
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,300
are you able to trust me now?

395
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,860
I heard that Minister Jiang

396
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,720
is the best chess player in the world.

397
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,740
Black or white, spring or autumn, accomplishing your tasks at ease,

398
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,000
they're in your hands.

399
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,340
Your Majesty is also skilled in this field.

400
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,460
Minister Jiang.

401
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,070
I summoned you here

402
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,790
just to have a chat

403
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,780
casually.

404
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,030
But I never expected

405
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,380
the Empress Dowager

406
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,750
to cause such chaos.

407
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,220
Now,

408
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,510
I have two important things

409
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,790
for you to do.

410
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,720
Awaiting your orders, Your Majesty.

411
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,060
Your Majesty.

412
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,030
Is Jiusi gone?

413
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,900
Yes.

414
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,980
Mr. Gu

415
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,960
had already left the city at dawn.

416
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,860
He won the bet?

417
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,870
It sounds nice,

418
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,790
but doesn't he still need me

419
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,720
to go and settle his debt at Eastern Capital?

420
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,130
By the way,

421
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,780
where is that person?

422
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,800
We've got that person.

423
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,780
The boat can be boarded anytime.

424
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,540
No hurry.

425
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,430
I'll see her off.

426
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,870
Before that,

427
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,840
go and invite Deputy Minister Luo

428
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,300
of the Ministry of Works to the mansion.

429
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:13,990
Yes.

430
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,820
With all due respect,

431
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,380
we are not friends.

432
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,600
After you got out of the Imperial Prison,

433
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,720
why am I the first person to be invited

434
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,660
here?

435
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,460
I've always been

436
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,380
on both sides in court,

437
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,680
never revealing my position easily.

438
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,420
Even when my nephew

439
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,950
Gu Jiusi was demoted

440
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,020
and my niece-in-law Liu Yuru was executed,

441
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,660
I didn't say much.

442
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,260
As you said,

443
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,420
I just got out of the Imperial Prison.

444
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,270
So I should choose the right ally.

445
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,660
Everyone says

446
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,830
Minister Jiang is non-conformist

447
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,700
and unpredictable.

448
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,020
This is the case with the affairs of the court.

449
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,880
But with the affairs of your kins,

450
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,720
could you have really been

451
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,900
this cold?

452
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,840
With your knowledge and experience,

453
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,550
I'm sure you could see through the mysteries.

454
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,260
You and I

455
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,380
are a little alike indeed.

456
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,000
You're exactly like me

457
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,630
when I was young.

458
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,230
Minister Jiang.

459
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,620
Please be frank.

460
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,180
Deputy Minister Luo.

461
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,470
I'm indebted to you.

462
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,980
The

463
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,460
most beautiful woman in Jiangnan in the past,

464
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,430
Luo Yishui,

465
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,240
is your mother, right?

466
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,700
Your mother

467
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,510
is the only woman

468
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,430
I want to marry in my life.

469
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,620
We used to love each other.

470
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,380
But I didn't expect her reputation

471
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,730
to be ruined

472
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,540
by a ruffian.

473
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,910
It's like a needle

474
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,270
that has been piercing my heart

475
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,590
for 20 years.

476
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,910
20 years.

477
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,260
If I could have

478
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,980
put aside my prejudice about family status

479
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
and married your mother at all cost,

480
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,250
I'm afraid things

481
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,340
would be completely different.

482
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,870
That's why

483
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,250
you hate Gu Langhua?

484
00:23:59,250 --> 00:23:59,990
I hate him.

485
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,060
Of course I hate your birth father

486
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,380
who abandoned you.

487
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,620
I hate the man who destroyed Yishui.

488
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,910
I wish he died in the fire.

489
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,740
What a pity.

490
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,980
When I took revenge in Yangzhou,

491
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,060
I let Gu Langhua die

492
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,180
just like that.

493
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,430
It was a quick end for him.

494
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,260
Fortunately, the Gu family

495
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,870
has been destroyed.

496
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,260
They've all either died,

497
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,100
been demoted,

498
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,740
or turned crazy.

499
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,460
It's acceptable

500
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,700
as belated retribution.

501
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,700
That's right.

502
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,600
Gu Jiusi has been demoted.

503
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,480
Liu Yuru has been sentenced to death.

504
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,730
His Majesty has lost his trusted aides.

505
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,660
The Youzhou Sect

506
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,140
has taken a great hit.

507
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,620
Now, the Crown Prince

508
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,190
is going all the way to Youzhou.

509
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,220
But he is the Crown Prince after all.

510
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,470
When they day comes

511
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,690
for him to ascend to the throne,

512
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,660
you would be even more greatly favored

513
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,100
by the Emperor

514
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,430
than when you were the Grand Tutor.

515
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,030
All in all,

516
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,270
I have to say...

517
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,450
Deputy Minister Luo,

518
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,310
you're formidable.

519
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,900
I've just been released from prison.

520
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,020
Whether professionally or personally,

521
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,140
I should have a drink

522
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,380
with you.

523
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,900
It's my honor.

524
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,310
If you were playing this round,

525
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,420
where would you

526
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,430
place your pawn next?

527
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,910
In the court,

528
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,800
the Empress Dowager holds all the power.

529
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,070
All of us officials

530
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,630
must contribute what we can.

531
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,860
Here.

532
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,950
Cheers.

533
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,070
Cheers.

534
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:18,940
Master,

535
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,100
is what Jiang He said true?

536
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,990
It's all in the past.

537
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,240
What if he lied?

538
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,030
He didn't lie.

539
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,780
I've been adept at lying

540
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,580
my whole life.

541
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,280
I'm even better

542
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,180
at seeing through other's lies.

543
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,540
Besides,

544
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,380
the white fox mask

545
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,590
Jiang He mentioned

546
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,150
was an item my mother treasured

547
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,070
and never showed to anyone.

548
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,420
I happened upon it once

549
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,680
and asked her about it.

550
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,030
She only said

551
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,370
it was worn by an old friend when they first met.

552
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,270
Later,

553
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,640
even when she couldn't escape that fire,

554
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,770
she insisted on going back

555
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,900
to retrieve that old, tattered, mask.

556
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,520
Few people in the world

557
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,350
know such a secret.

558
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,980
What Jiang He said

559
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,630
is true.

560
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,820
I see.

561
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,750
Since we share the same interests,

562
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,190
Jiang He

563
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,510
is my best ally.

564
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,590
Uncle?

565
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,430
Where am I?

566
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,040
Jiangling.

567
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
What about Jiusi?

568
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,340
The second year of the Yongkang era of Da Xia,

569
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,940
the 25th day of the 9th month.

570
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,520
Niece-in-law,

571
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,360
remember this day.

572
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,830
This is the day

573
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,510
Liu Yuru was buried.

574
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,670
His Majesty gave me poisoned wine,

575
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,030
but I'm alive.

576
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,950
The poisoned wine was fake?

577
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,710
The poisoned wine was fake.

578
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,750
But Liu Yuru

579
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,260
really died.

580
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,340
When you were buried,

581
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,260
Jiusi

582
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,870
placed it in your hand himself.

583
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,760
[A Godsent Marriage]

584
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,260
When I collected you from the coffin,

585
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,320
I thought about it,

586
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,040
but I still brought it for you.

587
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,230
It's something to remember him by.

588
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,950
Wed as husband and wife.

589
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,870
Love each other without doubt.

590
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,060
We will reunite if I'm alive.

591
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,860
If you die, we will miss each other forever.

592
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,550
Jiusi knows I'm afraid of the dark.

593
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,590
He wants to be with me.

594
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,590
Uncle.

595
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,240
Where's Jiusi?

596
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,620
Uncle.

597
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,740
Where is Jiusi?

598
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,620
He doesn't know I'm still alive?

599
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,150
No one can know

600
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,820
you're still alive

601
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,180
except His Majesty and me.

602
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,510
Including your mother.

603
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
Including Jiusi.

604
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,480
If they really think I'm dead,

605
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,320
they will be heartbroken.

606
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,300
This is the only way

607
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,360
to protect you two.

608
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,270
Gu Jiusi

609
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,540
brandished a blade in the palace

610
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,800
and transgressed against his superior.

611
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,900
It is an unforgivable crime.

612
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,580
His wife, Lady Liu,

613
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,920
died for his crime.

614
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,130
This is the greatest mercy

615
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,660
His Majesty can show to him.

616
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,670
Not only that,

617
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,600
His Majesty has to bear

618
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,910
the censure

619
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,780
from the whole court.

620
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,190
Moreover,

621
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,300
what if someone finds out

622
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,500
Lady Liu didn't die

623
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,910
and is still alive?

624
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,030
So,

625
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,540
Gu Jiusi can only live

626
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,470
if Liu Yuru is really dead.

627
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,070
Uncle,

628
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,740
can't we let just Jiusi

629
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,860
know the truth?

630
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,110
No.

631
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,270
Although Jiusi has left the court,

632
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:01,770
those people

633
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,020
who want to kill him

634
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,620
will be keeping their eyes on him no matter what.

635
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,350
If you show up in front of Jiusi

636
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,900
or let him know the truth,

637
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,020
in the end,

638
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,790
you,

639
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,830
Jiusi,

640
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,900
and even the whole Gu family,

641
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,430
will be in danger.

642
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,990
Uncle,

643
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,980
when can I see him?

644
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,550
You have to wait.

645
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,590
Wait?

646
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,540
Wait for Jiusi

647
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,260
to render prodigiously meritorious service

648
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,140
and become renowned throughout the world.

649
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140
Wait for the court

650
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,340
to purge and right itself

651
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,020
from the control of crafty and evil men.

652
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,260
When that time comes,

653
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,980
Liu Yuru's life

654
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,490
will no longer be something

655
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,090
people can use to frame Jiusi

656
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,310
for scheming against His Majesty.

657
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,400
Do you understand?

658
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,150
Yes.

659
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,700
Take it.

660
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,910
This is from me.

661
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,810
[Baiyujing]

662
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,460
This is from His Majesty.

663
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,030
There will be a boat

664
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,140
to take you to Lingnan later.

665
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,270
There are two boxes of gold on the boat.

666
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,860
When you arrive in Ningzhou,

667
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,260
someone will pick you up.

668
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,020
Your new name

669
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,920
and everything you will do

670
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,430
are in the sachet His Majesty gave you.

671
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,830
His Majesty

672
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,550
wants me to start over?

673
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,900
Not only that.

674
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,830
His Majesty has high hopes for you.

675
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,780
He said

676
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,650
you're the only piece of jade in his heart.

677
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,710
He will wait for you

678
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,520
to refine yourself

679
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,240
before seeing the light of day again.

680
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,270
I am

681
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,350
a piece of jade?

682
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,510
From now on,

683
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,150
you'll have to go on

684
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,540
by yourself.

685
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,490
Check these pillars again.

686
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,740
Make sure they're sturdy.

687
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,940
The stones in front, too.

688
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,600
Clear them.

689
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,100
Otherwise, the carriage can't pass.

690
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,740
Thank you for your work.

691
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,100
Don't worry, Supervisor Gu.

692
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,650
Brother Jiu.

693
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,380
We've got it.

694
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,420
Be careful of falling rocks.

695
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,730
Be careful of falling rocks.

696
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,700
Dinner is ready!

697
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,430
Dinner is ready!

698
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,670
Dinner is ready!

699
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,100
Let's eat first then.

700
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,030
Let's eat first.

701
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,660
Okay.

702
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,220
Come on, guys.

703
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,700
Let's eat.

704
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,500
Let's eat, guys.

705
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,700
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

706
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,810
[Prefect of Yongzhou, Wang Siyuan]

707
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,070
Miss Shiyu is in Xingyang?

708
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,420
Yes,

709
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,440
Your Highness.

710
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,360
She's bought the property

711
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,660
and is ready to open for business.

712
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,620
But I heard

713
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,090
she is

714
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,020
the richest person in the country.

715
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,180
I'm afraid...

716
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,630
she could buy

717
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,470
the whole of Xingyang city.

718
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,389
It's more than that.

719
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,739
Do you know what

720
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,179
"wealth that rivals a kingdom" means?

721
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,460
With her ability,

722
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,300
she can even buy

723
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,429
500 Xinyang cities.

724
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,940
But why would such a rich businessman

725
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,820
come to a poor and remote place

726
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,739
like ours

727
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,260
to open a branch?

728
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,540
Well...

729
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,820
Maybe it's because

730
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,350
the Yellow River dam is about to be completed.

731
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,820
After it's completed, flooding will no longer pose a problem.

732
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,860
Maybe

733
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,960
this place

734
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,020
wouldn't be poor and remote anymore.

735
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,830
You are right.

736
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,630
Speaking of the dam,

737
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,219
according to the report

738
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,100
of the Directorate of Waterways, Gu Jiusi,

739
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,420
the dam can be completed ahead of schedule

740
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,870
at the end of this month.

741
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,110
So soon?

742
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,420
The last time I went there,

743
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,280
it was still far from completion.

744
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:00,910
Your Highness,

745
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,620
the last time you went for an inspection

746
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,570
was last year.

747
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,940
Gu Jiusi

748
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,430
has been living at the construction site

749
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,820
with the river workers,

750
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,420
rushing the work day and night.

751
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,300
He said he wants to finish

752
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,340
before the tides rise this year

753
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,290
so that the people of Xingyang City

754
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,150
can avoid an extra year of suffering from the flood.

755
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,510
Gu Jiusi

756
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,060
is really something.

757
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,860
All these years,

758
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,580
no one has managed to construct a dam.

759
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,900
He has been here for three years,

760
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,190
and it's almost done.

761
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,740
Subduing the Yellow River

762
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,660
will be

763
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,470
a feat that makes him famous.

764
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,020
Young Master.

765
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,860
Let's eat.

766
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,550
Here.

767
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,750
Eat first.

768
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,660
By the way,

769
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,160
the people of Xingyang City

770
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,360
are all talking about

771
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,580
Miss Shiyu's arrival

772
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,460
to Xingyang,

773
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,900
and how she donated a fortune

774
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,230
to the Yellow River dam.

775
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:11,980
Until now,

776
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,310
we haven't even met her.

777
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,300
Shouldn't we pay her a visit?

778
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,550
Of course.

779
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:17,930
Miss Shiyu

780
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,990
is our benefactor.

781
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,220
The project is about to be completed.

782
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,660
When the dam is completed,

783
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,550
we'll visit her

784
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,030
and thank her properly.

785
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,140
Young Master.

786
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,550
Here.

787
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,710
I just bought it.

788
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:52,670
♫May I be like the wind that allows you to travel thousands of miles♫

789
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:59,800
♫After thousands of journeys, you are still like when you were a youth♫

790
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,900
♫Galloping hoofs, lush willow, you turn around♫

791
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,220
Have a bite.

792
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,480
♫Shocking thousands of people♫

793
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:21,650
♫If you are like the wind, I am like a tree in a yard♫

♫Shielding you from dust regardless of the season♫

♫Regardless of the vast waves and smoke in the world♫

796
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,660
Yuru's death anniversary is coming up.

797
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
After we finish the project,

798
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,790
♫I'll keep your skirt from marks♫

799
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,060
let's go back and see her.

800
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:53,400
♫I wish you were still that youth♫

801
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,000
[Jiang Residence]

802
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,850
You must have heard

803
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,740
the news about the Yellow River.

804
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,830
You're right.

805
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,210
No one expected

806
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,500
that brat Gu Jiusi

807
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,510
to really build

808
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,590
the dam.

809
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,840
Rain will be heavy in the south this year.

810
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,590
This peacock tongue tea

811
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,030
is lacking a little something.

812
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,740
In just three years,

813
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,500
without manpower

814
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,780
or money,

815
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,270
under such circumstances,

816
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,910
Gu Jiusi

817
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,180
actually solved the perennial problem

818
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,310
of the Yellow River.

819
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,060
Minister Jiang,

820
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:53,990
do you think

821
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,590
there's someone powerful behind him?

822
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,320
I'm not sure about someone powerful.

823
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,400
There is, however,

824
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,660
someone wealthy.

825
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,070
Have you uncovered

826
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,070
Miss Shiyu's identity?

827
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,740
This person is very strange.

828
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,630
No one knows

829
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,730
where this wealthy businesswoman came from

830
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,900
all of a sudden.

831
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,430
A few years ago,

832
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,410
she built herself up in Ningzhou, Lingnan,

833
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,950
and then expanded her business

834
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,700
from the Southern Seas all the way to the Western Regions.

835
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,620
She became

836
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,590
the premier business in Da Xia.

837
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,590
No one would believe

838
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,500
there's no powerful backer

839
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,780
behind such a person.

840
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,980
But as for who this back is,

841
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,140
I tried my hardest,

842
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,590
but

843
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,700
still couldn't find out.

844
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,790
This person's actions are very high profile.

845
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,230
Your Baiyujing

846
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,340
are located all over the world.

847
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,860
It's fine if you weren't aware of her

848
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
at the beginning.

849
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,030
But now,

850
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,390
you still have no idea.

851
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,640
Doing great things

852
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,180
is like cooking food.

853
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,230
If you lose patience,

854
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,790
you'll lose control over the fire.

855
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,860
The drum has sounded three times.

856
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,900
It's time to take a break.

857
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,580
These clothes

858
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,020
aren't urgently needed anyway.

859
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,110
You can continue embroidering tomorrow.

860
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,190
At our age,

861
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,410
we can't stay up late.

862
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,540
If you get sick,

863
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,500
when Yuru comes back,

864
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,300
she will blame me

865
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,030
for not taking good care of you.

866
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,110
Here.

867
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,340
Be good.

868
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,860
She won't come back.

869
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,910
Madam.

870
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,390
I know.

871
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,110
I know everything.

872
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,400
I've been mending this

873
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,020
for three years.

874
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,810
She will never wear it again.

875
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,670
Madam.

876
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,960
Are you recovered?

877
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,340
You remember now?

878
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,860
She won't come back.

879
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,790
I'm not sound of mind.

880
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,530
That's why I always feel

881
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,110
Yuru is by my side.

882
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,030
The past three years

883
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,020
was like a long dream.

884
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,870
Madam.

885
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,630
I've been a burden.

886
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,540
We're family.

887
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,360
Don't say that.

888
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,260
Ruixue.

889
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,210
Go get the physician from Ningzhou

890
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:42,990
to come back.

891
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,780
Tell him that Madam has recovered.

892
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,120
Tell him to prescribe more medicine.

893
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:48,830
Yes.
