all the classical texts

00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,539

Don't interrupt me.

169

173
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,380

She's still so young, can she handle it?

192
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,700
Yes.

193
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,180
In terms of talent and diligence,

194
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,260
she's even better than me back in the day.

195
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
I think the Gu family

196
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,660
can't live without Yuru.

197
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,020
In the future,

198
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,260
when the two of us are gone,

199
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,100
the two youngsters

200
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,830
will have to rely on each other.

201
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,340
Don't say such ominous things.

202
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,020
You're only 45.

203
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,580
What's wrong?

204
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,370
You don't want to live to see your grandson?

205
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,580
Of course I do.

206
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,710
You're talking about your grandson?

207
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,140
Look at Yuru's belly.

208
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,990
There's been no news at all.

209
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
She married into our family half a year ago.

210
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,940
You only got pregnant with Jiusi

211
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,260
after three years.

212
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,980
That's true.

213
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,340
Besides,

214
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,060
we are leaving Yangzhou soon.

215
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,580
If Yuru gets pregnant,

216
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,440
it would inconvenience her during the journey.

217
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,580
I don't care.

218
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,890
I want to live a long life.

219
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,470
I want to see Jiusi have a grandson.

220
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,080
You want to live that long?

221
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,300
You'll be old and ugly. People will find you bothersome, too.

222
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,940
So what?

223
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,420
No matter what, I want to see

224
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,930
Jiusi's son and grandson

225
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,660
call him an "awful old man"

226
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,720
and give him grief.

227
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,830
I'll feel good then.

228
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,900
Nonsense.

229
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,340
I think

230
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,420
Jiusi must be full of nonsense

231
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,730
because he takes after you.

232
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,130
You still won't admit it?

233
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,980
Jiusi and Yuru are both good kids.

234
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,100
Our later years

235
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,980
will be easy.

236
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,100
Young Master, have some porridge

237
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,860
to fill up your stomach.

238
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,100
No, no, no.

239
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,540
I've been so stifled

240
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,780
for the past few months.

241
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,380
This is not a life for humans.

242
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,660
Go and get

243
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,500
Yang Wenchang and Chen Xun

244
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,700
to go hunting with me.

245
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,660
We'll ride our horses and raise our whips!

246
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,180
Okay.

247
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Young Master.

248
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,230
Master wants to see you.

249
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780
He wants to see me?

250
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,980
The year ends in two months.

251
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,540
The yearly rent of six farmsteads outside the city

252
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,900
is due.

253
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,180
We can't make it.

254
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,940
We'll probably celebrate the new year

255
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,660
in Youzhou this year.

256
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,790
[Baojin Pavilion]

257
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,140
Daughter-in-law

258
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,260
has been calculating for so many days,

259
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,660
but the property we can take away with us

260
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,620
is less than 40%.

261
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,380
We have

262
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,380
so many farmsteads and shops,

263
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,840
along with stockpiled goods,

264
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,120
that we must leave behind.

265
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,730
If I had known,

266
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,210
I wouldn’t have

267
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,270
opened those two silk shop branches.

268
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,300
You know that

269
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,860
we don't have enough time

270
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,780
to sell our property and farmland.

271
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,840
Moreover, it'll be too conspicuous.

272
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,380
Our family has always attracted attention.

273
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:03,980
Now, too,

274
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,840
there are many pairs of eyes on us.

275
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,860
We need to expend considerable effort

276
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,300
to think of ways

277
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,060
to liquidate even these assets,

278
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,660
little by little.

279
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,020
I know.

280
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,460
I just think it's a pity.

281
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,510
You can't tell what's important anymore?

282
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,660
Since you've decided to leave,

283
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
don't worry about trivial matters.

284
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,740
You'll only make it harder for Yuru, who's in charge of the accounts.

285
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,380
I feel sorry for you.

286
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,490
All these years,

287
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,060
our family's property

288
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,670
has been built up by your hard work,

289
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,380
little by little.

290
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,340
But now...

291
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,970
We're moving somewhere else,

292
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,500
but we can build it back up again,

293
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
little by little.

294
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,740
When people get older,

295
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,620
their energy isn't the same.

296
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,060
It's not easy

297
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,300
to start over.

298
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,580
We still have Yuru.

299
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,900
This child

300
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,820
is like how I used to be.

301
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,610
Yes.

302
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,020
Yuru is a good girl.

303
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,490
She just married into our family,

304
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,290
but she has to face such a crisis.

305
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,660
She hasn't enjoyed her life for long,

306
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,590
but she has to suffer along with us.

307
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,800
It must be hard for her.

308
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,980
Having such a good daughter-in-law

309
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,620
is our good fortune.

310
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,340
Unfortunately,

311
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,020
our lives in the future

312
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,710
can't compare to how it was before.

313
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,130
Without a backer in court,

314
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,780
it'll be hard to do business.

315
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,780
Yuru and Jiusi will have it much tougher

316
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,740
than we did, back in the day.

317
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,780
Jiusi

318
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,380
is always like

319
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,820
a child who can't grow up.

320
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,820
It's all our fault.

321
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,350
We've spoiled him too much.

322
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,020
So,

323
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,860
we must tell him the truth

324
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,990
about our family's predicament.

325
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,940
I've asked Qingshui to look for him

326
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,000
and ask him to come.

327
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,380
I didn't tell him before

328
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,110
because he was taking the exam.

329
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,860
Father, Mother.

330
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,060
What is it?

331
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,860
Tell me.

332
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,020
I have to go hunting.

333
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,150
It's been half a year since I last went.

334
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,010
Your father has something to tell you.

335
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,650
Tell him.

336
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,100
Go ahead.

337
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,070
The exam is over. You should relax.

338
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,620
But don't make trouble.

339
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,550
Come back early.

340
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,580
That's it?

341
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,860
Go ahead.

342
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,940
Wait for me.

343
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,260
We'll have barbecue.

344
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,500
Didn't you say you wanted to tell him

345
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,060
about our predicament?

346
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,420
Why didn't you tell him

347
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,460
when he came?

348
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,900
I couldn't.

349
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,620
He finally finished his exam.

350
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,620
Let him relax.

351
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,340
I can't

352
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,070
tell him our family is in danger

353
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,660
at a time like this

354
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,860
and put more pressure on him, right?

355
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,300
You always say

356
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm spoiling our son.

357
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,780
I think

358
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,580
you're no better than me.

359
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,110
What could we do?

360
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,030
We're his parents, after all.

361
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,860
Where's Jiusi?

362
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,260
Why isn't he here yet?

363
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,290
He's here.

364
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,780
Munan.

365
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,980
Where is your young master?

366
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,340
He asked me to tell you

367
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,780
he's going to the shop

368
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,820
with your Second Brother.

369
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,180
You can go hunting by yourselves.

370
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,380
But you must share two of the wild rabbits you catch

371
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,340
with him.

372
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,260
Second Brother, Second Brother, Second Brother.

373
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,500
It's Second Brother again.

374
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,960
How many times has it been?

375
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,500
Now, he only has Second Brother

376
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,620
in his eyes.

377
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,140
Let's go.

378
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,660
Two!

379
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,190
Young Madam.

380
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,780
Do we need to buy so much stock

381
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,500
this season?

382
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,190
[Wealthy And Benevolent, Using Money To Save The World]
[Gu]

383
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,600
What do you think, Manager He?

384
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,590
The market is unstable.

385
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,070
All the stores are afraid of stockpiling,

386
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,200
so everyone is buying in moderation.

387
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,700
In my opinion,

388
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,180
we should wait to observe

389
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,540
the market conditions after the new year

390
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,260
before deciding.

391
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,900
Other shops can wait,

392
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
but we can't.

393
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,540
Seek out good products,

394
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,740
discern their value,

395
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,300
and keep money circulating.

396
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,460
Fan Li's three laws

397
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,060
are what the Gu family lives by

398
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,420
in doing business.

399
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,900
One of them is important.

400
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,100
Money should flow like water.

401
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,930
The bigger a business is,

402
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,380
the more money needs to move.

403
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,260
In my opinion,

404
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,540
we should not only stock up as per usual,

405
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,460
but

406
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,500
stock up extra.

407
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,900
This...

408
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,819
Yes.

409
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,569
We are leaving.

410
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,940
We can't bring so many things with us.

411
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,900
You're throwing so much money

412
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,960
into the business.

413
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,339
Doesn't that mean

414
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,460
we're throwing the money away in Yangzhou?

415
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,060
There are times when money must be thrown away.

416
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,190
I don't understand.

417
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,000
You don't understand?

418
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,930
You've been by my side this whole time

419
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,390
and watching everything.

420
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,260
If you still don't understand anything,

421
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,540
it's because you didn't pay attention

422
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,800
and engage your brain.

423
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,380
I'm just a maid.

424
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,740
It's my duty to take care of

425
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,260
your daily necessities.

426
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,690
I don't know much

427
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,980
about business.

428
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,060
Yinhong.

429
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,820
Are you really planning on

430
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,020
being a maid forever?

431
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,940
We grew up together.

432
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
You're my most trusted subordinate.

433
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,740
If you don't learn about doing business,

434
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,420
how can you be

435
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,780
my right-hand man in the future?

436
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
Do you really want

437
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,540
to be a maid for the rest of your life

438
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,400
and marry a servant in the future?

439
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,400
Don't you want to be a manager,

440
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,950
have your own business,

441
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,600
and be your own master?

442
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,460
I- I can't do that.

443
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,660
Before my mother-in-law taught me

444
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,780
and trained me,

445
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,580
I didn't think I could do it either.

446
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,100
But

447
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,880
if we always think we can't do something,

448
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,190
then we really won't be able to.

449
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,180
Boss Liu,

450
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,830
didn't you go hunting?

451
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,860
Why are you here?

452
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,260
I can come to my family's shop

453
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,190
whenever I want.

454
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,460
You're finally out of your cage.

455
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,170
Why are you here making trouble for me

456
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,630
instead of taking a break?

457
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,260
You bothered me a lot

458
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,460
when I was preparing for the exam.

459
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,790
The tables have turned.

460
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,480
It's my turn to supervise you.

461
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,100
How is our business doing

462
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,250
under your care?

463
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,450
Are you slacking off?

464
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,300
What is it?

465
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,220
Tell me.

466
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,260
I...

467
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,780
am here to learn from you.

468
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,220
[Gu]

469
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,180
Do you need anyone

470
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,520
to run errands for you?

471
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,230
Here, look at my leg.

472
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,140
No.

473
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,000
What about serving tea and water?

474
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
No.

475
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,940
You must need cleaners.

476
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,090
No.

477
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,500
What are you up to?

478
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,060
What do you mean?

479
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,660
I really want to help you.

480
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,740
Although I don't know much

481
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,980
about business,

482
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,580
I'm willing to learn.

483
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,540
If I don't learn anything now,

484
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,380
I'll feel bad.

485
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
From now on,

486
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,700
I will stay by your side

487
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,230
and be at your disposal.

488
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,780
Please be kind and teach me.

489
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,860
Okay?

490
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:17,980
Please.

491
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,340
Please.

492
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,100
You promised.

493
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,500
With this batch of

494
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,220
bamboo,

495
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,260
rattan,

496
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,340
and rawhide,

497
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,940
you can make another 20,000 bamboo arrows,

498
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,200
3,000 leather armors,

499
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,780
and 700 shields.

500
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,620
Plus,

501
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,020
since last year,

502
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,100
I have been sending spears,

503
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,600
short knives, and chain mail in batches.

504
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,100
Your Highness

505
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,360
now has enough weapons

506
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,100
to equip 100,000 soldiers.

507
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,860
There will be another 20 merchant ships

508
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,580
sending an endless supply of stock.

509
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,100
I've gone all in this time

510
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,980
and invested all my life savings.

511
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,460
To do big business,

512
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,620
you must be willing to spend.

513
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,460
Indeed.

514
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,820
It's worth it.

515
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Young Master Luo.

516
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,820
You said you could provide me

517
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,300
with Ceylon ironwood

518
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,820
to build invincible tanks.

519
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,040
The year is almost ending.

520
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,470
Where is my wood?

521
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,200
It's right in front of you.

522
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,580
This is made of Ceylon ironwood.

523
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,300
If we transport

524
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,340
things like pig iron and bamboo,

525
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,740
we can use the excuse

526
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,180
that they're for construction.

527
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,240
But if we transport Ceylon ironwood,

528
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,720
I'm afraid Your Highness' grand plan

529
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,540
will be exposed.

530
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,860
So,

531
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,300
my merchant ship

532
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,780
has been constructed entirely of Ceylon ironwood.

533
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,260
The axes in particular

534
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,740
have been made of

535
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,580
the best Cantian wood.

536
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,780
When the goods have all been shipped,

537
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,310
we can disassemble the ship

538
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,460
and rebuild it into a tank

539
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,420
that is impervious to water and fire and impenetrable by weapons.

540
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,700
100 of them.

541
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,100
These merchant ships

542
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,660
have been sailing to and fro at the wharf

543
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,780
under everyone's eyes.

544
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,060
They have passed

545
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,260
the imperial court's multiple checks.

546
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,140
Yet, no one has realized.

547
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
I admire you.

548
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,380
With your help,

549
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,420
before next spring,

550
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,110
I will recoup the money I have invested

551
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,690
ten times over.

552
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,580
I don't think so.

553
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,380
The Gu family

554
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,940
will not just sit and do nothing.

555
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,460
They're already trying to liquidate their property

556
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,780
and flee Yangzhou.

557
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,670
Impossible.

558
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,740
The Gu family has been expanding their business.

559
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,380
They've invested a lot of money on stocking up.

560
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,110
They don't look like they're going to flee at all.

561
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,040
Your Highness.

562
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,140
Since you and I

563
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,610
know to deceive the world

564
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,940
by feigning one thing while doing something else,

565
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,740
how could the Gu family not?

566
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,250
You mean...

567
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,420
Gu's merchants

568
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,620
have all been heading to Youzhou recently.

569
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,070
That's not surprising.

570
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,900
The Gu family secured the deal

571
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,420
for Youzhou's military supplies

572
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,750
and are friendly with Zhou Gaolang's son.

573
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,980
All trade in Youzhou

574
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,420
must go through the Gu family.

575
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,020
Everyone

576
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,860
knows this.

577
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,860
This is a secret letter from the Eastern Capital.

578
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,520
Open and read it for yourself.

579
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
This is a document

580
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,400
from the Ministry of Revenue.

581
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,780
Youzhou is remote and poor.

582
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,900
All these years,

583
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,100
all the money in the province

584
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,040
only totals seven million taels.

585
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,660
Since the middle of the year,

586
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,220
the Gu family's merchants have already

587
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,700
transported over 9 million taels of goods

588
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,540
to Youzhou.

589
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,620
The people of Youzhou

590
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,020
can't afford so much

591
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,460
even if they didn't eat or drink.

592
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,260
As expected, the Gu family is moving their property.

593
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,500
So,

594
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,550
we need to figure out how they're doing it.

595
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,380
We need to block this loophole

596
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,860
so that they can't escape.

597
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,460
Otherwise, when the time comes,

598
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,260
all our efforts will be for naught.

599
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,260
Young Master Luo.

600
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,950
The contents in this letter

601
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,420
are all confidential information

602
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,950
of the Ministry of Revenue.

603
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,070
What is your background

604
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,190
in the Eastern Capital?

605
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,820
I'll tell you

606
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,380
everything you need to know.

607
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,550
Please forgive me

608
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,380
for keeping the rest from you.

609
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,820
Fine.

610
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,500
My ambition is to dominate Yangzhou.

611
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,350
I have no interest in the Eastern Capital.

612
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,260
The most important thing now is the Gu family.

613
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,820
One month.

614
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,620
I'll let the Gu family

615
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,940
live for another month.

616
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,090
[Wenchang Hall]

617
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,460
Lord Wenchang,

618
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,780
please watch over our Young Master

619
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,580
and allow him to rank first in the Provincial Examination tomorrow.

620
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,890
No, no.

621
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,700
That is too hard for the Lord.

622
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,460
Our Young Master

623
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,060
just has to place in the top 5.

624
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,420
Forget it.

625
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,340
It'll be good...

626
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,660
if he can even pass.

627
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,260
The results will be released tomorrow.

628
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,900
The scripts have already been graded.

629
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,620
What's the point

630
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,080
of begging the Lord today?

631
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
We're just doing our best and leaving the rest to fate.

632
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,270
It'll be fine whether he passes or not.

633
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,260
Yuru.

634
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,980
Mother.

635
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,080
Since that time Son-in-law gave his speech,

636
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,780
my life at home

637
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,980
has been much easier.

638
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,700
Is Mother Yue still making trouble for you?

639
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,340
No.

640
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,820
She is very respectful now.

641
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,860
A few days ago,

642
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,590
she cried and apologized to me.

643
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,580
She said she didn't know her place

644
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,170
and wanted to correct her mistake.

645
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,700
She asked me to forgive her.

646
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,180
She seems to have changed.

647
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,340
Mother Yue

648
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,940
knows how to take advantage of the situation

649
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,050
and she's hypocritical.

650
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,650
She cannot be fully trusted.

651
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,040
What about Father?

652
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,940
Your father

653
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,590
is also respectful towards me now.

654
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,640
He dares not neglect me at all.

655
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,620
Mother,

656
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,260
if you face any trouble at home,

657
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,460
ask Yun to come and tell me immediately.

658
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,180
There's no trouble anymore.

659
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,180
I've never done so well

660
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,100
in the Liu family

661
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,500
in the past 10 years.

662
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,950
It's all thanks to my daughter.

663
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,380
By the way,

664
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,020
I was just talking.

665
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,060
Where are you taking me?

666
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,260
Mother.

667
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,940
It's been almost ten years

668
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
since you were last back

669
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,940
at the old mansion

670
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,470
in Xijia Datang in Jinling.

671
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,380
We're going back to Jinling?

672
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,420
That old mansion

673
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,020
was destroyed

674
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,220
in the fire that year.

675
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,620
No one has lived in it

676
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,860
for many years.

677
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,070
I wonder what it looks like now.

678
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,460
Why did you suddenly think of

679
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,580
going back there?

680
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,190
After all, it's your birth family.

681
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,520
I lived there when I was young too.

682
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,950
I still remember

683
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,380
Grandfather loved me the most.

684
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,820
In the future, it'll be a long way away.

685
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,100
I'm afraid it'll be hard to return to Jinling.

686
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,980
What do you mean?

687
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,580
Mother.

688
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,300
I've decided

689
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,000
to leave Yangzhou with the Gu family.

690
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,010
Mother, come with me.

691
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,580
Where are you going?

692
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,620
Youzhou.

693
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,660
Xijia Datang in Jinling?

694
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
Yuru and her mother

695
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,820
went to Xijia Datang?

696
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,540
It's not far.

697
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,340
It's a day's journey.

698
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,740
They'll be back at night.

699
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,820
I asked the guards to follow them.

700
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,620
It'll be fine.

701
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
Why are Yuru and her mother

702
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,940
going there?

703
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,180
Her maternal grandfather's old mansion is there.

704
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,210
She said she wanted to visit

705
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,220
and bid farewell.

706
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,140
I almost forgot

707
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,020
Yuru's hometown

708
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,100
is also there.

709
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,020
Right.

710
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Who else is there?

711
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,600
We have relatives in Jinling?

712
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,900
The Gu family is moving to Youzhou.

713
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,500
What's the current situation in Yangzhou?

714
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,780
The Commissioner's ambition

715
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,740
is known to all.

716
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,360
I'm afraid we can't stay for long.

717
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,420
But

718
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,220
does the Gu family

719
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,940
really have to move away?

720
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,300
Actually, it's not just the Gu family.

721
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,020
Any family

722
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,980
with any property and business

723
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,130
in Yangzhou

724
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,990
must all make preparations before it's too late.

725
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,820
Mother.

726
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,990
Don't be afraid.

727
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,260
When we get to Youzhou,

728
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,580
we can still live well.

729
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,980
Most of my in-laws' property

730
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,240
have been moved there.

731
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,020
Jiusi and I

732
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,770
have friends to watch out for us in Youzhou.

733
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,630
What about your father?

734
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,500
I've thought about it countless times.

735
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,560
Father is too short-sighted.

736
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,970
Until the disaster has come,

737
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,460
it's impossible for him

738
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,060
to leave behind

739
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,560
the Liu Mansion and family business.

740
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,670
When the disaster has come,

741
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,700
it will be too late.

742
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,250
If that day comes,

743
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,550
I can only beg the Gu family

744
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,940
to do their best

745
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,460
to spare a horse carriage

746
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,320
to help Father escape.

747
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,830
If even the Gu family can't help...

748
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,340
Mother.

749
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,380
Today,

750
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,470
I want to use offering incense as an excuse

751
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,620
to ask you to make a decision.

752
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,060
Are you coming with me

753
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,470
or staying with the Liu family?

754
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,060
Yuru.

755
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,580
You have a way out.

756
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,300
I'm relieved.

757
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,450
I won't go with you.

758
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,340
Why?

759
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,980
How can a woman leave her husband

760
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,510
to live with her married daughter?

761
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,690
It's improper.

762
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,780
People will gossip.

763
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,660
Mother.

764
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,860
What's important about rules and propriety?

765
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,980
What's so important about gossiping?

766
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,420
What matters is you and I

767
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,620
won't be separated again

768
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,220
and can be together forever.

769
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,180
But...

770
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,020
Mother.

771
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,260
I've discussed this

772
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,740
with my in-laws and Jiusi.

773
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,500
They all welcome you.

774
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,350
Besides, I'm not only

775
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,580
a daughter-in-law in the Gu family.

776
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,260
I am my mother-in-law's right-hand man.

777
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,740
I lead all the managers

778
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,500
in managing the Gu family's businesses.

779
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,450
I'm now the Young Madam

780
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,060
of the Gu Family's business.

781
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,020
I’d like to see who dares to gossip.

782
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,460
But

783
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,260
I'm Madam Liu after all.

784
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,260
Mother.

785
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,420
All these years,

786
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,950
how has Father treated you?

787
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,580
Need I say more?

788
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,670
Father didn't marry you

789
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,340
because he cared about you,

790
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,940
but because of

791
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,140
Grandfather’s reputation and status.

792
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,110
That's why when the Su family declined

793
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,540
and you lost the support of your birth family,

794
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,620
he indulged Mother Yue

795
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,100
and allowed her to humiliate us.

796
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,230
Have you forgotten?

797
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,620
I remember.

798
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,340
But...

799
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,260
Mother.

800
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,000
No matter how little your father cares about me,

801
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
I'm still a member of the Liu family.

802
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,940
I am still his wife.

803
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,700
Mother.

804
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,780
You must choose between dad and me.

805
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,140
Mother.

806
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,060
Father has his favorite concubine,

807
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,020
a daughter, and a son.

808
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,060
I only have one mother.

809
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,460
Mother.

810
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,540
Yuru, I've been feeling regretful and upset

811
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,890
since you got married.

812
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,660
I was thinking

813
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,100
why I hadn't

814
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,460
talked to you properly

815
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,980
and kept you company

816
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,260
while you were still at home.

817
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,100
Mother.

818
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,260
Move to Youzhou with me.

819
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,820
We'll have plenty of time

820
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,730
to talk.

821
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,780
You can keep me company everyday.

822
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,300
Mother.

823
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,820
I can make money.

824
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,540
I can make a lot of money.

825
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,659
I can give you

826
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,699
the best life

827
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,139
with my own efforts.

828
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,739
I promised you this.

829
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,179
Do you remember?

830
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,020
Yes.

831
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,100
Mother.

832
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,340
You've been weak and bullied all your life.

833
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,820
Even if your teeth broke,

834
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,300
you had to swallow them.

835
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,550
You dared not stand up for yourself.

836
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,060
Mother.

837
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,300
Be brave

838
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,620
for my sake.

839
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,540
Come with me.

840
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,340
Mother.

841
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:44,340
Okay.

842
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,190
Okay, I promise you.

843
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,300
Yuru.

844
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,820
I think you're different

845
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,250
from before.

846
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,460
Mother.

847
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
I think so too.

848
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,020
I've changed

849
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,640
since I married Jiusi.

850
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,660
In the future,

851
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,620
I will be different.

852
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,580
Your grandfather

853
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,480
put a lot of work into this garden.

854
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
He inscribed the plaques on all these pavilions and towers

855
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,700
personally.

856
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,720
He instructed someone

857
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,780
to ship this artificial rock

858
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,820
from Suzhou.

859
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,740
Your uncle and I

860
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,220
grew up playing here.

861
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,780
At that time,

862
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,690
the fire next door

863
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,780
caused the Su family to suffer a lot.

864
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,460
Yes.

865
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,540
If it weren't for the fire,

866
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,260
you would still be a noble.

867
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,750
You wouldn't have been wronged for so many years.

868
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,540
Mother.

869
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,180
I still remember

870
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,840
when I was a kid, I was really naughty.

871
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,540
I often climbed over the wall to play in the neighbor's house.

872
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,870
Their garden was bigger

873
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,780
and had a pond.

874
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,270
There were many yuhua stones in it.

875
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,990
They were so colorful.

876
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,940
Yes.

877
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,260
I don't know where

878
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,340
you got so many beautiful stones from.

879
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,540
You hid them in that tree hollow

880
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,020
as if they were treasures.

881
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,250
I remember

882
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,180
I was short when I was young.

883
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,020
Whatever treasure I got,

884
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,780
I hid them in this tree hollow,

885
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,040
thinking the adults didn't know.

886
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,300
Be careful.

887
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,140
This is a pair of moonstones

888
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,180
I brought back from the Sinhala Kingdom.

889
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,650
There have been many disasters at sea this year.

890
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,500
This is the only pair in Yangzhou.

891
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,760
I'm gifting them to you

892
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,010
as a pair of earrings.

893
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,720
It's a token of my respect.

894
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,020
Luo Zishang.

895
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,700
Why are these gems here?

896
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,540
Young Master.

897
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,900
According to the spy sent by Commissioner Wang,

898
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,860
someone from the Gu family has left the city.

899
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,140
It's the Gu's Young Madam.

900
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,870
Judging from the direction, she went to Jinling.

901
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,540
Our men are following her from afar.

902
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,340
We don't know

903
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,490
where she went in Jinling

904
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,260
and what she did.

905
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,170
Once there is news,

906
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,970
I'll come back and report to you.

907
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,830
There's no need.

908
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,820
I know where they went.

909
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:19,980
Go.

910
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,380
Yes.

911
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,860
I thought

912
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,420
you would never go back there.

913
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,980
Mother.

914
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,660
I remember our neighbors

915
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,950
were the Luo family?

916
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,180
Yes.

917
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,980
They were also a prominent family.

918
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,100
Their great grandfather was a Grand Tutor of the previous dynasty.

919
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,260
Were there any young masters

920
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,020
similar to me in age?

921
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,140
No.

922
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,380
Slightly older than me?

923
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,400
Did you remember wrongly?

924
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,420
No.

925
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,020
The Luo family didn't have many offspring

926
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,420
and their other relatives were scattered.

927
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,580
In my generation,

928
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,940
they only had

929
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,620
a girl about my age.

930
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,420
She was bedridden due to illness

931
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,680
and never got married.

932
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,460
How could they have a child

933
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,740
similar in age to you?

934
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,020
I seem to remember one.

935
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,060
You were too young.

936
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,000
You must have gotten it wrong.

937
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,260
Right.

938
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,780
Back then,

939
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,060
I was carefree

940
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,460
and knew nothing.

941
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,270
I only started to mature

942
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,780
when Father

943
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,690
married Mother Yue.

944
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,420
If Luo Zishang

945
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,480
has nothing to do with the Luo family,

946
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,930
why did he come here?

947
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,740
Why did he leave these gems

948
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,540
here?

949
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,300
Mr. Luo.

950
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,030
Gu Jiusi’s wife ran out of the city.

951
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,060
Were you the one who said

952
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,420
not to follow them?

953
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,380
Yes.

954
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,290
She's not back yet.

955
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,540
Did she run away?

956
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,580
The Gu family sent one out of the city today.

957
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,140
They can send one out tomorrow.

958
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,180
They'll all be gone in no time.

959
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,180
Young Madam Gu

960
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,220
left with her mother,

961
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,980
Su Wan.

962
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,060
They went to Jinling.

963
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,340
What?

964
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,020
Even Gu Jiusi's mother-in-law

965
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,950
is running away?

966
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,540
Su Wan's birth family was from Jinling.

967
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,940
They're probably

968
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,580
visiting their hometown before leaving.

969
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,700
The Su family

970
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,070
is just a deserted mansion now.

971
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,300
They have nowhere to stay.

972
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,140
They will most likely

973
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,580
be back by tonight.

974
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,300
Really?

975
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,700
How did you

976
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,580
know so much?

977
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,580
I see.

978
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,740
This is called knowing thy self and knowing thy enemy.

979
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,940
Young Master Luo,

980
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,900
you've already investigated

981
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,960
every member of the Gu family, right?

982
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,130
No wonder my father

983
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,810
said you were shrewd.

984
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,500
You're indeed thorough.

985
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,940
Goodbye.

986
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,410
Hush.

987
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,660
There are so many beautiful rocks

988
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,260
in your pond.

989
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,180
Can I take some home?

990
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,660
You like pretty stones?

991
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,340
Thank you.

992
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,380
What's your name?
