00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,030
[Episode 39]

4
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,640
I...

5
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,050
My last family

6
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,810
is gone.

7
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,930
All gone.

8
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,180
His Majesty is drunk.

9
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,930
Guards!

10
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,800
Yes.

11
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,820
Send His Majesty

12
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,840
back for some rest.

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,079
Yes.

14
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,810
No!

15
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,100
I'm not drunk.

16
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,270
I've never been more sober.

17
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,780
Grand Tutor Luo.

18
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,829
You calculated your every move

19
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,650
to set me up.

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,400
Your next step

21
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,560
must be to replace me

22
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,920
and seize my throne.

23
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,480
It seems that His Majesty is very sick.

24
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,120
He is beginning to talk nonsense.

25
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,950
He is not suitable to take charge of state affairs anymore.

26
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,880
No.

27
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,950
Close the palace doors.

28
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
Without my order,

29
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,750
no one is allowed to see him.

30
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,290
Yes.

31
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,050
Let's go.

32
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,730
Let go of me!

33
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,010
No!

34
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,760
Let go of me!

35
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,810
My dear.

36
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,800
Let go of me!

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,720
Dear!

38
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,690
Xifeng.

39
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,130
Dear, save me!

40
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,170
Feng'er!

41
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:25,930
Feng'er!

42
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,800
Feng'er!

43
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,960
Let go of me!

44
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,040
I am the Emperor!

45
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,850
Do you want to die?

46
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,400
Dear!

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,480
Congratulations, Master.

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,140
Your plan is almost complete.

49
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,720
Pass my order.

50
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,090
Yes.

51
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,400
Dispatch all the Imperial Guards

52
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,400
to arrest the rebel Gu Jiusi.

53
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,420
Any associates of his

54
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,340
must be arrested as well.

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,370
If they resist,

56
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,650
kill them without mercy.

57
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,080
Yes.

58
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,170
Luo Zishang rebelled.

59
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,780
You followed him.

60
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,340
You're a traitor too.

61
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,470
Your entire family will be killed.

62
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,080
He even used a palace coup to threaten me.

63
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,360
But he doesn't have

64
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,220
any external troops to help him.

65
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,890
He wants to topple the throne

66
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,340
with just 3000 Imperial Guards?

67
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,680
Luo Zishang must be crazy.

68
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,680
You are following a crazy man.

69
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,610
Ridiculous.

70
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,940
Does he...

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,340
Does he really have external troops supporting him?

72
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,340
What do you think?

73
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,720
Who is it?

74
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,820
The rebel Liu Xingzhi of Yuzhou is dead.

75
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,550
Yongzhou's finances are poor.

76
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,250
Jingzhou

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,940
and Bingzhou are too far away.

78
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,070
The other states...

79
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,120
The other states

80
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,860
have been reducing military activities,

81
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,370
and their military expenses have been decreasing.

82
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,460
There's no problem to be found

83
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,420
on account after skimming through it.

84
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,080
Right?

85
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,060
Your Majesty, do you know

86
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,050
why Gu Jiusi

87
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,690
was able to peacefully

88
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,370
and safely manage

89
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,900
the Yellow River in Yongzhou for three years?

90
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,400
This great kingdom

91
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,640
has changed its owner several times.

92
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,320
Now,

93
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,920
it's finally going to be mine.

94
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,280
It's worth your meticulous planning

95
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,840
for all these years.

96
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,200
Soon,

97
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,240
I will have to call you

98
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,640
Your Majesty instead.

99
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,280
But I have not received word

100
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,200
of Gu Jiusi's whereabouts yet.

101
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,120
Gu Jiusi knows that

102
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,620
the Eastern Capital is under your control.

103
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,350
I don't think he will come back.

104
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,640
No.

105
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,040
He will come back for sure.

106
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,650
I know Gu Jiusi.

107
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,110
He will definitely come to save Ye Shi'an.

108
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,090
He will definitely come to play against me

109
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,150
to the last moment.

110
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,120
Most of the officials

111
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,110
are his supporters.

112
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,120
Someone must be secretly helping him

113
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,170
and hiding him.

114
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,320
Even if he comes back,

115
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,140
the bulk of your plan is already complete.

116
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,870
What else can he do to rival you?

117
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,720
If I don't get rid of him,

118
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,130
I won't feel at ease.

119
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,560
Keep watching.

120
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,800
If anything happens,

121
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,980
let me know immediately.

122
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,090
Yes.

123
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,480
Lady Xifeng.

124
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,420
Are you really willing

125
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,730
to trade your whole life

126
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,260
for the success of another?

127
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,040
You led a humble past,

128
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,660
but now you don the phoenix coronet and robes of rank.

129
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,520
From Yangzhou,

130
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,480
to Youzhou,

131
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,780
and now to the Eastern Capital.

132
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,040
You staged all sorts of

133
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,540
relationships with different men

134
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,540
and went through so many ups and downs.

135
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,300
All that, to satisfy

136
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,780
Luo Zishang’s personal plan

137
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,180
and his selfish desires.

138
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:33,929
Lady Xifeng.

139
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,960
We are both women.

140
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,740
Don't you want to

141
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,370
live for yourself?

142
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,170
You bunch of insolent

143
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,010
rats!

144
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,290
Let me out!

145
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,720
I am the Emperor!

146
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,710
I'm going to kill all of you!

147
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,560
Guards!

148
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,650
Let me out.

149
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,600
I'll reward you.

150
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,840
Please.

151
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,240
Please!

152
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,720
Let me out.

153
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,690
Let me out.

154
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,330
Your Majesty.

155
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,930
Feng'er.

156
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,040
It's you.

157
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,240
Are you here to see me

158
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,760
or laugh at me?

159
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,460
Your Majesty,

160
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,520
I brought your old friends to see you.

161
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,260
Your Majesty.

162
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,880
We're here to save you.

163
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,930
Save me?

164
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,360
Save me?

165
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,930
None of you can save me!

166
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,970
Get out!

167
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,210
Get out now!

168
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,920
I saved you from that

169
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
dice rolling game back then.

170
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,180
Now, I can save you again.

171
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,840
You...

172
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,840
Can save me again?

173
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,170
Why?

174
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,360
This is the real will of the late Emperor.

175
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,470
How dare you!

176
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,000
I am the Emperor.

177
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,520
This is fake!

178
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,340
Your Majesty.

179
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,640
[My brother is a great and virtuous warrior. I trust him to be a just ruler of Da Xia, to protect the ancestral temple, and to bring peace to the people. Respect your positions and fulfill your roles to the end. This is the heavenly will. ]

180
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,350
This was written by the late Emperor.

181
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,640
The next Emperor should have been

182
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,860
Zhou Gaolang.

183
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,330
No.

184
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,310
Impossible.

185
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,880
Father didn't write this.

186
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,400
On the day Father passed away,

187
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,950
I was the only one present.

188
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,240
Who gave you this will?

189
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,920
It must be fake!

190
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,760
It's me.

191
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,710
The late Emperor

192
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,510
had long drafted this will.

193
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,350
He kept it in a hidden place.

194
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,840
Your Highness.

195
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,210
How could you offend His Majesty?

196
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,200
How could you be so reckless?

197
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,160
His Majesty has been ill for a long time.

198
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,590
[Peace and Tranquil]

199
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,760
He cannot withstand any more trouble.

[Peace and Tranquil]

201
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,760
This is about my brother, Gaolang.

202
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,960
In the past, Emperor Yao abdicated to Yu Shun.

203
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,440
Shun also abdicated to Yu.

204
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,960
Life is unpredictable.

205
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,370
But it all comes down to virtue.

206
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,840
I only have one heir.

207
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,370
He is weak and incapable.

208
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,130
Yet, we are in a dark time.

209
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,650
I'm afraid that when I pass away,

210
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,960
evil will become rampant, and order will be lost.

211
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,480
My brother is a great and virtuous warrior.

212
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,760
I trust him to be a just ruler of Da Xia,

213
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,690
to protect the ancestral temple,

214
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,730
and to bring peace to the people.

215
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,540
[October, the fourth year of Da Xia]

216
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,050
Respect your positions

217
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,600
and fulfill your roles to the end.

218
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,690
This is the heavenly will.

219
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,330
So what?

220
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,810
Now,

221
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,440
I am the Emperor.

222
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,520
Father...

223
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,730
He never cared about me.

224
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,080
If I don't become the Emperor,

225
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,820
no one will

226
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,080
care about me anymore.

227
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,800
Father

228
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,100
had never spared a thought for me

229
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,520
as his son.

230
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,080
Why should I

231
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,520
listen to him?

232
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,580
Your Majesty, you are wrong.

233
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,940
The person the late Emperor

234
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,800
cared about and

235
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,700
thought about the most

236
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,570
was you,

237
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,610
his only son.

238
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,890

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,600

00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,240
Father's personal notes.

246
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:58,850

248
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,290
Yes it is.

249
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,120
My father had been writing

250
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,890
to record his views

251
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,060
and thoughts over the years.

252
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
He filled many books with his notes.

253
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,480
But he

254
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,540
never let me look at his personal notes.

255
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,080
Why do you have it?

256
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,620
The late Emperor entrusted them

257
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,220
with me before he passed away.

258
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,290
I've been hiding them

259
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,410
in the Shiyu Store

260
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,140
and kept them away from the court.

261
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,540
The late Emperor told me,

262
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,400
if his son were safe and happy,

263
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,830
I wouldn't need to give them to him.

264
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,010
If his son

265
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,400
felt lost

266
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,500
and helpless,

267
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,920
then I must

268
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,960
give them to him.

269
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,480
My son was born today.

270
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,640
When I held him,

271
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,050
he kept crying.

272
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,980
I'm afraid there's no other way.

273
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,360
I need to ask the nanny

274
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,160
to teach me how to hold the child.

275
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,580
I've been thinking about

276
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,350
a name for my son for months.

277
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,900
If I don't name him soon,

278
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,600
I may end up calling him Child.

279
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,740
In the end, I decided to draw lots.

280
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,140
The result was Yu, which means Jade.

281
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,470
Heaven has named him Yu.

282
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,030
My son will certainly become a gentleman.

283
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,010
My son is learning to walk.

284
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,300
He can walk for six to eight meters

285
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,130
without anyone's help now.

286
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,440
I'm very glad.

from the day I was born

290
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,200
to the day he died.

291
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,330
Father.

292
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,280
Father!

293
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,570
I was wrong.

294
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,880
I was wrong about everything.

295
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,000
Brother Gu.

296
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,240
Save me.

297
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,650
Looks like everyone is here.

298
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,839
Xifeng.

299
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,060
You betrayed me

300
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,319
at the right time.

301
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,569
I was just agonizing over

302
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,500
how to let Grand Councilor Gu and Boss Liu

303
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,170
come to me on their own.

304
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,820
You did me another big favor.

305
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,280
Good.

306
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,460
I'll let you die with your limbs intact.

307
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,120
Back then,

308
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,400
you saved me from the brothel.

309
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,780
To repay your kindness,

310
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,810
I was loyal to you.

311
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,960
Now,

312
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,280
I've paid you back.

313
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,090
I don't regret it.

314
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,600
Boss Liu,

315
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,120
I'll give you one last chance.

316
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,120
When I become the Emperor,

317
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,330
you can be my Empress.

318
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,640
Luo Zishang.

319
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,460
We have never met before.

320
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,500
Why are you so obsessed with me?

321
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,610
If you really want to know

322
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,960
the reason behind it,

323
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,080
I will tell you all about it

324
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,220
when you become the Empress.

325
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,010
In that case,

326
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,020
in the future,

327
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,420
I will tell it to

328
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,330
your grave.

329
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,770
Gu Jiusi,

330
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,900
I've waited so long for this day.

331
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,880
I'm afraid you don't know.

332
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,040
We are actually brothers.

333
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,460
My father never had

334
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,520
a son like you.

335
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,320
He did.

336
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,580
And it's his blessing

337
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,010
to have a

338
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,890
son of my stature.

339
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,840
Unfortunately,

340
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,730
he already died at my hands

341
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,040
back in Yangzhou.

342
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,140
He won't see

343
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,840
the day I ascend to the throne.

344
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,630
Luo Zishang.

345
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,770
We've known each other for so long,

346
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,300
but we never had a good chat.

347
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,570
I heard you're good at chess.

348
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,520
How about a game?

349
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,530
What are you planning?

350
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,980
Since victory is already in your hands,

351
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,840
what are you afraid of?

352
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,330
Okay.

353
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,200
Gu Jiusi.

354
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,880
Life is like a game of chess.

355
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,690
Every step is calculated.

356
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,660
A slight move in one part may affect the whole situation.

357
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,590
There's another important thing.

358
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,980
Make the first move.

359
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,100
The chaos in Yangzhou

360
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,330
was your first move.

361
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,380
You gained Wang Shanquan's trust

362
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,890
by pretending to be a strategist.

363
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,060
After his death,

364
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,340
you killed his children.

365
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,340
You controlled Jiangnan and replaced him.

366
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,740
Then, you took control of Yangzhou as well.

367
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,570
But your goal

368
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,130
didn't stop at Yangzhou.

369
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,780
The Eastern Capital had a new  master.

370
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,620
So you gave up Yangzhou in exchange for

371
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,340
a high position, and volunteered to be the Grand Tutor.

372
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,580
But you did it to get close to the Crown Prince

373
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,310
so you may exert control over the future emperor.

374
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,690
Back in Lanxiao House,

375
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,330
when I instructed Xifeng to rope Fan Yu in

376
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,860
with the dice rolling game,

377
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,350
I didn't expect

378
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,210
him to be the future Crown Prince.

379
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,130
But since then,

380
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,200
I was sure that

381
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,440
Fan Yu is easy to control.

382
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,970
He was easily captured.

383
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,120
You provoked Empress Dowager to force me

384
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,450
to divorce my wife and marry the princess.

385
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,490
You wanted the Youzhou Sect and I

386
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,460
to differ in morals and drift apart,

387
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,340
so that I would lose His Majesty's trust.

388
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,740
Seeing that this plan failed,

389
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,140
you colluded with Lu Yong

390
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,450
and murdered Liu Chun,

391
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,810
the key witness of the treasury incident,

392
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,930
to frame me.

393
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,550
This way, you could weaken the late Emperor's strength.

394
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,230
But, in terms of foresight,

395
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,220
you still lost to the late Emperor.

396
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,930
You advanced with a retreat

397
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,380
and volunteered to be demoted to Deputy Minister of Works.

398
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,490
Then, you pretended to manage the Yellow River.

399
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,020
When in reality, you embezzled the treasury funds

400
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,480
and raised a private army.

401
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,260
You quietly waited for His Majesty's death,

402
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,860
and pointed your sword at the Eastern Capital.

403
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,500
You knew about the private army?

404
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,240
Not bad.

405
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,300
What else do you know?

406
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,380
Bingzhou is too far from here.

407
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,840
The Cangzhou army is weak.

408
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,210
Only Zhou Gaolang's Youzhou army

409
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,890
is a threat to you.

410
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,010
So after His Majesty passed away,

411
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,210
you tried everything

412
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,240
to annihilate the Youzhou army.

413
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,000
So, you forged the will,

414
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,190
ordered the Youzhou army to battle with Nanzhao,

415
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,160
and cut off their provisions.

416
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,360
Unfortunately,

417
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,880
Boss Liu intercepted my plan.

418
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,060
She's the most impressive woman

419
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,160
I've ever seen.

420
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,790
When that didn't work,

421
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,530
you got your eyes on

422
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,700
the Hanging Lake above the Black River Valley.

423
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,010
When the victorious Youzhou Army returned,

424
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,540
you blew up the valley and caused a landslide.

425
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,380
Then, you could use the natural disaster as an excuse

426
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,040
to kill the 300,000 meritorious soldiers.

427
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,770
At the same time, you manipulated the new Emperor

428
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,920
to take control of the court

429
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,650
and colluded with the Imperial Guards in secret.

430
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,130
When the private army arrives,

431
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,460
no one will come to help the Emperor.

432
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,330
By then,

433
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,800
you just need to open the city gate

434
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,920
to become the new Emperor

435
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,450
and ascend the throne without any bloodshed.

436
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,720
Luo Zishang.

437
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,880
Am I right?

438
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,050
Gu Jiusi.

439
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,960
You are indeed my opponent of choice.

440
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,530
If you were not my enemy,

441
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,090
you might have been a confidant.

442
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,360
But it's too late

443
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,220
even if you knew all that.

444
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,460
You are just a small pawn

445
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,040
in this game of chess.

446
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,850
And I

447
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,880
am the player.

448
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,530
I am the final winner.

449
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,720
Do you really think

450
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,720
the late Emperor didn't notice it?

451
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,490
He granted you the Grand Tutor position

452
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,550
because he treated you with respect,

453
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,640
not because you blinded him.

454
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,330
He was buying time for Da Xia.

455
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,690
His Majesty knew people well and was tolerant.

456
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,930
He pushed everyone

457
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,930
to

458
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,530
the most suitable position.

459
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,570
He spent three years

460
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,680
cleaning up the royal court

461
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,500
and building the Yellow River dam.

462
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,740
He suppressed civil unrest and defended the borders.

463
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,040
He boosted trade and reduced tax burdens.

464
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,250
He gave Da Xia a new life.

465
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,810
Luo Zishang.

466
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,570
You think you are very smart.

467
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,610
But there are too many

468
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,140
smart people in this world.

469
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,820
Why didn't they

470
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,320
take your path?

471
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,810
Because every road of crime

472
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,200
and bloodshed

473
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,490
leads to a dead end.

474
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,420
The so-called world is made of

475
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,120
the kingdom and the people.

476
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,770
If you want the world,

477
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,220
you have to perceive everything it entails.

478
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,450
If you only care about playing with power

479
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,420
and manipulating people's hearts,

480
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,610
how can you see the big picture

481
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,940
and the true state of this game?

482
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,290
That's all just empty talk.

483
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,290
Do you really think

484
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,690
you can turn the table

485
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,600
by telling me

486
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,810
all these grand things?

487
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,310
Your Yongzhou private army

488
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,810
is on its way here

489
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,440
via the Biluo Pass,

490
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,400
right?

491
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,520
Jiusi!

492
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,480
Jiusi!

493
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,060
The Youzhou Army is still alive.

494
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,660
Zhou Gaolang is still alive!

495
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,810
They have passed Cangzhou

496
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,900
and left the valley.

497
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,960
They are rushing back here right now.

498
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,560
You're bluffing.

499
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,940
Trying to trick me again?

500
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,800
Take him down.

501
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,680
Wait.

502
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,570
Luo Zishang.

503
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,050
Do you recognize this?

504
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,970
[Tiger Tally]

505
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,820
Baiyujing

506
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,040
just passed it to me.

507
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,460
This is the commander's tally you used to deploy the Yongzhou private army.

508
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,640
[Tiger Tally]

509
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,680
[Tiger Tally]

510
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,200
General Zhou.

511
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,230
[Tiger Tally]

512
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,130
Ye.

513
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,130
Yes.

514
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,460
Immediately pass this Tiger Tally

515
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,600
to Gu Jiusi

516
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,120
through Baiyujing.

517
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,810
Yes.

518
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,730
The Youzhou army

519
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,330
had received my tip-off

520
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,130
to bypass Black River Valley and take Biluo Pass

521
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,260
to ambush your Yongzhou private army.

522
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,050
Your private army gathered for profit.

523
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,580
They are just a bunch of thugs.

524
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,110
Compared to the real elite soldiers of Da Xia,

525
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,320
they never stood a chance.

526
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,050
They have surrendered.

527
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,440
All you Imperial Guards

528
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,370
willingly colluded with the traitor

529
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,630
and slaughtered the entire Zhou family.

530
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,240
When Zhou Gaolang's army returns,

531
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,240
what will happen to you?

532
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,010
Zhou Gaolang is dead.

533
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,410
He can't be alive!

534
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,720
Kill them!

535
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,160
You still have a choice right now.

536
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,160
The killing of the Zhou family

537
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
was due to Luo Zishang's fake edict.

538
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,840
You were also deceived.

539
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,000
But if you insist on doing his bidding...

540
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,560
He's lying.

541
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,490
Don't believe him!

542
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,600
I order you to kill them!

543
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,340
All you Imperial Guards.

544
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,330
Step back!

545
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:21,800
This...

546
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,660
Grand Councilor Gu.

547
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,460
If Zhou Gaolang's army enters the city,

548
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,720
will you really step in

549
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,050
and keep us safe?

550
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,730
Following my order

551
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,290
is your only way out right now.

552
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,280
Step back!

553
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,400
Luo Zishang.

554
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,600
You lost.

555
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,640
I lost.

556
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,050
Gu Jiusi.

557
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,210
Do you really think

558
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,720
you have won?

559
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,970
Do you think you can use those

560
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,210
flowery words

561
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,790
about the support and objection of people

562
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,280
to criticize me now?

563
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,420
I'm not criticizing you.

564
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,590
I just want you to know why you have failed.

565
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,050
Your last move

566
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,280
has been unraveled by me.

567
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,700
It's still too early for you to be happy.

568
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,090
My last move

569
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,740
was not the Yongzhou private army.

570
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,290
I've already surrounded the entire hall

571
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,530
with gunpowder.

572
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,060
As soon as I ignite the fuse,

573
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,840
the hall will

574
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,630
explode and collapse within seconds.

575
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,930
None of us

576
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,960
can escape.

577
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,240
Where is it?

578
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,740
What should we do?

579
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,660
We're fighting for the world after all.

580
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,390
It's inevitable that we put our lives on the line.

581
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,770
Till the last moment,

582
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,740
you will never know if you will rule the world,

583
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,360
or be executed.

584
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,770
It's common

585
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,710
for failure to result in death.

586
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,720
But in the end,

587
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,280
I can take at least one person with me.

588
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,680
And I

589
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
only want to take one person with me.

590
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,770
Be good, Boss Liu.

591
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,960
Otherwise Gu Jiusi

592
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
will die

593
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,440
with us.

594
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,620
The rest of you should leave now.

595
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,090
Leave!

596
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,060
Do you want to

597
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,080
die with us?

598
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,760
All of you, leave the hall!

599
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,050
Gu Jiusi.

600
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,060
What are you waiting for?

601
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,280
Run.

602
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,220
Run for your life.

603
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,920
Let Yuru go.

604
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,400
I lost.

605
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,730
I don't want

606
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,520
the world anymore.

607
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,880
Boss Liu,

608
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,830
you always think I'm not a good person.

609
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,690
But only for you,

610
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,160
I gave you many chances.

611
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,810
I let you off again and again.

612
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,160
But today,

613
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,680
I won't let you go anymore.

614
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,890
Just die with me.

615
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,080
The person you hate is me.

616
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,960
Kill me.

617
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,020
Let Yuru go!

618
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,330
Yes, I do hate you.

619
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,040
So, after she dies with me,

620
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,810
I want you to live well.

621
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,930
I want you to live a long life.

622
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,260
I want you to experience

623
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,920
the taste of failure forever!

624
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,730
Jiusi.

625
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,640
Leave! All of you!

626
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,890
Luo Zishang.

627
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,410
Why are you still getting the innocent involved

628
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,760
at this point?

629
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,440
Shut up.

630
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,720
Gu Jiusi.

631
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,400
The Gu family

632
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,080
owes me

633
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,290
and my mother

634
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,280
an apology.

635
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,020
Since he couldn't marry Luo Yishui,

636
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,739
why did he have to provoke her?

637
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,860
Since he had provoked her,

638
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,190
why didn't he marry her?

639
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
Since he brought me into this world,

640
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,260
why couldn't he

641
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,280
teach and raise me properly?

642
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Why were you born

643
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,699
to live a luxurious life,

644
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:24,170
while I

645
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,239
had to witness all the evil

646
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,570
and suffer all the hardships in the world?

647
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,639
I was wrong.

648
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,210
I've let the people down.

649
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,850
But your Gu family.

650
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,159
should apologize to us.

651
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,320
Luo Zishang.

652
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,480
If the Gu family apologizes to you,

653
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,500
will you put your sword away?

654
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,780
You want me to stop my carnage

655
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,400
just for a mere apology?

656
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,850
Are you dreaming?

657
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,780
We have found out that Luo Zishang

658
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,940
plans to hold the Emperor hostage

659
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,120
and kill the three troops.

660
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
He is cruel beyond means.

661
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,660
Uncle, you must be careful in the Eastern Capital.

662
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,860
This child has made

663
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,360
a grave mistake.

664
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,050
It's unforgivable.

665
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,560
It's all my fault.

666
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,740
I brought this monster

667
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,360
into this world.

668
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,090
I must

669
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,890
end him myself.

670
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,320
Yes.

671
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,840
I lost.

672
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,200
But you, Gu Jiusi, and Jiang He.

673
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,130
You didn't win either.

674
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,770
None of us won.

675
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,060
Zhou Gaolang is storming his way here,

676
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,440
filled with hatred.

677
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,980
He will surely attack the Imperial City

678
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,090
and kill Fan Yu.

679
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,480
In the eyes of everyone,

680
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,860
he will just be a reckless man who usurped power and killed the Emperor.

681
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,210
No one will obey him.

682
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,900
By then, the 13 states

683
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,500
will split up again

684
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,770
and war between them will never rest.

685
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,600
Chaos

686
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,560
will plague this world again!

687
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,560
Mingyi, do it!

688
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,270
You should leave first.

689
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,890
I have something to tell him.

690
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,490
Go to the Imperial Prison

691
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,890
and rescue Ye Shi'an.

692
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,440
Soon,

693
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,380
General Zhou Gaolang will arrive at the city.

694
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,840
You need to get ready.

695
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,570
What else

696
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,930
do you have to say

697
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,070
to someone who has suffered utter defeat?

698
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,410
Do you remember?

699
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,130
When we first met,

700
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,520
I told you

701
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,900
you didn't look like Yishui.

702
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,120
But

703
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,210
you resembled me a lot.

704
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,650
I'm sorry.

705
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,520
But I didn't lie to you.

706
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,040
Your mother

707
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,700
was the only woman

708
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,400
I've ever wanted to marry.

709
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,330
We loved each other back then.

710
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,490
Her reputation

711
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,140
was ruined

712
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,270
by a damn crazed man.

713
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,320
These are all true.

714
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,570
I also told you

715
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,890
I hate your

716
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,280
father who abandoned you.

717
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,490
I hate

718
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,760
the person who ruined Yishui.

719
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,040
I wish he were caught in the fire.

720
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,410
I wish he were devoured by it

721
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,850
in a slow agonizing death.

722
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,040
It's all true.

723
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,000
I provoked her,

724
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,160
but I didn't marry her.

725
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,290
And you mistook Gu Langhua

726
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,370
as your biological father.

727
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,530
You're mistaken.

728
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,440
I'm the one

729
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,290
who started all of this.

730
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,080
It's you.

731
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,920
It's me.

732
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,850
In this life,

733
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,080
I plotted, schemed,

734
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,080
and calculated my every move.

735
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,490
But in the end,

736
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,390
I was wrong about everything.

737
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,720
Only when you created the chaos in Yangzhou

738
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,880
did I realize that

739
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,760
Yishui and I

740
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,600
had a son.

741
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,800
But it's too late.

742
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,000
I never taught you for a single day,

743
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,720
but you have committed a heinous sin

744
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,660
and turned yourself into

745
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,560
an irredeemable monster.

746
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,920
Today,

747
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,280
I'll kill you myself.

748
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,480
However,

749
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,340
I will compensate you

750
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,970
with my life.

751
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,840
Son!

752
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,450
Son.

753
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,810
It's not supposed to be like this.

754
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,290
Son!

755
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,350
Don't come closer!

756
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,290
But

757
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,120
you need to know one thing.

758
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,970
Your mother

759
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,040
really loved you.

760
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,600
When we were in love,

761
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,280
she imagined the appearance

762
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,830
of her future child several times.

763
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,320
She really loved you.

764
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,560
And I

765
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,800
loved your mother very much.

766
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,840

00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,180
my brother back then,

I would have witnessed your birth,

771
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,680
and accompanied you as you grew up.
