[Episode 25]

4
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,990
I'm here to save you.

5
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,670
Let me help you put it on.

6
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,240
Did Sister Yuru send you here?

7
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,350
Yes.

8
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,230
What?

9
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,630
Are you hurt?

10
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,990
This is not my blood.

11
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,980
It's Wang Shanquan's blood.

12
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,870
I killed him.

13
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,790
Impressive.

14
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,340
My sworn sister's sister

15
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,800
is indeed extraordinary.

16
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,260
Don't be afraid.

17
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,300
The first time killing people

18
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,030
is like this.

19
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,060
It's normal that you're not used to it.

20
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,520
Wipe that bad guy's blood,

21
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,740
and you'll be fine.

22
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,270
Let's go.

23
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,990
My sworn sister is waiting.

24
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,780
Young Master Luo.

25
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,260
You're finally back.

26
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,870
I knew it.

27
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,940
Father shouldn't

28
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,380
have quarreled with you

29
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,510
and driven you away.

30
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,750
Now, Father is gone.

31
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,820
However, Young Master Luo,

32
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,680
you can help me.

33
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,240
We can share Yangzhou.

34
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,940
Young Master Luo.

35
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm different from my father.

36
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,290
I'm also very different

37
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,620
from my other brothers.

38
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,230
You know, Young Master,

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,100
I'm the commander of Yangzhou.

40
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,860
I'm in sole charge of

41
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,740
Yangzhou.

42
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Young Master Luo.

43
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,160
I'll definitely treat you

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,380
as my welcomed guest.

45
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,790
Go spread the word.

46
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,180
Commissioner Wang Shanquan's

47
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,350
third son, Wang Ai,

48
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,540
maintained an army and defied orders from the central government,

49
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,430
and intended to rebel like Lord Liang.

50
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,220
He has been executed.

51
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,230
The one who killed the rebel

52
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,630
is Luo Zishang.

53
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,270
Yes.

54
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,930
What's wrong?

55
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
It's Luo Zishang.

56
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,710
When did he return to Yangzhou?

57
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,480
And when did he appear at the dock?

58
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,780
It looks like

59
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,070
he's seeing us off.

60
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,310
Boss Liu.

61
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,310
Thank you for your help.

62
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
See you.

63
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,430
My Lady.

64
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,900
Have a bite.

65
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,150
Put it down.

66
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,000
Ever since you heard the news from Yangzhou,

67
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,670
you haven't eaten anything

68
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,620
or slept.

69
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,640
You've been sitting here all night long.

70
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,400
If your condition gets worse,

71
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,570
when Young Madam comes back,

72
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,990
she'll blame me.

73
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,980
My Lady.

74
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,530
The more serious the situation is,

75
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,860
the more you should take care of yourself.

76
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,060
This...

77
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,620
This will be for the good of them.

78
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,510
Yuru and Jiusi

79
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,580
made a written pledge

80
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,640
in order to save the Gu family.

81
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,380
Today is the last day.

82
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,510
If Yuru

83
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,790
couldn't make it back,

84
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,270
I'll definitely

85
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,250
go

86
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,420
with them.

87
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,030
My Lady!

88
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:32,909
Ruixue.

89
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,700
You're a good girl.

90
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,350
You never left,

91
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,940
even though the Gu family had ups and downs.

92
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,620
If this fatal calamity

93
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,340
really happens to us,

94
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,310
just leave.

95
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,500
I've prepared the travel expenses

96
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,790
for you.

97
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,110
My Lady.

98
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,830
Don't say that.

99
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,050
Heaven will help a good person like Young Madam.

100
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,150
She will be fine.

101
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,220
You will be safe too, My Lady.

102
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,580
If...

103
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,900
If it should happen,

104
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,070
no matter where you go, My Lady,

105
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,570
I will be with you

106
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,740
and take care of you.

107
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,920
♫I implore the moon to be bright and the wind to be gentle♫

108
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,710
♫Lightly shine on my beloved♫

109
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,540

111
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,210
Yuru.

112
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,790
Mother.

113
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,180
You're finally back.

114
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,990
Mother.

115
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,140
All is well now that you're back.

116
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,900
Madam Yue.

117
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,380
Yuru.

118
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,630
You're back.

119
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,660
How have you been, Madam Yue?

120
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,060
Can you sleep

121
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,390
at night?

122
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,020
I'm okay.

123
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,790
Not bad.

124
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,140
Yuru.

125
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,490
I've been worried about your safety.

126
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,460
I've cut out meat and prayed for you every day.

127
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,060
It's great that you're back.

128
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,300
I'll go burn incense and thank the gods for answering my prayers.

129
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,910
No need.

130
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,090
Someone wants to see you.

131
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,940
Who is it?

132
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,150
Yinhong.

133
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,710
Let's go.

134
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,020
Let's go.

135
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,660
Help!

136
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,310
Eldest Madam!

137
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,420
Help me, Zhao!

138
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
Zhao, help me!

139
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,330
Mother, save Eldest...

140
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,010
Help me, Zhao!

141
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,540
Eldest Madam, take my hand.

142
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,650
Zhao!

143
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,940
Get Yuzhao back.

144
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,820
Zhao!

145
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,780
Take care of yourself!

146
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,220
Let's go!

147
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,050
Zhao!

148
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,140
-Let's go!/N-Eldest Madam!

149
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,020
Eldest Madam!

150
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,100
Zhao!

151
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,110
Let's go!

152
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,870
Zhao!

153
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,290
Eldest Madam.

154
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,670
Can I

155
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,550
have a few words with you alone?

156
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,460
You gave up on a dying woman.

157
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,220
It's no different from killing her.

158
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,820
We have nothing to say to you.

159
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,680
Save your words for the court.

160
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,300
Zhang Yue'er.

161
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
I will interrogate you personally.

162
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,700
Although you don't deserve to die,

163
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,020
exile and servitude

164
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,510
will be inevitable.

165
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,180
Eldest Madam.

166
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,470
I'm begging you.

167
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,900
For the sake of

168
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,230
us both being mothers,

169
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,740
give me a chance.

170
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,780
I'll just say a few words.

171
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,790
Just a few words.

172
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,150
Let me finish,

173
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,230
and I'll be willing to die.

174
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,470
Just say it here.

175
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,070
Eldest Madam.

176
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,460
I know that

177
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
I deserve to die.

178
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,070
I made many mistakes.

179
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,500
But no matter how bad I am,

180
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,310
my heart for my children

181
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,030
is the same as yours.

182
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,940
Yuzhao, Yuying, and Yumao.

183
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,540
These three children

184
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,280
were brought up

185
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,430
solely by me.

186
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,830
Maybe for them,

187
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,910
having a mother like me

188
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,260
is the most unfortunate thing

189
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,060
that could happen in their life.

190
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,860
But from today on,

191
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,620
even a mother like this

192
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,580
won't be there for them anymore.

193
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,020
Eldest Madam.

194
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,400
You are kind-hearted.

195
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,660
I beg you.

196
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,480
Please take them in

197
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,060
and take care of them.

198
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,660
From now on,

199
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
you'll be their real mother.

200
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,060
Consider me dead.

201
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,030
No.

202
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,870
Just take it as

203
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,120
I've never existed in this world.

204
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:17,990
OK?

205
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,900
OK.

206
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,840
I promise I'll take care of the three of them.

207
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,150
But it's not because you begged me.

208
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,390
It's because I'm also a mother.

209
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,700
I watched

210
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,100
the three of them grow up.

211
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,770
Although some of them

212
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,100
have been misled by you,

213
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,860
they're still young.

214
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,760
They are not hopeless.

215
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,420
Thank you, Eldest Madam.

216
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,700
Mother.

217
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Mother.

218
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,590
I beg you to

219
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,030
teach them well.

220
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,940
Don't let them

221
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,870
become someone like me.

222
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,840
From now on,

223
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,980
listen to Eldest Madam.

224
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,340
Take me to the court.

225
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,580
Mother!

226
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,140
-Mother!/N-Mother!

227
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,510
Mother!

228
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,600
Eldest Sister.

229
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
We're guilty too.

230
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,740
We've been holding out on you.

231
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,200
We should be punished too.

232
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,630
To be honest,

233
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,270
if my mother didn't make it...

234
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,500
But now that I know the truth,

235
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,950
I will never forgive you.

236
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,980
In this world,

237
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,750
not everything

238
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,390
can be turned around

239
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,500
and made up for.

240
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
But fortunately,

241
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,140
my mother is still alive.

242
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,270
As long as you

243
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,630
repent sincerely,

244
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,380
and be honest

245
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,390
and kind,

246
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,340
I'm willing to be your sister again.

247
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,920
But the three of you

248
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,700
are different.

249
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,380
Mao is still young.

250
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,140
It's forgivable that

251
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,510
a little kid

252
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,910
didn't want to disobey his mother.

253
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,180
Yuzhao is repentant.

254
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,720
I can forgive her, too.

255
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,620
As for Yuying.

256
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,670
Your personality

257
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,660
is the most similar to Madam Yue.

258
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,540
You've always been

259
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,510
mean and duplicitous.

260
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,540
I can keep you here

261
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,260
and let you learn to do business

262
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,100
in Huarong,

263
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,140
and learn the way of making your own living.

264
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,470
Or, I can give you a dowry

265
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,790
and find you a good husband.

266
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,290
Whether you'll follow me or not,

267
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,380
you have to

268
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,140
choose the right road

269
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,780
in the future.

270
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,630
You and Yuzhao

271
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,580
were both given birth by her.

272
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,180
You've been eating and sleeping together since childhood.

273
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,240
Everything has been the same for you,

274
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,290
but you have completely different temperaments.

275
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,220
It shows that a person's origin

276
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,220
is not important.

277
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,060
The road

278
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,760
is completely chosen by themselves.

279
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,740
Got it.

280
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,760
Eldest Sister.

281
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,270
[Commissioner's Mansion]

282
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,130
[Clean and Sharp]

283
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,820
His Majesty passed away?

284
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,220
Yes.

285
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,630
There was supposed to be a solemn funeral.

286
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,220
But that rebel Lord Liang's army

287
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,980
is still besieging Eastern Capital,

288
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,310
and fighting intensely

289
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,830
with the Youzhou Army.

290
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,520
Other prefectures

291
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,260
can only observe from the side.

292
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,740
They're waiting to choose sides

293
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,050
when the situation is clearer.

294
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,850
Not to mention a solemn funeral.

295
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,480
In troubled times,

296
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,600
people can only take care of themselves.

297
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,220
But now,

298
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,109
the Crown Prince is regent.

299
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,230
The Crown Prince is narrow-minded

300
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,109
and useless.

301
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,060
Knowing that Lord Liang was coming,

302
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,420
he has been terrified.

303
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,540
Once His Majesty

304
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,829
passed away,

305
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,920
he ran away overnight.

306
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,109
Now Eastern Capital's trouble

307
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,910
is both internal and external.

308
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,190
I'm afraid my father and Uncle Fan

309
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,030
are deeply distraught.

310
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,170
But Lord Liang's army

311
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,060
already approached Eastern Capital last year.

312
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,500
Now it's already spring, but the city hasn't been taken down yet.

313
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,060
Even if he has a strong army,

314
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,140
he won't last long.

315
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,070
Looks like

316
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,980
Commissioner Fan and General Zhou

317
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,840
are about to have a great victory.

318
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,350
Thanks to Yuru,

319
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,500
who went south to raise military provisions

320
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,220
to provide

321
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,460
a steady flow of military provisions for the front line.

322
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,620
If it were not for her,

323
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,380
I'm afraid the front line would have been in critical condition.

324
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,180
If so, Youzhou

325
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,940
would be in trouble, too.

326
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,940
By the way,

327
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,810
I just checked.

328
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,580
The last batch of grains has been stored too.

329
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,380
I'm reporting to you

330
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,380
on behalf of Yuru.

331
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,780
Why is it you this time?

332
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,940
Where is Yuru?

333
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,090
She's with my mother-in-law.

334
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,490
She and her mother finally got together after her mother almost died.

335
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,950
They have a lot to catch up.

336
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,420
That's right.

337
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,710
When I have time,

338
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,850
I should prepare a welcome dinner

339
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,660
for Yuru.

340
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,710
This time,

341
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,070
she made a significant contribution.

342
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,200
The welcome dinner can be put on hold.

343
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,460
Now that you're in charge of Youzhou's affairs,

344
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,120
I want to ask you for a position

345
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,730
in the name of

346
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,460
Yuru.

347
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,380
It's not for me,

348
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,380
but for

349
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,670
an extraordinarily talented man.

350
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,340
By the way,

351
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,090
the commissioner and General Zhou

352
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,380
led the army to fight out there,

353
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,530
and they transported so many provisions out.

354
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,380
But the grain price

355
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,270
in Youzhou

356
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,710
has been dropping.

357
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,240
Don't you know?

358
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,710
Boss Liu of Huarong,

359
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,080
Magistrate Gu's wife.

360
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,070
She went to Jiangnan alone

361
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,220
and raised 15,000,000 kilograms of provisions.

362
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,420
It's all thanks to her.

363
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,020
No wonder.

364
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,180
The couple also made a great contribution

365
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,900
to bandit suppression on Heifeng Mountain last time.

366
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,790
The couple is

367
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,360
really Youzhou's heroes.

368
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,270
Yes.

369
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,510
It's a blessing to Youzhou.

370
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,840
Brother Gu.

371
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,710
Why are you here?

372
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,570
You came at the right time.

373
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,890
I have some good news for you.

374
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,690
Let's talk inside.

375
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,260
No need.

376
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,620
I'm here to say goodbye.

377
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,020
Goodbye?

378
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,510
My sister is a weak girl.

379
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,460
It's not appropriate for her to travel around with me.

380
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,380
So I want to

381
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,620
entrust her

382
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,640
to you and Yuru.

383
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,150
I can also rest assured.

384
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,840
When I have the chance,

385
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,100
I'll come back to see her.

386
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,100
Where are you going then?

387
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
To be honest, I haven't decided yet.

388
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,200
But in this vast world,

389
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,180
there must be a place for me.

390
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,780
I just

391
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,350
got you a position

392
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
to be my secretary

393
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,230
and work for Youzhou together.

394
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,430
Why are you leaving?

395
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,700
I was born in a scholars' family.

396
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,740
My grandfather was a famous scholar in Jiangnan.

397
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,420
And I

398
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,220
have been well-read since I was little.

399
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,590
However, I accidentally

400
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,520
got under the rebel Wang Shanquan's command

401
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,960
and worked for him.

402
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,070
I've ruined the reputation

403
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,550
of myself and my family.

404
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,670
And now,

405
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
Commissioner of Youzhou, Fan Xuan,

406
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,860
is deeply conscious of righteousness

407
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,860
and sent troops to save the emperor.

408
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,180
He shouldn't have

409
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,550
a traitor like me

410
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,140
work for him.

411
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,950
Otherwise,

412
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,100
he won't be able to convince the people.

413
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,740
Ye Shi'an.

414
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,760
I've always looked down on you since childhood.

415
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,010
It's exactly because of

416
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,610
your pretentious attitude.

417
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,180
What are you holding onto the

418
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,490
pretentious reputation

419
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,700
for?

420
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,090
You are well-educated and knowledgeable.

421
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,260
Why are you still

422
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,460
so dumb and stubborn?

423
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,860
So in your eyes,

424
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,560
what's said in the classics,

425
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,340
like worrying about the country and the people,

426
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,300
is all cynical and empty talk?

427
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,190
Thank you for being frank with me, Brother Gu.

428
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,100
Goodbye.

429
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,340
Do you know

430
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,200
when I changed my thoughts of you?

431
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,020
It was when you surrendered to Wang Shanquan

432
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,540
to protect your family.

433
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,740
It was when you endured the humiliation

434
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,180
under Wang Shanquan's command, and planned secretly

435
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,700
to save so many people

436
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,430
and the literati of Jiangnan.

437
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,140
I suddenly felt like

438
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,270
you, Ye Shi'an, are really something.

439
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,330
You are a loyal

440
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,030
and courageous person.

441
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,430
Many people may not know

442
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,870
what you did.

443
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,810
But you know it yourself.

444
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,700
Your family knows it.

445
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,980
God knows it.

446
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,110
Ye Shi'an.

447
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,330
You've been studying all your life.

448
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,700
Isn't it for the world

449
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,190
and the people?

450
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,390
Can you really bear to

451
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,070
hand the country and the people

452
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,810
over to someone

453
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,030
like Luo Zishang

454
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,380
to wreck

455
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,550
and degrade?

456
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,510
No, I can't.

457
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,580
Young Master.

458
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,570
I didn't expect that

459
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,220
as a scholar,

460
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,980
you have calluses from archery practice all over your hands.

461
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,040
In troubled times,

462
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,990
scholars are the most useless.

463
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,790
If I'm defenseless,

464
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,760
so what if I'm knowledgeable?

465
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,900
I need to have the real ability

466
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,230
to protect our country.

467
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,830
You've been with me all day.

468
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,100
Don't you have things you need to do?

469
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,640
Even if I do, I won't go.

470
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,590
I finally found my mother.

471
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,540
I just want to be with you all day.

472
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,690
You're already the hostess of the Gu family

473
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,590
and a big boss.

474
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,000
Why are you still acting like a child?

475
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,120
Those who have mothers are supposed to be children.

476
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,990
Is Yuying's dowry ready?

477
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,110
Yes.

478
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,550
I also put in

479
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,430
an extra gold bracelet for her.

480
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,590
You are so kind.

481
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,340
You married her into a good family,

482
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,670
and added to her dowry.

483
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,220
She asked to get married far from us.

484
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,940
I think

485
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,590
she's too ashamed to see us.

486
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,880
We won't see each other again.

487
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,550
Our kinship is over.

488
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,190
It's okay if I

489
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,130
gave her some more money.

490
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,840
It's good that she's gone.

491
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,300
This child

492
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,900
is a bit more scheming

493
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,070
than Zhao and Mao.

494
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,430
What worries me the most now

495
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,620
is Yun'er.

496
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,120
Since she came to Youzhou,

497
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,330
she's been staying in seclusion all day.

498
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,930
I visited her several times,

499
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,870
but she didn't even open the door.

500
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,880
She was wronged badly.

501
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,140
It's understandable that she'd take things too hard for a while.

502
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,270
I've asked the maid

503
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,550
to keep her company.

504
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,910
Shen Ming

505
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,020
is keeping an eye on her outside the door all day, too.

506
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,950
I won't let her do anything stupid.

507
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,860
How about

508
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,620
I visit her again today?

509
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,540
Sister.

510
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,700
You're finally here.

511
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,780
Can you appoint me to something else?

512
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,470
I'm

513
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,220
bored to death here.

514
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,980
Do you have any grudges against someone,

515
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,090
or did someone offend you lately?

516
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,550
I can go fight them for you.

517
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,900
Or, can you

518
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,390
let me out for a walk?

519
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,460
No.

520
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,020
Just stay here.

521
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,900
Keep an eye on Yun'er. Don't go anywhere.

522
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,810
Take care of it immediately

523
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,030
if anything happens.

524
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,140
I'll hold you accountable

525
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,470
if anything goes wrong.

526
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,340
Okay.

527
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,910
What's this?

528
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,710
It's not for you.

529
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,100
Yun'er.

530
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,470
I'm Yuru.

531
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,620
Open the door.

532
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,820
Let me come in

533
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,700
and talk to you.

534
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,620
Sister Yuru.

535
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,470
I'm not feeling well today.

536
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,760
Maybe another day.

537
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,740
Didn't the doctor give you a checkup yesterday?

538
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,670
What did he say?

539
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,820
Let me in

540
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,030
and tell me.

541
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,780
It's nothing.

542
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,260
By the way,

543
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,180
I brought you a pot of plum wine.

544
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,460
I made it myself.

545
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,940
I remember

546
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,740
you liked

547
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,340
the plum wine I made the best.

548
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,510
Keep it, Sister.

549
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,310
It's bitter in my mouth.

550
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,920
I won't know how it tastes.

551
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,260
Fine.

552
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,030
Have a good rest.

553
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,130
If you want to talk to me,

554
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,260
come to me anytime.

555
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,300
Take care, Sister.

556
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,670
Yun'er.

557
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,220
I want to tell you that

558
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,900
when we were leaving Yangzhou,

559
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,100
you killed our enemy.

560
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,290
You are resolute, smart,

561
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,220
and courageous.

562
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,030
I was really impressed.

563
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,260
If Old Madam Ye were still alive,

564
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,520
she would be very happy

565
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,260
and want to make a toast to you, too,

566
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,790
saying that you're truly her granddaughter.

567
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,910
Kid.

568
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
As long as I'm still in the Ye family,

569
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,460
nothing will happen.

570
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,510
Let's go.

571
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,560
Sister.

572
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,420
Sister, take care.

573
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,500
What's that sound?

574
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,390
Why does it sound so bad?

575
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,390
Young Master Shen.

576
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,900
Miss Ye sends her greetings to you

577
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,420
and asks you to stop blowing the leaves.

578
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,030
Why?

579
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,100
I'm bored, so I blew the leaves.

580
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
What harm did I do?

581
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,780
Go again.

582
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,920
Young Master Shen.

583
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,300
Miss Ye is upset now.

584
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,620
Please be kind

585
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,910
and stop blowing.

586
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,180
She keeps herself

587
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
inside the house all day long.

588
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,620
How can she not be upset?

589
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,380
She doesn't feel bored,

590
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,820
and she won't allow others to do things to ease the boredom.

591
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,950
So domineering.

592
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,830
Besides,

593
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,020
my sister simply asked me to guard her.

594
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,300
She didn't ask me to listen to her.

595
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,660
If she wants to say something,

596
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,860
let her come out here and say it herself.

597
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,860
Can you stop blowing?

598
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,420
You were out of tune, don't you know?

599
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,520
I thought

600
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,590
you wanted to

601
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,020
keep yourself inside the house forever

602
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,080
and never come out.

603
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,710
But you're out now.

604
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,780
This is great.

605
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,790
Turns out

606
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,580
it's not that hard

607
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,990
to get out of this room.

608
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,940
The story of raising provisions in Yangzhou

609
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,940
is so good that it can be included in the story-telling script.

610
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,220
The timing, place and people

611
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,420
are all so favorable.

612
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,580
I didn't expect that

613
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,910
it would go so smoothly.

614
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,990
It's just...

615
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,440
It's just what?

616
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,540
It went too smoothly.

617
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,070
Maybe I'm overthinking.

618
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,620
Sister.

619
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,380
You're smart and resourceful.

620
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,770
Young Master Ye worked from the inside.

621
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,750
Plus, I'm brave and capable.

622
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,260
And Young Master Ye's sister,

623
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,180
a weak woman,

624
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,660
made an epic move

625
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,620
and assassinated Wang Shanquan.

626
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,140
Of course it went smoothly.

627
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,940
Wait a minute.

628
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,440
Who killed Wang Shanquan?

629
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,280
Young Master Ye's sister.

630
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,180
Yun'er has never even dared

631
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,010
to look at the scene of a chicken or fish being killed.

632
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,610
I didn't expect that either.

633
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,060
But the version I heard is that

634
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,420
it was Wang Shanquan's staff,

635
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,860
Luo Zishang, who killed him.

636
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,570
After Luo Zishang killed Wang Shanquan,

637
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,330
he also killed

638
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,180
the military commander of Yangzhou Army,

639
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,830
Wang Ai.

640
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,340
Wang Shanquan has

641
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,540
19 children in total.

642
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,300
They either died or escaped.

643
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,630
Now,

644
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:33,620
Luo Zishang is in sole charge

645
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,790
of Yangzhou.

646
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,510
It's a rumor, right?

647
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,580
Wang Shanquan

648
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,780
wasn't killed by him.

649
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,400
It can't be a rumor.

650
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,980
The military information I received

651
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,040
couldn't be wrong.

652
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,330
If it was really Young Master Ye's sister

653
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,790
who killed Wang Shanquan,

654
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,140
Luo Zishang

655
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,180
must have deliberately made up this lie

656
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,260
to tell the world.

657
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,810
During your stay in Yangzhou,

658
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,070
Luo Zishang wasn't there the whole time?

659
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,990
Right until the end,

660
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,280
when I was leaving.

661
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,620
He came to the dock to see me off from afar.

662
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,220
He only brought one attendant with him.

663
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,140
He looked

664
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,990
very calm.

665
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,740
So when did he

666
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,670
leave Yangzhou?

667
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,260
After the chaos took place in Yangzhou,

668
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,310
you all ran away.

669
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,310
The city

670
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,490
completely

671
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,940
got in the hands of Wang Shanquan.

672
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,900
He started to feel like Luo Zishang is an eyesore.

673
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,960
I was forced to get under his command.

674
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,810
One time,

675
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,640
I overheard

676
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,550
them quarrel.

677
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,250
Luo Zishang thought

678
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,530
Wang Shanquan should

679
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,790
be far-sighted.

680
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,140
But

681
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,100
Wang Shanquan only wanted

682
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,430
to be the local emperor.

683
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,100
Gradually,

684
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,450
he also started to feel like Luo Zishang

685
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,310
is ruthless.

686
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,500
He was afraid that he'd be killed if he kept Luo by his side.

687
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,760
So not long after that,

688
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,300
he expelled Luo Zishang from Yangzhou.

689
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,940
Everything went so smoothly in Yangzhou.

690
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,020
I think Luo Zishang

691
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,380
must have helped from the side.

692
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,580
He claimed to want to become

693
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,980
the top merchant in the world

694
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,380
and help Wang Shanquan dominate Yangzhou.

695
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,350
Now it seems

696
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,220
it was just a guise

697
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,680
to confuse Wang Shanquan.

698
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,460
What he wanted from the beginning

699
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,790
is the entire Yangzhou.

700
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,820
So Wang Shanquan

701
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,860
was something he abandoned

702
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,990
at this point?

703
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,860
It's very likely.

704
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,620
So what?

705
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,020
He's not

706
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,780
a legitimate commissioner.

707
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,949
Now,

708
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,230
Eastern Capital is temporarily in chaos.

709
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,340
So he's taking over the city for now.

710
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,909
When the world is stable again,

711
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,380
what should he do?

712
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,960
I don't understand it either.

713
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,389
Luo Zishang is treacherous.

714
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,179
When he takes a step, he has thought about five steps further.

715
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,060
But there must be something bigger

716
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
behind this.

717
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:50,670
She needs no loud red on common green boughs

718
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,580
to be found her blossoms blessed with the best.

719
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,990
I've traveled all over the world.

720
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,110
She's not a beauty of beauty.

721
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,860
But in this world,

722
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,070
no woman can compare with her.

723
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,530
Master, you have great ambitions.

724
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,260
Will you be tied down by a woman?

725
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,110
Of course not.

726
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,590
I'll get

727
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,580
what I want in the end.

728
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,780
When I own the world,

729
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,790
she will naturally be mine as well.

730
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,720
[Commissioner's Mansion]

731
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,270
Brother Zhou Ye.

732
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,300
This is a military letter from the front line

733
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,010
sent by Father.

734
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,710
Take a look.

735
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,810
[Ten days ago, the rebels led by Lord Liang were completely wiped out in Eastern Capital.]

736
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,750
Ten days ago,

737
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,780
the rebels led by Lord Liang

738
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,020
were completely defeated in Eastern Capital.

739
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,170
Father is about to win.

740
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,200
In the future,

741
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,530
he'll be a meritorious official since he saved the emperor.

742
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,530
Maybe we can all become officials

743
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,660
in Eastern Capital.

744
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,720
[Ten days ago, the rebels led by Lord Liang were completely wiped out in Eastern Capital.]

745
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,910
Something's wrong.

746
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,860
What's wrong?

747
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,300
Lord Liang's army was defeated.

748
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,940
The main force is still there, and the provisions are not used up.

749
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,870
At this time,

750
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,130
how could they

751
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:27,990
give up Jingji?

752
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,540
I think

753
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,550
there must be something wrong.

754
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,540
We can't act rashly.

755
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,740
Indeed.

756
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,900
It has been ten days since

757
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,980
Lord Liang's army was defeated in Eastern Capital.

758
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,930
But there hasn't been any news about

759
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,980
any of the prefectures fighting against them.

760
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,070
This means

761
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,900
they are very likely

762
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,940
to be heading towards...

763
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,630
Youzhou.

764
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,140
That's right.

765
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,460
They couldn't conquer the front line.

766
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,820
So they want to use the lives of Youzhou's Young Master

767
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,180
and the people of the city

768
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,510
to threaten Commissioner Fan to retreat.

769
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,060
This...

770
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,700
I'll write a letter right away

771
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,020
to notify the front line.

772
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,820
Report!

773
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,500
Young General.

774
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,500
Lord Liang has led a force of 100,000 soldiers

775
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,420
across the border of Youzhou,

776
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,020
and they're heading to Wangdu.

777
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,910
100,000?

778
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,820
Yes.

779
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
What should we do?

780
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,050
How many soldiers do we have in the city?

781
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,810
The main forces of Youzhou

782
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,460
are all saving the emperor at the front line.

783
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,900
Now there are only 10,000 soldiers left

784
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,990
in Wangdu.

785
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,540
This...

786
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,420
With such a large gap in military force,

787
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,420
aren't we destined

788
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,380
to lose?

789
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:26,700
Yu'er.

790
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,900
Pack your things

791
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,080
and get out of here.

792
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,220
But...

793
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,300
But what?

794
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,460
Now, we have to focus on the big picture.

795
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,150
Go!

796
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,740
OK.

797
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,320
Brother Gu.

798
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,060
Take care.

799
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,620
Jiusi.

800
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,580
I'll find someone reliable

801
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,610
to escort Fan Yu

802
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,540
and the letter of help-seeking.

803
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,270
At this time,

804
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,560
I can't leave Youzhou.

805
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,220
Brother.

806
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,110
You should go in person.

807
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,000
Think about it.

808
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,220
What if they don't come

809
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,140
after receiving the letter?

810
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,940
It's a long journey to Wangdu from Eastern Capital.

811
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,500
Lord Liang's army is approaching the city.

812
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,690
Even if they receive the letter,

813
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,290
they'll think it's too late,

814
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,350
and Youzhou is already a dead city.

815
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,980
Jiusi, don't worry.

816
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,260
I will go at top speed.

817
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,300
You must hang in there

818
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,230
until the reinforcements arrive.

819
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,030
No matter what it takes,

820
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,380
we must get them back.

821
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,350
Don't worry.

822
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,940
Yun'er.

823
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,630
Are you feeling better?

824
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,450
I brought some peach gum.

825
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,990
It's good for your health.

826
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,870
Thank you, Sister Yuru.

827
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,540
I'm all right.

828
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,980
You don't have to worry about me.

829
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,980
Why are you being so courteous to me?

830
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,270
The city has been in chaos lately.

831
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,820
I've asked

832
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,300
the wives of the soldiers guarding the city

833
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,900
to move to the charity halls.

834
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,610
For one thing,

835
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,410
they can take care of each other.

836
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,350
For another,

837
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,370
the soldiers

838
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,100
fighting at the front line can be assured since

839
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,700
they don't have to worry about their families.

840
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,060
Your brother has been busy

841
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,500
out there with Jiusi.

842
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,950
I'm really worried

843
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,750
that you're here alone.

844
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,460
Move

845
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,190
to my place as soon as possible.

846
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,180
There are many people there.

847
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,500
I'm good

848
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,560
living here alone.

849
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,300
My condition

850
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,420
is unstable.

851
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,950
It'll be bad

852
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,520
if I infect anyone.

853
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,910
It's nothing.

854
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,460
The current situation is special.

855
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,990
No one will care about that.

856
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,750
Besides,

857
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,860
I'm here.

858
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,590
It's still inappropriate.

859
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,620
If you need my help for anything,

860
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,860
Sister,

861
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,790
just let me know.

862
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,790
It's peaceful for me

863
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,580
to live here alone.

864
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,510
Everything's good.

865
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,740
Fine.

866
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,110
After all,

867
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,260
I want you

868
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,460
to live comfortably.

869
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,140
Take care and get better.

870
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,360
I'll come visit you tomorrow.

871
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,900
There is a prescription

872
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,100
for cooking peach gum

873
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,220
and the food that works against with it inside.

874
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,420
Take good care of her.

875
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,810
Don't worry, Boss.

876
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,660
I will take good care of

877
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,430
Miss Ye.

878
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:18,900
Yun'er.

879
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,230
No matter what happens,

880
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,390
we are sisters.

881
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,430
We're like actual sisters.

882
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,660
Of course.

883
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,310
I'm leaving.

884
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,830
Take care, Boss.

885
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,380
Did you call Sister Yuru "Boss"?

886
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,220
Do you work at Huarong?

887
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,100
No.

888
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,070
I'm a refugee from Qingzhou.

889
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,920
I almost starved to death.

890
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,340
Boss donated her family fortune

891
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,170
and built many charity halls in Youzhou.

892
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,030
Boss saved my life.

893
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,800
Although I'm not good at accounting,

894
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,260
I'm quick

895
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,980
and good at taking care of others.

896
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,780
Usually,

897
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,820
I do flower picking and drug pounding

898
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,980
at Huarong.

899
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,950
Sister Yuru

900
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,230
is still so kind.

901
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,390
Miss Ye.

902
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,740
Boss is worried about you.

903
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,250
The city

904
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,930
is in complete chaos right now.

905
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,780
The charity halls are the safest place.

906
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,230
You should move there.

907
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,520
Those living in the charity halls

908
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,230
are all wives of the soldiers.

909
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,740
Who are they?

910
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,300
And who am I?

911
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,990
You're Boss's sworn sister.

912
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,790
I know that

913
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,260
Sister Yuru treats me well.

914
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,540
But the better she treats me,

915
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,100
the more I can't take it for granted and

916
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,900
drag her down.

917
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,570
I'm a jinx

918
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,570
who has already lost my reputation.

919
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,420
If she

920
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,680
spends a lot of time with someone like me,

921
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,870
I'm afraid others will gossip about her.

922
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:42,550
[Liang]

923
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,530
[Getting Ready for Battle]

924
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,100
The rebels led by Lord Liang are intruding.

925
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,500
A major battle is coming.

926
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,550
Today,

927
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,780
I will go back to Eastern Capital in person to ask for reinforcements.

928
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,440
Therefore,

929
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,500
I'm handing the military power of Youzhou

930
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,780
over to Gu Jiusi.
