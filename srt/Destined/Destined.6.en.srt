00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,030
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,400
Actually,

5
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,710
my father treats me and my mother

6
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,390
badly.

7
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,270
I can see that.

8
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,200
I wanted

9
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,970
to cover up the past

10
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,730
and pretend everything was fine

11
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,540
so as to put my mother's mind at rest

12
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,760
and make her proud.

13
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,789
But I didn't expect...

14
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,260
Your father isn't like a father.

15
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,650
Your family isn't like a family.

16
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,570
I finally understood

17
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,960
why you were so afraid

18
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,130
of getting a divorce on the wedding day.

19
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,980
You've had a close-knit family since childhood.

20
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,579
You're loved by many people.

21
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,030
Of course you didn't know these things.

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,910
Actually, most women in this world

23
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,010
are like me.

24
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,480
We are cautious

25
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,550
and are afraid of making a wrong move.

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,920
But if you are so cautious,

27
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,300
it's not a home.

28
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,910
My mother said

29
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,600
women don't have a home.

30
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,200
Our husbands' homes are not our homes.

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,220
Our parents' homes are not our homes either.

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,130
They're just

33
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,840
places to stay.

34
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,140
I know

35
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,340
you don't like me scheming.

36
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,010
But in this world, no one protects me

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,620
and makes plans for me.

38
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,980
If I hadn't schemed

39
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,540
to have a good marriage for myself,

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,130
maybe

41
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,280
Zhang Yue'er would have sold me to someone

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,750
and made me a concubine.

43
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,020
Then my mother and I

44
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,030
would never be able to change our situation.

45
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,750
I'll protect you from now on.

46
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,680
If anyone dares to bully you,

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,940
I'll break their legs.

48
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,170
Enough.

49
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,730
Stop talking nonsense.

50
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,910
I'm serious.

51
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,560
I know you married me

52
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,290
for your mother.

53
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,810
Anyway,

54
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,540
I've destroyed your marriage.

55
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,640
It's my fault.

56
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,089
Gu Jiusi.

57
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
If you study hard,

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,000
beat Ye Shi'an,

59
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,390
become a senior official,

60
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,650
and earn a title for me,

61
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,070
I'll forgive you.

62
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,650
Okay.

63
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,200
Okay.

64
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,700
Gu Jiusi.

65
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,350
What are you doing?

66
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,130
Nothing.

67
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,490
Then why do you keep turning over?

68
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,370
I'm just unsure of myself.

69
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,840
You want me to beat Ye Shi'an.

70
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,390
I want to keep my promise.

71
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,280
But since I was a kid,

72
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,450
I haven't been good at studying.

73
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,090
This is too difficult for me.

74
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,930
I can't achieve it.

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,460
You can achieve it.

76
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,760
I really can't achieve it.

77
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,210
Actually, since I was a kid,

78
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,080
I've known Ye Shi'an is smarter than me.

79
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,870
Who said Ye Shi'an is smarter than you?

80
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,260
They all said so.

81
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,520
My parents also said so.

82
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,000
You also think so?

83
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,750
I...

84
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,280
I don't know.

85
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,510
But Ye Shi'an has been number one since he was a kid.

86
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,640
He was number one in the private school.

87
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,860
He was number one in the Provincial Examination.

88
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,570
In the future, he'll be number one

89
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,750
in the Metropolitan Examination and the Palace Examination.

90
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,750
Number one. He's always number one.

91
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,750
How dare you laugh.

92
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,270
My Lord, they're wrong.

93
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,210
I know how much time and effort

94
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,550
Ye Shi'an

95
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,230
spent on studying.

96
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,210
I also know how smart you are.

97
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,590
You memorized "Xue Er"

98
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,770
in half an hour.

99
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,160
Even Ye Shi'an

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,820
can't memorize it so quickly.

101
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,770
Usually,

102
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,780
your parents indulge you.

103
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,040
No one forced you once.

104
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,140
I believe

105
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,480
you can also do

106
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,810
what Ye Shi'an can do.

107
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,950
Do you really think

108
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,720
I can achieve it?

109
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,610
Yes, I do.

110
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,280
Fine.

111
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,660
I'll try.

112
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,520
I'll try my best.

113
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,160
Rest early.

114
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,120
Do you really think

115
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,810
I'm smarter than Ye Shi'an?

116
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,760
I'm smarter than Ye Shi'an.

117
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
It smells so good.

118
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,160
You're really good at cooking.

119
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,960
Our Young Master is so lucky.

120
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,720
Thank you.

121
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,450
My Lord.

122
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,600
My Lord, get up.

123
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,560
My Lord. My Lord.

124
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,500
My Lord.

125
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,100
My Lord, get up.

126
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,600
My Lord, you woke up.

127
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,030
I made breakfast.

128
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,830
My Lord, taste it.

129
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,030
You're good at cooking.

130
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,560
I'm glad you like it.

131
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,910
Go and study when you finish eating.

132
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,910
You have 15 books to memorize today.

133
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,750
Study?

134
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,820
Didn't we agree to take a vacation yesterday?

135
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,290
Yes, we did.

136
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,790
But we didn't say when the vacation is.

137
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,150
It's not too late to take a vacation

138
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,790
after the Provincial Examination.

139
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,290
Liu Yuru.

140
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,020
Are you going back on your word?

141
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,490
When a woman gets married,

142
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,210
her honor and disgrace

143
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,630
are tied to her husband.

144
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,320
In the future, I'll be rich if you're rich.

145
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,840
I'll be down-and-out if you're down-and-out.

146
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,140
After all, I'm an ordinary person.

147
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,910
I just want to live a better life.

148
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,790
So pedantic.

149
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,680
I helped you so much yesterday.

150
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,610
Now you're going back on your word.

151
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,170
You're heartless.

152
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,390
My Lord.

153
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,540
You'd better get up and wash up.

154
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,030
If you can't memorize

155
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,470
15 books by night,

156
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,190
you won't have dinner.

157
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,190
Liu Yuru.

158
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,330
Liu Yuru.

159
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,430
I...

160
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,370
Good brother.

161
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,600
You're the only one who can save me.

162
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,710
She's pushing me to death.

163
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,430
I can't stand it anymore.

164
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,280
Exactly.

165
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,410
When donkeys pull mills,

166
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,130
they still need to rest every other day.

167
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,760
Yes.

168
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,500
Who are you calling a donkey?

169
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,700
Blow it.

170
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,180
Wonderful.

171
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,660
If you see

172
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,750
Liu Yuru

173
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,880
go toward the study,

174
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,930
blow the whistle.

175
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,870
Mistaking other people for her is better than not blowing the whistle.

176
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,470
If she catches me slacking off again,

177
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,480
both of us will be toast.

178
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,400
Young Master, don't worry.

179
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,660
Leave it to me.

180
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,920
Enough. Stop playing.

181
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,760
Go.

182
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,000
There're birds chirping in the mansion these days.

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,300
I wonder what kind of birds they are.

184
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,830
They're chirping weirdly.

185
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,880
Maybe because the weather is getting hot,

186
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,080
there're more birds.

187
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,030
Yinhong.

188
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,830
Go to the kitchen and tell the cooks

189
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,640
to cook white fungus soup for my husband.

190
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,370
This soup is good for his lungs.

191
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:21,880
Remember

192
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,560
white fungus soup

193
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,030
should be cooked for a long time

194
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,420
until it's sticky.

195
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,730
My husband has a sweet tooth.

196
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,530
Remember to add more rock sugar.

197
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,140
Young Madam, you're so detail-oriented.

198
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,650
It's like you're raising a son.

199
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,080
You're talking nonsense.

200
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,130
No, I'm not.

201
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,810
If you had married Young Master Ye,

202
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,240
you would definitely have become Madam Jieyuan

203
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,870
without any worry.

204
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,140
There would be no need to work so hard.

205
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,200
Don't say that again.

206
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:47,960
Yes.

207

I know

208
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,200
you're complaining for me.

209
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,030
But no matter what happens,

210
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,290
we should always look on the bright side.

211
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,430
My husband

212
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,650
and Young Master Ye

213
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,450
have different personalities,

214
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,560
but he has his strengths.

215
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,660
Maybe...

216
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,540
Maybe he's better than Young Master Ye.

217
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,540
Young Madam.

218
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,510
In these years,

219
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,350
this is the first time

220
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,200
I've heard you say someone is better than Young Master Ye.

221
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,680
Let me use what happened these days as an example.

222
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,340
If it had been Young Master Ye,

223
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,030
do you think he could have dealt with them?

224
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,920
Because of my husband's family background and martial arts skills,

225
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,010
no one bullies him

226
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,380
when he goes outside.

227
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,960
As a woman,

228
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,770
I have no one to rely on.

229
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,990
I've already married into this family.

230
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,460
If he wants to bully me,

231
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,890
there are many ways.

232
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,030
Why is he

233
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,330
still at my disposal?

234
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,230
Why did he negotiate with me?

235
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,110
What do you think?

236
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,270
That's because he doesn't pull rank on me

237
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,550
and is willing to understand my pain.

238
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,270
He feels guilty,

239
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,070
so he makes concessions again and again.

240
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,520
I'm respected in the Gu family.

241
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,860
It has nothing to do

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,910
with me.

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,150
That's because my husband is kind

244
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,230
and my parents-in-law are wise and reasonable.

246
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,870
I'm grateful to them.

247
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,220
You have to be grateful to them too.

248
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,330
In the future, you have to not only treat me as your mistress,

249
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,590
but also treat my husband as your master.

250
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,860
I understood.

251
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,610
I've told my mother-in-law

252
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,310
I want to live a good life with my husband.

253
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,660
It's not just saying.

254
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,890
My parents-in-law want me to keep an eye on him.

255
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,320
and make him study more.

256
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,230
I heard from my parents-in-law

257
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,080
that my husband was not bad at studying before.

258
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,480
But he focused on practicing martial arts.

259
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,850
I want him to win an official rank in the examination.

260
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,510
It's also a way to repay my parents-in-law for their kindness to me.

261
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,010
Yes.

262
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,810
I didn't think much.

263
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,410
I'll keep what you said in my mind.

I'll deliver it to my husband personally.

He's been studying every day these days.

268
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,930
He's been studying very hard.

269
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,770
I have to treat him

270
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,830
to delicious food.

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,580

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,760
you like to do?

383
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,200
Aren't you bored?

384
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,660
But I'm just a woman.

385
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,090
You're using that as an excuse again.

386
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,480
You're going to say

387
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,070
that women should

388
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,540
rely on other people your whole life,

389
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,090
shouldn't have your own things to do,

390
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,480
and shouldn't live for yourselves.

391
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,650
This is nonsense.

392
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,800
Men and women?

393
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,220
We are all humans.

394
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,250
We humans should have our own interests.

395
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,880
We should have ambitions

396
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,280
which can't be influenced by other people.

397
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,050
Let me use myself as an example.

398
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,940
I've been learning martial arts since childhood. I'm good at martial arts.

399
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,240
Sooner or later

400
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,290
I'll leave this house

401
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,260
and travel around the world

402
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,320
to do good deeds and help the weak.

403
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,500
What about you, Liu Yuru?

404
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,040
What is your ambition?

405
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,530
I... I...

406
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,660
Is it to get married,

407
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,470
force your husband

408
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,440
to study hard,

409
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,160
and become a titled madam?

410
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,850
I...

411
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,640
Forget it.

412
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,870
You didn't keep your word.

413
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,800
I, Gu Jiusi, am as good as my word.

414
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,440
I'll

415
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,240
study for you.

416
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,810
If you want to be a titled madam,

417
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,860
I'll try my best.

418
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,290
I don't want to owe you anything

419
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,220
when we divorce.

420
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
But I don't want to be forced either.

421
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,450
I'm just too tired.

422
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,580
I want to rest.

423
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,770
Gu Jiusi.

424
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,820
You don't have to memorize books.

425
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,830
Go back and rest.

426
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,140
♫I borrowed moonlight♫

427
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,470
♫From fireflies♫

428
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,030
♫I held it in my arms♫

429
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,450
Why not?

430
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,590
♫And used it to decorate your dream♫

431
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,400
♫I borrowed spring scenery♫

432
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,760
♫From a breeze♫

433
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,150
♫It stopped on the branches♫

434
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,820
Munan. Munan.

435
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,800
♫I used it to decorate your smile♫

436
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,360
I'm here, Young Master.

437
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,100
Where is Liu Yuru?

438
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,010
♫I also want to hold your hand♫

439
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,020
I don't know.

440
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,600
♫And admire the plum blossom which is covered by snow♫

441
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,520
I'll go and look for Young Madam.

442
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,100
♫It's a seemingly♫

443
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,200
♫Young people's tour♫

444
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,120
Sachets.

445
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,290
Sachets.

446
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,960
♫The pear blossom accompanies the spring breeze♫

447
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,900
Clay oven rolls.

448
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,280
♫I forgot the things in the world all of a sudden♫

449
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,190
Freshly made clay oven rolls.

450
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,560
♫Everyone thinks life is like a dream♫

451
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,620
Young Madam.

452
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,990
Where are we going?

453
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,300
We've been wandering around the streets

454
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,560
this entire morning.

455
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,120
♫I looked back inadvertently♫

456
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,740
♫A stranger impressed me♫

457
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,870
Young Madam.

458
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,350
Did Young Master make you angry?

459
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,450
♫We've been with each other for another day♫

460
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,280
So you wanted to come out for a walk?

461
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,960
♫Another spring and autumn came♫

462
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,860
Men and women?

463
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,410
We are all humans.

464
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,500
♫Who will deliver letters to me?♫

465
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,380
We humans

466
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,480
should have our own interests.

467
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,240
♫I'm listening to you♫

468
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,030
We should have ambitions

469
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,960
which can't be influenced by other people.

470
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,150
♫I forgot the things in the world all of a sudden♫

471
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,860
What about you, Liu Yuru?

472
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,320
What is your ambition?

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,760
♫Everyone thinks life is like a dream♫

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,410
♫How much do I miss you?♫

♫I've seen you here before♫

476
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,980
♫One night, we sat together to write poems and drink alcohol♫

477
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,060
♫Another spring and autumn came♫

478
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,050
♫I saw the sun, the moon, and the stars outside the window♫

479
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:43,470
♫The wind blows and the moon sways. My heart is beating♫

480
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,260
Young Madam, please come in.

481
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,010
Thank you.

482
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,900
Young Madam, please take a seat.

483
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,030
When I was at home,

484
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,590
I heard from my mother-in-law

485
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,390
that Manager He

486
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,020
is a senior member of the Gu Business

487
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,790
and has made great contributions.

488
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,220
Without

489
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,560
your help,

490
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,860
the Gu Business wouldn't be a success.

491
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,720
I'm flattered.

492
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,190
Young Madam.

493
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,160
This is

494
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,010
our new batch of fine fabric.

495
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,730
Take a look at it later.

496
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,720
If there's fabric you like,

497
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,300
I'll ask a shop assistant to wrap it up

498
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,830
and send it to your mansion.

499
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,730
Hua Luo Fabric of Shu.

500
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,930
The fabric is light. The floral pattern is delicate.

501
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,300
Judging by the pattern,

502
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,300
was it made

503
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,900
by the Western Weaving Bureau in Jinguan City?

504
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,870
Yes.

505
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,190
It's unique and fashionable.

506
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,320
It's really good.

507
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,560
But spring is coming late this year.

508
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,200
Hua Luo Fabric can't resist cold weather.

509
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,780
Instead of

510
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,050
making it into clothes when the weather is hot,

511
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,120
it's better to make it into some silk scarves and handkerchiefs first.

512
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,780
Maybe they can be sold better.

513
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,530
That's a good idea.

514
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,970
Young Madam, you're an expert.

515
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,530
My family used to run

516
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,460
cloth business.

517
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,290
I knew something about it when I was not married.

518
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,830
Young Madam, let me take you

519
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,030
to inspect other shops of the Gu family.

520
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,540
It's inappropriate.

521
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,470
Don't worry, Young Madam.

522
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,610
This is Mistress's order.

523
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,500
She has already told us

524
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,970
as long as you are willing,

525
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:37,940
you can inspect

526
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,530
any shop of the Gu family.

527
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,250
You're obeying your mother-in-law's order.

528
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,720
It's appropriate for you

529
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,380
to inspect your own property.

530
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,570
Thank you.

531
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,780
Young Madam, this way please.

532
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,630
-Take care.
-Young Madam, look.

533
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,730
The streets on both sides of the river

534
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,790
are full of the shops of the Gu family.

535
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,720
The Gu family

536
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,450
has such street markets and shops

537
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,970
not only in Yangzhou City

538
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,550
but also in Jiangning, Lin'an,

539
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,810
Huzhou, and Mingzhou.

540
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,290
The shops of the Gu family

541
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,270
include salt shops, grain shops,

542
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,110
and jewelry shops.

543
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,610
Young Madam.

544
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,310
Let me show you over there.

545
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,500
This way please.

546
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,570
Young Madam, you just took a look

547
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,790
at the warehouse of the grain shops

548
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,990
and water transport.

549
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,600
Then let's take a look

550
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,950
at the main accounting office of the Gu family.

551
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,080
We've almost finished

552
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,010
inspecting the important places.

553
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,210
Manager He,

554
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,700
can I go in and have a look?

555
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,280
Well...

556
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,100
Young Madam.

557
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,230
These accountants

558
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,070
are odd.

559
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,700
Disturbing them while they're counting

560
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,590
is a taboo here.

561
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,060
I don't think we should go in.

562
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,210
You're right.

563
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,100
Young Madam, this way please.

564
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,980
Okay.

565
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,600
Young Madam, please come in.

566
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,840
Young Madam.

567
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,290
This is

568
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,350
the meeting hall of the headquarters of the Gu family.

569
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,110
Usually,

570
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,790
Master discusses business matters and checks accounts

571
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,710
in this place.

572
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,360
The account books which have been sorted out

573
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,160
over these three years are here.

574
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,510
You can take a look.

575
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,650
Thank you.

576
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,540
You're welcome, Young Madam.

577
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,220
I'll go to the front hall now.

578
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,940
Excuse me.

579
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,350
Chengzi said

580
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,280
bending neither one way or another is called Zhong

581
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,870
Young Master.

582
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,270
Remaining unchanged...

583
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,250
Why are you here?

584
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,050
Young Master.

585
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,930
I found out

586
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,000
that Young Madam is not at home.

587
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,050
She's really not at home?

588
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,970
She's really not at home.

589
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,770
Is it true?

590
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,690
It's true.

591
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,250
Her informant, Yinhong,

592
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,510
also went out with her.

593
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,600
Even Ms. Ruixue

594
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,110
went out early this morning.

595
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,110
No one is keeping an eye on you today.

596
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,750
Young Master, don't be afraid.

597
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,170
We can do

598
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,310
what we like to do today.

599
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,100
I'll go and bring

600
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,730
your grasshoppers, crickets,

601
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:54,490
dice, wooden balls,

602
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,120
bronze pots, and leaf cards

603
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,830
for you.

604
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,690
Let's have fun.

605
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,570
No need. I'm not interested.

606
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,230
Why?

607
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,860
These things

608
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,420
are what you want to play

609
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,260
the most.

610
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,150
When Young Madam comes back,

611
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,080
you won't get to play them anymore.

612
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,090
Where did she go?

613
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,450
Young Master, why do you care about Young Madam?

614
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,780
Anyway, she's not here.

615
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,730
Just tell me.

616
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,900
I heard she's looking at account books at the headquarters.

617
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,690
She's looking at account books?

618
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,210
Why is she looking at account books?

619
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,470
She can't understand.

620
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,080
It's so late and she's still not back.

621
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,910
As the eldest son

622
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,210
of the Gu family,

623
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,550
I should go

624
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,320
and take a look, right?

625
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,950
What are you going to take a look at?

626
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,810
Account books.

627
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,520
She's so clumsy.

628
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,050
She might make trouble for my family's shops.

629
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,400
She's just looking at account books.

630
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,740
She is not doing the accounts.

631
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,200
What trouble can she make?

632
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't think it's necessary.

633
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,580
It's necessary.

634
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,250
It's absolutely necessary.

635
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,530
Fine.

636
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,880
I listen to you.

637
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,730
Let's go and have a look.

638
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:18,240
[Money Helps the World]

639
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,820
Really.

640
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,380
Listen to me?

641
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,830
[Gu]

642
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,550
I want to talk to her alone.

643
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,430
What?

644
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,290
Nothing.

645
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,610
I'm just looking around.

646
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,950
What are you doing?

647
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,320
I'm looking at account books.

648
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,330
Why did you suddenly begin to look at account books?

649
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,820
Cause I want to.

650
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,050
Account books are very complicated.

651
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,180
Can you understand?

652
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,620
Barely.

653
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,610
Liu Yuru.

654
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,760
Are you angry?

655
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,610
No.

656
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,430
Can you

657
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,270
not reply

658
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,470
with just a few words?

659
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,480
If you have nothing to do,

660
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,530
you can rest in the outside room.

661
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,650
Why did you say you're not angry?

662
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,050
You're obviously angry.

663
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:18,690
I...

664
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,550
Are you ignoring me?

665
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,750
Cloth. Two guan.

666
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,150
If you continue to ignore me, I'm going to go out to play.

667
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,760
Raw silk.

668
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,770
I'm going to Lanxiao House.

669
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,760
Whatever.

670
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,780
I'm leaving.

671
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,060
I'm striding along

672
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,060
and stepping out.

673
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,670
I already took two steps.

674
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,199
Why aren't you stopping me?

675
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,110
Liu Yuru.

676
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,250
It was my fault.

677
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,300
I shouldn't have scared you.

678
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,560
My words were indeed harsh.

679
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,020
But

680
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,830
I was too anxious.

681
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,470
I apologize to you.

682
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,890
Can you stop being angry?

683
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,450
I'm not angry.

684
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,570
I've been thinking about

685
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,320
what you told me last night.

686
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,960
I think you are right.

687
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,060
I should have

688
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,950
my own interests and ambitions.

689
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,250
I don't have to

690
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,340
think about you

691
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,350
all the time.

692
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,870
Don't you want to take a vacation?

693
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,720
I allow you to take a three-day vacation.

694
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,270
You can go wherever you want.

695
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,660
Come back and study when you have had enough fun.

696
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,340
I have to look at account books now.

697
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,200
I don't have time to chat with you.

698
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,770
You're so cruel.

699
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,490
You were forcing me to study before.

700
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,330
Now you're forcing yourself

701
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,460
to look at these boring account books.

702
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,400
You really like to suffer.

703
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,880
These account books

704
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,180
are quite impressive.

705
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,810
They are not boring at all.

706
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,670
They're much more interesting

707
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,160
than your story scripts and leaf cards.

708
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,530
They're interesting?

709
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,270
Forget it.

710
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,400
I'm leaving.

711
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,660
Goodbye, My Lord.

712
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,630
Are you okay?

713
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,550
I was just about to leave.

714
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,920
And you were about to drink incense ash?

715
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,880
Why didn't I know

716
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,850
you like this?

717
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,670
All right.

718
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,350
Look at the account books.

719
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,660
I'll send you back when you finish looking at them.

720
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,990
Don't get me wrong.

721
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,630
I'm not here specially to pick you up.

722
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm just taking you back

723
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,420
on my way home.

724
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,050
It's not my purpose today.

725
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,880
All right. Hurry up.

726
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,030
I... I... I've almost finished looking at them.

727
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,760
My Lord, prepare the carriage.

728
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,180
Okay.

729
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,770
Wang Fu,

730
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,230
deliver the goods according to this form.

731
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,060
Manager He.

732
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,380
Mr. Wan.

733
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,010
Look.

734
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,610
I come here every day these days.

735
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,780
But I didn't see you.

736
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,710
I finally see you today.

737
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,600
Mr. Wan,

738
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,030
the thing about you wanting to get credit,

739
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,750
without Master here,

740
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,480
I really can't make a decision.

741
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,110
Please don't make things difficult for me.

742
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,870
I can wait.

743
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,550
But the business can't wait.

744
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:36,850
Tomorrow noon,

745
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,410
if I still can't get the goods,

746
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,000
my century-old shop

747
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,050
will close down.

748
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,850
I know. I also understand.

749
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,740
But I really

750
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,270
can't do anything about it.

751
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,760
How about...

752
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,730
Manager He.

753
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,370
Young Master is in the meeting hall.

754
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,460
He has finished looking at account books

755
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,660
and is about to leave.

756
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,670
Master is not here.

757
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,460
But Young Master is here.

758
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,850
Mr. Wan.

759
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,530
Don't offend Young Madam.

760
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,330
Stop him!

761
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:00,830
Yes.

762
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,120
Mom, you're back.

763
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,760
I missed you so much.

764
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,650
Where's the old man?

765
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,330
He must be fooling around again.

766
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,340
Look at you.

767
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,470
Watch your mouth.

768
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,200
Why did you

769
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,670
come to

770
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,730
the headquarters?

771
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:18,680
I...

772
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,320
Do you owe gambling debts?

773
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,460
Were you searching the shops for money?

774
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,140
I've been studying every day.

775
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,670
I don't have time to gamble.

776
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,010
You've been studying every day?

777
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,740
You're really not good at lying.

778
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,870
Believe it or not.

779
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,560
So why are you here?

780
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,920
I'm here to pick up

781
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,390
Heroine Big Sword.

782
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,080
Heroine Big Sword?

783
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,160
It's Young Madam.

784
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,680
Young Master

785
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,650
gave this nickname to Young Madam.

786
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,690
Yuru is here too?

787
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,520
Yes.

788
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,590
Please come in.

789
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,520
Young Master.

790
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,910
Young Master.

791
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,060
Young Master, please save

792
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,650
my century-old shop.

793
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,120
Mr. Wan.

794
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,890
Young Madam

795
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,900
is a woman.

796
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,950
As an outsider,

797
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,080
you rushed here and stopped her.

798
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,680
The Gu family will blame you.

799
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,100
Even if you report it to the authorities,

800
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,240
it's still your fault.

801
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,830
Yes.

802
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,470
I was too anxious.

803
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,840
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

804
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,330
I offended Young Madam.

805
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,420
Don't blame me, Young Madam.

806
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,390
I... I...

807
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,120
I have no other choice.

808
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,580
This...

809
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,420
Come.

810
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,760
Send Mr. Wan out.

811
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,310
Yes.

812
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:33,940
Wait.

813
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,640
Business is urgent.

814
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,620
Don't stand on ceremony now.

815
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,860
If you have any difficulties,

816
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,220
please tell me.

817
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,840
I'm in a hurry to get the goods.

818
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,060
But I don't have cash now.

819
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,450
I don't know what to do now.

820
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,620
If I can't get the goods,

821
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,850
my century-old shop will close down.

822
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,790
I have money to repay you.

823
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,040
In the middle of next month,

824
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,010
I'll be repaid by the money I lent other people last year.

825
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,270
By then, I will

826
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,420
repay you with interest.

827
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,310
Young Madam, trust me.

828
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,200
I won't break my promise.

829
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,300
I see.

830
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,900
Mr. Wan.

831
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,250
It's not that we don't want you to get credit.

832
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:18,550
But…

833
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,220
Manager He.

834
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,860
Let him

835
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,080
get credit.

836
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,440
No.

837
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,710
You're kind.

838
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,310
But you don't know

839
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,360
these years,

840
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,920
we have many taxes to pay in Yangzhou City.

841
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,600
It seems that business is booming,

842
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,230
but actually it's hard to do business.

843
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,160
Many businesses

844
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,460
went bankrupt.

845
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,100
The Gu Business

846
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,400
lent thousands of taels of silver

847
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,740
last year.

848
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,050
No one repaid them.

849
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,150
Besides, if people want to get credit,

850
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,460
they need to mortgage something.

851
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,980
Mr. Wan,

852
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,840
do you have any property that can be mortgaged?

853
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,720
No.

854
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,960
My family

855
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,840
had property and fields before.

856
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,370
Last year, the commissioners

857
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,460
found an excuse

858
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,180
to confiscate them.

859
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,760
These two years,

860
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,680
the commissioners are indeed overbearing.

861
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,840
They have confiscated many things

862
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,070
which were belonged to rich businessmen.

863
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,700
But

864
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,290
we really

865
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,550
can't do anything about it.

866
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,610
We can't break the rules.

867
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,470
I have a dowry.

868
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:30,830
I own a few shops in Chengnan Street.

869
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,460
Mr. Wan, if you

870
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,950
can't pay off your debts,

871
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,060
you can mortgage my shops.

872
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:36,870
No.

873
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,420
Young Madam.

874
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:37,880
How can you

875
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,970
mortgage your dowry?

876
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,230
You can't do that.

877
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,690
No.

878
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,350
Manager He.

879
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,710
Does the Gu Business have a rule

880
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,140
that if a person can mortgage something,

881
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,780
they can get credit?

882
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,880
We have this rule, Young Madam.

883
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,060
Since we have this rule, just follow the rule.
