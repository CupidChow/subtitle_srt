[Episode 33]

4
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,259
To be brave enough to accept punishment

5
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,140
and seek justice for your husband,

6
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,930
I can see that

7
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,590
you are righteous

8
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,770
and won't stop

9
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,430
your husband from improving.

10
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,660
I'm sure

11
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,539
there won't be any conflicts

12
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:01,400
when you spend your days with my child in the future.

13
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,700
My child and Deputy Minister Gu

14
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,820
have an engagement.

15
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,669
I was thinking of

16
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,590
fulfilling this marriage

17
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,330
and allow you to divorce.

18
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,930
But my son pleaded for you.

19
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,660
He said that you and Deputy Minister Gu

20
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,050
have been through thick and thin together

21
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,570
and you are willing to be a commoner's wife.

22
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,350
So I agreed.

23
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,190
Thank Her Majesty.

24
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,180
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,150
I refuse.

26
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,670
How dare you!

27
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,750
I dare not

28
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,540
lie to Your Majesty about my feelings.

29
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,310
Gu Jiusi

30
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,829
is my husband.

31
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,510
I

32
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,030
am unwilling to share him with anyone.

33
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,020
How dare you say such ridiculous words

34
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,620
and talk back to the Majesty?

35
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,460
Fine.

36
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,100
Just continue kneeling here

37
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,750
and come to your senses.

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,950
Liu Yuru.

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,010
Do you think putting on an act here

40
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,700
can prove that

41
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,860
your relationship with Brother Jiusi is

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,900
tougher than gold

43
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,180
and can stop this marriage?

44
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,700
I thought

45
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,350
you were a smart woman.

46
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,940
I thought

47
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,540
you were a great pillar of support for Brother Jiusi.

48
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,400
I didn't expect

49
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,430
you to be so stupid.

50
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,710
Do you know

51
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,579
you are the only obstacle

52
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,370
between Gu Jiusi and

53
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,430
his bright future?

54
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,350
Your Highness is a noble lady.

55
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,200
You have the Empress Dowager's help.

56
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,910
If Jiusi becomes a consort,

57
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,470
it is his blessing.

58
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,329
In the future,

59
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,740
in the court,

60
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,550
it will be a smooth road for him too.

61
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,940
But I just refuse.

62
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,460
Gu Jiusi

63
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,829
is my husband.

64
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,750
And the man I love.

65
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,860
I have him in my heart.

66
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,820
I also wish that in Gu Jiusi's heart,

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,660
by him,

68
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,340
will always be

69
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,630
just me, Liu Yuru.

70
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:03,950
You...

71
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,510
How ungrateful!

72
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,190
Whoever wants to marry Gu Jiusi

73
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,180
will have to step over

74
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,829
my life.

75
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,260
I'll grant your wish.

76
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,620
Mother, save me!

77
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,700
Mother!

78
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,310
How dare you, Gu Jiusi!

79
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,770
How dare you wield a sword at someone above you

80
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,100
in the palace?

81
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,710
Do you want

82
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,270
our lives?

83
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,380
Empress Dowager.

84
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,380
You have achieved your goal.

85
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,990
You can target me,

86
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,400
but please let Yuru go.

87
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,740
Fine.

88
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,700
I promise you.

[Changgeng Palace]

105
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,980
Your Majesty.

106
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,500
Lady Liu, a commoner,

107
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,420
talked back to me and I can let that slide.

108
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,450
But a mere Deputy Minister

109
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,020
broke into my palace

110
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,700
and wanted to kill me.

111
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,100
Your Majesty,

112
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,140
you misunderstood.

113
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,180
Actually Gu Jiusi...

114
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,700
He already had his sword

115
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,540
pointing at my throat.

116
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,900
If the guards hadn't stopped him,

117
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,020
I would have

118
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,550
already died.

119
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,500
Your Majesty.

120
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,150
I know.

121
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,590
Gu Jiusi

122
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,020
is your favorite subject.

123
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,190
But I was alone with my child

124
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,590
when I opened the city

125
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,470
and presented Darong

126
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,260
to Your Majesty.

127
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,630
From then on,

128
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,680
the world became Da Xia's.

129
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,230
The only hope I have

130
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,060
is to get His Majesty's protection.

131
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,660
So that I can spend the rest

132
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,860
of my life in peace.

133
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,380
Can't you fulfill such

134
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,030
a humble wish?

135
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,630
Your Majesty,

136
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,550
you're exaggerating.

137
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,440
When I ascended the throne,

138
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,350
I promised you and your daughter

139
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,710
that I will give you

140
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,520
infinite glory and wealth.

141
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,340
I am a man of my words.

142
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,660
I have already

143
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,140
put Gu Jiusi in jail.

144
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,620
He has suffered a lot

145
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,870
in that prison.

146
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,940
I am very grateful that Your Majesty remembers

147
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,400
the promise you have made.

148
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,420
But

149
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,060
I was scared to death.

150
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,890
If Gu Jiusi is not

151
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,909
executed,

152
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,700
I

153
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,200
will never have peace.

154
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,190
I will live in perpetual fear

155
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,470
that I will die sooner or later.

156
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,850
Your Majesty.

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,300

Your Majesty.

159
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,300
Your Majesty,

160
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,740
if anything happens to you,

161
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,940
what would people think of His Majesty?

162
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,950
Please take care of your health

163
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,020
and just forgive this mere subject.

164
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,070
Your Majesty...

165
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,060
Fine.

166
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,140
Since you are so afraid

167
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,940
of Gu Jiusi,

168
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,800
then I shall...

169
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,420
I...

170
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,080
I shall just exile him from the Eastern Capital.

171
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,140
Your Majesty.

172
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,940
Your Majesty.

173
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,300
Between Gu Jiusi and I,

174
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,270
only one can be alive.

175
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,990
If Your Majesty decides

176
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,660
to let Gu Jiusi live,

177
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,730
I will go back today

178
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,130
and hang myself to death with a white ribbon

179
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,000
so that Your Majesty won't have to be so conflicted.

180
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:35,860
Your Majesty!

181
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,140
What are you standing around for?

182
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,890
Stop her!

183
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

184
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,740
Your Majesty!

185
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,620
Your Majesty!

186
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,510
Is he stupid?

187
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,420
He finally escaped from danger

188
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,710
yet caused such a disaster again.

189
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,830
Do you know Her Majesty

190
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,730
is seeking death now?

191
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,420
Those old ministers of the previous dynasty

192
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,180
are also on her side.

193
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,280
Everyone is very agitated,

194
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,060
asking me

195
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,980
to execute Gu Jiusi.

196
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,510
Your Majesty...

197
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,200

571
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,310
he is unsure exactly who wants to see him.

572
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,140
If it's the Emperor's son,

573
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,820
then...

574
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,070
he is just a sinner

575
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,140
who is undeserving of any honor.

576
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,350
If it was

577
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,860
Commissioner Fan of Youzhou back then,

578
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,190
he asks for your understanding

579
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,780
for he is unwilling to meet anyone

580
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,840
as he mourns the death of his new wife.

581
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,300
If the Commissioner were to be angry about this,

582
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,370
then there is nothing he can do about it.

583
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,700
Calm down, Your Majesty.

584
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,710
What's there to be angry about?

585
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,590
In terms of playing with words,

586
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,250
if Gu Jiusi ranks second

587
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,770
in Da Xia,

588
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,790
no one dares to be the first.

589
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,990
Then

590
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,780
I'll go invite him again tomorrow.

591
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,670
No need.

592
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,740
He's upset at me now.

593
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,510
It's better not to meet.

594
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,550
It's getting late.

595
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,390
You may leave.

596
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,380
Tomorrow morning,

597
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,860
ask Zhou Gaolang to come see me.

598
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

599
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,140
Master.

600
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,300
Why?

601
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,910
When I used her as a bargaining chip,

602
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,430
I should have known

603
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,740
she would lose her life.

604
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,820
I knew she was stubborn.

605
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,050
I thought I could

606
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,810
keep myself from

607
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,950
sympathizing with her ever again.

608
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,030
But why does it still hurt

609
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,580
now that she's really dead?

610
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,670
Liu Yuru.

611
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,670
You've been smart your whole life.

612
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,780
But why are you always

613
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,050
so stupid

614
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,830
when it comes to Gu Jiusi?

615
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,830
I set this up

616
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:26,240
[Fragrant Lanzhi]

617
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,310
to get rid of Gu Jiusi.

618
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,470
Not you.

619
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,100
Not you.

620
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,110
Master,

621
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,500
should we kill Gu Jiusi

622
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,900
on his way to his new post?

623
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,390
No need.

624
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,300
Yongzhou is my territory.

625
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,820
When Gu Jiusi reaches,

626
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,180
his

627
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,510
every move

628
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,550
will be under my control.

629
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,070
I can easily do away with him

630
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,510
anytime I wish.

631
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,860
But for now,

632
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,300
I want him to live a little longer.

633
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,700
I want his heart to be in piercing pain everyday.

634
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,620
I want him to wish he were dead.

635
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,570
I want him to rot in Yongzhou

636
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,580
and become a good-for-nothing.

637
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,540
Become a good-for-nothing.

638
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,660
Become a good-for-nothing.

639
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,020
Zhou,

640
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,980
you don't want to even

641
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,940
talk to me now?

642
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,150
I dare not.

643
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,670
I just

644
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,580
don't know

645
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,110
what to say to Your Majesty.

646
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,300
Fine.

647
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,520
I don't want to hear it either.

648
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,550
Go.

649
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,820
Your Majesty.

650
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,270
I don't understand.

651
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,820
The Crown Prince was the one who committed a serious crime.

652
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,130
Yet Gu Jiusi was the one

653
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,260
exiled to Yongzhou.

654
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,950
Gu Jiusi is a rare talent.

655
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,870
That's not true.

656
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,090
This is just a plan

657
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,070
I had devised

658
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,310
and have yet to discuss with you about.

659
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,820
Only because the Empress Dowager was being stubborn

660
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,780
and forced me to make a choice.

661
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,990
I had no choice

662
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,080
so I could only think of a win-win situation.

663
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,300
So,

664
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,700
I had to sacrifice Liu Yuru

665
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,460
to pacify the Empress Dowager

666
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,860
and save Gu Jiusi.

667
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,890
Only by asking him to be away from this chaos

668
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,790
can I keep him alive.

669
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,540
This was also

670
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,390
a suggestion of his earlier on.

671
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,790
Now,

672
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,420
although he is resenting me,

673
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,670
it doesn't matter anymore.

674
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,590
When I'm gone,

675
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,040
Yu'er will ascend the throne.

676
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,820
By then, he will still be an important subject

677
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,620
by Yu'er's side.
