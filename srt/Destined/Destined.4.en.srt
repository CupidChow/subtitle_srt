00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,700
Then cry.

5
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,130
When you're done crying,

6
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,590
you have to stand up again.

7
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:49,780
If you lock yourself in the room

8
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,180
for the rest of your life,

9
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,060
the path of your life will end there.

10
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,539
I don't know.

11
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,950
I can't see where

12
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,740
the path of my life leads.

13
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,310
The weather is great today.

14
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,700
Why don't you accompany me

15
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,860
to walk to the stores

16
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,560
and relax a little?

[Gu's Grain Store]

18
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,740
Indeed, no other stores

19
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,420
can be as prosperous as the ones of Gu's.

20
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,620
Yuru.

21
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,020
What do you think the reason behind

22
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,480
the blooming business is?

23
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,900
The reason?

24
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,620
Hard word.

25
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,100
Well said.

26
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,760
Our family background, luck,

27
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,180
and others' help,

28
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,770
are not the main reasons.

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,740
The key

30
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,620
is that your father-in-law and I

31
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,020
put a lot of effort

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,180
to run the stores little by little.

33
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,060
In fact, maintaining a marriage

34
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,060
is similar to

35
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,700
starting or running a business.

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,830
Both require you to work hard and know how to manage them.

37
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,890
Your father-in-law and I

38
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,100
may look loving now.

39
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,890
But when I first married him,

40
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,100
we also fought a lot.

41
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:16,820
Then,

42
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,180
how did you...

43
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,110
Your father-in-law is old now.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,620
When he was young,

45
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,160
he was quite handsome.

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,400
He looked almost as good as Jiusi.

47
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,660
One day that year, it rained heavily.

48
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,190
I went to pray and was trapped in the mountain.

49
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,220
And I got robbed by some bandits.

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,380
Your father-in-law appeared out of nowhere and saved me.

51
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,260
However,

52
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,800
until the moment he escorted me home,

53
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,660
he didn't even look at me.

54
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,940
Yet I could never forget him.

55
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,829
I insisted on marrying him.

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,860
When people are young,

57
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,020
they like to force things their way.

58
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,460
But when we just got married,

59
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,620
he wasn't into me.

60
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,880
He was always wandering outside.

61
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,040
Then what happened later?

62
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,500
Later,

63
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,740
as the saying goes, humans have hearts, unlike plants.

64
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,660
As time went by,

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,980
we took care of each other

66
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,360
and helped each other.

67
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,740
Gradually,

68
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,600
he couldn't leave me anymore.

69
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,540
Then we stayed loving

70
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,740
for most of our lives.

71
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,019
He never hurt my feelings again.

72
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,790
That's so great.

73
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,740
If you want a good life,

74
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,900
you have to put effort into it.

75
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,900
How can we expect

76
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,370
everything to go smoothly and that we have nothing

77
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,300
to worry about from the beginning?

[Gu Mansion]

79
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,620
You've been patrolling so many stores with me.

80
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,620
You must be tired.

81
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,580
No.

82
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,500
When I was not married,

83
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,990
I also helped my family patrol the stores.

84
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,610
If you want to learn how to do business,

85
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,500
I can teach you.

86
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,620
Jiusi is too much of a good-time kid.

87
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,620
In the future, the Gu's property

88
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,150
should be entrusted to you.

89
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,340
Mom,

90
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,880
I'll be just like this all my life.

91
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,180
How would I dare to manage the affairs of the Gu family?

92
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,540
If you don't despise me

93
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,140
and are willing to provide for me,

94
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,340
that would be a grace.

95
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,260
Yuru,

96
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,980
you're a smart girl.

97
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,940
Why don't you

98
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,580
treat Jiusi the way

99
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,500
you treat me?

100
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,060
Jiusi

101
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,420
doesn't strive to make progress as hard as Mr. Ye.

102
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,480
I understand that you don't like him.

103
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,060
But I still hope

104
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,810
your marriage

105
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,460
can work out.

106
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,420
People say Jiusi is a playboy.

107
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,060
In fact, he's kind.

108
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,020
He has never done anything evil.

109
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,140
He's very loyal to his friends.

110
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,060
Now he did such a ridiculous thing.

111
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,900
First, it's because he was angry with his father.

112
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,660
Second, he's too naive.

113
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,830
He can’t understand your pain.

114
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,980
Gu Jiusi is your son.

115
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,580
I hate him,

116
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,580
but you still treat me with such sincerity.

117
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,490
He's my son,

118
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,740
but we are both women.

119
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,780
In this world,

120
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,980
women's lives are much harder

121
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
than men's.

122
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,840
I don't want you to make things difficult for yourself.

123
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,040
If you are willing,

124
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,150
I'll tell you more of the truth.

125
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,780
Please go ahead.

126
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,659
Jiusi

127
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,980
has never liked a girl before.

128
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,790
He has never even

129
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,659
talked to a girl much.

130
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,220
The reason we think

131
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,060
he likes you

132
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,140
is because

133
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,260
you are the only girl

134
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,720
that he claimed he liked and wanted to marry.

135
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Even if this is a misunderstanding,

136
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,660
in terms of a relationship,

137
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,060
you've already had a big advantage

138
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,180
than other women.

139
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,540
Our lives depend on how we live them.

140
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,460
Yuru, I can see

141
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,660
you are a girl with a mind of your own.

142
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,100
You have a long way to go.

143
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,900
Before we make it to the end,

144
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,140
who dares to say

145
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,780
it'll end like this,

146
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,300
right?

147
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,140
Mom.

148
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,700
My husband…

149
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,140
Where is he now?

150
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,860
Yuru,

151
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,420
I'm sorry for putting you through this.

152
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,500
That little brat has embarrassed himself.

153
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,780
Anyway, it's the Gu family's fault.

154
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,220
Your mother and I apologize to you.

155
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,900
Please don't, Dad.

156
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,940
Jiusi is the only child.

157
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,100
Your mother and I

158
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,700
have loved him very much since he was little

159
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,540
and we neglected to subject him to discipline.

160
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,780
Although our family

161
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,220
has a little bit of money,

162
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,140
we can't

163
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,460
protect him forever.

164
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,060
If

165
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,460
anything happens in the future…

166
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,660
It's groundless.

167
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,950
Why are you telling Yuru that?

168
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,590
Your father-in-law is thoughtful

169
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,100
and always prepares for the worst.

170
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,220
Never mind it.

171
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,020
You mean

172
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,220
something will happen to our family?

173
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,380
We're family now.

174
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,620
Plus, Yuru is so smart.

175
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,500
We can just speak the truth.

176
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,920
Although our Gu family is in Yangzhou now,

177
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,780
we're actually from Dongdu.

178
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,220
My younger brother

179
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,420
is the Minister of Personnel in Dongdu.

180
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,880
I also have a sworn sister,

181
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,300
who is King Liang's wife.

182
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,620
So we kind of have some noble relations.

183
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,140
But His Majesty is seriously ill.

184
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,350
and the Crown Prince is unpopular.

185
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,530
We're afraid that the situation in Dongdu

186
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,860
is going to be unstable.

187
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,700
In that case,

188
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,020
Jiusi indeed

189
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,430
should change his ways.

190
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,580
As he's a man,

191
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,300
though I don't expect him to earn wealth and honor,

192
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,020
at least he should have some skills

193
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,300
to make a living.

194
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,100
Exactly.

195
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,660
Yuru.

196
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,480
To get along with someone,

197
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,820
you have to set the rules from the very beginning.

198
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,100
I'm just an example.

199
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,440
I didn't discipline him well before.

200
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,220
Now even if I break his legs,

201
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,280
he's not afraid to talk back to me.

202
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,730
From now on, Yuru,

203
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,260
you'll set this rule.

204
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,030
You are well-educated.

205
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,990
You must discipline him for me.

206
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,300
But Dad,

207
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,060
I'm just a woman after all.

208
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,580
And as his wife,

209
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,920
I should respect him as my master.

210
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,880
I could just persuade him at most.

211
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,520
If he doesn't listen to me,

212
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,590
I have no other choices.

213
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,070
Don't be afraid.

214
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,190
From now on, all the servants,

215
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,990
maids and guards of our Gu family

216
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,550
will be at your command.

217
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,740
If he dares to act recklessly,

218
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,420
tell me,

219
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,310
and I'll break his legs.

220
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,820
Since you support me so much,

221
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,980
I'm relieved.

222
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,530
[Chunhe Hall]

223
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,270
I'm new to the Gu family.

224
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,460
In the future,

225
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,880
please be so kind as to take care of me.

226
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:36,940
You are all old servants

227
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,600
who have served Young Master.

228
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,730
What is he like?

229
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
What does he like?

230
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,150
What has he done?

231
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,180
Just tell me all of it.

232
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,620
Young Mistress,

233
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,020
although Young Master's monthly income is not much,

234
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,140
only 2,000 taels,

235
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,100
he overspends it almost every month,

236
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,380
spending at least 5,000 taels.

237
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,220
Young Master overspends his money

238
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,420
because he is kind-hearted.

239
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,780
When he sees someone in their distress,

240
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,940
he would help them.

241
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,350
My mother was sick last month.

242
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,620
Young Master gave me a lot of money.

243
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,220
He asked me to take my mother to see a famous doctor.

244
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,020
Young Master is philanthropic.

245
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,980
But whatever the illness is,

246
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,910
it won't cost 5,000 taels, will it?

247
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,950
Go on.

248
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,950
Young Mistress,

249
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,020
Young Master

250
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,780
should go to school every day.

251
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,740
But every ten days,

252
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,420
he will go to play cockfighting for four days,

253
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,980
go to watch the musical performance for three days,

254
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,460
go to the casino for two days.

255
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,300
As for the last day,

256
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,340
he would make the teacher so angry

257
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,380
that he leaves

258
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,740
and refuses to teach the lesson anymore.

259
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,340
It's all Yang Wenchang's fault. He's addicted to gambling.

260
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
Young Master just couldn't stand to see

261
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,730
his good buddy neglect his studies.

262
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,260
That's why he went to the casino to get him out.

263
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,030
You are a loyal servant.

264
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,980
You always take his side,

265
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,040
which is indeed valuable.

266
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,220
How about this?

267
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,740
You know him the best.

268
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,830
Why don't you tell me about him?

269
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,100
If you lie,

270
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,260
I'll punish you according to the family rules.

271
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,220
I won.

272
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,690
What's wrong?

273
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,700
You look distracted.

274
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,180
Last time at Sande Casino,

275
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,860
before I even placed the chips,

276
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,820
my father charged in

277
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,950
and dragged me back.

278
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:21,980
This time,

279
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,940
we've been playing all day.

280
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,940
But the old man didn't make any move.

281
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,580
Weird.

282
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,820
It's so weird.

283
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,220
On the first day after your wedding,

284
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,340
you came to Lanxiao House and asked for a prostitute.

285
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:33,820
That wife of yours, Liu Yuru,

286
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,980
cries all the time.

287
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,840
I wonder what her reaction is.

288
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,460
There

289
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,250
must be a mess at your home now.

290
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,580
In my opinion,

291
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,020
your father probably doesn't have time for you.

292
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
That makes sense.

293
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,820
Did she cry the entire day?

294
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,310
Young Madam.

295
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,460
Twenty good fighters are ready.

296
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:00,940
OK.

297
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,140
My Lady,

298
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:02,940
are we really going to

299
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,460
catch Mr. Gu with knives?

300
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,180
Being easily jealous…

301
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,780
Yin Hong.

302
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,650
From now on, you'll

303
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,820
call me Young Madam.

304
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,940
Yes, Young Madam.

305
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,420
Who is she?

306
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,460
Why did she come with a knife?

307
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,300
This woman is so tough.

308
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,300
Which family does she come from?

309
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,340
She came with a knife.

310
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,620
This is the oldest daughter of the Liu family.

311
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,220
I guess she's here for Mr. Gu.

312
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,060
Where is Gu Jiusi?

313
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,450
He's in big trouble.

314
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,780
Jiusi, stop playing.

315
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,350
Jiusi.

316
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,100
That crybaby of yours

317
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,710
came here with a knife.

318
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,300
What's so scary about that?

319
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,220
Isn't that great?

320
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,020
It's your idea

321
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,820
that I do this to make her uncomfortable.

322
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,180
No.

323
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,780
You aren't afraid but we are.

324
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,820
If that tigress

325
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,110
finds out that it was our idea,

326
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,640
how can we

327
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,420
hang out with you in the future?

328
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,380
Go. Just go.

329
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,700
Go. Hurry.

330
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,540
A good man knows when to retreat.

331
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,480
You go that way.

332
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,340
Go.

333
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,340
Come here.

334
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,700
Don't reveal that we've met.

335
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,940
This woman is so tough.

336
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,940
Liu Yuru, you really came with a knife.

337
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,620
Do you know how to use it?

338
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,500
Who are you trying to scare?

339
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
What do you think?

340
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,040
How dare you dodge?

341
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Are you serious?

342
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,340
What are you laughing at?

343
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,260
Have you never seen a couple fighting?

344
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,720
We've never seen a couple fight in a brothel.

345
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,700
There are so many people here.

346
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,300
Don't I need dignity?

347
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,220
Do you need it?

348
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,060
Gu Jiusi!

349
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,620
Gu Jiusi!

350
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,500
Are you done?

351
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,590
I'm here to take my husband home

352
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,940
to study hard

353
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,020
and get an official rank through the exams.

354
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,420
What did you say?

355
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,340
Study hard

356
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,820
and get an official rank through the exams.

357
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,060
Are you alright?

358
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,180
Talking about "study hard"…

359
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,820
If you start studying

360
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,060
from today on,

361
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,100
maybe you can make it for

362
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,960
the provincial imperial exams in August this year.

363
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,580
Liu Yuru.

364
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,870
Our family is the richest in Jiangnan.

365
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,340
Even if I don't do anything,

366
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,200
with only loan interest and rent,

367
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,190
I won't need to worry about my livelihood for a lifetime.

368
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,030
What if there isn't a lifetime?

369
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,700
What do you mean?

370
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,390
Gu Jiusi.

371
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,180
I used to be

372
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,710
a spoiled oldest daughter.

373
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,640
When I was young, I thought

374
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,980
my father and mother

375
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,230
would stay loving for the rest of their lives.

376
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,700
But when I was five,

377
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,980
Concubine Yue married into our family.

378
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,940
From then on,

379
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,740
my mother and I

380
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,890
became the laughingstock of the entire Yangzhou.

381
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,510
Today, the Gu family

382
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,220
wields immense influence in Yangzhou.

383
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,119
But what if one day,

384
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,240
the situation changes

385
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,079
and your backers fall?

386
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,540
If that day really comes,

387
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,940
it'll just be my fate.

388
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,950
I'll live in whatever way I can.

389
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,900
But I'm really not made

390
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,350
to study and pass the exams.

391
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,340
But Ye Shi'an got Jieyuan, first place in provincial imperial exams.

392
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,580
But what does Ye Shi'an

393
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,100
have to do with me?

394
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,140
I was meant to

395
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,420
marry Ye Shi'an!

396
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,820
Do you know how much effort

397
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,000
I've made to marry into the Ye family?

398
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,900
I've memorized

399
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,100
all the family rules and ancestral teachings of the Ye family.

400
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,820
I've tried to learn

401
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,150
the zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting I don't like.

402
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
For six years,

403
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,460
I dare not say anything wrong

404
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,030
or take any wrong steps.

405
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,260
I almost succeeded.

406
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,860
But you ruined everything!

407
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,660
You said you'll only marry me

408
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,100
in this life.

409
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,380
I fell in love with you at first sight.

410
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,260
I'm enamored of you at second sight.

411
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,620
In this life,

412
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,630
I'll only marry you.

413
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,860
Didn't you say that?

414
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,460
That was just…

415
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,620
A joke?

416
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,140
A joke of yours

417
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,300
ruined my whole life!

418
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,940
Did you know your words

419
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,060
would make the Ye family

420
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,540
cancel the marriage?

421
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,940
Everyone who heard it that day

422
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
would think that we had an affair

423
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,580
and my behavior was inappropriate.

424
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,580
They would doubt how my mother educated and raised me.

425
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,300
You know nothing.

426
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,190
Gu Jiusi.

427
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,900
Sorry, I...

428
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,180
Is an apology useful?

429
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,380
All these years of hard work

430
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,500
have been ruined by a joke of yours.

431
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,380
Gu Jiusi,

432
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,120
listen carefully.

433
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,310
I don't care what you think,

434
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,800
or whether you're willing or not.

435
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,060
Since you said that

436
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,710
and the Gu family agreed to have me,

437
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,180
you must be responsible for me.

438
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,260
Y-Y-Yes.

439
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,380
Since we are stuck

440
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,460
together,

441
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,020
then what I, Liu Yuru,

442
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,660
wanted,

443
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,740
and what I should have had,

444
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,700
you have to give them all to me.

445
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
Okay. Okay. I'll give you anything.

446
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,260
Okay, then let me tell you.

447
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,060
From now on,

448
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,940
I want you to be successful

449
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,380
and give me and my mother

450
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,820
a stable and happy life.

451
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,420
You have to do

452
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,780
as well as Ye Shi'an can do.

453
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,910
Ye Shi'an is right on the second floor.

454
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,040
Why don't you two...

455
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,300
What?

456
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,180
You expect Ye Shi'an to save you?

457
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,380
Listen, Gu Jiusi.

458
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,500
Ye Shi'an can't save you.

459
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,820
Even if the Heavenly Emperor comes,

460
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,900
you won't be saved!

461
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,060
From now on,

462
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,660
go home

463
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,660
and study.

464
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,180
If you dare to come to

465
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,710
such an unruly place again,

466
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,900
either

467
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,140
I'll kill you,

468
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,500
or I'll use this knife

469
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,180
to kill myself in front of your mansion.

470
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,460
No, no, no.

471
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,760
Do you understand?

472
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,220
Yes.

473
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,300
Louder.

474
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,180
Yes!

475
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,180
Keep your promise, Mr. Gu.

476
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,540
Get an official rank through the exams.

477
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,700
Let’s go.

478
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,180
Study hard, Mr. Gu.

479
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,180
Gu Jiusi.

480
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,440
I didn't expect to meet him

481
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180
so soon.

482
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,240
You must pass the exam.

483
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,220
Mr. Gu,

484
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,380
we'll wait for your good news.

485
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,100
Gu Jiusi’s wife…

486
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,020
Interesting.

487
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,680
Gu Jiusi is really something.

488
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,180
He got himself

489
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,990
a tigress who would come to the brothel and make a scene.

490
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,520
He'll suffer in the future.

491
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,990
[Wang Rong, son of the governor of Yangzhou]

492
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,780
Sir,

493
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,150
why do you want to see me?

494
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,700
I see your father looks like a potential dragon.

495
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
Of course I came

496
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,980
to follow the dragon.

497
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,780
Nonsense!

498
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,520
My father is loyal to His Majesty.

499
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,300
How dare you slander him?

500
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,820
I thought Your Highness

501
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,420
was ambitious.

502
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,460
I didn't expect that I was wrong.

503
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,220
Forget it.

504
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,180
Since Your Highness

505
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,980
think I'm talking nonsense,

506
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,670
please leave.

507
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,180
Just pretend that we have never met today.

508
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,420
You have eighteen

509
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,080
brothers and half-brothers.

510
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,540
I'm sure

511
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,100
there must be someone who doesn't think

512
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,420
I'm talking nonsense.

513
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,150
What on earth

514
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,140
do you want?

515
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,620
I...

516
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,560
am here to help you.

517
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,010
[Gu Mansion]

518
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,740
Mom.

519
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,460
Mom.

520
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,100
My child is back!

521
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,580
I was bullied outside.

522
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,820
You must help me.

523
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,180
Yuru.

524
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,700
Mom.

525
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,940
-You've been busy half the day.
-Dad.

526
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,430
Dad.

527
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,240
You must be thirsty and tired.

528
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,700
Mom, I'm not tired.

529
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,140
Are you going out?

530
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,180
Yes.

531
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,260
I've been busy for so many years.

532
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,900
Now that you're in our family,

533
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,420
I can finally rest.

534
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,420
We bought Jishu Villa

535
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,950
in the suburbs of Yangzhou.

536
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,140
Your father-in-law and I

537
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,070
are going there for some fresh air.

538
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,270
Mom.

539
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,220
Mom.

540
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,910
You can't leave.

541
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,020
This woman is a tigress.

542
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,880
She wanted to kill me with a knife.

543
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,700
If you leave,

544
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,900
your son will be gone.

545
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,310
Why are you yelling?

546
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,940
How can you still talk if she wanted to kill you?

547
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,540
Dad.

548
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,500
I'm your precious son.

549
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,060
You can't...

550
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,780
Rou.

551
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,660
It's getting late.

552
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
Let's hit the road.

553
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,740
Okay.

554
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,540
Yuru.

555
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,680
When we are not around,

556
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,360
everything in the Gu mansion,

557
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,340
including Jiusi's studies,

558
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,270
are all left in your charge.

559
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,240
I'll leave Ruixue with you.

560
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,380
She knows everything.

561
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,820
With her assistance,

562
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,220
you can rest assured to run the whole house.

563
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,140
Don't worry, Mom and Dad.

564
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,840
I'll take care of everything.

565
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,580
Listen up.

566
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,180
From now on,

567
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,670
Young Madam's words

568
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,140
are equal to my words.

569
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,860
The entire Gu family

570
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,140
should follow her lead.

571
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,540
Yes.

572
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,140
Jiusi,

573
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,580
you have to listen to Yuru.

574
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,860
I'm doing this for your own good.

575
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,700
Let's go.

576
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,020
Mom.

577
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,590
Let's go.

578
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,340
Mom.

579
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,540
Mom, I can't study.

580
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,960
I'm not in good health.

581
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,700
I'm not in good health.

582
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,380
The moment I read a book,

583
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,260
I start to have a headache, a tummy ache, and a leg ache.

584
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,420
Mom, I can't study.

585
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,220
Don't go.

586
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,350
Please turn around and look at me, Mom.

587
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,900
My lord,

588
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,880
it's time to study.

589
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,780
Liu Yuru.

590
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,020
What are you so complacent about?

591
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,780
This mansion is Gu's after all.

592
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,500
Now that my parents left,

593
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,300
I'll be the legitimate master of the Gu's mansion.

594
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,380
Someone!

595
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:26,960
Someone?

596
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,500
Come on.

597
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,310
Why are you standing there? Come here!

598
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,060
Someone!

599
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,460
Yes.

600
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,020
My lord, don't

601
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,180
choose the hard way.

602
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,470
No, no.

603
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,980
Well,

604
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,630
go on with your work.

605
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,690
I'm going to study.

606
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,730
Didn't Young Master say

607
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,130
he was not in good health?

608
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,980
It's not that.

609
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,440
It's his brain that's not in good condition.

610
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,020
You're still too young to fight with me.

611
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,140
Who is it?

612
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,420
How did you...

613
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,780
How did I know

614
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,670
there's a dog hole here, right?

615
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,660
Munan.

616
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,420
Why don't you explain it?

617
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,620
Young Madam is resourceful.

618
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,750
I just named

619
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,700
a place.

620
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,660
I dare not take credit.

621
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,990
You betrayed me.

622
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,780
Young Master.

623
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,980
My current boss is Young Madam.

624
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,150
Since my mother-in-law has entrusted me

625
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,860
with all the house management and Young Master's studies,

626
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,580
I'll be in charge from now on.

627
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,180
From now on,

628
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,180
everyone in the Gu family

629
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,620
should take the Young Master's studies

630
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,750
as the top priority.

631
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,390
Understand?

632
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,420
Yes.

633
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,180
No.

634
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,500
If anyone disturbs him,

635
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,300
or complies to my face

636
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,720
but helps Young Master

637
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,540
do something to influence his studies on the sly,

638
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,820
once found out,

639
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,260
no matter how long

640
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,820
you've served in the mansion,

641
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,300
or how close

642
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,140
you are with Master and Madam,

643
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,620
you will be kicked out.

644
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:02,940
Understand?

645
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:03,780
Yes.

646
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,700
No.

647
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,180
Ruixue,

648
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,660
please go to

649
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,920
Young Master's study.

650
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,700
Sort out all the things that a student would use,

651
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,900
like brushes, ink, paper, ink slab,

652
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,220
as well as the Four Books

653
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,480
and the Five Classics.

654
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,900
Then, find all the irrelevant books,

655
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,700
game cards,

656
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,860
and the ring puzzles,

657
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,990
and throw them away.

658
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,740
Yes.

659
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,780
What are you doing?

660
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,180
It's for your own good, My lord.

661
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Pretty Fairy Liu,

662
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,580
we can discuss.

663
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,390
I have a strange disease.

664
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,420
Whenever I read a book,

665
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,380
I have a leg ache…

666
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,780
A leg ache, a headache, and a stomach ache?

667
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,540
Your whole body doesn't feel well, right?

668
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
That's right.

669
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,720
What does it have to do with me?

670
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,940
I just want to be

671
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,420
a lady with an honorary title conferred by imperial mandate.

672
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,780
Liu Yuru,

673
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,660
you've gone too far!

674
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,870
Are you threatening me?

675
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,700
I am threatening you.

676
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,540
So?

677
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,390
If you do this to me again,

678
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:05,780
I will...

679
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,710
What will you do?

680
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,300
I'll divorce you.

681
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,700
Are you scared?

682
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,020
If you don't make it difficult for me,

683
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,140
I won't make it difficult for you, either.

684
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,270
It's been a long day.

685
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,960
My lord, you must be tired.

686
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,500
Look at the dirt on you.

687
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,580
Wang Shou, Munan.

688
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,300
Yes.

689
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,140
Serve Young Master

690
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,100
to bathe and change clothes.

691
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,460
Young Master,

692
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,740
please.

693
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,550
Let me ask you one thing.

694
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,580
Why did you change my clothes?

695
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,150
I don't like white clothes.

696
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,580
Why are you making me change?

697
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,740
Dress plainly,

698
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,780
so that you'd look like a student.

699
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,580
Your colorful clothes

700
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,120
are not good for focusing.

701
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,620
From now on, you will wear this outfit

702
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,540
when you study.

703
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,900
Just this one outfit?

704
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
I've prepared

705
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
more than 30 outfits for you.

706
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,100
You can change one every day.

707
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,820
Are you doing this on purpose,

708
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,620
Liu Yuru?

709
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,990
From now on,

710
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,620
you should fall asleep between 11 and 1 o'clock,

711
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,190
and wake up between 5 and 7 every day.

712
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,450
This is the content you will be studying.

713
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,380
This one

714
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,220
is your daily

715
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,380
schedule.

716
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,760
Are you trying to push me to death?

717
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
From now on,

718
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,360
I'll wake you up at a fixed time

719
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,760
and send you to school.

720
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,420
When you come back at night,

721
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,820
I'll keep you company to study

722
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,280
and finish your homework.

723
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,260
Every month,

724
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,150
you have five days off.

725
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,960
You can arrange it freely.

726
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,670
However,

727
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,660
you are not allowed to go to brothels, casinos,

728
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,990
or performance venues.

729
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,580
Fine, I don't have to go to brothels,

730
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,500
but can you change it to seven days?

731
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,260
Four days.

732
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
Four days is not enough.

733
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,940
Three days.

734
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,940
You just said four days. Why...

735
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,580
Two days.

736
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,540
Three days is good.

737
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,340
Good. Three days is good.

738
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,580
Very good.

739
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,980
From today on,

740
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,040
you must stop all kinds of playing

741
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,670
and focus on your study.

742
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,660
Liu Yuru,

743
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,980
don't go too far!

744
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,580
Young Master.

745
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,110
Focus on your study.

746
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,280
[Gulin Hall]

747
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,220
You even close the door?

748
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,420
I won't study even if you close the door!

749
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,350
You're dressed in colorful clothes.

750
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,740
And you let me wear white.

751
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,000
Liu Yuru, wait and see.

752
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,710
White clothes?

753
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,170
I'll dye them black later.

754
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,100
I'll burn all the books!

755
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,860
Just wait.

756
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,940
Let's roast a sheep tonight.

757
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,820
Right in this yard.

758
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,840
[Gulin Hall]

759
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,700
Prepare some wine, too.

760
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,940
You've all worked very hard today.

761
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,180
I'll reward you.

762
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,140
Thank you, Young Madam.

763
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,920
[Gulin Hall]

764
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,870
Thank you, Young Madam.

765
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,180
It's just roasted lamb.

766
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,190
Who cares?

767
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,260
It smells so good.

768
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,380
Give me some of

769
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,790
the leg of mutton later.

770
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,060
Just a little.

771
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,420
OK.

772
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,900
Young Madam.

773
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,659
Thank you for your hard work.

774
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,920
Have a good meal today.

775
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,120
I'm counting on you all in the future.

776
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,900
You're welcome, Young Madam.

777
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,300
Thank Young Madam for the wine and meat.

778
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,659
Thank you, Young Madam.

779
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,830
It smells so good.

780
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,560
-It smells good.
-It smells good.

781
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,300
This is for you.

782
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,060
Young Madam.

783
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,510
Go ahead and eat.

784
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,700
It's delicious.

785
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,580
Liu Yuru.

786
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,900
I'm hungry.

787
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,480
Have this piece of meat with skin.

788
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,420
Young Master.

789
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,500
Young Madam has ordered that

790
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,340
you must memorize the first chapter of

791
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,800
"The Analects of Confucius" before you eat.

792
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,900
Traitor.

793
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,290
Let me help you.

794
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,040
Which piece of meat do you want?

795
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,750
Confucius said,

796
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,860
isn't it a pleasure to study and practice what you've learned?

797
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,320
Isn't it a pleasure to study and practice what you've learned?

798
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,260
Isn't it a happy thing

799
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,940
to have friends from afar?

800
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,660
Isn't he a man of complete virtue,
who feels no discomposure

801
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,520
though others take no note of him?

802
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,340
Munan,

803
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,100
bring the wine and dishes

804
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,940
prepared for Young Master.

805
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,380
Yes.

806
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,390
When directing a great nation,
the ruler must attend to business and observes his promises.

807
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,340
He must be economical, love his subjects,
and employ the people at the proper times of the year.

808
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,270
Confucius said,

809
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,910
young people should be filial to their parents and respectful to their brothers.

810
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,990
They should be serious and trustworthy.

811
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,590
Have you memorized them all?

812
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,980
Do you want to check it?

813
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,260
No, I trust you.

814
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,990
Every time you read,

815
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,420
you always get stuck

816
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,500
on the cover.

817
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,860
Once you go past the cover,

818
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,920
it'll be very fast.

819
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,860
Shut up, traitor!

820
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,420
Slowly, you might choke.

821
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,100
Munan.

822
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,860
Pour Young Master some wine.

823
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,780
That's more like it.

824
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,140
You are indeed smart.

825
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,070
Having you just memorize this one chapter

826
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,540
is underestimating you.

827
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,080
It's good you realized it.

828
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,940
How about

829
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,010
memorizing five more chapters tonight?

830
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,870
[Liu Mansion]

831
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,540
Really?

832
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,100
She really took a knife to Lanxiao House?

833
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,790
Yes.

834
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,400
It's all over the city now.

835
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,380
Even the servants of our mansion

836
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,540
are gossiping.

837
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,940
They're wondering if she is possessed.

838
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,340
Good.

839
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,380
But it's useless that the whisper is only among the servants.

840
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,040
It's a waste of this good show.

841
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,270
Find some smart people,

842
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,140
and tonight,

843
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,660
pass the story to Master.

844
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,300
Su Wan

845
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,700
thought

846
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,900
she can pressure me

847
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,180
as she's now in charge of

848
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,510
the keys to the mansion.

849
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,060
Now her daughter

850
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,580
caused such a big trouble

851
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,270
and offended the Gu family.

852
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,140
I'd like to see

853
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,620
if Master will

854
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,300
still spoil her?

855
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,580
I understand.

856
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,900
Young Master.

857
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,200
Have some ginseng tea.

858
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,620
No, I don't deserve it.

859
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,900
Young Master,

860
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,340
have a sip.

861
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,870
Is this the poison

862
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,340
your new boss gave me?

863
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,220
Young Master,

864
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,900
you wronged me.

865
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,910
Munan,

866
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,580
ask your conscience.

867
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,720
If I hadn't saved you when I was young,

868
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,520
you would've frozen to death.

869
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,300
It's been ten years.

870
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,910
I treat you as my brother.

871
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,100
We eat together and sleep together.

872
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,340
Even when your mother was sick,

873
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,940
I've spent money and effort.

874
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,140
But you?

875
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,390
You went to that scheming girl,

876
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,500
Liu Yuru.

877
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,390
Forget it.

878
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,300
I'm too disappointed.

879
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,980
Young Master! Young Master!

880
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,790
I'm innocent, Young Master.

881
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,500
Young Master.

882
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,820
I am loyal to you.

883
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,510
If I didn't

884
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,580
pretend to be loyal to Young Madam,

885
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,260
she would degrade me

886
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,380
to a third-class servant

887
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,860
and send me to clean the toilets in the outer courtyard.

888
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,140
Then there won't be one reliable person

889
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,740
beside you!

890
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,260
I would never

891
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,430
see you again.

892
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,260
I endured humiliation

893
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,580
and stayed by Young Madam's side

894
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,180
just to

895
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,500
get information for you,

896
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,660
so that you can know your enemy well

897
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,020
to escape.

898
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,380
Young Master, you don't believe me?

899
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,660
Look at this.

900
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,340
These are the schedules

901
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,800
of Young Madam these days.

902
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,580
And the timetable for the patrols.

903
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,110
I've written them all here.

904
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,780
I wrote them down secretly.
