00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,300
Don't write anymore divorce letters

383
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,380
so lightly.

384
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,740
A piece of paper can't stop me.

385
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,740
If you really care about me,

386
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,420
tell me

387
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,700
everything.

388
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,940
I'm not stupid.

389
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,020
I'll decide whether to stay or leave.

390
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,700
I don't need you to decide for me.

391
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,780
Okay.

392
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,260
Mother and the managers

393
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,340
have left first on the ship.

394
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,180
They should be safe now.

395
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,620
Where is your mother?

396
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,140
How is she? Is she safe?

397
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,740
That's good.

398
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,620
That's good.

399
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,060
Father escaped through the secret tunnel.

400
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,790
He should

401
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,340
meet up with us soon.

402
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,300
Boss Liu, Young Master Gu.

403
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,660
Mr. Wan.

404
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,700
All of the Gu family's shops

405
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,460
in Yangzhou

406
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,220
have been burned down

407
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,500
by the commissioner.

408
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,100
I found your father's body

409
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,140
in the jewelry shop

410
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,620
on Guangling East Street.

411
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,460
This jade pendant

412
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,660
was found on his body.

413
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,700
Are you sure?

414
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,340
I've done business with the Gu family for many years.

415
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,740
I recognize

416
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,450
your father's face.

417
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,500
What are you doing?

418
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:48,820
Jiusi, calm down.

419
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,780
Let go of me!

420
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,260
No, you can't go!

421
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,140
Calm down, Jiusi!

422
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,820
They're looking for you.

423
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,020
You'll be turning yourself in!

424
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,900
You can't go!

425
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,660
Let go of me!

426
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,340
Mother is waiting for us!

427
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,820
Jiusi.

428
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,060
Mother is waiting for us.

429
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,100
Jiusi.

430
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,380
Jiusi.

431
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,940
My condolences.

432
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,340
My condolences.

433
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,370
My condolences.

434
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,980
Jiusi.

435
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,960
[Wang Mansion]

436
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,900
Commissioner, Master.

437
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,220
We've searched the city,

438
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,220
but we couldn't find

439
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,620
Gu Jiusi and Liu Yuru.

440
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,490
The city gates are locked.

441
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,100
You searched all night but couldn't find two people.

442
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,860
They couldn't possibly have

443
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,860
flown or burrowed away.

444
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,260
Search again.

445
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,540
Yes.

446
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,100
Your Highness.

447
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,980
Calm down.

448
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,490
Young Master Luo,

449
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,340
do you have any ideas?

450
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,700
What's happening there?

451
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,210
I'm not sure.

452
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,450
This is our family's

453
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,260
last secret tunnel.

454
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,020
Let's hurry up.

455
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,580
Yuru.

456
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,620
Young Master.

457
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,100
After thinking about it,

458
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,660
there's something I can't hide from you anymore.

459
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,210
The soldiers

460
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,660
have arrested the entire Yang family

461
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,700
to force them to hand over Yang Wenchang.

462
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,580
Otherwise, they'd be sentenced as accomplices

463
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,780
for harboring a fugitive.

464
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,220
Their whole family would be executed and their corpses would be abandoned.

465
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,380
So

466
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,260
Yang Wenchang came back by himself.

467
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,340
Wang Shanquan said

468
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,580
Yang Wenchang's life

469
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,020
can be exchanged for the lives of the whole Yang family.

470
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,660
He captured Wenchang

471
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,100
because he couldn't find Jiusi.

472
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,860
Uncle Yang always said he was useless

473
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,060
and didn't know how to do business.

474
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,380
Now,

475
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,660
Wenchang's closed a large deal.

476
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,460
His life for the whole family's.

477
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,020
When will he be beheaded?

478
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,900
Today.

479
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,300
Jiusi.

480
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,900
I know what's important.

481
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,940
I can't save him,

482
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
but I can at least send him off.

483
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,700
Young Master Luo, we've searched everywhere.

484
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,300
There's no trace of Gu Jiusi.

485
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,610
Keep searching.

486
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,460
Search carefully.

487
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,250
If they show up,

488
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,580
they will disguise themselves.

489
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,860
Yes.

490
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,060
Master,

491
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,260
what if Gu Jiusi

492
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,580
isn't as loyal as the rumors say,

493
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,180
and he's simply too cowardly

494
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,580
to come?

495
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,820
We can see the execution ground from here.

496
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,340
I'll keep watch down there.

497
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,940
Young Master, Young Madam, hurry.

498
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,660
Okay.

499
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,210
Wenchang,

500
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,740
you are also

501
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,220
a famous character in Yangzhou City.

502
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,700
You can't leave

503
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,900
without a send off drink.

504
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,340
Wenchang,

505
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,580
we both know that

506
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,650
right now,

507
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,700
there is still one person who can save your life.

508
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,420
Unfortunately,

509
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,140
I overestimated

510
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,940
the loyalty between you brothers.

511
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,580
You're wrong.

512
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,300
If Gu Jiusi doesn't show up today,

513
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,700
he will still be my brother.

514
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,220
If Gu Jiusi really comes for me,

515
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,460
he will be a foolish man who loses sight of what's important

516
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,580
because of a moment of indignation.

517
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,020
I, Yang Wenchang,

518
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,580
won't have such a man for a brother.

519
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,540
Wenchang,

520
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,940
I thought

521
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,130
you only cared about cockfighting and dog racing.

522
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,260
Who knew you would be fearless in the face of death?

523
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,540
I'm impressed.

524
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,739
I was wrong, my nephew.

525
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,380
What's so hard

526
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,420
about dying?

527
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,820
In my opinion,

528
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,420
there's nothing easier

529
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,540
than dying.

530
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,340
You only have to close your eyes and kick your legs,

531
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,620
cross the Bridge of Forgetfulness,

532
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,940
and you will have arrived at your next life.

533
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,260
But it's hard to live.

534
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,139
I'm not capable.

535
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:52,980
I enjoyed 20 years

536
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,540
of leisure and riches.

537
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,179
I thought

538
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,690
I could go horse-riding, flower-viewing,

539
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,940
cockfighting, and dog racing

540
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,540
for the rest of my life of enjoyment and freedom.

541
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,980
But now,

542
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,420
the situation is on the verge of collapse

543
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,340
and a storm is coming.

544
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,060
People like me, who have been raised on luxury

545
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,540
and are greedy for enjoyment,

546
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,700
won't be able to

547
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,260
withstand the suffering in these troubled times.

548
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,300
In life,

549
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,380
people are like water.

550
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,500
Wherever the water flows,

551
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,650
you

552
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,580
will be carried there.

553
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,700
Nobility

554
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,060
and commoners alike

555
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,380
struggle amidst it.

556
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,740
No one can escape.

557
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,620
Carving out

558
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,380
a dignified path

559
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,180
that allows you to survive

560
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,300
and save other people

561
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,980
is too difficult.

562
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,700
I can't handle such a difficult task.

563
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,660
I'll leave it to Jiusi.

564
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,050
♫ In a troubled spring and autumn ♫

565
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,460
Search in that direction.

566
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,440
♫ As he looks back, it's like our first meeting ♫

567
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,580
Yes.

568
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,510
♫ He fell into the eye of the storm ♫

569
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,190
♫ Black and white hair fall untied ♫

570
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,940
I'll keep this

571
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,940

♫ The wind and clouds, the lakes in writing ♫

596
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,020
who scheme in underhanded ways

597

This has nothing to do with you.

You're just one of the countless merchants

under the Gu family

630
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,340
trying to make a living.

Except for Ye Shi'an,

651
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,860
who went back to the academy,

652
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,780
