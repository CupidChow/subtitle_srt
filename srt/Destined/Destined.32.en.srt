00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,130
Zhou Ye used the military intelligence network

5
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,660
of his eldest brother and second brother

6
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,140
to find

7
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,200
the staff who gave a false testimony.

8
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,380
Are you the staff of Lefeng Restaurant,

9
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,460
Zhao Xiaohe?

10
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,580
Giving a false testimony

11
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,380
to slander an imperial official

12
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,020
would be punished with a beheading.

13
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,460
He indeed took money from the Ministry of Justice

14
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,790
and was about to escape.

15
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,300

in the room where Liu Chun got killed.

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,700
The bloody fingerprints on the curtain

20
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,660
might have been left

21
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,460
by Liu Chun when he was murdered.

22
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,200
Do you recognize the mark?

23
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,040
Who is this person?

24
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,780
This is a serious matter.

25
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,980
I want to see His Majesty.

26
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,660
Only His Majesty

27
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,520
can handle this matter properly.

28
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,710
Okay.

29
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,670
Jiusi.

30
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,660
I will get you out of here.

31
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,100
I, Gu Jiusi,

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,900
must have cultivated blessings for several lifetimes

33
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,460
to marry such a good wife

34
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,980
who has developed our ancestral business

35
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,380
and dashed around for me.

36
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,100
Jiusi.

37
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,410
I idealized everything

38
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,940
and underestimated the difficulty.

39
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,000
At first, I thought

40
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,730
I could focus on making money to pave the way

41
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,270
for you to serve the people.

42
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,660
But after we came to Eastern Capital,

43
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,180

45
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,740

Why did you say that, Uncle?

71
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,480
You made her think that

72
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,820
once you present the token of the murderer,

73
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,230
you can clear your name.

74
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,260
That should be the case.

75
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,860
Jiusi,

76
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,340
you've contributed to throning the Emperor.

77
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,260
You're also an upright and loyal official.

78
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,860
His Majesty knows that clearly.

79
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,580
Fan Xuan does admire you.

80
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,100
But even with admiration, what if

81
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,820
you are compared with

82
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,980
the Crown Prince,

83
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,620
who is his own

84
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,550
flesh and blood?

85
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,360
Who will he choose?

86
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,240
There are many smart people in the world.

87
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,840
Intelligent young people

88
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,060
always say their ideas out loud.

89
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,550
When they get older,

90
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,000
they will then realize

91
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,400
the real intelligence

92
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,310
is to be reticent about what they know.

93
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,350
So you mean...

94
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,630
If you keep the item,

95
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,980
you will have a chance to survive.

96
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,100
But if you present it to His Majesty,

97
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,750
you will die for sure.

98
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,440
But I believe His Majesty is wise enough.

99
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,030
He will judge impartially.

100
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,980
Wise enough?

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,910
I've been an official for more than ten years.

102
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,700
I've witnessed a lot of absurd happenings.

103
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,580
Why do you think

104
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,340
I could become the Minister of Personnel during the previous dynasty?

105
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,540
It was because I was ridiculous enough.

106
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,230
Maybe Fan Xuan is a good person.

107
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,340
But anyone

108
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,250
involved in the whirlpool of power

109
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,380
in Eastern Capital

110
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,420
can't act as they wish.

111
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,820
The Emperor is different from the Commissioner.

112
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,690
The Emperor needs a successor

113
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,420
to balance all forces

114
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,180
so that

115
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,620
Da Xia which has been covered with mud

116
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,820
can keep on operating.

117
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,700
His Majesty needs to compromise

118
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,460
and tolerate so much.

119
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,180
But now you are locked here,

120
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,290
isn't that caused by

121
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,780
you speculating about the Emperor's intention?

122
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,380
Before Lord Liang rebelled,

123
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,980
I had resigned, left the capital

124
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,220
and cut ties with him.

125
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,340
But the Jiang family is closely related to Lord Liang.

126
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,270
No matter who

127
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,820
took over Eastern Capital,

128
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,280
I would surely be treated as his accomplice.

129
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,000
Even Fan Xuan is no exception.

130
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,100
Now that you have been

131
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,160
acknowledged and valued by Fan Xuan,

132
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,980
you should clearly realize that

133
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,260
from now on,

134
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,270
you have to cut ties with me

135
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,900
and not have any contact,

136
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,800
in case the Emperor gets suspicious.

137
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,310
As for the Imperial Prison,

138
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,700
it turns out to be the safest place

139
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,420
for me.

140
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,480
Do you understand?

141
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,900
Uncle,

142
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,670
have you reconciled to it?

143
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,260
You have great ambition

144
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,390
and literacy talent

145
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,230
but nowhere to show.

146
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,740
Do you really accept it?

147
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,310
Jiusi.

148
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,830
Look at you.

149
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,630
What's the point

150
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,860
of saying this now?

151
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,360
If His Majesty summons me,

152
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,000
I will ask for his permission for you to return to the court.

153
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,890
Although you can't be regarded as reinstated,

154
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,950
at least you won't waste your talent.

155
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,180
After all, you still trust Fan Xuan.

156
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:28,900
Uncle,

157
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,580
do you remember

158
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,540
the first time I went to the gambling house when I was young,

159
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,670
you took me there?

160
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,310
Do you dare to bet

161
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,260
one more time?

162
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,659
You're betting your life on it.

163
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,740
I've been betting

164
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,560
all the way I came through.

165
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,810
But I won

166
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,270
the best wife in the world.

167
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,710
I won

168
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
reliable and trustworthy friends.

169
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,700
I also won 300,000 lives

170
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,190
of people in Wangdu.

171
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,070
This time,

172
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,070
I bet His Majesty is a wise emperor.

173
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,340
I bet Da Xia won't

174
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,690
make the same mistake as the previous dynasty.

175
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,420
I believe Da Xia

176
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,670
will be a

177
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:12,810
new empire

178
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,880

Who is she?

181
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,900
I think she's from the Gu family.

182
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,700
Gu family?

183
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,730
Which Gu family?

184
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,539
The same family as the Deputy Minister of Revenue

185
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,460
who killed somebody and was imprisoned.

186
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,340
Was he wronged?

187
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,210
Who knows? Let's take a look.

188

want to see the Emperor

191

and clear my husband's name.

192
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,950
I see. It's Madam Gu.

193
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,670
Greetings, Your Highness.

194
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,780
Her Highness?

195
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,030
Why did the Princess come for it?

196
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,460
Are you here

197
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,700
for Deputy Minister Gu?

198
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,740
Don't worry.

199
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,760
Since I bumped into you today,

200
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,100
I will make sure the Investigating Censor

201
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
deals with the matter impartially.

202
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,380
Come with me.

203
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,000
[Institute of Inspection]

204
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:52,400
[Institute of Inspection]

205
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,670
It must be a big deal.

206
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,940
Even the Princess is here.

207
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,750
Yes.

208
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
I send my regards to you,

209
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,890
Your Highness.

210
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,950
Rise.

211
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,340
Who

212
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,230
is kneeling down there?

213
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,030
I, Gu-Liu Yuru,

214
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,500
am the wife of Gu Jiusi, the Deputy Minister of Revenue.

215
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,900
Why did you beat the drum?

216
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,880
I want to bring accusations before the Emperor.

217
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,350
My husband was framed by a villain.

218
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,060
He is innocent but is now in prison.

219
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,990
Sir, please report to His Majesty.

220
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,330
I would like to hand over the evidence

221
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,860
to His Majesty personally.

222
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,930
What evidence makes

223
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,590
you can't submit it directly?

224
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,710
Sir, I would like to know

225
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,460
if you will address the case.

226
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,030
If you intend to address it,

227
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,510
I will submit the evidence.

228
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,320
Then, you should do so.

229
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,350
Hold on.

230
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,550
Your Highness.

231
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,020
I am not qualified enough

232
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,700
to handle the case.

233
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,240
If so, you should ask Madam Gu

234
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,840
to go somewhere else so the case can be handled.

235
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,150
You should

236
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,780
follow the rules.

237
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:21,860
Sir,

238
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,660
according to the law,

239
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,990
Dengwen Drum is located

240
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,780
at the Institute of Inspection

241
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,060
so that Investigating Censor

242
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,820
can deal with the grievance of the people.

243
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,940
Once someone beats Dengwen Drum,

244
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,610
their appeal will be passed to His Majesty.

245
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,260
I want to clear my husband's name.

246
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,590
So I hit the Dengwen Drum

247
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,880
to see the Emperor.

248
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,220
May I ask

249
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,990
why it is against the rules?

250
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,580
Yes, it makes sense.

251
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,740
Why can't she do so?

252
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,620
Why is it against the rules?

253
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,340
Come on.

254
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,200
Moreover, Your Highness,

255
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,630
as a princess,

256
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,060
may I ask what position you are holding

257
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,430
to meddle in the affairs

258
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,220
in Institute of Inspection?

259
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,990
Now you are sitting there,

260
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,870
which of the rules does it comply with?

261
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,950
Madam Gu is indeed familiar with the Law of Da Xia.

262
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,270
If so, do you know

263
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,620
according to the law,

264
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,420
after beating the Dengwen Drum and asking to meet the Emperor,

265
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,620
a man needs to be flogged 30 times first,

266
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,140
while a woman needs to be punished by finger crushing?

267
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,380
Madam Gu,

268
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,710
are you willing to be punished?

269
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,180
Finger crushing?

270
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,190
This is too...

271
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,860
How can a weak woman

272
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,910
stand it?

273
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,870
As far as I know,

274
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,100
this is the law of the previous dynasty.

275
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,500
A new dynasty comes with new policies.

276
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,100
His Majesty pitied the people

277
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,010
and has decreed

278
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,020
to revise the law

279
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,560
and abolish this rule.

280
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,460
Has the revision finished yet?

281
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,180
As long as the new law is not issued,

282
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,460
the old law can still be followed.

283
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,430
Investigating Censor,

284
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,340
am I right?

285
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,910
Yes.

286
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,220
Madam Gu.

287
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,710
How about...

288
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,070
forget it?

289
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,980
That's right.

290
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,900
You should go back, Madam Gu.

291
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,150
You can't simply bring accusations before the Emperor.

292
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,820
Are you here today

293
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,990
prepared to be punished?

294
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,620
I don't think so.

295
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,830
Finger crushing is painful.

296
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,170
You look beautiful today.

297
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,630
If you are punished later,

298
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,060
you'll look ugly.

299
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,700
What you're trying to do

300
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,150
is just useless.

301
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,300
You can't save Jiusi.

302
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,110
He

303
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,500
shouldn't have

304
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,470
married an ordinary woman.

305
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,780
Sir.

306
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,310
I

307
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,540
am willing to accept the punishment of finger crushing.

308
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,470
How much grievance she has to do so?

309
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,870
Please tell His Majesty

310
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,110
about the hidden truth of the case.

311
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,740
Gu Jiusi has become

312
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,260
the Deputy Minister of Revenue

313
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,860
at such a young age.

314
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,390
In terms of scheming and judging the situation,

315
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,070
he's an expert.

316
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,550
Do you really think

317
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,310
he's pure and innocent deep inside?

318
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,710
Do you believe that

319
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,350
he has no wrongdoing at all

320
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,990
and he has nothing to do with this case?

321
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,020
I believe.

322
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,360
You can punish her now.

323
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,590
Yes.

324
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,240
[Order]

325
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,260
Execute!

326
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,780
Wait!

327
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,300
[Silence]

328
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,150
Grand Tutor Luo.

329
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,220
Greetings, Grand Tutor Luo.

330
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,900
Liu Yuru.

331
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,720
Gu Jiusi is not worth

332
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,070
you striving

333
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,070
and even risking your life.

334
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,430
I trust him.

335
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,120
I trust my husband.

336
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,600
He is impartial and selfless.

337
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,270
I trust my husband

338
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,950
has lived up to His Majesty's grace

339
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,660
and the people's expectations.

340
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,110
My husband

341
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,070
is a dignified official.

342
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,100
Sir.

343
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,860
Please execute the punishment.

344
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,070
Okay.

345
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,190
Execute!

Since Your Majesty inherited the throne

These people

532
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,620
took advantage of Your Majesty when you haven't gained a firm foothold

533

But if we punish them now,

536
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,820
it will give others

now?

545
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,030
I suggest the first step

546
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
is to rectify the government

547

548
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,550
I'd recommend Ye Shi'an

He ranked first in the Provincial Examination during the previous dynasty,

552

556
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,790
he will definitely pick

00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,760

560
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,620

562
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,340
It seems like our country

564
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,060

00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,340
The commissioners

567
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,490
are also making a move.

568
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,030
We need a great victory

569
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,110
to crack the whip

570
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,980
so that we can ensure peace for Da Xia for the next ten years

571
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,240
and the people can live and work in peace.

572
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,870
Jiusi,

573
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,420
your move

574
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,750
is so risky.

575
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,730
That's right.

576
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,480
If we win with the move,

577
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,340
we can ensure peace for Da Xia for ten years.

578
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,460
What if

579
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,580
we lose?

580
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,750
That's why we need to take down Liu Xingzhi first.

581
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,380
Yuzhou is facing locust invasions.

582
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,580
They don't have enough provisions.

583
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,900
Speed matters the most in battles. We should take this opportunity

584
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,500
to attack Yuzhou in the south.

585
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,260
We will besiege them for at most a year.

586
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,190
When the grains in the city run out,

587
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,020
we can take them down easily.

588
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,790
Then,

589
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,820
who can be the commander-in-chief?

590
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,300
I'd recommend

591
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,350
Zhou Ye.

592
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,080
We need someone who is meticulous

593
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,300
and firm,

594
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,560
someone who can mobilize the army

595
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,290
and is trusted by Your Majesty.

596
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,660
The three sons

597
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,560
of General Zhou, the Minister of State Security,

598
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,980
are extraordinary talents.

599
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,700
But the reason I chose Zhou Ye

600
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,670
is not only that.

601
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,260
Go ahead.

602
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,540
This battle is not a war of attack

603
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,420
but a war of appeasing the people

604
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,880
and arousing patriotism.

605
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,940
Besides bravery, the commander-in-chief

606
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,650
has to be kind

607
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,380
to the soldiers and the people.

608
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,260
After the battle of guarding Wangdu,

609
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,700
we can know Zhou Ye's personality of being

610
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,550
loyal

611
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,960
and kind to the people.

612
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,950
He can take this responsibility.

613
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,270
What a good saying for

614
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,860
"appeasing the people and arousing patriotism."

615
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,230
I witnessed

616
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,460
Zhou Ye's growth.

617
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,240
I have no doubts

618
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,420
about deploying him.

619
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,460
But

620
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,820
the deficit treasury is gradually rising.

621
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,990
What about the Empress Dowager

622
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,140
who formed a clique for personal gains?

623
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,420
To solve this problem, we need to wait and see.

624
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,500
We have evidence of the entire Ministry of Revenue

625
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,900
embezzled the treasury.

626
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,940
Lu Yong, the Minister of Revenue,

627
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,340
must be dismissed and punished severely

628
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
to show everyone.

629
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,500
But the stakes are high.

630
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,330
If anything goes wrong,

631
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,460
everyone in the court

632
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,120
will be panicked and anxious.

633
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,070
I'm inexperienced.

634
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,180
I'm afraid I can't take the responsibility.

635
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,740
I suggest

636
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,410
we need someone

637
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,460
who is well-versed in official paths

638
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,310
and has a close relationship

639
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,700
with the Empress Dowager and old ministers

640
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,960
to handle this matter.

641
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,390
Who

642
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,380
are you referring to?

643
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,900
The Minister of Personnel of the previous dynasty,

644
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,870
my uncle,

645
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,820
Jiang He.

646
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,660
He was the Deputy Minister of Revenue before this.

647
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,220
He has been managing the Ministry of Revenue for ten years during the previous dynasty.

648
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,260
Then, he was promoted to the Minister of Personnel.

649
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,820
He knows a lot about

650
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,140
the Ministry of Revenue of the previous dynasty.

651
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,490
He was a minister during the previous dynasty,

652
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,020
so he must have a close relationship

653
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,480
with the Empress Dowager.

654
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,550
If

655
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,230
he is in charge of it,

656
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,220
I believe the Empress Dowager

657
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,940
will not make things difficult for him.

658
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,800
It indeed can achieve the balance

659
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,940
if he is back in court.

660
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,650
I am truly loyal to Your Majesty.

661
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,060
I will persuade him to be loyal to you.

662
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,760
He was a capable official during the previous dynasty.

663
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,510
If he

664
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,100
can assist Your Majesty,

665
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,080
it will surely be a great help.

666
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,020
Good.

667
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,190
Jiusi.

668
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,150
Let me

669
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,150
think about it.

670
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,110
Yes.

671
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,460
Jiusi.

672
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:39,980
Well,

673
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,500
what about

674
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,780
your own case?

675
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,210
Zhou Ye has found

676
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,340
the witness of the case.

677
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,820
It's a staff of Lefeng Restaurant.

678
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,660
He was running away from Eastern Capital with his family.

679
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,650
Now he has admitted that

680
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,220
he took a bribe from the Ministry of Justice

681
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,860
to slander me as the murderer.

682
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,010
Following the clues,

683
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,480
he also found the inferior official

684
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,020
who buried the murder weapon and bloody clothes in my house.

685
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,780
That's good.

686
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,700
That's good.

687
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,670
I

688
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,230
will clear your name.

689
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

690
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,660
Your Majesty.

691
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,390
I've known

692
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,910
who killed Liu Chun.

693
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,980
It's just that it's inconvenient to tell anyone.

694
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,240
I'm here to report to Your Majesty first.

695
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,420
This mark

696
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,390
was left by the murderer who killed Liu Chun.

697
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,990
Thank you, Father.

698
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,280
Your Highness,

699
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,630
I just saw

700
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,030
Mr. Gu was still in the Imperial Study.

701
00:33:59,050 --> 00:33:59,910
His Majesty...

702
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,660
His Majesty lost his temper.

703
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,190
Grand Tutor.

704
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,300
Save me!

705
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,380
Don't worry, Your Highness.

706
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,429
I have thought of

707
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:14,980
a backup plan for you.

708
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,020
Gu Jiusi

709
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,139
will not leave the palace alive.

710
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,150
That day,

711
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,219
I asked Liu Chun to meet at Lefeng Restaurant.

712
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,659
After analyzing the pros and cons,

713
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,389
Liu Chun decided to confess.

714
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,340
When I left,

715
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
someone found

716
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,610
Liu Chun died in Tianshui Pavilion.

717
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,139
I was imprisoned.

718
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,719
Ye Shi'an and Shen Ming

719
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,980
went to Lefeng Restaurant

720
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,110
and found this mark.

721
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,739
After comparison,

722
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,400
it was indeed left by Liu Chun.

723
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,030
When he was killed,

724
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,050
he grabbed

725
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,500
the killer's accessory tightly

726
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,300
and that's how the mark was left.

727
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,640
This accessory is rare to be seen.

728
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,440
Only one person

729
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,260
always wears it.

730
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,520
Why would the Crown Prince

731
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,470
want to kill Liu Chun?

732
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,160
It's unusual that

733
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,740
the evidence was noticeable.

734
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,020
On the day of the incident,

735
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,460
the entry and exit records

736
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,180
of the Crown Prince were also recorded.

737
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,420
Instead of asking why the Crown Prince wanted to kill Liu Chun,

738
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,230
why not ask

739
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,020
why the person

740
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:29,110
used the Crown Prince?

741
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,500
His purpose

742
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,900
is not only to frame me

743
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,000
but to threaten the others

744
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,830
using the Crown Prince.

745
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,980
Your Majesty.

746
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,090
Recently, the Crown Prince

747
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,220
always spends time with the Grand Tutor.

748
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,750
He goes hunting in the suburbs when he's free.

749
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,820
By the way,

750
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,110
he also went to

751
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,350
Lefeng Restaurant.

752
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,190
The Crown Prince

753
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,380
is of kind nature.

754
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,060
Although he didn't achieve big,

755
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,320
he has worked hard to govern the country.

756
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,180
But since Your Majesty

757
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,020
assigned Luo Zishang as the Grand Tutor,

758
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,130
the Crown Prince has been arrogant and domineering.

759
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,860
He abused power and governance.

760
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,520
Now he made such a big mistake.

761
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,620
Your Majesty.

762
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,940
The Crown Prince is not virtuous enough

763
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,110
to be your successor.

764
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,110
Shut up!

765
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,940
Your Majesty.

766
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,260
I

767
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,350
have only one son.

768
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,740
You put this

769
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,270
in front of me.

770
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,540
What do you want me to do?

771
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,060
But the people of Da Xia

772
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,300
are still counting on Your Majesty.

773
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,260
Please

774
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,700
take care of your health.

775
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,510
Pass my order.

776
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,790
Ask the Crown Prince

777
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,820
to leave Eastern Capital

778
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,500
and go back to Youzhou.

779
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,150
No one

780
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,500
is allowed to go with him.

781
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,760
Liu Chun, the Deputy Minister of Revenue

782
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,620
embezzled the treasury

783
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,950
and committed suicide to escape punishment.

784
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,470
Confiscate all his property.

785
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,510
His offspring for the next three generations

786
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,980
are not allowed to be officials.

787
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,430
Gu Jiusi, the Deputy Minister of Revenue,

788
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,660
was wronged.

789
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,760
Release him immediately.

790
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

791
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

792
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,540
Deputy Minister Gu.

793
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,140
Please.

794
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:57,230
[Changgeng Palace]

795
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,430
Deputy Minister Gu,

796
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,840
please forgive me for not seeing you off.

797
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,630
Manzi,

798
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,520
Escort Deputy Minister Gu back to his house.

799
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,100
Yes.

800
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,030
Minister Jiang,

801
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,600
please accept the decree.

802
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,260
The Deputy Minister of Works of the previous dynasty, Jiang He,

803
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,380
has a talent for great strategies.

804
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,660
He has been an official for 15 years

805
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,130
and has always been loyal to the country.

806
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,140
Hence, he is reliable and trustworthy.

807
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,740
Now he has been appointed as the Minister of Revenue

808
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,870
and is responsible for collecting lost treasury money.

809
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,750
That's all.

810
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,820
I

811
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,590
accept the decree.

812
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,820
Congratulations, Minister Jiang.

813
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,020
I have one more verbal decree.

814
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,910
His Majesty wants to see you.

815
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,590
Thank you.

816
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,150
Jiusi.

817
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,940
You won the bet.

818
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:24,860
Sir,

819
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,470
have you seen my wife?

820
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,500
She should be waiting for me here.

821
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,460
Madam Gu is tired.

822
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,300
His Majesty asked her to go back first.

823
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,710
Was she unwell?

824
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,630
No.

825
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,520
Madam Gu is so fragile.

826
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,120
His Majesty...

827
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,040
His Majesty pitied her,

828
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,770
so he asked her to go back first.

829
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,240
What happened to her?

830
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,640
Please tell me the truth.

831
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,900
Madam Gu asked us

832
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,990
not to tell you.

833
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,650
Madam Gu hit the Dengwen Drum today

834
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,980
and was intervened by Princess Yunchang.

835
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,060
She was then punished with finger crushing.

836
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,260
Now she is summoned by Empress Dowager.

837
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,870
Are you Gu-Liu Yuru?

838
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,100
Yes.

839
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,060
You dared to accept the finger-crushing punishment in person

840
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,740
to seek justice for your husband.

841
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,530
I can tell

842
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,580
you are a person who knows righteousness

843
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,380
and won't stop

844
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,060
your husband from improving.

845
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,300
I think

846
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,860
you'll have no problem

847
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,940
when getting along with my daughter in the future.

848
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,420
My daughter did have an engagement

849
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,460
with Deputy Minister Gu.

850
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,310
I was thinking

851
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,230
to make a good end for them

852
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,910
and allow you to divorce.
