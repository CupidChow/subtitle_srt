[Destined]

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,030
[Episode 37]

4
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,820
Why did you ask me that?

5
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,470
For me,

6
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,660
there are two most important things in my life.

7
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,020
One is the state of Da Xia,

8
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,180
and the other is you.

9
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,300
I must

10
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,260
entrust these two things

11
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,860
to the person I trust the most,

12
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,750
so that I can rest in peace.

13
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,470
Father!

14
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,229
Why am I not good enough?

15
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,790
Why can't I be the emperor?

16
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,540
Yu'er.

17
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,110
If you could be like Gu Jiusi,

18
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,970
I would surely...

19
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,940
Enough!

20
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,070
Shut up!

21
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,300
Stop pretending.

22
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,540
Gu Jiusi.

23
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,740
In your eyes,

24
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,310
there has only been others,

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,870
but not me.

26
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,860
You left me on my own

27
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,710
in Youzhou.

28
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,390
Father.

29
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,579
You can only see

30
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,550
your empire

31
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,030
and your officials.

32
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,060
You are so cold-blooded and ruthless

33
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,300
to your own son.

34
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,190
What kind of father are you?

35
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,470
Yu'er.

36
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,550
Yu'er, you...

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,420
Your Highness.

38
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,350
Your Highness.

39
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,060
How could you offend His Majesty like this?

40
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,870
How could you be so reckless?

41
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,900
His Majesty has been ill for a long time.

42
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,190
[Peace and Tranquil]

43
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,310
He can't take any more torment.

44
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,530
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,820
I'll summon the imperial physician immediately.

46
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,660
Your Majesty!

47
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,050
Call in the imperial physician!

48
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,250
Imperial physician!

49
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,620
Call in the imperial physician!

50
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,310
Father.

51
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,420
Father.

52
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,870
Father!

53
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,220
Father!

54
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,430
Don't go.

55
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,550
Don't leave me.

56
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,990
Father.

57
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,420
I'm scared.

58
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,159
Your Highness.

59
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,960
Your Highness.

60
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,190
Grand Tutor.

61
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,910
I'm an orphan now.

62
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,310
I made Father so angry that he died.

63
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,630
Your Majesty, stop talking nonsense.

64
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,720
The late emperor died of illness.

65
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,420
It had nothing to do with you, Your Majesty.

66
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,180
Before Father passed away,

67
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,980
his dying wish was to let Uncle Zhou be the next emperor,

68
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,940
not me.

69
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,900
That's not true.

70
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,230
The country

71
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,090
is already yours, Your Majesty.

72
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,530
The late emperor knew that

73
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,660
his time was coming,

74
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,940
hence he summoned Your Majesty to the palace to grant you his will.

75
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,630
As for the content of his will,

76
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,500
only Your Majesty know about it.

77
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,440
[I hereby order Zhou Gaolang to lead the Youzhou Army to pacify Nanzhao.]

78
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,740
Asking Uncle Zhou

79
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,830
to conquer Nanzhao?

80
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,110
Yes.

81
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,330
You want me

82
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,420
to pass on a false will of Father's?

83
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,620
Zhou Gaolang made great contributions, which is a threat to the emperor.

84
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,480
Only if he leaves Eastern Capital

85
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,060
can Your Majesty rest easy

86
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,340
on your throne.

87
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,780
But...

88
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,430
But what if Zhou Gaolang has doubts

89
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,500
and refuses to go?

90
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,580
He will believe it.

91
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,659
Why?

92
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,390
There has always been a rift

93
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,260
between Zhou Gaolang and His Majesty.

94
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,140
They were indeed inseparable before.

95
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,860
But later,

96
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,810
they were separated by the identity difference between the emperor and the official.

97
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,750
This will

98
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,020
simply serves to

99
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,280
establish the unclear

100
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,740
but undeniable mistrust

101
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,630
[I hereby order Zhou Gaolang to lead the Youzhou Army to pacify Nanzhao.]

102
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,230
between them.

103
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,580
If this will

104
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,420
confirms his guess,

105
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,660
he will think

106
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,270
he knew it long ago.

107
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,260
So he'll be convinced.

108
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,390
If he believes

109
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,380
this is Father's will,

110
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,340
he will definitely do it

111
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,620
even if he has to put his life on the line.

112
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,100
Your Majesty.

113
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,270
The late emperor has passed away.

114
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,620
My condolences, Your Majesty.

115
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,390
Your Majesty!

116
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,030
Brother Fan!

117
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,980
Good brother.

118
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,510
Good brother!

119
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,060
Good brother...

120
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,420
General Zhou.

121
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,770
The new emperor ordered me

122
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,770
to deliver the late emperor's will.

123
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,950
His Majesty just passed away.

124
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,230
The Crown Prince hasn't ascended the throne yet,

125
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,350
and you are already saying things like

126
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,880
the new emperor and the late emperor.

127
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,540
Aren't you a bit too impatient?

128
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,270
Zhou Gaolang, listen to the edict.

129
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,420
The mighty Grand General Pacifying the North,

130
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,380
Zhou Gaolang,

131
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,300
led troops to garrison the border.

132
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,940
He's been through tough battles.

133
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,140
He's loyal and brave,

134
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,580
and is of vital importance to the country.

135
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,040
The bandits in Nanzhao refused to surrender

136
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,940
and forcibly intruded the border.

137
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,660
The people are suffering.

138
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,940
I hereby order

139
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,090
Zhou Gaolang

140
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,860
to lead the Youzhou Army to the south,

141
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,030
serve the country

142
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,560
by pacifying Nanzhao,

143
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,630
and demonstrate the military prestige of Da Xia.

144
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,910
Respect this.

145
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,300
His Majesty wanted us to conquer the south instead of garrisoning the north?

146
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,100
That's right.

147
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,190
The Youzhou Army is mostly

148
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,150
composed of cavalry.

149
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,540
They were born and raised

150
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,710
in the north.

151
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,730
They are better at

152
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,740
horseback archery on open prairies.

153
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,890
Why did he want us to

154
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,380
conquer Nanzhao in the rugged mountains and humid rain forests

155
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,750
in the south

156
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,090
instead of

157
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,150
garrisoning the border in the north?

158
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,780
His Majesty's mind is unpredictable.

159
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,990
I don't dare to guess.

160
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,550
General Zhou.

161
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,430
Take the edict.

162
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,510
Right.

163
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,860
That's what he wanted.

164
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,310
My old brother

165
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,980
wanted me

166
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,300
to wipe out

167
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,950
the border

168
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,670
with my gnawed old bone

169
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,660
for the Crown Prince.

170
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,220
To realize my angry words

171
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,750
of dying on the battlefield.

172
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,780
In case

173
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,010
this old man, whose merits make the emperor uneasy,

174
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,350
becomes a threat

175
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,510
to the new emperor.

176
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,420
Old brother.

177
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,140
I'll listen to you.

178
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,940
I'll listen to you.

179
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,660
I,

180
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,740
Zhou Gaolang,

181
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,040
receive the edict.

182
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,460
Brother Ye.

183
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:14,990
Jiusi.

184
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,110
Yuru.

185
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,080
It's been three years.

186
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,180
I've been waiting for you here

187
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
for a while.

188
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,830
Yuru.

189
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,620
Although I've got the news beforehand,

190
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,220
seeing you

191
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,750
standing in front of me now,

192
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,630
it's still hard to believe.

193
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,900
I'm so happy.

194
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,530
Thank you

195
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,900
for taking care of my mother

196
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,100
and mother-in-law over the past three years.

197
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
Please accept my kowtow.

198
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,750
Don't say that.

199
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,470
Shi'an.

200
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,830
How is Eastern Capital?

201
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,220
His Majesty

202
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,070
passed away.

203
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,380
His Majesty's coffin has been sent to the mausoleum.

204
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,380
How could this be?

205
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,140
A few days ago,

206
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,580
His Majesty sent a message

207
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,710
through Baiyujing,

208
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,580
saying that despite his illness,

209
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,710
he was feeling okay.

210
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,050
How could he suddenly pass away?

211
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,520
Did any other event

212
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,180
happen in Eastern Capital?

213
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,040
There's indeed something weird.

214
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,850
The Crown Prince was summoned to the capital.

215
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,700
He brought a woman with him.

216
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,420
He even brought her

217
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,860
to the palace to see His Majesty.

218
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,620
Everyone thought

219
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,480
His Majesty would be furious.

220
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,020
However,

221
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,080
His Majesty approved this marriage.

222
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,220
It's Lady Xifeng.

223
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,390
How do you know?

224
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,720
She is the owner

225
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,760
of Lanxiao House in Yangzhou.

226
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,360
She works for Luo Zishang.

227
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,620
His Majesty ordered the Crown Prince to reflect on his mistakes in Youzhou

228
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,860
in order to isolate him

229
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,420
from those treacherous people.

230
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,060
I didn't expect that Luo Zishang

231
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,590
still managed to reach him.

232
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,260
I guess Luo Zishang

233
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,710
has been reinstated.

234
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:52,980
Yes.

235
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,100
When the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

236
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,340
he will definitely make his comeback

237
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,340
and become the most powerful official in the country.

238
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,070
Not only that.

239
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,980
the Crown Prince is weak in mind.

240
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,900
If he is constantly under Luo Zishang's control,

241
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,830
the entire Da Xia

242
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,390
will fall into his hands in the future.

243
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,340
By the way,

244
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,300
there's even worse news.

245
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,900
The day before yesterday,

246
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,300
General Zhou led the army

247
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,620
to conquer Nanzhao.

248
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,840
Leading the army to conquer Nanzhao?

249
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,190
Isn't that suicidal?

250
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,260
Let alone losing the battle,

251
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,290
even if he wins,

252
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,420
there'll still be a heavy price to pay.

253
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,860
Whose order was that?

254
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,790
It's said to be His Majesty's will.

255
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,760
I don't believe it.

256
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,950
I don't think

257
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,140
this was His Majesty's idea either.

258
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,660
The death knell hasn't stopped yet,

259
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,130
and the new emperor couldn't wait to send the army to conquer the south.

260
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,860
There must be something wrong.

261
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,460
But the imperial edict has been issued.

262
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,750
Even if we have doubts,

263
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,990
we have no evidence.

264
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,380
We need to find out

265
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,580
Luo Zishang's whole plan as soon as possible.

266
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,140
This way,

267
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,660
we can know

268
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,520
what his thoughts really are.

269
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:24,980
Mother.

270
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,130
Mother-in-law.

271
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,140
We're back.

272
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,900
Mother.

273
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,580
Mother, don't you recognize me?

274
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,820
I'm Yuru.

275
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,630
Sister.

276
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,470
Am I sick again?

277
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,790
I just got better,

278
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,410
but why do I see

279
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,550
Yuru is back again?

280
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:10,310
Mother.

281
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,109
Mother, you've really recovered.

282
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,099
I got the famous doctor

283
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,910
from Ningzhou for you.

284
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,750
I'm Yuru.

285
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,780
I'm not dead.

286
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,260
Mother, I'm home.

287
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,430
This is impossible.

288
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,470
I just convinced myself that

289
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,310
Yuru is gone.

290
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,780
Sister Su.

291
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,540
Your daughter

292
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,430
is really home.

293
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,780
Mother.

294
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,490
It's really Yuru.

295
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:47,870
Mother.

296
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,900
Yuru.

297
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,230
Mother.

298
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,350
Yuru.

299
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,230
Mother!

300
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,700
Yuru.

301
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,620
Mother!

302
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,670
Yuru, my child!

303
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,980
Mother!

304
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,990
-Mother!/N-Yuru!

305
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,990
Mother, I'm home.

306
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,910
Yuru.

307
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,340
Mother.

308
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,430
You're finally back.

309
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,750
I'm back.

310
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,420
I'm back, Mother.

311
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,430
Mother.

312
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,110
I'm home.

313
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,110
I'm home.

314
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,590
Has Zhou Gaolang set off?

315
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,840
Yes, he's already out of town.

316
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,100
Notify Zhao Can, Commissioner of Jingzhou, that

317
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,250
once Zhou Gaolang's army

318
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,060
starts fighting against Nanzhao's army,

319
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,050
cut off

320
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,450
the provisions for the front line right away.

321
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,780
No matter how brave

322
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,780
and formidable Zhou Gaolang's troop is,

323
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,980
without provisions,

324
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,860
he'll definitely lose.

325
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,510
This time,

326
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,190
I'll make sure he and his son

327
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,060
die in Nanzhao.

328
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,350
Yes.

329
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,700
You'll recover soon.

330
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,340
We just need to change the dressing for two more days.

331
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,020
Yun'er.

332
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,590
I just got the news.

333
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,560
Sister's still alive.

334
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,550
What are you talking about?

335
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,750
My sworn sister Liu Yuru.

336
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,150
She's still alive.

337
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

338
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,620
You don't believe me?

339
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,180
Here.

340
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,070
Look.

341
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,720
Yuru's letter.

342
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,130
[Yun'er, how have you been? I've made it back safely. I miss you a lot. By Yuru]

343
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,180
Sister Yuru.

344
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,450
[Yun'er, how have you been? I've made it back safely. I miss you a lot. By Yuru]

345
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,300
It's really written by Yuru.

346
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,750
Sister Yuru is still alive.

347
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,950
Sister Yuru is still alive!

348
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,280
She's still alive!

349
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,790
My Sister Yuru is still alive!

350
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,110
My Sister Yuru.

351
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,440
She's still alive.

352
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,460
Great.

353
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,840
She's still alive.

354
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,950
Look.

355
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,660
She wrote this herself.

356
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,710
She wrote this herself.

357
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,030
She wrote this herself.

358
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,060
Sister Yuru is still alive.

359
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,120
She's still alive.

360
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,900
She's alive.

361
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,110
She's still alive.

362
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,310
This is great! Shen Ming!

363
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,460
Shen Ming! This is great!

364
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,460
Great.

365
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,550
Great.

366
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,270
Great.

367
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,990
Greetings, Your Majesty.

368
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,830
Dear officials.

369
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,510
Why don't you kneel?

370
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,460
Your Majesty.

371
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,220
The late emperor was benevolent and compassionate.

372
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,620
Considering the old officials are aged,

373
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,790
he ordered that

374
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,380
we don't have to kneel in court.

375
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,830
I am the emperor now.

376
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

377
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,670
Long live Your Majesty!

378
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,630
Long live Your Majesty!

379
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,300
Good. That's more like it.

380
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,180
You may rise.

381
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

382
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,380
All of you are well-educated.

383
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,660
You know clearly about

384
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,300
the difference between the emperor and officials,

385
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,100
and the nobility of the emperor.

386
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,270
In the future,

387
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,100
formalities can't be ignored in court.

388
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

389
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,300
Official Gu.

390
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,870
You did a good job resolving the problem of the Yellow River.

392
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,620
You resolved the water-related disasters of Xingyang

393
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,550
and built dams on the Yellow River.

394
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,950
This is a great merit.

395
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,540
The late emperor granted you the position of Grand Councilor of the Left.

396
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,620
Therefore, I'll let you be the top-level official

397
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,780
together with Grand Tutor Luo.

398
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,600
You'll be on an equal footing.

399
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,070
I want the late emperor to know that

400
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
I treasure the talented.

401
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,380
I will be a wise emperor

402
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,740
and be praised by the people.

403
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

404
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,550
However,

405
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,070
the late emperor had always liked you.

406
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,870
Now that he has passed away,

407
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,070
I think

408
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,830
you must feel bad too.

409
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,320
I sympathize with you.

410
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,190
From now on,

411
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,790
come to court two hours early

412
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,030
and kneel in the hall

413
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,460
for 49 days.

414
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,980
What the late emperor couldn't see,

415
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,330
such as the clean imperial court

416
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,660
and the peaceful world,

417
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,390
I

418
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,150
want you, Gu Jiusi,

419
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,710
to see it all for Father.

420
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,460
It'll also serve to honor

421
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,500
relationship between the emperor and the official between you two.

422
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,830
Yes,

423
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,510
Your Majesty.

424
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,390
It seems that

425
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,180
you didn't listen to my advice

426
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,390
and stay away from Da Xia.

427
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,420
Now,

428
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,540
it's my turn to advice you, Minister Jiang,

429
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,740
to keep a low profile.

430
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,910
Grand Tutor Luo, you are very favored now.

431
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,350
However, the Crown Prince has ascended the throne.

432
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,630
Will he still be under your control?

433
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,620
You must be joking, Minister Jiang.

434
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,220
You and I are both officials.

435
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,150
We are only performing our duties.

436
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,280
Speaking of which,

437
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,150
I have something

438
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,220
to tell you, Minister Jiang.

439
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,500
You're full of lies.

440
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,200
But your love for my mother

441
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,460
is true.

442
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:29,630
Right?

443
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,980
Actually, the surname of Luo

444
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,750
doesn't matter to me.

445
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,670
On the contrary,

446
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,060
it's the source of all my pain.

447
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,590
There's even

448
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,700
a huge secret.

449
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,860
In fact,

450
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,100
the fire that took place in the Luo family back then

451
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,990
was set by me.

452
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,590
Only when the world is in chaos,

453
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,940
and all the rules

454
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,750
are broken,

455
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,500
can I make a comeback.

456
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,140
It was true.

457
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,910
It is still true.

458
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,660
It'll also be true

459
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,980
in the future.

460
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,160
The lambs kneel to suckle,

461
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,520
and the crows feed their parents.

462
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,990
Even animals know to repay their parents' kindness.

463
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,230
This kid

464
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,590
got no kindness from his mother at all.

465
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,460
Is this God's way of punishing me?

466
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,210
Come on.

467
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:40,730
Cheers.

468
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,190
Cheers.

469
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
Uncle, what's bothering you?

470
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,530
Nothing.

471
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,500
Let's eat.

472
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,380
If there's something bothering him, he must have asked for it himself.

473
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,940
It's because he used to be a playboy

474
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,270
when he was young.

475
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,820
And he always says nonsense like

476
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,620
having a wife and children is like being in prison.

477
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,420
Having a wife and children is like being in prison?

478
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,550
What does that mean?

479
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,100
Is it from the scripture?

480
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,300
It says, for a man, being tied to his wife, children, and household

481
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,940
is even worse than being in prison.

482
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,300
Being in prison, there's a date of release.

483
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,230
However, his wife and children will never leave him.

484
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,980
It actually makes sense.

485
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,290
No matter

486
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,910
how suave a man is,

487
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,780
once he gets married and has children,

488
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,910
he's willing to be imprisoned by this.

489
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,270
What sense does it make?

490
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,730
It's exactly because

491
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,660
your uncle believes this nonsense

492
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,780
that he's still alone.

493
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,850
Otherwise, his child

494
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,660
should have been

495
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,910
as old as you two.

496
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,950
So what?

497
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,040
I have my nephew to take care of me.

498
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,860
Little Jiusi.

499
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,670
In the future,

500
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,600
you'll be in charge of my funeral.

501
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,510
By then,

502
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,940
you don't need to invite anyone.

503
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,060
Just bury me in peace.

504
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,780
Don't write anything on the tombstone.

505
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,750
Not even my name.

506
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,660
Got it?

507
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,820
By the way,

508
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,930
I have gifted Baiyujing

509
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,470
to niece-in-law.

510
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,820
I don't have

511
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,680
anything else.

512
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,740
There's a farm that has horses raised.

513
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,530
There are

514
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,390
many precious good horses there.

515
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,900
I'll leave them all to you.

516
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,700
Stop it.

517
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,580
We're finally reunited.

518
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,420
Why are you talking about this?

519
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:32,950
Nothing.

520
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,950
I was just saying.

521
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,180
Mother.

522
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,420
Let's eat.

523
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,060
What Uncle said last night

524
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,170
sounded like he's telling us about his will.

525
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,100
He must have something on his mind.

526
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,310
Uncle is very shrewd.

527
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,820
Even my mother

528
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,840
doesn't know what he's thinking.

529
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,740
If he doesn't want to tell us,

530
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,180
we won't be able to guess.

531
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,700
Greetings, Grand Councilor of the Left.

532
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,660
Your Ladyship.

533
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,750
Thank you

534
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,420
for taking the risk and meeting with us.

535
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,540
It's what I should do.

536
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,750
Let's make it short.

537
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,080
When His Majesty passed away,

538
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,680
was your master there?

539
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,310
Yes.

540
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,930
What happened to him?

541
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,260
Ever since His Majesty passed away,

542
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,710
Master has lost his mind.

543
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,510
He became incoherent.

544
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,380
The imperial physician said

545
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
it was caused by excessive sadness.

546
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,910
Little butterfly.

547
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,310
My little butterfly flew away.

548
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,230
It flew away!

549
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,460
Why does he keep talking about butterflies?

550
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,070
It's already deep autumn.

551
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,160
He shouldn't be able to see butterflies.

552
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,790
He's just talking nonsense.

553
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,460
A normal person

554
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,820
suddenly went crazy.

555
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,240
It doesn't make sense.

556
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,660
The imperial physician said

557
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,940
it's the insanity caused by sadness.

558
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,750
But I think

559
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,300
it seems to be the symptom

560
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,130
of overdosing on Cold-Food Powder

561
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,060
in a short time.

562
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,190
If he were really poisoned,

563
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,710
he must know something.

564
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,660
But now,

565
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,880
he can't tell us anything.

566
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,240
Little Butterfly.

567
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,460
My little butterfly flew away.

568
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,950
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

569
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,760
How is your master's illness?

570
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,460
Master...

571
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,710
He's still not well.

572
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,420
Thank you for your concern, Your Ladyship.

573
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,930
He served the late emperor for many years.

574
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,460
He made his contributions.

575
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,780
Take good care of him.

576
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,620
Yes.

577
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,470
Butterfly...

578
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,180
Manzi.

579
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,550
Didn't you say

580
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,130
your master said

581
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,590
something weird about me,

582
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,220
and you wanted to show me?

583
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,940
Why did you take me here?

584
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,860
What do you want to do?

585
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,500
I didn't lie.

586
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,990
There's someone

587
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,510
I'd like you to see, Your Ladyship.

588
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,820
As the Grand Councilor of the Left's wife, a titled madam,

589
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,470
if you want to see me,

590
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,020
just hand in a plaque.

591
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,780
You don't have to do this.

592
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,430
Lady Xifeng.

593
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,870
I'm here to get you out of the sea of flames.

594
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,940
I'm already

595
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,100
in the highest position

596
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,630
a woman can be in this world.

597
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,100
But you call it a sea of flames, Boss Liu.

598
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,820
This is not what you want.

599
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,740
It's against your original intention,

600
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,300
and it isn't of your own accord.

601
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,630
Isn't it a sea of flames?

602
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,750
Courtesans like me

603
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,060
are like willows, or duckweeds.

604
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,040
We can't ask for

605
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,620
something to rely on for our whole life.

606
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,590
But now,

607
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,960
who I'm relying on is the most distinguished man

608
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,110
in the world.

609
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,570
How do you know

610
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,370
this is not what I want, Boss Liu?

611
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,130
If you are really willing

612
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,380
to be imprisoned in the golden cage,

613
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
to be manipulated

614
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,580
and taken as entertainment,

615
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,380
you wouldn't have let Yun'er go,

616
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,470
or said those things to her.

617
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,560
Why do you let me go?

618
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,260
Show me what you've got.

619
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,940
Show me

620
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,180
how far a weak woman

621
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,380
can go fair and square

622
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,360
in this chaotic world.

623
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,710
Lady Xifeng.

624
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,700
I know

625
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:46,940
you are not

626
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,140
a heartless villain.

627
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,380
Not only that,

628
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,750
but you are also a smart person.

629
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,020
However, if you go down this path

630
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,940
any further,

631
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,000
there will be no turning back.

632
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,420
There is no such thing as turning back

633
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,940
in this world.

634
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,590
There is.

635
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,460
It depends on whether you want to take it or not.

636
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,060
We will never be on the same path.

637
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,860
Please leave.

638
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,790
Lady Xifeng.

639
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,220
I let Ye Yun go

640
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,550
simply because

641
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,430
her plan for Master

642
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,010
was like

643
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,300
an insignificant canary.

644
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,160
It wouldn't matter if I let her go.

645
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,510
I didn't mean to be kind.

646
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,160
But you are different.

647
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,390
You are the one my master cares about the most.

648
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,710
You and your husband

649
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,430
are the biggest variables in his plan.

650
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,830
Today,

651
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,290
I didn't detain you in secret

652
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,750
or hand you over to Master.

653
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,580
It's only because

654
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,040
this is not the right time.

655
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,540
It's only been a few days

656
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,580
since the Youzhou Army started fighting against Nanzhao,

657
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,100
and their provisions were cut off.

658
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,420
Brother Zhou asked us for help

659
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,550
through Baiyujing.

660
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,580
Zhao Can

661
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,540
wouldn't dare to confiscate military provisions

662
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,140
without permission from the Eastern Capital.

663
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,380
Although the new emperor is arrogant,

664
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,440
he's not sinister.

665
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,580
He's easy to see through.

666
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,780
Killing people with a borrowed sword bloodlessly.

667
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,710
It's most likely

668
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,500
to be Luo Zishang again.

669
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,510
He's willing to kill 300,000 soldiers

670
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,900
to eliminate his dissidents?

671
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,310
Therefore,

672
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,540
we can't let things happen

673
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,800
according to his plan.

674
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,139
Zhou Gaolang and the Youzhou Army

675
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,670
are like the rocks of Da Xia.

676
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,570
If they are defeated in the southwest,

677
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,500
there will be bloodshed

678
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,949
in our country again.

679
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,940
But the mountain roads are rugged and winding during the rainy season.

680
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,969
Even if we have provisions,

681
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,500
it'll be hard to deliver them.

682
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,830
We can use my horse gang.

683
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,780
There are 18 branches

684
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,050
of Shiyu Store in the southeast,

685
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,580
selling jewels and spices.

686
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,690
We've opened five trade routes

687
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,139
to Nanzhao over the years.

688
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,610
The horse gang is familiar with the mountain terrain.

689
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,260
They can definitely find the Youzhou Army

690
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,989
and send the provisions there.

691
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,860
But the military provisions for 300,000 soldiers

692
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,820
will be hard to raise in a short time

693
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,949
even if we gather nationwide efforts.

694
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,510
Miss Shiyu

695
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,030
has been doing business

696
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,340
and raising funds in Lingnan over the years.

697
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,980
It's not only for resolving the Yellow River problems,

698
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,040
but also for today.

699
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,550
But it's a significant matter.

700
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,010
I have to be there myself.

701
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,180
In such troubled times,

702
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,240
it's too dangerous

703
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,060
for you to go alone.

704
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,190
I'll go too.

705
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,160
We'll go together.

706
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,020
You are the Grand Councilor of the Left.

707
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,140
Not to mention His Majesty may not let you go,

708
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Luo Zishang won't let you

709
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,600
leave the capital easily.

710
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,710
I have my way.

711
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,460
Official Gu.

712
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,470
Yes.

713
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,070
How is

714
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,940
the construction of my mausoleum going under your supervision?

715
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,060
Your Majesty.

716
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,620
The royal mausoleum is the top priority.

717
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,280
We can't afford any mistakes.

718
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,110
Minister of Works and I

719
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,080
discussed five times and reviewed eight times

720
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,260
to put together a 100-year construction plan.

721
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,700
We'll make sure it's built perfectly.

722
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,950
100 years?

723
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,010
Your Majesty, you just ascended the throne.

724
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,820
You're in your prime, and you're blessed with longevity.

725
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,900
There's no rush.

726
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:18,910
Fine.

727
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,460
I'm in no rush.

728
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,370
Then why haven't you started

729
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,430
the construction of Qifeng Pavilion

730
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,400
I want to build for my darling?

731
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,260
I know you love the Crown Princess, Your Majesty.

732
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,610
So the wood I chose

733
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,620
is the finest Phoebe sheareri.

734
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,740
It needs to be transported from the East Sea to Eastern Capital.

735
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,420
However,

736
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,440
the weather hasn't been good.

737
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,300
Recently, there has been a hurricane on the East Sea.

738
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,360
The ship fell over.

739
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,600
[Changgeng Palace]

740
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,550
Gu Jiusi

741
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,280
doesn't respect me at all.

742
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,540
Not only did he delay the task

743
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,660
I assigned to him,

744
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,770
when I asked him about it,

745
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,570
he even responded with sarcasm,

746
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,300
but his words were flawless.

747
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,440
I wanted to be mad, but I had no reason.

748
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,340
If the official doesn't fulfill his duties

749
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,980
and disrespects your prestige,

750
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,240
why do you have to keep him, Your Majesty?

751
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,970
Just dismiss him

752
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,100
and kick him out.

753
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,870
But

754
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,580
he's the Grand Councilor of the Left

755
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,310
appointed by the late emperor.

756
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,260
Now you are the Emperor.

757
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,300
I've always been annoyed

758
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,550
by Gu Jiusi.

759
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,620
I hate it when he gets in my face.

760
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,240
Whenever I see him,

761
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,510
I can't help thinking about

762
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,270
how the late emperor

763
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,860
liked him

764
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,180
more than me, his own son.

765
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,940
But I had to focus on the bigger picture

766
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,900
and keep him as Grand Councilor of the Left

767
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,030
for Father's order.

768
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,380
When you were Crown Prince,

769
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,020
you were treated unfairly the whole time, Your Majesty.

770
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,740
Now,

771
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,670
do you have to endure it longer?

772
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,040
Why don't you punish Gu Jiusi to build up your prestige?

773
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,660
You're right.

774
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,180
Besides, he still called you

775
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,620
the Crown Princess

776
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,250
appointed by the late emperor

777
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,510
in front of so many people in court today.

778
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,520
He has no respect for me at all.

779
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,580
I'll issue a decree right away

780
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,660
to remove Gu Jiusi from the position of Grand Councilor of the Left,

781
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,580
and order him to leave the capital.

782
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,110
You're wise, Your Majesty.

783
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,590
I'm still in mourning.

784
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
I'm sorry you have to bear it longer.

785
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,620
After the mourning is finished,

786
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,820
and the enthronement ceremony is held,

787
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,320
I'll officially marry you

788
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,390
and confer you the title of Noble Consort.

789
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,500
What's inappropriate

790
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,310
about dismissing

791
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,170
an official who hasn't fulfilled his duties?

792
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,500
If it's just a dismissal,

793
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,180
of course it's all up to you, Your Majesty.

794
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,460
However, you can't

795
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,650
let Gu Jiusi leave Eastern Capital

796
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,780
and get out of control.

797
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,310
This move

798
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,640
is no different from freeing a tiger.

799
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,140
You worry too much, Grand Tutor.

800
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,540
Although I hate Gu Jiusi,

801
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,020
after all,

802
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,540
he was my sworn brother when I was young.

803
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,340
He has no bad intentions towards me.

804
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,400
Do you really think so, Your Majesty?

805
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,620
If

806
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,340
Zhou Gaolang turns against Your Majesty some day,

807
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,860
will Gu Jiusi assist Zhou Gaolang

808
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,010
or you, Your Majesty?

809
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,270
Can you be sure about that, Your Majesty?

810
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:37,940
But

811
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,780
I just issued a decree of dismissal to build up my prestige.

812
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,040
If I withdraw my order,

813
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,110
it'll be a slap in the face,

814
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,220
showing that I can't manage

815
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,020
without Gu Jiusi.

816
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,690
Your Majesty.

817
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,150
You don't have to say anything, Grand Tutor.

818
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,310
I know what to do.

819
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,660
The stupid Crown Prince became the emperor.

820
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,700
How foolish.

821
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,300
If Gu Jiusi and his wife leave Eastern Capital,

822
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,370
they will surely raise military provisions

823
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,170
to support Zhou Gaolang's army.

824
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,500
Once they

825
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,590
leave Jingji,

826
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:15,900
we can no longer

827
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,780
stop them.

828
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,730
Mingyi.

829
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,150
Yes.

830
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,770
Send someone to Gu Mansion immediately.

831
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,420
Remember, be quick and clean.

832
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:21,860
Yes.

833
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,470
Madam.

834
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,020
Minister Jiang asked me

835
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,820
to see you off.

836
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,110
No one knows of

837
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:41,610
your route to leave the capital

838
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,740
except the boatman.

839
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,620
Baiyujing's people

840
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,740
will be there all the way.

841
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,000
They will protect you.

842
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,020
Got it.

843
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,320
Also, Minister Jiang asked me to tell you

844
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,530
not to come back and reunite with your family

845
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,190
until everything is settled,

846
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,820
Tell him

847
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,230
we will.

848
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,990
We believe in Jiusi

849
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
and Yuru.

850
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:02,950
Yes.

851
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,220
So the dismissal

852
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,510
was really Gu Jiusi's plan.

853
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,510
He'll definitely go south.

854
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,340
Send an assassin to chase him immediately.

855
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,100
We must stop him and kill him

856
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,070
halfway.

857
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,220
We can't let him escape from Jingji.

858
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,820
Yes.

859
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,140
Nanzhao is such a shabby place.

860
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,800
Even the leaves here are bitter than Youzhou's.

861
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,800
Gu Jiusi replied in his letter

862
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
that he'll come to the south to help.

863
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,830
Any update?

864
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,260
Father.

865
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,600
There's no update for now.

866
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:12,970
Jiusi!

867
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,900
Wait for me here.

868
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,310
Jiusi!

869
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,100
Jiusi!

870
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,270
Jiusi!

871
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,710
Jiusi!
