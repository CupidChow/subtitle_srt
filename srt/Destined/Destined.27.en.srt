[Episode 27]

4
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,910
Brother.

5
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,340
Get up.

6
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,700
Don't make Father angry.

7
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,760
Has Father given up on Wangdu?

8
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,140
Father and Uncle Fan

9
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,570
are thinking about the long-term consequences.

10
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,630
They're concerned about the people.

11
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,669
Father, have you given up on Wangdu? Yes or no!

12
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,030
Father, have you given up on Wangdu? Yes or no!

13
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,710
Father, have you given up on Wangdu? Yes or no!

14
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,660
Zhou Ye.

15
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,820
Father, have you given up on Wangdu? Yes or no!

16
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,300
He's short-sighted.

17
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,310
You're being soft

18
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,120
and not considering the big picture.

19
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,900
You even learned the ways of the household womenfolk

20
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,900
and are interrogating your father?

21
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,460
To watch Wangdu fall into the hands of the enemy

22
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,300
and the lives of 300,000 people

23
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,310
be in peril—

24
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,220
is this what you mean

25
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,610
by looking at the big picture?

26
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,410
Unfilial son.

27
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,460
I still have

28
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,980
20,000 soldiers.

29
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,790
They were the guards of Wangdu.

30
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,740
Now,

31
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,030
they're stuck here.

32
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,390
If you

33
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,500
are unwilling to help them out,

34
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,480
I'm going to beg Commissioner Fan

35
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,460
to recall the Wangdu guards.

36
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Stop right there!

37
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,110
Think carefully.

38
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,020
If you persist in disobeying military orders,

39
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,260
you won't be able to serve as a general.

40
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,980
In the future, you don't have to worry about

41
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,250
the Youzhou Army anymore.

42
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,310
After this battle,

43
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,660
you will retire from office.

44
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,260
You can go wherever you want!

45
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,140
Unfilial son!

46
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,040
Your Highness.

47
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:36,980
We've been

48
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,840
besieging Youzhou for many days.

49
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,860
It's just Wangdu.

50
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,590
If our 100,000 troops

51
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,180
attack the city in full force,

52
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,900
even if they

53
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,780
may have some defensive tricks,

54
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,750
I think

55
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,030
we can definitely subdue the city.

56
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,740
Let’s wait and see.

57
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,270
The way Gu Jiusi handles matters

58
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,420
is exactly

59
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,810
the same

60
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,510
as his uncle Jiang He.

61
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,070
Jiang He is unfathomable.

62
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,270
We can't let our guard down.

63
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:09,820
Then,

64
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,160
what's your plan, Your Highness?

65
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,350
If we can't make them

66
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,430
yield for now,

67
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,900
why don't we take a detour to attack Yuquan Pass

68
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,590
and lead Northern Liang into the Pass?

69
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,620
Then Wangdu will be surrounded by enemies.

70
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,070
But, Your Highness,

71
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,470
Northern Liang

72
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,820
is still an enemy on the border,

73
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,380
so I think this is actually...

74
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,470
Report!

75
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,700
Your Highness.

76
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,659
Someone's at the entrance of the camp.

77
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,640
He just came from Wangdu

78
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,580
and he wants to see you.

79
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,110
He said he has something important to report.

80
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,710
Let him in.

81
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,020
Yes.

82
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,810
[Wangdu was attacked by Lord Liang's troops.
We're hoping for soldiers from all over the country to come to our aid.
We're interdependent entities, so please don't stand on the sidelines.]

83
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,670
[Bingzhou Commander-in-chief Qin]

84
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,250
[Qin Wanzhi, daughter of Bingzhou's commander-in-chief]

85
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,660
Father.

86
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,580
Why won't you send troops to help Youzhou?

87
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,420
Why didn't you knock again?

88
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,900
Wan.

89
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,550
You're almost 19 years old.

90
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,240
You should behave like a lady.

91
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,940
You can't always be this reckless.

92
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,100
Don't try to fool me.

93
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,740
If you act in your own way and delay the military plans,

94
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,000
how many deaths will you cause in Wangdu?

95
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,660
Father.

96
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,440
Why are you doing this?

97
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,830
Do you really think the commissioner

98
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,300
doesn't know about this?

99
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,110
You've already planned

100
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,010
to watch Youzhou fall into the hands of the enemy

101
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,810
and just stand on the sidelines?

102
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,520
The main force of Youzhou Army

103
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,390
joined Fan Xuan to help the emperor.

104
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,980
There are only a handful of men

105
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,860
in the garrisons of each city.

106
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,700
A starving camel is still bigger than a horse.

107
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Even if Lord Liang

108
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,810
was defeated and fled in disorder,

109
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,590
he still has 100,000 men.

110
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,980
How can we win?

111
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,630
Wangdu

112
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,140
is hopeless.

113
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,020
Yes.

114
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,860
We can't win with Youzhou's garrison alone.

115
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,380
But with

116
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,830
the troops in both Yizhou and Qingzhou,

117
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,090
we still have a chance.

118
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,070
Besides,

119
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:14,940
within Wangdu,

120
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,580
it's still a matter of 300,000 lives.

121
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,150
Father.

122
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,780
If any state were to

123
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,100
send troops alone,

124
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,950
it'd be striking rocks with eggs.

125
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,850
Right now, all states have received

126
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,450
the letter requesting help.

127
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,440
Look at who has sent their troops.

128
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,580
No one's willing to

129
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,860
take the first step,

130
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,300
in fear of perishing

131
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,020
with Youzhou.

132
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,390
Our commissioner

133
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,440
doesn't want to get involved in this.

134
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,940
But once Fan Xuan

135
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,700
entered Eastern Capital

136
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,390
and took that position,

137
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,680
I'm afraid it's only a matter of time.

138
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,030
We can't

139
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,180
be too obvious with this matter.

140
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,220
If Fan Xuan blames you later,

141
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,420
it means

142
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,380
the commander-in-chief will come with an unauthorized seizure letter

143
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,820
and strip me of my official title.

144
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,990
That's fine.

145
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,270
Wan.

146
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,700
I'm old.

147
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,070
No matter how brave and skilled you are in,

148
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,150
you still have to get married eventually.

149
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,700
You don't like hearing this,

150
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,870
but I have to say it.

151
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,300
How long more do you think you can

152
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,350
stay in the army?

153
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,340
Will a woman really

154
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,980
become a general?

155
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,750
Don't think too much

156
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,620
about worldly affairs.

157
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,690
Before I'm stripped of

158
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,020
my official title,

159
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,220
I just want to

160
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,980
find a good man for you,

161
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,299
so that in the future,

162
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,030
you'll have someone to rely on.

163
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,919
I've already told you many times.

164
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,540
I will never marry an ordinary person in this life.

165
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
I'd rather stay in the army my whole life.

166
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,290
I'd rather be

167
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,380
a soldier wrapped in horsehide after death

168
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,910
than a wife in the backyard.

169
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,750
You're so disobedient.

170
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,890
It's all my fault for not teaching you well.

171
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,090
From your teachings,

172
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
I'll benefit for the rest of my life.

173
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,990
When I was young,

174
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,740
you told me

175
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,100
the stories of border soldiers

176
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,860
guarding city gates with loyalty and bravery.

177
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,340
Back then, when the Xiliang borders were attacked,

178
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,650
General Liang Qingyu

179
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,830
boldly rode

180
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,420
and led troops to help the garrison at the Xiliang Pass.

181
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,610
And the fact that she was outnumbered

182
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,460
but the surprise attack

183
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,060
repelled the foreign army for a hundred miles.

184
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,420
You taught me all these.

185
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,590
You also said

186
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,380
a daughter should be like Liang Qingyu.

187
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,900
Have you forgotten?

188
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,980
Back then, you looked down on

189
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,220
those cowards who only cared about their own safety

190
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,820
during times of trouble.

191
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,130
Now, why are you...

192
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,870
Shut up!

193
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,740
How dare you lecture your father?

194
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,130
Small matters depend on the human will,

195
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,930
but huge matters depend on fate.

196
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,730
Such is the fate of

197
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,300
the common people of Wangdu.

198
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,300
It's not something a little girl like you

199
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,940
can change.

200
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,740
Also, what happened to Liang Qingyu?

201
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
She still got married and had children.

202
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,980
In the end, she died

203
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,620
with the Ye family in the rebellion of Yangzhou.

204
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,510
Such is fate.

205
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,070
Coward.

206
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,620
Come back!

207
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,660
What?

208
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,630
Impossible.

209
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,060
How many people did you say are there?

210
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,890
I am telling nothing but the truth.

211
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,900
The garrison of Wangdu

212
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,340
only has 10,000 men indeed.

213
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:31,950
1...

214
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,020
10,000 men?

215
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,580
If there are only 10,000 soldiers

216
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,100
within Wangdu,

217
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,580
why is Gu Jiusi

218
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
so confident and fearless?

219
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,990
Drag him out.

220
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,960
Your Highness.

221
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,080
I'm really telling the truth.

222
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,330
If there's any lie in what I'd said,

223
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,860
I will die a horrible death.

224
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:00,790
Let go of him.

225
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,560
Your Highness.

226
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,490
You can't trust

227
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,940
Gu Jiusi.

228
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,580
He is cunning

229
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,190
and always bluffing.

230
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,580
He's deliberately stalling for time,

231
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,260
but in fact, he's playing the Empty City Ruse.

232
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,430
His motive

233
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,940
is to deceive you

234
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,800
so that you'll give up on Wangdu as soon as possible.

235
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,300
As a native of Wangdu,

236
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,160
with this act of betrayal,

237
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,000
aren't you afraid of implicating your family and friends?

238
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,510
I

239
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,070
dare not lie to you.

240
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,750
I also once

241
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,150
devoted myself

242
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,110
to serve the Youzhou Army.

243
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,290
But Gu Jiusi cast us aside

244
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,580
after our services were no longer needed

245
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,150
and I ended up in prison.

246
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,550
Now,

247
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,540
I just want to take revenge.

248
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,940
I have no other thoughts.

249
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,280
Your Highness.

250
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,060
There's no one that knows the situation

251
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,860
of the Wangdu army more than I do.

252
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,220
I can definitely help you,

253
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,080
Your Highness.

254
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,590
If you...

255
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,180
No.

256
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,890
Attack the city tomorrow.

257
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,100
If we take another step,

258
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,780
the defense in the city will definitely collapse.

259
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,510
By then,

260
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,420
Wangdu will become

261
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,950
under your control.

262
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,510
Under my control?

263
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,940
Are you telling the truth?

264
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,750
Absolutely.

265
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,070
Okay.

266
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,940
Get up.

267
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,880
Thank you, Your Highness.

268
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,810
This righteous man brought

269
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,180
such an important piece of military information.

270
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,620
It mustn't have been easy.

271
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,340
Take him away.

272
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,720
Your Highness!

273
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,800
Your Highness!

274
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,180
Your Highness!

275
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,430
Your Highness!

276
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,380
Your Highness.

277
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,870
Your Highness,

278
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
you are...

279
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,620
I dare not have such treacherous people

280
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,180
working under me.

281
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,550
10,000 people?

282
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,670
Gu Jiusi.

283
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,710
Good job.

284
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,190
Pass my order.

285
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,180
Yes.

286
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,340
Attack the city tonight

287
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,060
and subdue Wangdu!

288
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,150
Yes.

289
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,080
General Gu.

290
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,700
Lord Liang's 100,000 troops are suddenly

291
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,060
fully spread out outside the city.

292
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,260
I'm afraid they're going to attack the city in full force.

293
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,780
Pass my order.

294
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,510
Shut the city gate tight

295
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,820
and guard it with all your might!

296
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,140
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

297
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,690
Shut the city gates tight!

298
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,300
-Guard it with all your might!
-Guard it with all your might!

299
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Shut the city gate tight and guard it with all your might!

300
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,900
Guard it with all your might!

301
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,230
Defense!

302
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,820
Release!

303
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,470
Release!

304
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,780
Attack!

305
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,340
Charge!

306
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,750
Release!

307
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,780
Charge!

308
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,790
Charge!

309
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,350
Release!

310
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,900
Charge!

311
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,070
Attack!

312
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,030
Release!

313
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,750
Let's disperse!

314
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,390
Yes.

315
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,500
Attack! Attack! Attack!

316
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,430
Follow me!

317
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,520
Pour the kerosene!

318
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,060
Add the kerosene!

319
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,340
Add the kerosene!

320
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
Add the kerosene!

321
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,740
Hurry!

322
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,820
Hurry!

323
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,730
Go! Go! Hurry!

324
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,070
Go! Hurry!

325
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,430
Release!

326
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,340
Charge!

327
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,830
Qi!

328
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,590
Help! Help!

329
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,980
Boss!

330
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,320
Don't bother about me.

331
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,410
Attack!

332
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,750
Attack!

333
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,230
Charge!

334
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,660
Throw the oil tank in!

335
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,140
Hurry!

336
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,710
Throw the oil tank in!

337
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:34,940
Attack!

338
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,830
A mere garrison of 10,000 troops

339
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,870
actually successfully defended the city of Wangdu.

340
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,380
And even caused me

341
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,950
to lose 20,000 of my soldiers.

342
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,340
Your Highness, don't worry.

343
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,020
A lot of them died or got injured too.

344
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,740
After our army goes back,

345
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,350
we'll recalibrate

346
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
and then attack in full force again.

347
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,620
I believe

348
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,980
they can't tide through

349
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,860
another attack.

350
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,980
Another attack?

351
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,660
Another attack...

352
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,300
In the next attack,

353
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,180
I will turn Wangdu into a bloodbath!

354
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,140
Retreat!

355
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,070
You must be scared to death.

356
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,180
You're a lady from a noble family.

357
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,310
It's normal to not be

358
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,100
used to such a situation.

359
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,740
I'm not only a lady from a noble family,

360
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,660
but also a descendant of a general.

361
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,100
My grandmother was a famous general of the border garrison.

362
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,500
Don't underestimate me.

363
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,110
This is for you.

364
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,620
You're the descendant of a general.

365
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,480
Use this dagger

366
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,700
to protect yourself.

367
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,190
No matter when,

368
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,320
protect yourself.

369
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,590
If Lord Liang's army attacks,

370
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,300
I'll kill whoever comes my way,

371
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,720
Like the Youzhou Army,

372
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,230
I'll persist to the end.

373
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,510
Long.

374
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,700
Defend...

375
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,700
Wangdu.

376
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,340
Boss!

377
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,140
Boss!

378
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,340
Boss!

379
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:29,970
Boss!

380
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,860
Boss!

381
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,620
Boss!

382
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,860
Boss!

383
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,030
Boss!

384
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,150
Boss!

385
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,260
Boss!

386
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,630
Defend Wangdu!

387
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,110
Defend Wangdu!

388
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,500
Defend Wangdu!

389
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,940
Defend Wangdu!

390
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,460
Defend Wangdu!

391
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,830
Defend Wangdu!

392
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,230
Defend Wangdu!

393
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,660
Defend Wangdu!

394
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,030
Defend Wangdu!

395
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,470
Defend Wangdu!

396
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,910
Defend Wangdu!

397
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,230
Defend Wangdu!

398
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,630
Defend Wangdu!

399
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,020
Defend Wangdu!

400
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,800
Why are you dressed so nicely?

401
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,220
Today

402
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,660
is a life-and-death battle.

403
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,550
If we win,

404
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,520
it's natural to want to be dressed up nicely.

405
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,460
If we lose,

406
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,990
we'll die together,

407
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,950
so I also must be dressed up nicely.

408
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,300
Yuru.

409
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,660
I'm afraid

410
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,340
this city can't be defended.

411
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,740
I know.

412
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,660
I claim to be smart.

413
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,690
I thought I could come up with a solution

414
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,060
for every problem.

415
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,100
But now,

416
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,500
there's nothing I can do.

417
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,860
And there's no turning back.

418
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,670
I know.

419
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,600
We're going to die.

420
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,600
Do you blame me?

421
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,740
Why would I blame you?

422
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,310
Jiusi.

423
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,590
When I was young,

424
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,140
I never thought

425
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,150
that one day,

426
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,430
I'd actually marry a playboy.

427
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,910
I'd actually expanded my business

428
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,070
all over Youzhou.

429
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,470
I'd actually watched this playboy

430
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,670
gradually

431
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,340
become a hero

432
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,630
who everyone trusts.

433
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,780
I'd actually stand with him

434
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,750
at the city tower

435
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,310
and, to protect the people,

436
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,120
battle to the last moment.

437
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,870
You gave me all these.

438
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,390
This life

439
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,180
is what I want.

440
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,310
I thought I wanted

441
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,270
to start over.

442
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,070
I wanted to offer betrothal gifts,

443
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,700
get married with you,

444
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,670
and carry you into the bridal chamber.

445
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,780
We won't leave behind

446
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,300
the good things either.

447
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,030
We can't do it in this life anymore.

448
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,510
Let's do it in our next life.

449
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,230
I just want to thank God

450
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,820
for giving me

451
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,510
this opportunity to die with you.

452
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,220
Jiusi.

453
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,440
I wanted to make up for our wedding

454
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,830
and finish the cross-cupped wine we haven't had.

455
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,670
Now it seems

456
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,030
there is no time

457
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,780
better than this moment.

458
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,710
♫Spring breeze passing by♫

459
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,960
♫Like the smile of youth on your face♫

460
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,040
♫Drops of lovesickness immersed in days and nights♫

461
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,820
♫Nowhere to be found♫

462
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,370
♫You once said I'm heartless♫

463

♫I didn't know I couldn't stop missing you♫

♫Follow you everywhere you go♫

466
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,500
♫Days and nights, I can't help myself♫

467
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,220
♫What is love and what is anticipation♫

468
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,550
The gods are always present at all times and all places.

469
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,260
♫Our hearts collide♫

470
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,020
The Heaven and Earth can testify

471
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,920
that you're my wife.

472
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,520
♫If only one person understands the hopes I wouldn't give up♫

473
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,990

♫You are the one I hold on to♫

475
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,460
The sun and the moon shine brightly.

476
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,690
♫If only one person can get me through the storm♫

477
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,830
The mountains and rivers are our matchmakers.

478

♫You're the home I come back to♫

479
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,270

♫If only one person can protect me through the long nights♫

481
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,030
Gu Jiusi.

482
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:35,330
♫You're the peace of my life♫

483
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:43,100
♫Hoping the hands that I'm holding tight are yours♫

484
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,500
I, Gu Jiusi,

485
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,770
will use my body

486
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,370
♫If I can make a wish, I hope we can be like this for the rest of our lives♫

487
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,630
to protect you from wind and rain,

488
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,630
to protect your clothing from dust

489
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,300
and your hair from frost.

490
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,550
May I be like the wind

491
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
and accompany you

492
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
