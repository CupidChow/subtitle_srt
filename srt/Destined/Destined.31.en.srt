[Episode 31]

4
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,340
He's dead?

5
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,460
Zhou Kai was a Treasury official.

6
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,259
He retired due to illness three years ago,

7
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,720
and passed away a year ago.

8
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,460
Since he worked for the Ministry of Revenue for 20 years,

9
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,420
Minister Lu even gave his household

10
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,110
ten taels of silver himself

11
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,910
for the funeral.

12
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,400
What about Liu Zhe?

13
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,940
He retired and returned to his hometown.

14
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,540
He should be able to be found.

15
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,790
The war two years ago

16
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,340
affected his residence.

17
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,910
The village was destroyed,

18
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,190
and he went missing.

19
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,950
What a coincidence.

20
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,500
The people we're looking for

21
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,300
either got executed for corruption,

22
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,100
or defected because of the war

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,260
and are unaccounted for.

24
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,579
Whoever we want to find

25
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,740
would be dead and not be able to provide testimony.

26
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,820
It's more like

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,780
it's exactly because they died

28
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,579
that the clues were put on them.

29
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,260
I didn't expect that

30
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,540
they embezzled 15 million taels of silver.

31
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,540
I thought

32
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,980
even if they got their hands

33
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,060
on the ledgers of the past years,

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,930
they wouldn't be able to balance the books.

35
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,860
Who would have thought about this?

36
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,290
We underestimated them.

37
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,660
There's one more thing we can investigate.

38
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,260
It couldn't be easy

39
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,250
for them to balance the 15 million taels

40
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,380
without anyone knowing.

41
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,310
The person who compiled the ledger

42
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,030
is a clue.

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,250
My Lord.

44
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,410
What are you doing?

45
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,940
My clothes! My table cloth!

46
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,180
Go away!

47
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,220
These are all Suzhou embroidery.

48
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,020
My clothes...

49
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,700
Don't I feel bad about it too?

50
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,120
But what's the point?

51
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,870
We still have to burn them.

52
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,700
Money

53
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,540
is worldly possession after all.

54
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,060
If these things

55
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,550
are found out by them,

56
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,270
our whole family

57
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,590
will be executed.

58
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,450
Is Gu Jiusi who's investigating the case

59
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,700
really that serious?

60
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,390
Why don't you go see him in his mansion?

61
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,940
Instead of burning these things,

62
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,100
why don't you give him some

63
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,730
and ask him to look the other way?

64
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,010
Isn't that better?

65
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,149
Women's opinion

66
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,790
is so foolish.

67
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,610
Go see him?

68
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,580
Do you want to hand him

69
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,780
the evidence of my bribery?

70
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,990
Burn it.

71
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,590
Burn it.

72
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Deputy Minister.

73
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,860
Minister Lu wants to see you.

74
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,260
Who?

75
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,440
Who's that?

76
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,470
Are you Sun He?

77
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,900
I'm Gu Jiusi, Deputy Minister of Revenue.

78
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,350
I'm here for business.

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,100
Pardon me.

80
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,360
Please come in.

81
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,710
Mother.

82
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,670
Make some tea for our guest.

83
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,460
Your residence is really remote.

84
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,659
Only you and your mother live here?

85
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,750
What do you mean by this?

86
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,740
Didn't Liu Chun send you here

87
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,630
to kill me?

88
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,020
Cut it out.

89
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:58,830
What?

90
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,710
What do you mean he's not there?

91
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,660
The house was empty.

92
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,980
Sun He and his mother

93
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,870
have left.

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,910
His mother is seriously ill.

95
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,830
He's just a weak scholar.

96
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,670
Where can they go?

97
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,780
According to his neighbor who's been watching him,

98
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,660
this morning, a young man

99
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,660
went to see Sun He.

100
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,340
He disappeared after that.

101
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,470
This time,

102
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,740
I failed to kill Sun He.

103
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,290
If he falls into

104
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,700
Gu Jiusi's hands...

105
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,420
Deputy Minister.

106
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,100
Someone delivered

107
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,170
Deputy Minister Gu's invitation.

108
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,260
He wants to invite you to have a drink

109
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,990
at Lefeng Restaurant tonight.

110
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,520
[Invitation]

111
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,110
Gu Jiusi?

112
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:54,990
Master.

113
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,340
This Cold-Food Powder can control people's minds.

114
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,420
make them hallucinate

115
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,680
and become irritable.

116
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,900
Is the effect reliable?

117
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,780
This is the top-grade product

118
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,900
refined from the essence stone of the Western Regions.

119
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,980
As long as the Crown Prince takes it continuously

120
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,850
for more than a month,

121
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,420
it'd be ten times more effective than

122
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,280
the common Five-Mineral Powder.

123
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,700
This is its unique incense.

124
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,570
As long as you put this incense in the incense burner,

125
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,460
the effect of Cold-Food Powder

126
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,570
will increase several times.

127
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,900
It will make him completely lose his mind.

128
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,700
How long can the effect last?

129
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,180
It can last for several hours.

130
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,710
However,

131
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,460
as long as he drinks the antidote,

132
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,660
he will come to his senses immediately.

133
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,670
Here.

134
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,140
I've been working with you for so long, Deputy Minister Gu.

135
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,260
But we've never had dinner alone.

136
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,140
I wonder

137
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,140
why you are in the mood today?

138
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,700
Since we are colleagues,

139
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,860
we're supposed to get more acquainted.

140
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,740
Deputy Minister Liu,

141
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,659
you also took extra care of

142
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,060
your former subordinate

143
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,500
Sun He today, didn't you?

144
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,420
If you confess

145
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,090
all the details

146
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,980
of Lu Yong and other important court officials embezzling the treasury money,

147
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,110
I'll keep you alive.

148
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

149
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,600
I don't know anything.

150
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:22,590
Get out.

151
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,900
I'll call you if I need anything.

152
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,620
Yes.

153
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:32,980
Liu Chun.

154
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,260
Think about it.

155
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,370
If I really want you to die,

156
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,659
I can hand Sun He's evidence

157
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,659
directly over to His Majesty.

158
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,860
You will die for sure.

159
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,900
And Lu Yong

160
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,160
will definitely give you up to protect himself.

161
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,180
We have no grudge.

162
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,850
What I want is to get the treasury money back.

163
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,980
My target is Lu Yong.

164
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,070
I'm here

165
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,020
to give you a chance

166
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,590
and spare your life.

167
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,230
Deputy Minister Gu.

168
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,860
I promise you.

169
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,300
I'll testify against Lu Yong

170
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,080
in court tomorrow.

171
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,670
But you must keep your promise.

172
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,430
Don't forget what you promised me.

173
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,710
Don't worry.

174
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,020
Thank you, Deputy Minister Liu.

175
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,110
Greetings, Grand Tutor.

176
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,190
Greetings, Your Highness.

177
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,620
Deputy Minister Liu.

178
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,300
What did Gu Jiusi

179
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,420
say to you just now?

180
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,020
Tell me everything.

181
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,350
Your Highness.

182
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,780
It was just

183
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,250
drinking and chatting between colleagues.

184
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,700
It's not worth listening.

185
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,900
Deputy Minister Liu.

186
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,640
Are you seeing clearly

187
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,810
who the man

188
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,830
in front of you is?

189
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,100
This is the Crown Prince.

190
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,870
The future emperor.

191
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,490
You still don't want to tell us the truth?

192
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,060
We...

193
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,190
We really didn't talk about anything important.

194
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,500
It was just grumbling after drinking.

195
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,030
I forgot what I said after I said it.

196
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,920
Stop acting clueless!

197
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,990
Liu Chun.

198
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,300
Do you think I don't know that

199
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,200
Gu Jiusi came to talk to you

200
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,260
about the embezzlement of the treasury money?

201
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,270
Your Highness, I'm innocent.

202
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,610
I drank too much today.

203
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,940
I'm afraid that I might offend you.

204
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,140
I shall take my leave.

205
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,910
I'm leaving.

206
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,990
Did I

207
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,710
permit you to leave?

208
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,910
Your Highness.

209
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,780
Liu Chun.

210
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,250
You really don't

211
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,300
take His Highness

212
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,360
seriously, do you?

213
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,750
You...

214
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,300
Will you say it or not?

215
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,490
Your Highness.

216
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,250
This...

217
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:55,780
The treasury case

218
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,350
is Gu Jiusi's duty.

219
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,730
Why bother

220
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,830
to interfere?

221
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,240
Liu Chun, how dare you!

222
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Do you think what His Highness says

223
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,380
holds less weight than Gu Jiusi's words?

224
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,930
Is that so?

225
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,420
No.

226
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,620
Do you think

227
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,450
His Majesty would rather trust an outsider

228
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,380
than

229
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,620
his own son?

230
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,060
No.

231
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,750
He can investigate,

232
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,220
and I can't?

233
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,420
That's not what I meant.

234
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,620
What do you mean then?

235
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,660
Liu Chun.

236
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,020
You keep talking back

237
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,580
and despising His Highness.

238
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,740
You even insinuated that

239
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,980
His Highness is not as good as a deputy minister.

240
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,190
How dare you!

241
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,260
Why do you trust

242
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,380
Gu Jiusi so much

243
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,670
and side with him?

244
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,020
Say it.

245
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,550
I'll say it.

246
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:37,980
Gu Jiusi

247
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,510
promised that he would keep

248
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,920
me and my family alive.

249
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,100
Everything I have

250
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,180
is in his hands.

251
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,980
I could only choose to trust him.

252
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,040
Your Highness.

253
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,460
Gu Jiusi will protect you?

254
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,540
You trust him so much.

255
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,990
I'll see

256
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,340
how he can protect you today.

257
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,120
Your Highness, calm down.

258
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,760
Your Highness.

259
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,200
Your Highness.

260
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,640
Your Highness.

261
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,860
Your Highness.

262
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,190
How could you be so impulsive?

263
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,460
Look what you've done.

264
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,710
I... I killed him.

265
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,680
Your Highness.

266
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,100
We can't let anyone know about this.

267
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,750
Go!

268
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,590
Go!

269
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,540
Go!

270
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:06,740
Go!

271
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,460
Mingyi.

272
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,390
Yes.

273
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,260
Got it.

274
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,430
My Lady.

275
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,550
It's almost 3 a.m.

276
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,060
It's almost dawn.

277
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,960
Let me take you to bed, My Lady.

278
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,990
I don't know why,

279
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,750
but I feel uneasy.

280
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,580
I feel so upset.

281
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,260
It's done.

282
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,560
Liu Chun has agreed

283
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,940
to testify against Lu Yong

284
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,000
in court tomorrow,

285
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,570
and hand over all the evidence of the treasury case

286
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,940
and the whereabouts of the money.

287
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,580
We can finally give His Majesty

288
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,380
and the people

289
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,710
a satisfactory answer.

290
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,060
Deputy Minister Gu.

291
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,820
Come with us.

292
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,800
What happened?

293
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,060
Liu Chun, Deputy Minister of Revenue,

294
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,300
went to Lefeng Restaurant

295
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,830
at your invitation, right?

296
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,780
What's wrong?

297
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,340
Is having dinner with my colleague

298
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,350
a sin?

299
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,590
Liu Chun is dead.

300
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,960
[Imperial Prison]

301
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,980
Uncle.

302
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,100
You're here wining and dining,

303
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,620
while your nephew is suffering.

304
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,350
It's inappropriate, isn't it?

305
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,140
Little Jiusi.

306
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,700
You asked for the suffering

307
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,020
yourself.

308
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,300
I told you

309
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,820
to stop investigating,

310
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,100
but you wouldn't listen.

311
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,160
You got imprisoned

312
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,160
a few days earlier than I thought.

313
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,180
Looks like

314
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,780
you worked quite hard for your investigation.

315
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,950
Since you knew I would be imprisoned,

316
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,140
how about you tell me

317
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,230
when I can get out?

318
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,500
This is the Imperial Prison.

319
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,420
Once you come in,

320
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,880
don't think about getting out any time soon.

321
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,940
Take things as they come.

322
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,950
Stop thinking about it.

323
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,470
Have a drink with me.

324
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:34,700
Here.

325
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,100
Take it.

326
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,310
No food?

327
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,550
I can smell it.

328
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Good wine.

329
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,950
Liu Chun died

330
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,220
right after we got some clues of the treasury case.

331
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,300
And Jiusi became the murderer.

332
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,620
This is clearly a trap.

333
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,020
Since it's a frame-up,

334
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,130
we can definitely find a way

335
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,730
to prove Jiusi's innocence.

336
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,020
But he's gone to jail.

337
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,819
He's only a step away from death.

338
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,150
What if

339
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,300
he's already beaten up in the prison

340
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,099
before we can find any evidence?

341
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,470
I want to see him.

342
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,500
I want to make sure he's safe.

343
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,619
Okay.

344
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,670
Brother Jiusi.

345
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,180
Don't do that.

346
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,860
When you call me that,

347
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,980
I feel a toothache.

348
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,250
I heard that you are in prison, Deputy Minister Gu.

349
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,350
I felt uneasy,

350
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,030
so I came to check on you.

351
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,350
Since you've seen me,

352
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,460
please leave.

353
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,220
I didn't expect that you'd

354
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,580
end up like this, Deputy Minister Gu.

355
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,130
You are punished for murder,

356
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,530
but you're still so calm.

357
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,020
Your Highness.

358
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,380
Please go ahead if you have something to say.

359
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,870
I have a way to get you out.

360
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,380
[Death-exemption Plate]

361
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,300
His Majesty managed to ascend the throne

362
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,940
without going through battles.

363
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,140
It's all thanks to my mother's support.

364
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,820
This

365
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,100
is not a secret.

366
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,860
Since His Majesty is lenient,

367
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,060
he returned the favor

368
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,180
by keeping our dignified positions.

369
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,300
He also gave me and Mother

370
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,760
a death-exemption plate.

371
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,250
The royal

372
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,350
family members

373
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,980
can be exempted from death with this,

374
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,660
unless it's mutiny.

375
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,550
Brother Jiusi.

376
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,670
You know what I want.

377
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,290
If you become my consort,

378
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,300
no matter whether you killed Liu Chun or not,

379
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,900
it'll no longer be a problem.

380
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,350
Your Highness.

381
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,860
I've already told you that

382
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,900
I have a wife.

383
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,500
We love each other very much.

384
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,900
My wife is

385
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,940
the best woman in the world.

386
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,330
No one can compare with her.

387
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,260
Even the princess?

388
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,510
Even Your Highness.

389
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,660
Deputy Minister Gu.

390
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,010
Do you know how many court officials

391
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,900
are waiting to use this opportunity

392
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,750
to knock you into the mud?

393
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,180
What can your wife

394
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,500
who can't even operate a rouge shop

395
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,660
do for you now?

396
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,980
The lower class a person is,

397
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,780
the more casual their marriage is.

398
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,100
The higher class you want to be,

399
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,630
the more you should pay attention to lineage.

400
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,540
Liu Yuru...

401
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,630
It's Liu Yuru, right?

402
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,950
She is a nice person.

403
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,930
But she was born a commoner,

404
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,180
and she became a merchant.

405
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,300
She's unpresentable after all.

406
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,310
Deputy Minister Gu.

407
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,460
You are a smart man.

408
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,580
You should have a bright future.

409
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,950
You should know

410
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,790
what's better for you.

411
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,100
You're a descendant of the royal family,

412
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,220
Your Highness.

413
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,530
But now,

414
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,970
you end up using your noble identity

415
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,100
as a bargaining chip

416
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,420
to discuss the pros and cons of marriage

417
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,950
with me, an official who used to be a merchant.

418
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,430
I feel sorry for you.

419
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,650
Gu Jiusi, how presumptuous you are!

420
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,300
If I'm not,

421
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,560
how could I end up here?

422
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,380
I'm afraid you have no idea

423
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,020
what kind of person

424
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,180
I, Gu Jiusi, am.

425
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,580
Regarding marriage as a business.

426
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,780
Even merchants wouldn't do that.

427
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,820
Your Highness,

428
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,280
you really opened my eyes.

429
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,270
Who do you think you are,

430
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,660
pointing fingers at Yuru?

431
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,060
My Yuru

432
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,090
devotes herself to helping others.

433
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,300
She helped many people,

434
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,560
and saved many people.

435
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,420
Wherever she goes,

436
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,030
she brings hope there.

437
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,120
What about you?

438
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,380
Have you ever made money?

439
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,700
Have you done anything

440
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,850
for others and the world?

441
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,530
You've been enjoying the grains produced by the people,

442
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,900
but have you ever worried about them, for even a while?

443
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,500
Princess is not only a title.

444
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,300
Just like His Majesty,

445
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,830
you have many responsibilities to shoulder.

446
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,860
Although Yuru

447
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
is not a princess,

448
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,860
I treat her as my treasure.

449
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,820
I, Gu Jiusi,

450
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,630
will never marry another woman in my life.

451
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,910
Gu Jiusi.

452
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,540
I like you.

453
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,640
You do not have to be grateful,

454
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,110
but how dare you insult me like this?

455
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,420
You like me?

456
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,420
Really?

457
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,890
Your Highness.

458
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,260
I know

459
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,870
exactly who I am.

460
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,350
What do you mean?

461
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,580
Do I have to

462
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,910
make it so clear?

463
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,140
Fine.

464
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,420
The Empress Dowager and Princess of the previous dynasty.

465
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,020
How long do you think you can enjoy your honor

466
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,680
in the new emperor's capital?

467
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,500
Now you're at

468
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,420
the right age to get married.

469
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,530
If you keep delaying,

470
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,010
when we start to fight Northern Liang,

471
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,540
you will definitely be sent there for marriage alliance.

472
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,800
That's why you're in such a hurry, right?

473
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,390
But in Eastern Capital,

474
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,660
you can't marry someone with a complex background,

475
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,060
someone from an established noble family,

476
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,460
someone who's from an inferior family,

477
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,700
or someone incapable.

478
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,220
Looks like

479
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,420
I'm the only suitable one,

480
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,950
even though I'm in decline.

481
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,950
Marrying someone like me sounds nice.

482
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,940
And I don't have much money,

483
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,260
so I'm easy to control.

484
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,500
As for me as a person,

485
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,180
I'm smart and good-looking,

486
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,580
and I'm quite promising.

487
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,230
Do you think I'm shameless?

488
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,980
I am.

489
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,040
Your Highness.

490
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,450
It's not wrong

491
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,660
to plan

492
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,820
for your marriage and your future.

493
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,540
But what's wrong is

494
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,420
to treat others as dirt,

495
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,530
or

496
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,460
as a tool to achieve your own goals.

497
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,280
Even only for this reason,

498
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,440
we are not the same kind of people.

499
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,300
And you are

500
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,070
a far cry from my wife.

501
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,580
Gu Jiusi.

502
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,150
You'll regret it.

503
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,590
See you.

504
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,750
You are unromantic, Little Jiusi.

505
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,090
You really didn't

506
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,020
get any of

507
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,900
my romantic temperament from me.

508
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,990
When did you wake up?

509
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,720
You heard everything?

510
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,510
Such a beautiful girl.

511
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
She can help you ascend to power smoothly,

512
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,030
but you turned her down.

513
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,350
What a pity.

514
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,140
Her Highness must not have gone far.

515
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,130
If you want to,

516
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,460
you can be the consort.

517
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,450
This way,

518
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,540
she can let us out,

519
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,110
and I can call her aunt.

520
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,740
No need.

521
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,520
It's peaceful in here.

522
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,790
I can see

523
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,780
what happens out there clearly.

524
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,150
[Imperial Prison]

525
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,950
Here.

526
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,100
What's up?

527
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,300
Everything is ready.

528
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,030
Don't worry.

529
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,670
Let's go.

530
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,750
Jiusi.

531
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,060
Jiusi.

532
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,380
Yuru.

533
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,310
Are you okay?

534
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,100
What is it with Liu Chun?

535
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,700
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

536
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,960
I made you worry again.

537
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,220
Why are you talking about this now?

538
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,940
You know court affairs

539
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,340
more thoroughly than me.

540
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,590
What should I do now?

541
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,180
Show me the way.

542
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,990
No matter who framed me,

543
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,440
they are targeting the Treasury.

544
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,210
There are two things

545
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,410
I need you to do for me.

546
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,230
First,

547
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,100
ask Munan to take you outside the city

548
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,660
to find a man named Sun He.

549
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,310
He's the key witness of the treasury case.

550
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,350
Second,

551
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,620
Liu Chun was murdered at Lefeng Restaurant.

552
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,340
Go check there to see

553
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,570
if there are any clues

554
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,830
to prove my innocence.

555
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,270
Okay.

556
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,940
Look.

557
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,790
If you agreed

558
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,940
to be Her Highness's consort,

559
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,600
you wouldn't have to go through so much trouble.

560
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,090
Who would agree to Her Highness's offer?

561
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,220
Don't listen to him.

562
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,780
I know.

563
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,750
I trust you.

564
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,980
Greetings, Uncle. I'm Yuru.

565
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,910
What you said just now

566
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,030
is wrong, Uncle.

567
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,060
I believe Jiusi is innocent.

568
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,940
I also believe that His Majesty is perspicacious.

569
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,300
When the truth comes out,

570
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,560
Jiusi will be alright.

571
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,620
There's no need for him to make a deal with Her Highness.

572
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,230
Besides,

573
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,700
when people gather for profit,

574
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,220
they'll break up when there's no more profit.

575
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,740
If Jiusi becomes the consort,

576
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,380
maybe

577
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,940
he can get out of jail.

578
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,110
But since Li Yunchang

579
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,280
can get Jiusi

580
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,020
out of jail and become a noble consort for now,

581
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,700
in the future,

582
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,860
she can order Jiusi to bow down to the nobility

583
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,870
in the name of the royal family.

584
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,640
Jiusi cares about the people.

585
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,270
He is not a snobbish man.

586
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,180
I don't want to see him

587
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,620
forget his roots either.

588
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,270
I didn't expect that

589
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,940
Liu Yuru

590
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,260
is a girl

591
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,740
with such bearing.

592
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,700
It's really interesting.

593
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,880
I'm flattered, Uncle.

594
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,970
It will take some time

595
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,900
before I can prove Jiusi innocent.

596
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,660
You must have a plan

597
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,860
since you've been staying here in peace.

598
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,590
It's hard for me to guess.

599
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,390
I just hope that

600
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,500
you can take care of Jiusi for the next couple of days.

601
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,510
I, Yuru, thank you, Uncle.

602
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,520
♫I borrowed moonlight♫

603
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,850
♫From fireflies♫

604
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,340
♫It stopped on the branches♫

605
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,990
♫I used it to decorate your smile♫

606
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,200
♫I also want to hold your hand♫

607
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,030
Little Jiusi.

608
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,300
You have good taste.

609
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,390
No wonder you didn't fall for Her Highness.

610
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,790
♫And admire the plum blossom which is covered by snow♫

611
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,980
Enough is enough.

612
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,820
Come at me if you want to say something.

613
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,290
♫It's a seemingly♫

614
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,660
Don't mess with my wife.

615
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,390
♫Young people's tour♫

616
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,140
He's all mumbo jumbo.

617
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,000
Don't mind him.

618
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,860
I think,

619
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,150
♫The pear blossom accompanies the spring breeze♫

620
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,660
in fact, Uncle is easy to get along with.

621
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,390
Really?

622
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,470
♫I forgot the things in the world all of a sudden♫

623
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:56,360
♫Everyone thinks life is like a dream♫

624
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,440
It's time for you to leave.

00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,480
♫How much do I miss you?♫

626
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,860
I'm leaving.

627
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,710
I brought you something.

628
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,890
♫I've seen you here before♫

629
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,600
The guards will give it to you.

630
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,050
♫One night, we sat together to write poems and drink alcohol♫

631
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,480
Take care of yourself.

632
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,670
You too.

633
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,470
♫Another spring and autumn came♫

634
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,120
♫I saw the sun, the moon, and the stars outside the window♫

00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,740
♫The wind blows and the moon sways. My heart is beating♫

636
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,950
Why did you go visit Gu Jiusi

637
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,820
in jail again?

638
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,060
I was trying to

639
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,470
win him over,

640
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,980
in the hope that he can be used as a pawn by you in the future, Mother.

641
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,840
I didn't expect

642
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,420
that he'd be so stubborn.

643
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,660
Forget it.

644
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,750
He has to go.

645
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,590
Mother.

646
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,610
But after all,

647
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,630
he's our best pawn for now.

648
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,110
Do you really want him dead?

649
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,660
You just like

650
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,380
his appearance, right?

651
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,460
A man's appearance

652
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,300
can be delusional.

653
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,630
It will make you stupid.

654
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,580
In the future,

655
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,770
when we have a stable position

656
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,410
in the imperial court,

657
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,670
there won't be any man that you can't get.

658
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,360
You are right, Mother.

659
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,060
Your Majesty.

660
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,430
As for the case of Gu Jiusi murdering Liu Chun,

661
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,860
the Ministry of Justice has already

662
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,140
[Minister of Justice, Hu Pan]

663
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,610
dug out bloody clothes and weapons from his backyard.

664
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,670
The bloody clothes

665
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,260
are exactly what Gu Jiusi wore

666
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,270
on the night he met with Liu Chun.

667
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,310
The weapon

668
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,340
also matches

669
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,460
the fatal injury on Liu Chun's body.

670
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,300
There's a waiter from Lefeng Restaurant

671
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,220
as witness.

672
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,660
He saw

673
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,820
Gu Jiusi had an argument with Liu Chun with his own eyes.

674
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,330
He also heard them say words like

675
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,020
"Help!" and "Murder!".

676
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,730
Several imperial guards on duty

677
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,180
also provided their testimony.

678
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,020
According to them,

679
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,270
Gu Jiusi and Liu Chun

680
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,580
have always been on bad terms as colleagues.

681
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,020
Gu Jiusi always complained about Liu Chun

682
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,580
for making things difficult for him

683
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,140
in procedures.

684
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,510
In that case,

685
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,860
we have everything

686
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,540
from physical evidence

687
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,340
and witnesses

688
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,420
to motive.

689
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,900
According to the rules of the Ministry of Justice,

690
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,830
this case can be closed.

691
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,070
The case is closed?

692
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,870
Deputy Minister Gu is one of His Majesty's favorite,

693
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,260
and he has great military achievements.

694
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,520
He has a bright future.

695
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,020
At this moment,

696
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,560
would he kill his colleague

697
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,420
for some trivial disagreements?

698
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,940
I think you are talking nonsense.

699
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,500
Please judge wisely, Your Majesty.

700
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,310
I

701
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,920
dare not argue with the Magistrate Zhou.

702
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,590
In Ministry of Justice,

703
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,870
we decide cases based on evidence.

704
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,660
Can't evidence be forged?

705
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,710
I've long heard about

706
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,060
the tricks of you officials.

707
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,100
Your Majesty.

708
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,380
In my opinion,

709
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,010
Gu Jiusi giving up his bright future

710
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,700
and killing someone for trivial matters.

711
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,260
This

712
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,340
is the most suspicious thing.

713
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,020
Your Majesty.

714
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,660
Deputy Minister Gu is an important talent for our country.

715
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,920
I don't want to believe

716
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,860
he would do such a thing, either.

717
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,060
It's just that Deputy Minister Gu

718
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,100
has always been irritable since he was young.

719
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,960
A few years ago,

720
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,480
due to an altercation,

721
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,660
he broke the leg of

722
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,920
the son of the Commissioner of Yangzhou.

723
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,030
This was all over the place.

724
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,240
Everyone in Yangzhou knows about it.

725
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,270
So I think

726
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,460
it's also reasonable that

727
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,700
Deputy Minister Gu would kill him

728
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,070
out of anger.

729
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,300
Nonsense!

730
00:31:59,260 --> 00:31:59,870
No.

731
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,430
I have something to say.

732
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,780
Your Majesty.

733
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,580
What Grand Tutor said is purely hearsay.

734
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,710
It can't be trusted.

735
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,220
Besides, on the day of the incident,

736
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,740
I happened to be there.

737
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,670
I can say I witnessed it myself.

738
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,460
Wang Rong, son of the commissioner,

739
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,270
was a bully.

740
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,020
He did all kinds of evil deeds.

741
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,260
He humiliated Deputy Minister Gu's wife

742
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,750
in front of everyone.

743
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,960
But it should have been dealt with according to the law.

744
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,850
He shouldn't have violated the law

745
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,180
and taken care of it himself impulsively.

746
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,100
Your Majesty.

747
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,950
I can testify.

748
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,530
There was no such thing

749
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,340
as the law

750
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,540
in Yangzhou back then.

751
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,660
Enough.

752
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,230
Father.

753
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,180
I have something to say.

754
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,550
Go ahead.

755
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,390
Father.

756
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,900
As for the case of Gu Jiusi

757
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,380
murdering the court official,

758
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,100
we have both physical evidence and witnesses.

759
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,500
The case is already clear.

760
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,700
In my humble opinion,

761
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,220
the new dynasty has just been established.

762
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,860
Reward and punishment should be dispensed fairly.

763
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,050
We shouldn't break the rule

764
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,270
just because Gu Jiusi

765
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,360
made his contributions to Da Xia.

766
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,660
You mean

767
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,270
you want me to execute Gu Jiusi as well?

768
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,020
In order to stabilize the court

769
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,550
and console the officials,

770
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,320
I would like to request you

771
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,190
for the decision to be made according to the law, Father.

772
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,070
The Empress Dowager is here!

773
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,860
Greetings, Your Majesty.

774
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:11,909
Bring a seat.

775
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,780
Your Majesty.

776
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,139
I heard that you are not feeling well recently.

777
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,590
Why aren't you resting in your palace?

778
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,659
Your Majesty.

779
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,860
I'm not here today

780
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,389
to interfere with court affairs

781
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,909
as the Empress Dowager.

782
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,150
I'm here to seek justice

783
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,670
as your elder, Your Majesty.

784
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,429
Liu Chun's wife

785
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,989
is the daughter of my cousin.

786
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,949
Liu Chun

787
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,469
can count as half a nephew to me.

788
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,300
He has been a court official for many years.

789
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,699
He devoted himself to the country

790
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,350
and never slacked off.

791
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,239
But he was cruelly assassinated.

792
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,389
Today,

793
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,030
I'll risk my dignity

794
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,990
to ask Your Majesty to handle it impartially.

795
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,070
Execute Gu Jiusi

796
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,160
according to the law of Da Xia.

797
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,100
Your Majesty.

798
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,870
This is not deserved.

799
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,660
Your Majesty.

800
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,580
If the murderer is not executed,

801
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,830
I

802
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,640
won't be able to sleep.

803
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,440
From now on,

804
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,590
I will be too ashamed

805
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,950
to see my mother's family.

806
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Please judge wisely, Your Majesty.

807
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,220
I've been in charge of the Ministry of Justice

808
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,820
and followed the rules.

809
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,090
Every case

810
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,430
is evidence-based.

811
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,140
On the contrary, after Gu Jiusi was imprisoned,

812
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:42,140
there have been people asking around for his release.

813
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,700
What I'm afraid of is that

814
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,140
if the Ministry of Justice doesn't decide cases based on evidence,

815
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,470
but on

816
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,460
speculation, contribution, and favors

817
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,540
and lets the murderer go,

818
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,740
it will really disappoint all my fellow officials

819
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,710
and the people.

820
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,750
Please follow the law of Da Xia

821
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,670
and execute Gu Jiusi in three days

822
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,620
to console Deputy Minister Liu's soul.

823
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,670
I second it.

824
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,140
I agree.

825
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,550
Do it according to the law.

826
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,030
Grand Tutor.

827
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,880
Are we sure that

828
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,190
Gu Jiusi's case can't be overturned?

829
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,660
The reports asking for severe punishment on Gu Jiusi

830
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,250
are piling on His Majesty's desk

831
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,460
like snow flakes.

832
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,910
They won't let it go

833
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,070
if it isn't done.

834
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,590
Besides,

835
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,660
Her Majesty

836
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,990
gave that speech today.

837
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,410
She condescended so much for it.

838
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,660
If His Majesty still

839
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,060
defends Gu Jiusi publicly in spite of all this,

840
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,380
he will definitely be alienating the old officials of Eastern Capital,

841
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,710
and falling out with the Empress Dowager.

842
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,580
But Gu Jiusi's men

843
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,310
are favored by His Majesty.

844
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,210
Since His Majesty is willing to save him,

845
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,810
they may mediate in private.

846
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,080
We won't know about it.

847
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,460
Does Father really

848
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,860
trust Gu Jiusi that much?

849
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,120
Before His Majesty ascended the throne,

850
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,700
the Gu family helped him.

851
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,310
His Majesty

852
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,580
values Gu Jiusi very much.

853
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,180
In public,

854
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,170
he regards him as his right-hand man.

855
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,180
In private, he treats him as his nephew.

856
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,210
This relationship

857
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,700
cannot be underestimated.

858
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,470
In public,

859
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,340
His Majesty has to follow

860
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,630
the rules he set.

861
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,700
But he might find a way

862
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
to help Gu Jiusi get away with it

863
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,870
in secret.

864
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,110
It's his duty

865
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,780
to serve the country as an official.

866
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,660
Father received his help

867
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,300
for once,

868
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,780
so he'd be threatened to return the favor

869
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,860
for the rest of his life?

870
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,590
Grand Tutor.

871
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,380
Think of a way for me.

872
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,190
Although His Majesty values this relationship,

873
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,140
he values you more, Your Highness.

874
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,030
You need to

875
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,620
speak to him

876
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,360
yourself, Your Highness.

877
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,770
Your Majesty.

878
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,550
The carriage is ready.

879
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,580
It's waiting at Qinghe Gate.

880
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,660
Your Highness.

881
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,140
Yu'er.

882
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,140
Where are you going, Father?

883
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,220
Are you going to see Gu Jiusi?

884
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,180
Father, you can't go.

885
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,950
Why are you stopping me, Yu'er?

886
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,180
I'm stopping you

887
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,600
for the same reason

888
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,510
as I proposed to

889
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,120
execute Gu Jiusi in court.

890
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,980
Father, you are the Emperor.

891
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,380
What you should think about

892
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,040
is the great plan of the world.

893
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,700
If you always side with the old officials of Youzhou,

894
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
it will only make the officials of Eastern Capital

895
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,560
unsatisfied, Father.

896
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,670
And the country will be disunited.

897
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,100
Yu'er, you have a point.

898
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,150
It's just that

899
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,700
Gu Jiusi did a great favor

900
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,700
for the people of Wangdu.

901
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,430
I can't forget where I started.

902
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,460
To me, Gu Jiusi

903
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,770
is also like an elder brother.

904
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,300
Even better than a brother.

905
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,380
I'm as worried as you

906
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,750
at this moment.

907
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,980
However, you have handed this case over

908
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,180
to the Ministry of Justice, Father.

909
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,220
All the procedures

910
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,150
will be handled by the law of Da Xia.

911
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,980
If you meet with the criminal in private at this time

912
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,440
and get caught by someone,

913
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,150
it may not affect you, Father,

914
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,500
but it would be setting Gu Jiusi

915
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,510
on fire.

916
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,070
It's no good

917
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,420
to the investigation of the case itself at all.

918
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,270
Father.

919
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,470
Yu'er.

920
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,340
You've grown up.

921
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,060
You have a lot

922
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,500
on your mind.

923
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,260
I

924
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,760
have always been willing to share your burden, Father.

925
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,420
You may leave.

926
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,990
Go check

927
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,160
where the Crown Prince

928
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,860
has been recently,

929
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,150
and who he has been with.

930
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

931
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,900
Who are you?

932
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,170
[Deputy Minister of Revenue]

933
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:04,190
[Report Letter: Wang Youcai from Cihu Village hereby reports that Lu Yong, Minister of Revenue, and his gang embezzled the treasury money.]

934
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,580
I thought with Liu Chun pleading guilty,

935
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,790
this would be over.

936
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,840
But someone still got ahead of us.

937
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:13,980
We can't let anything go wrong

938
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,060
with Sun He.

939
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,630
Keep it safe.

940
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,340
Zhou Ye asked his eldest brother and second brother

941
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,430
to find the waiter

942
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,420
who committed perjury

943
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,820
using the military intelligence network.

944
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,660
Are you the waiter from Lefeng Restaurant,

945
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,740
Zhao Xiaohe?

946
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,780
Committing perjury and

947
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,640
slandering an imperial official

948
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,900
is a capital offense.

949
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,740
