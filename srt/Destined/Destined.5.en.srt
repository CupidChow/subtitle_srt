[English subtitles are available]

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,050
[Destined]

3
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,030
[Episode 5]

4
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,630
I endured humiliation

5
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,140
and stayed by Young Madam's side

6
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,610
because... because I wanted

7
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,920
to get information for you

8
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,050
so that you can know yourself and your enemy

9
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,560
and escape from here.

10
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,870
Young Master, you don't believe me?

11
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,150
Look at this.

12
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,789
This is all of Young Madam's

13
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,250
schedule and patrol times

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,040
for the next few days.

15
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,660
I recorded everything here.

16
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,080
I wrote them down secretly.

17
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,220
The ugly doll you drew

18
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,440
looks quite like her.

19
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,920
This doll

20
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:22,800
is you.

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,770
This willow branch is Young Madam.

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,579
There's more.

23
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,800
A handwritten copy of the novel,

24
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,660
The Legend of Jiangnan Heroes.

25
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,670
Good brother.

26
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,640
Young Master.

27
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,080
Young Madam.

28
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,350
Ms. Ruixue asked me to ask you

29
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,210
how the gifts should be prepared.

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,020
Prepare gifts?

31
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,810
What gifts?

32
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,330
Tomorrow is the day you return home.

33
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,640
Young Madam, have you been so busy that you've forgotten?

34
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,430
Oh no.

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,120
What's wrong?

36
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,460
I offended my husband so much today.

37
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,190
What if he

38
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,829
makes a scene when we go back tomorrow?

39
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,329
Wouldn't that

40
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,760
make Mother lose her dignity at home?

41
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,260
Then...

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,050
This won't do, I have to talk to him.

43
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,010
My lord.

44
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,230
Young Master, hurry up.

45
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,410
My lord, you've worked hard.

46
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,180
I'm fine.

47
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,380
Why is your throat hoarse?

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,040
Have some pear soup to moisten your throat.

49
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,960
I don't want it.

50
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,160
I'm still memorizing.

51
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,620
It's late. Stop reciting.

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,630
Drink it quickly.

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,810
No, I just had ginseng tea.

54
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,110
I can't drink anymore.

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,250
I made

56
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,140
this pear soup specially for you.

57
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,590
My lord, have a taste.

58
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,420
Liu Yuru.

59
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,060
There's evil lurking behind your smile.

60
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,990
Don't be so gentle,

61
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,250
it makes you seem fake.

62
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,690
You must be joking.

63
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,360
I...

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,960
I'll drink for Young Master.

65
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,010
It's none of your business.

66
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,680
Leave.

67
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,620
I have something to discuss with my lord.

68
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,250
No.

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,080
I want to live and die with Young Master.

70
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,730
Live and die together?

71
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,920
Young Master, take care of yourself then.

72
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,740
I...

73
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,050
Yinhong, send Munan out.

74
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,100
Yes.

75
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,910
Let's go.

76
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,800
Was what I said just now for nothing?

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,350
My lord.

78
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,820
My lord?

79
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,400
Just tell me what you're plotting.

80
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,110
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,350
I really don't have other intentions.

82
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,000
It's just...

83
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,520
Just what?

84
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,800
It's just that tomorrow

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,460
is the day I'm returning home.

86
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,950
So?

87
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,220
When a daughter gets married,

88
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,650
parents are worried.

89
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,159
I hope my lord

90
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,920
would preserve my dignity

91
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,070
in front of my family tomorrow.

92
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,650
Liu Yuru.

93
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,120
Are you begging me?

94
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,770
Yes.

95
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,370
I beg you to

96
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,840
go back with me tomorrow as a harmonious couple

97
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,100
so that my mother can rest assured.

98
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,630
As for the other matters, we can discuss them.

99
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,800
I'll have to have a taste

100
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,700
of your act of filial piety then.

101
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,180
It's too hot.

102
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,930
It's not sweet enough.

103
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,200
Then,

104
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,220
can I add some sugar for you?

105
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,620
My lord.

106
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,920
It's too sweet.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,590
You...

108
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,170
You're right.

109
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,770
The pear soup is supposed to moisten your throat.

110
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,630
It shouldn't be too sweet indeed.

111
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,340
Then can I make

112
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,890
another bowl for you?

113
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,160
Liu Yuru.

114
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,640
You are quite flexible.

115
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,890
Thank you for the compliment.

116
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,460
Enough.

117
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,930
It's not undrinkable.

118
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,620
Go behind me

119
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,410
and give me a massage.

120
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,450
Press the left side, come on.

121
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,760
Don’t pull a long face.

122
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,390
Smile.

123
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,090
Why are you not using any force?

124
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,490
Was all the mutton that you ate for nothing?

125
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,590
Is this the attitude of someone begging for help?

126
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,260
Liu Yuru.

127
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,520
Gu Jiusi, let me tell you.

128
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,860
I really can't beg you any longer.

129
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,170
I'm not going home.

130
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,730
It's not that I can't... Don't go.

131
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,080
Liu Yuru!

132
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,300
Yuru!

133
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,050
Ru!

134
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,030
Actually, your massage skills

135
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,920
were not bad.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,730
Returning home is a big matter.

137
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,850
We can discuss it.

138
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,580
Why?

139
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,380
Are you now willing to

140
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,350
discuss it?

141
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,950
It's not impossible.

142
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,480
Then make your conditions.

143
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,180
First,

144
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,320
bring

145
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,620
all my colorful clothes

146
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,590
back to me.

147
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,970
I can wear

148
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:37,990
whatever I want.

149
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,450
Okay.

150
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,890
Second,

151
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,610
don't make frequent changes to the rules,

152
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,920
don't add more passages for memorizing at the last minute,

153
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,930
and don't lock me up in the room

154
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,060
without any food.

155
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,500
Fine.

156
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,230
Third,

157
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,990
I want a vacation...

158
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,790
of seven days.

159
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,100
Gu Jiusi, you...

160
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:57,930
What’s wrong?

161
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,400
No way.

162
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,500
Is your dignity

163
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,810
not even worth a seven-day vacation?

164
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,750
Okay, fine.

165
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,780
That's it.

166
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,080
I

167
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,510
don't push my luck.

168
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,990
Then it's a deal.

169
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,120
Deal.

170
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,090
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

171
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,840
How about I sleep in the study?

172
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,190
That won't do.

173
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,820
We just got married.

174
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,710
We can't already be sleeping in separate rooms.

175
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,100
If there's gossip about it,

176
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,760
my reputation will be ruined.

177
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,920
But we are not a real married couple after all.

178
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,480
I can't take advantage of you.

179
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,740
It's not appropriate.

180
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,770
You still want a divorce?

181
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,410
This is just a temporary solution.

182
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,640
We'll be separated sooner or later.

183
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
Future matters are to be dealt with in the future.

184
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
At least for now,

185
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,230
we can't let anyone notice that something's off.

186
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,580
Sleep here tonight.

187
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,390
Sleep on the floor.

188
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,030
I have a soft mat in the study,

189
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,790
and you want me to sleep here on the floor?

190
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,750
It's getting late.

191
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,410
You should settle in quickly.

192
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,170
[Gu Mansion]

193
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,190
This floor is really nice.

194
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,590
I can lie in whatever position I want.

195
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,980
Good. The further you stay away from me,

196
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
the less I'll be annoyed.

197

[Liu Mansion]

198
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,780
It's only been a few days.

199
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,620
Why has your sickness relapsed again?

200
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,380
That dear daughter that you brought up!

201
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,870
What's wrong, my lord?

202
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,390
Eldest Madam.

203
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,280
You still don't know, do you?

204
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,000
It's all over Yangzhou city.

205
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,810
Eldest Miss...

206
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,850
Did something happen to Yuru?

207
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,580
If Yue'er hadn't told me,

208
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,590
the servants

209
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,650
would still be hiding it from you two.

210
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,220
Two days

211
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,570
after her wedding,

212
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,000
Eldest Miss went to the brothel with a knife.

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,730
The rumors going around the entire Yangzhou city

214
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,580
are saying that Eldest Miss

215
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,770
is a top-class shrew.

216
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
How could that be?

217
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,140
Yuru has always been sensible.

218
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,850
How could that be?

219
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,410
My lord.

220
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,920
My lord.

221
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,680
Yuru must be having a hard time

222
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,110
at the Gu House right now.

223
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,920
Go and save her quickly.

224
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,600
My lord, I beg you.

225
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,940
You must save Yuru, my lord!

226
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,470
How do you still have the audacity to say that?

227
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,520
Yuru could marry into the Gu family

228
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,690
because we were blessed

229
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,580
by the good deeds of our ancestors.

230
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,460
But now,

231
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
not only did she not serve her husband well,

232
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,670
but she's also acting so jealous

233
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,520
and shrewish!

234
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,970
Can we afford

235
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,780
to offend the Gu family

236
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,790
this easily?

237
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,330
With just a few words,

238
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,280
they could release me from prison.

239
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,670
With just a few words,

240
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,670
they can surely put us all in prison!

241
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,660
Tomorrow... tomorrow is

242
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,390
the day Eldest Miss comes home.

243
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,600
If the Gu family

244
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,080
comes and interrogates us...

245
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,210
It's all your daughter's fault!

246
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,360
Tell me, what should we do?

247
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,600
My lord.

248
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,540
We should quickly find a way

249
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,040
to

250
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,570
overcome this difficulty.

251
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,620
I have an idea.

252
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,650
What is it?

253
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,830
It's just that Eldest Madam is in poor health,

254
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,130
so I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

255
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,270
As long as it'll calm the Gu family's anger,

256
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,240
there's nothing

257
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,920
I can't do for Yuru.

258
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,020
Then we'll have to trouble you, Eldest Madam.

259
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,070
As long as you

260
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,920
kneel in the Buddhist hall for a few days,

261
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,980
and copy the Women's Commandments by hand,

262
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,790
if the Gu family comes to investigate,

263
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,790
and see that Eldest Madam

264
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,520
is punishing herself for the sake of her daughter,

265
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,570
it's unlikely that

266
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,900
they would give our family too hard a time.

267
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,290
Good idea.

268
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,610
We'll do that then.

269
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,250
Yue'er will be in charge of every family matter

270
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,890
for now, from now on.

271
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,600
Yes.

272
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
As for you, go quickly

273
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,210
to the Buddhist hall to receive punishment.

274
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,340
As long as the Gu family is still angry,

275
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,450
you're not allowed to come out.

276
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,470
Okay.

277
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,850
Take care, Eldest Madam.

I'm bearing the punishment for you by copying the Women's Commandments by hand.

282

I just hope you're safe and in peace,

287
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,460
You've been dressing up

288
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,720
for almost two hours.

289
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,470

Yes, yes.

When we get to the Liu house, I'll help you off the carriage,

292
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,950
be polite to your parents,

293

and be gentle and considerate to you.

294
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,890
Since I woke up, you've been nagging about it so much

295

that my eardrums are about to burst.

296
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,920
Forget about other things.

297
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,640
My father cares about his dignity the most.

298
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,440
You must be respectful with him.

299
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,200
You can't

call my father by his name

301
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,560
or glare at him.

302
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Okay, I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

303

so that my mother can be at ease.

310
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,220
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

311
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,290
I'm a decent person, you know?

312
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:18,920
Forget it.

313
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,160
I didn't count on you to agree to all my wishes.

314

If you can

315
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,430
give me a ten-day vacation,

316
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,820
I can consider it.

317
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,820
You wish.

318
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,400
I heard that

319
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,470
your father is well-known for favoring his concubine over his wife,

320
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,020
and he doesn't treat you and your mother well.

321
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,900
Why do you care so much

322
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,960
about his dignity?

323
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,310
My mother is in poor health

324
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,780
and can't exert herself.

325
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,090
So, instead, Mother Yue is in charge of household affairs.

326
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,060
Although she's a bit greedy for money,

327
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,910
my father doesn't mistreat my mother

328
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,440
to the extent of the rumors.

329
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,680
He also cares a lot about

330
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,940
my daily necessities.

331
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,790
The gossips outside

332
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,920
are unjustified.

333
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,550
Let me tell you.

334
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,180
The rumors

335
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,860
are very detailed.

336
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,910
Every family

337
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,340
has times of internal dispute.

338
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,200
Take your Gu family as an example.

339
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,079
Your parents are broad-minded

340
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,630
and conduct themselves properly.

341
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,890
But they still ended up

342
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,660
with a rebellious and unorthodox son like you.

343
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,020
That makes sense.

344
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,250
I've never seen someone like you

345
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,980
who dares to call their father—

346
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,099
Old man?

347
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,790
Isn't that normal?

348
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,380
When he gets angry,

349
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,839
he even calls me a bastard.

350
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,300
But he's your father and you're his son.

351
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,350
So what?

352
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,780
I don't always

353
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,380
call him old man.

354
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,320
I call him dad when he's normal.

355
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,150
But if he did something immoral,

356
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,140
there's nothing wrong with calling him old man.

357
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,270
It's natural for children

358
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,240
to be filial to their parents.

359
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,250
I disagree.

360
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,090
If he's a father,

361
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,780
but he commits murder, arson, and adultery,

362
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,430
do I still have to respect and praise him,

363
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,900
saying that he did the right thing?

364
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,120
I think parents

365
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,560
also have to earn the right to filial piety.

366
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,810
I've never heard anyone

367
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,650
make such an argument.

368
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,040
But it makes sense, right?

369
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,550
You can't rebuke it, right?

370
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,100
I don't want

371
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,700
to join you in this nonsense.

Anyway, keep this in mind.

373

Don't talk too much in my house.

374
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,770

to act like you treat me well.

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,910
Okay.

00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,040
Master.

381
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,790
Master Liu.

382
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,800
Young Madam

383
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,440
prepared this homecoming gift.

384
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,040
There's a total of 128 items.

385
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,340
Please have a look.

386
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,610
The Gu family is so generous.

387
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,170
[Gift List]

388
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,800
Greetings, Young Madam.

389
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,610
Thank you for your hard work.

390
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,000
Father-in-law!

391
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,910
My lady, what's wrong?

392
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,350
Do you feel unwell?

393
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,950
It's my first homecoming,

394
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,950
so I just got emotional for a moment.

395
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,730
Greetings, Father.

396
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,640
You don't have to be so courteous.

397
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,740
Please.

398
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,630
Be careful, my lady.

399
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,400
It doesn't seem like the Gu family is here

400
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,750
to accuse us of crime and interrogate us.

401
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,850
This is a proper and decent homecoming.

402
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,490
Call Wan o-o-out—

403
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,030
Call her out?

404
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,750
Yes.

405
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,920
Yes.

406
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,000
Help Eldest Madam up quickly.

407
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,430
Eldest Miss is back.

408
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,280
How is Yuru?

409
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,880
Is she okay?

410
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,520
We worried for nothing.

411
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,010
Eldest Miss looks great.

412
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
That's good.

413
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,390
That's good.

414
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,660
Eldest Madam.

415
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,580
Do you want to

416
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,260
go wash up and dress up first?

417
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,530
You can't go out like this.

418
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,380
Eldest Miss will notice that something's off.

419
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,390
You...

420
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,290
You made Eldest Madam kneel in the Buddhist hall,

421
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,010
and you still want her to help you hide the truth?

422
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,600
Yun.

423
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,610
You brat,

424
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,270
you're being so illogical.

425
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,760
Last night, it was because we were

426
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,290
worried about Eldest Miss,

427
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,290
that this misunderstanding happened.

428
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,010
Now that everything is fine,

429
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,900
if Eldest Miss finds out about this,

430
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,230
wouldn't we just be adding to her worries?

431
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,340
Besides,

432
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,860
she's already married.

433
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,080
If she keeps thinking about her maternal family,

434
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,140
I'm afraid it will make your husband's family unhappy.

435
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,690
Eldest Madam.

436
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,830
Go and get washed and dressed.

437
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,090
Let's go.

438
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,270
Slowly.

439
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,990
Let me help you.

440
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,850
Father.

441
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,670
Where is my mother?

442
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,510
Your mother...

443
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,240
has been busy preparing the banquet

444
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,250
since the morning,

445
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,300
so she's tired

446
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,980
and resting in the rear chamber now.

447
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,830
Mother Yue has gone to get her.

448
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,620
Mother!

449
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,860
Mother.

450
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,740
Yuru.

451
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,440
Wan is here.

452
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,860
Everyone, have a seat.

453
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,620
Mother, have a seat.

454
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,470
Sit down.

455
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,000
Sit down.

456
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,360
What's wrong?

457
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,790
Nothing.

458
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,710
I was in a hurry just now.

459
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,650
I'm fine.

460
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,920
Mother, you are in poor health.

461
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,620
You need to be more careful.

462
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,950
Got it.

463
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,730
Yuru.

464
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,210
Everyone is waiting for you to start the banquet.

465
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,810
Go back to your seat quickly.

466
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,660
I'll go back first.

467
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,030
The whole family

468
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,340
has been waiting for you to come back since the morning.

469
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,250
This first toast is to my good son-in-law.

470
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,630
I'm so flattered.

471
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,170
I should give a toast to my father-in-law.

472
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,420
Thank you, Father-in-law and Mother-in-law,

473
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,720
for giving me the fortune to marry

474
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,780
someone like Yuru,

475
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,860
who's virtuous, gentle, and graceful

476
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,500
like a fairy.

477
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,190
You're really good with compliments.

478
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,210
Yuru is lucky that you've taken a liking

479
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,680
to her.

480
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,840
Everyone, eat up.

481
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,900
Today is Yuru's first homecoming.

482
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,180
Here, for this dish of braised prawns,

483
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,310
Chef Huang

484
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,250
specially visited the North to learn from a chef.

485
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,570
You will definitely like it.

486
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,240
Come on.

487
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,060
Thank you, Father.

488
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,370
Here, my good son-in-law, have a taste too.

489
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,900
Thank you, Father-in-law.

490
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,320
Eldest Miss, every time you eat prawns,

491
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,380
you'll get rashes.

492
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,760
Be careful.

493
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,600
The chef must have been careless

494
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,820
and ignored

495
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,260
my father's words again?

496
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,450
Yes.

497
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,150
My lady.

498
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,590
The fish meat at the stomach

499
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,600
is the fullest and most delicious.

500
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,520
Here, try it.

501
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,440
You have to eat the roast pork while it's hot.

502
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,570
It'll get greasy when it's cold. Here.

503
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,160
This bean curd goes well with the roast pork,

504
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,620
it's a great combination.

505
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,920
My lord, this is too much.

506
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,790
How is this too much?

507
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,760
This is not enough.

508
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,100
Do you want some meatballs too?

509
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,360
Here, have a meatball.

510
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,400
You shouldn't talk while eating or sleeping.

511
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,870
Refrain from talking so much.

512
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,880
No one's talking.

513
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,510
There's no need to be so polite.

514
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,560
Eat up, kid.

515
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,750
Yuru, we're family.

516
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,940
You don't have to restrict Jiusi.

517
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,980
Mother.

518
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,790
You don't know

519
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,300
that my husband

520
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,290
is usually a troublemaker.

521
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,000
If I fail to control him even for a moment,

522
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,260
he gets carried away.

523
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,660
Nonsense.

524
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,220
He seems gentle and proper to me.

525
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,930
He's great.

526
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,290
You should be nicer to him too.

527
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,970
Did you hear that?

528
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,230
Mother said I'm great.

529
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,480
Mother, listen.

530
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,870
You have to help me.

531
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,340
Every day, Liu Yuru...

532
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,210
Go on. Tell us.

533
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,060
What can you do?

534
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,110
You don't want me to tell them?

535
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,240
I still have to.

536
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,250
Since Liu Yuru

537
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,760
married into our family,

538
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,440
my parents

539
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,370
treat her like their own daughter,

540
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,170
and I became like an adopted son.

541
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,640
Now, everyone in the Gu family

542
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,860
will only obey her.

543
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,500
If she says yes, nobody dares to say no.

544
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,630
I can't even summon

545
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,470
a servant now.

546
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,060
Yuru.

547
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,280
The Gu family dotes on you so much.

548
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,870
You must not

549
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,270
let their kindness down.

550
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,680
This shows that we shouldn't believe in

551
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,810
the rumors outside.

552
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,670
Jiusi

553
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,440
is a rare good man.

554
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,870
I liked you at first glance.

555
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,350
You don't know how happy you've made me

556
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,080
by calling me Mother.

557
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,440
Although my mother likes you,

558
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,940
your mother likes me too.

559
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,910
We're even now.

560
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,390
Got it.

561
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,610
Eat up.

562
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,930
I can't shut you up.

563
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,680
Stop talking.

564
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,320
You're even feeding me?

565
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,120
Stop it.

566
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,590
Come on.

567
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,060
Let's eat.

568
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,130
Here, my good son-in-law.

569
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,260
Eat more.

570
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,510
Father.

571
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,440
Here.

572
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,270
Mother.

573
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,610
I'm unfilial.

574
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,000
Since I'm married,

575
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,840
I can't be by your side.

576
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,520
Nonsense.

577
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,980
How can you be with your mother forever?

578
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,610
Just now, I saw that

579
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,740
he knows how to dote on people.

580
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,020
Mother.

581
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,050
What happened to your hand?

582
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,760
Nothing.

583
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,820
Are you okay?

584
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,080
Did you apply the medication?

585
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,510
I scalded myself by accident.

586
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,180
I'm fine.

587
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,650
I've already applied the medication.

588
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,020
Here, have some snacks.

589
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,440
Mother.

590
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,820
I want to eat preserved plums.

591
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,100
Do you still have any at home?

592
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,570
Yes, I'll get it for you.

593
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,210
Eldest Madam.

594
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,550
Your health is precious.

595
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,350
Let the maids

596
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,610
do these things.

597
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,990
No.

598
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,380
They don't know Yuru's preference

599
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,520
and won't know the right amount of sugar to add.

600
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,400
I'll go.

601
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:09,670
Mother.

602
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,350
Mother, what's wrong?

603
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,090
What happened to your legs?

604
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm fine. I'm fine.

605
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,410
Eldest Miss!

606
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,510
Please save Eldest Madam.

607
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,780
You brat.

608
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,750
Don't spout nonsense.

609
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,720
Don't alarm Eldest Madam.

610
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,100
Guards! Take her away!

611
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,910
Stop!

612
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,070
Yun.

613
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,170
Come here.

614
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,510
Get up and talk to me.

615
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,060
Eldest Miss.

616
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,210
Eldest Madam has been tortured by Madam Yue.

617
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,470
She knelt in the Buddhist hall all night.

618
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,840
Eldest Madam was already sick,

619
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,600
but she was even forced to be in the cold and copy sutras.

620
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:47,890
This is literally

621
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,820
driving Eldest Madam to her death!

622
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,870
Yun.

623
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,270
Mother.

624
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,080
Mother.

625
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,980
Mother, why is your leg swollen?

626
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,040
I'm fine. I'm fine.

627
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,300
Just now, Eldest Madam

628
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,730
couldn't even bend her knees or fingers.

629
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,800
It took me a long time to get them better after massaging with medication.

630
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,550
Mother.

631
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,150
I'm fine.

632
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,630
It's only been three days since I left home and got married.

633
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,990
What happened?

634
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,250
Eldest Miss.

635
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,400
These are all misunderstandings.

636
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Last night, it was Eldest Madam

637
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,870
who insisted on kneeling in the Buddhist hall.

638
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,390
She said she was praying for you.

639
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,650
We persuaded her for a long time,

640
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,740
but I saw that she

641
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,290
was sincere,

642
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,680
so we could do nothing.

643
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,020
Eldest Madam didn't want you to worry,

644
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,030
so she wouldn't let me tell you.

645
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,630
It's true.

646
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,420
We didn't mean to hide it.

647
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,470
Nonsense!

648
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,110
You were the one who instigated it.

649
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,120
Enough, Yun.

650
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,510
It's my fault for being gentle with you.

651
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,570
How dare you talk back to your master?

652
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,580
Mother.

653
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,680
Mother.

654
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,030
It was my idea.

655
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,590
Your father and Mother Yue couldn't persuade me.

656
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,590
Don't blame them.

657
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,990
That girl Yun

658
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,270
always makes a fuss over nothing.

659
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,310
I was just exposed to some cold wind.

660
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,110
I'm fine.

661
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,090
That's right.

662
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,140
If you don't believe me,

663
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,840
you can ask the others, like Yuzhao and Yuying.

664
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,340
Eldest Sister.

665
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,000
Yesterday, I even accompanied Mother Yue

666
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,530
to persuade Eldest Mother.

667
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,200
It was really Eldest Mother who insisted on kneeling.

668
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,960
We persuaded her for an hour.

669
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,880
Third Sister.

670
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,480
Am I right?

671
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,890
That's not right.

672
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,090
Second Sister.

673
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,290
Last night,

674
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,100
you were playing with the nine-links puzzle with me.

675
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,830
I've never seen Eldest Mother.

676
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,980
When Father was testing my reading last night,

677
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,030
Mother Yue came to tell Father something

678
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,630
and Father got so angry.

679
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,530
He said he wanted to teach Eldest Mother a lesson.

680
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,010
Then, Mother Yue asked Sister Guixiang

681
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,140
to send me to play with you.

682
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,980
Mao, shut up!

683
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,450
How did you learn to lie

684
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,790
at such a young age?

685
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

686
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

687
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,460
I'm not lying.

688
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm really not lying.

689
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,430
The teacher in the school said

690
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,040
we have to be upright.

691
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,650
I'm telling the truth.

692
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,430
Enough!

693
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,000
Mao, come here.

694
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,190
Be good, Mao.

695
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,280
My lord.

696
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,900
Come out with me for a moment.

697
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,030
Yuru...

698
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,290
Just stay here

699
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,390
and look at the clouds and birds,

700
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,320
or catch crickets,

701
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,380
or do as you please.

702
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,960
The situation has become disastrous.

703
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,840
I have to accompany you.

704
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,730
Gu Jiusi.

705
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,630
This is my family matter.

706
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,210
I can solve it by myself.

707
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:06,840
But...

708
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,850
I'm begging you.

709
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,240
Okay?

710
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,380
Okay.

711
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,250
Yuru.

712
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,570
For such a trivial matter,

713
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,670
do you have to be so relentless

714
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,870
and make such a scene,

715
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,650
to make a fool of our family in front of our good son-in-law?

716
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,340
Father.

717
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,990
How is this a trivial matter?

718
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,250
Today,

719
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,390
if Yun didn’t tell the truth,

720
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,310
I would still

721
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,640
be blind to everything.

722
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:08,790
I wouldn't have known

723
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,650
that Mother had suffered so much.

724
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,580
Enough, Yuru.

725
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,050
It's all in the past.

726
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,350
I'm fine.

727
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,980
Father is afraid of being laughed at.

728
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,990
Don't you think I'm afraid of being laughed at too?

729
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,440
No woman in the world

730
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,040
would want her newlywed husband

731
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,680
to see the ugly side of her family.

732
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,610
But since matters have come to this stage,

733
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,620
how can I be at ease

734
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,370
and keep acting like nothing happened?

735
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,910
Father, Mother,

736
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,350
there's something

737
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,960
that I shouldn't say.

738
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,840
Mother Yue.

739
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,970
You have evil intentions.

740
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,380
You've been causing a lot of trouble in our family.

741
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,450
Now,

742
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,250
not only is she torturing my mother,

743
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,560
but also teaching my sisters

744
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,700
and Mao to lie.

745
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,840
I think...

746
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,219
Mao should

747
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,280
be registered under my mother's name

748
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,659
and be taken care by my mother from now on.

749
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:13,889
No.

750
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,980
Why not?

751
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,510
Mao is still young.

752
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,770
It'll be hard to take care of him.

753
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,040
Besides, Eldest Madam is in poor health.

754
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,760
How can I trouble her?

755
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,500
Mao has started schooling.

756
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,659
He's also usually taken care by the nanny.

757
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,790
How will it be tough?

758
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,270
Mao.

759
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,949
Are you willing?

760
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,380
Yes.

761
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,989
Eldest Mother has many books in her room.

762
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,050
I want to read them.

763
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,610
But Mother Yue never lets me go there.

764
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,120
Mao.

765
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,350
Can you bear to leave me?

766
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,780
No.

767
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,290
Mao

768
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,150
will visit you every day like I do.

769
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,489
It's not like you're separated.

770
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,920
You live under the same roof.

771
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,389
You can see each other every day.

772
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,190
In my opinion,

773
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,190
this is appropriate.

774
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,750
I get it.

775
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,850
You two

776
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,180
are putting up this show

777
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,030
just

778
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,590
to steal my son, right?

779
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,320
Master.

780
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,300
Master.

781
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,930
For so many years,

782
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,620
I've only been concerned for the Liu family

783
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,180
and Master.

784
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,610
I've also always treated Eldest Miss

785
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,800
as my own daughter.

786
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,980
But listen to her

787
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,040
talking nonsense.

788
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,510
Now that she's climbed up the ladder,

789
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,010
she no longer has any regard

790
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,230
for small households like us,

791
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,780
and is bullying us, Master.

792
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,050
Master.

793
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,290
Father.

794
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,870
I'm doing this for Mao's sake.

795
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,950
Mao is upright and reasonable.

796
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,000
He's a good boy.

797
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,250
I can't bear to see him

798
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,120
be taught and led astray by Mother Yue

799
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,560
such that he might go down the wrong path in the future.

800
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,240
Master. Master.

801
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,250
Master. Help me.

802
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,090
Master.

803
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,400
Please help me, Master!

804
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Enough.

805
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,380
Stop crying.

806
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,140
How inappropriate!

807
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,070
Do you still think our family

808
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,800
hasn't been disgraced enough?

809
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,050
Sit down quickly.

810
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,380
And you!

811
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,770
You're just a younger member of the family.

812
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,300
What are you talking about?

813
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,970
It's a matter for the adults.

814
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:30,720
It's not up to you

815
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,320
to make decisions.

816
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,730
Apologize to Mother Yue now!

817
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:41,940
Father.

818
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,940
I've only said good things.

819
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,310
I won't apologize.

820
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,940
Now,

821
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,430
you're the noble Young Madam

822
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,870
of the Gu family.

823
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,850
Even though I'm your father,

824
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,590
I can't control you anymore, is that it?

825
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,560
I'm just my mother's daughter.

826
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,440
I don't want her to suffer.

827
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,570
I can apologize, but only on two conditions.

828
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,430
First, Mother Yue

829
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,170
has to apologize for sowing discord.

830
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,360
Next, Father

831
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,630
has to apologize for not distinguishing right from wrong

832
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,490
from prejudice

833
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,240
and being harsh on your wife.

834
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,700
Master,

835
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,710
listen to her.

836
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,900
She has a distinguished status now.

837
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,560
We can't afford to offend her.

838
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,670
Master,

839
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,560
just give in

840
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,030
and bow down to her.

841
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,920
So what if she's noble?

842
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,810
This is the Liu family after all.

843
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,890
It's the Liu family's matter.

844
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:00,730
You have no right to make accusations!

845
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,780
You're no longer

846
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,250
a member of the Liu family.

847
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,630
You are just a daughter

848
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,760
who's married away.

849
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,880
You're just like splashed water!

850
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,440
What difference has

851
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
my marriage made?

852
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,050
Before, even when I was at home,

853
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,270
I've never received

854
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,400
love from my father!

855
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,660
How dare you talk back?

856
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,510
Is this the great education your mom

857
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,940
had taught you, such that you turned out

858
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,540
so rebellious and unfilial?

859
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,140
Keep in mind,

860
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,490
I'm your father!

861
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,090
Even if you become a lady conferred with an honorary title,

862
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,020
you have to be filial to me forever!

863
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,420
If my father is

864
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,890
a fool who confuses right and wrong,

865
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,190
do I still have to be filial?

866
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,030
Bastard!

867
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,720
Father-in-law!

868
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,940
Sit down, everyone.

869
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,840
My good son-in-law,

870
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,270
I'm sorry we've become a laughing stock.

871
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,580
I shouldn't interfere

872
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,140
when you're lecturing your daughter.

873
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,770
But...

874
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,740
not to mention laying a hand on my lady,

875
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,000
I can't even bear to raise my voice at her.

876
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,360
I hope you'd help me uphold my dignity.

877
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,810
Sure, sure.

878
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,750
Although it's a private matter of the Liu family,

879
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,640
after hearing about it, I'd like to give my opinion.

880
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,360
If Mao is registered under Mother-in-law's name,

881
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,000
he'll become the legitimate son of the Liu family.

882
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,130
This is a good thing.

883
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,790
Why do you want to punish Yuru?

884
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,990
Well...

885
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,520
Actually, I quite like him.

886
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,470
He's smart.

887
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,150
If he is really my brother-in-law,

888
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,150
I will definitely

889
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,380
prepare a job for him.

890
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,990
If he's not,

891
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,320
our Gu family's money

892
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,380
can't be given to outsiders, right?

893
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,170
My good son-in-law, do you mean...

894
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:40,730
I'm a straightforward person.

895
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:41,730
Please pardon me.

896
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,560
What you've said makes sense.

897
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,490
Mao should be raised by the Eldest Mother.

898
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,140
Master.

899
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:51,940
Sit down!

900
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,210
How rude!

901
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,580
Yun.

902
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,950
This is the token of our Gu family.

903
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,440
With it,

904
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,060
you can enter and exit the Gu House as you wish.

905
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,270
From now on, every three days,

906
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,400
pay us a visit to report to Young Madam

907
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,410
about Mother-in-law's situation.

908
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,210
Do you hear me?

909
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,140
[Gu Mansion]

910
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,950
But if I don't see Yun,

911
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,160
I’ll come to visit my mother-in-law in person.

912
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,200
Of course,

913
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,790
my father-in-law won't make the life

914
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,260
of a loyal and protective maid difficult, right?

915
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,610
I won't, I won't.

916
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,100
Yun.

917
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,220
Take good care of Mother-in-law.

918
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,050
Yes.

919
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,710
My lady, it's getting late.

920
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,060
Let's go home.

921
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,140
Mother.

922
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,900
We'll get going.

923
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,870
Father-in-law.

924
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,320
Well,

925
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,380
Liu Yuru,

926
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,110
I did you such a big favor,

927
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,710
but you didn't even thank me.

928
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,050
Are you mad at me?

929
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,690
Yes, I did promise you

930
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,100
to respect your father.

931
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,010
But I really couldn't help it,

932
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,350
I just wanted to mock him.

933
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:57,980
I can't stand it

934
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,310
when he bullies others.

935
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,050
I know

936
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,100
it's not good to pressure others with money.

937
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,560
But that's what he eats up.

938
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,040
I was just dealing with your father.

939
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,770
If it were my father, I would...

940
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:12,830
You smiled?

941
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,110
That's good.

942
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:22,210
Actually,

943
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,710
my father does not treat my mother

944
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,370
and me well at all.

945
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,120
I can see that.

946
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,110
I initially wanted

947
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,830
to cover up the past

948
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,840
and pretend like everything's harmonious

949
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,570
so that Mother can rest assured

950
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,940
and uphold her dignity.

951
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,440
Who would have thought...
