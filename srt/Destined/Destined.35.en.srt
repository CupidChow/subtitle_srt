[Destined]

3
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,030
[Episode 35]

4
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,150
It's like a long dream.

5
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,940
Madam.

6
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,080
Sorry to be a burden to you.

7
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,660
We're family.

8
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,600
Don't say that.

9
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,340
Ruixue.

10
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,340
Go get the physician

11
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,470
from Ningzhou back.

12
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,110
Tell him that Mrs. Liu has recovered

13
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,300
and he needs to prescribe more medicines.

14
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,940
Yes.

15
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,060
Has Gu Jiusi

16
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,990
met his wife?

17
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,260
Your Majesty,

18
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,190
the dam will soon be completed.

19
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,020
They'll meet soon.

20
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,350
Good.

21
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,710
Good to hear that.

22
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,260
You've asked about them every day recently.

23
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,260
You must have been

24
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,120
looking forward to their return.

25
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,829
Yes.

26
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,340
I'm old

27
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,310
and seriously ill.

28
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,850
I fear uncertainties more than anything else.

29
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,070
I just want

30
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,020
to meet those I miss

31
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,870
as soon as possible.

32
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,620
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,980
Your Majesty.

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Administrator Zhou asks to see you.

35
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,900
Let him in.

36
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,829
Yes.

37
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,350
Greetings,

38
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,910
Your Majesty.

39
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,579
Wang Hong.

40
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,220
Leave us.

42
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,620
-Yes.
-Yes.

43
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,420
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,740
Gaolang.

45
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,430
Take a seat.

46
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,940
Has your health improved?

47
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,620
Just the same.

48
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,780
Your Majesty,

49
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,660
have you summoned

50
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,940
the Crown Prince back?

51
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,910
Is this why

52
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,310
you came to see me?

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,390
Yeah.

54
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,300
I'm old.

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,820
My condition is getting worse day by day.

56
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,430
As my son,

57
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,350
the Crown Prince

58
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,510
should come back to take care of me,

59
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,700
shouldn't he?

60
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,909
If you're a normal father,

61
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,700
he should.

62
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,220
But this

63
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,110
is not just your family affair.

64
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,820
The return of the Crown Prince

65
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,500
will be a meaningful move

66
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,710
in the court.

67
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,980
Are you going to

68
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,140
talk about succession again?

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,310
Yes.

70
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,940
Your Majesty.

71
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,780
Over the past three years,

72
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,990
I know you've been unwell,

73
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,710
so I've never voiced my concern

74
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,820
and been careful with what I said.

75
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,020
But my attitude

76
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,750
has never changed.

77
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,570
The Crown Prince is unworthy of the throne.

78
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,650
He shouldn't be summoned back

79
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,070
as the Crown Prince.

80
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,390
Gaolang, you…

81
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,060
The Crown Prince has been repenting in Youzhou

82
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,460
for three years.

83
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,500
For the past three years,

84
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,460
he's been on his best behavior

85
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,060
and studied very hard.

86
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,650
He barely left the house

87
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,830
and has changed a lot.

88
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,950
Besides,

89
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,180
you watched him grow up.

90
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,850
You're not only his subject

91
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,350
but also an elder to him.

92
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,910
How can you despise him so much?

93
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,820
Your Majesty,

94
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,570
it's because I treat the Crown Prince

95
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,130
as my child

96
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,930
that I'm trying to dissuade you.

97
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,180
Your Majesty,

98
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,630
you must not put him

99
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,350
on the throne

100
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,340
and let him rule.

101
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,620
Although the Crown Prince

102
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,740
is your son,

103
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,310
he doesn't have

104
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,770
any of your fine qualities.

105
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,780
Nonsense!

106
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,750
He's my son.

107
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,690
Of course

108
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,820
he has my qualities!

109
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,980
Besides,

110
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,140
everyone makes mistakes when they're young.

111
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,450
Why do you have to latch on to

112
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,909
the Crown Prince's mistake?

113
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,310
You just said

114
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,620
that the Crown Prince has changed a lot.

115
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,980
I'm afraid

116
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,950
that's not true.

117
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,430
Take a look, Your Majesty.

118
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,180
What the Crown Prince

119
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,620
has done and said

120
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,950
in the past three years,

121
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,100
it's all recorded

122
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,140
in this scroll.

123
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,300
[The Crown Prince is dissolute and doesn't follow the etiquettes.]

124
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,000
[He fools around with women, which is very unbecoming of his identity.]

125
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,659
[He swore at the servants and keeps company with devious people.]

126
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,100
Zhou Gaolang.

127
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,470
You sent someone to spy on the Crown Prince?

128
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,710
I'm just worried

129
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,110
that your paternal love may cloud your judgment.

130
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,300
In Youzhou, His Highness

131
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,470
lives a dissolute life

132
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,070
and neglects his studies.

133
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,380
He gets drunk frequently and complains a lot.

134
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,110
What's more,

135
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,380
he's fooling around

136
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,730
with a prostitute.

137
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,710
Zhou Gaolang!

138
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,080
He's the Crown Prince.

139
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,550
You're a subject.

140
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,100
You…

141
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,700
I insist at the risk of my life

142
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,990
because it's my duty as a subject.

143
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,000
But Yu'er is my only son!

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,220
But the Crown Prince

145
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,710
will be the future of Da Xia.

146
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,860
You can't play nepotism!

147
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,380
I deserve to die for saying this,

148
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,110
but I hope

149
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,300
you can choose someone qualified

150
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,220
in the Fan family

151
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,100
to inherit the throne!

152
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,140
You want me

153
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,660
to disinherit my own son

154
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,380
and make someone else's son

155
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,620
the Crown Prince?

156
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,460
Yeah.

157
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,110
I'm indeed different from you.

158
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,630
I only have one son,

159
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,700
but you have many sons.

160
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,020
Disinheriting one son, you still have other choices.

161
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,710
Back then,

162
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,260
I wanted you

163
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,700
to ascend the throne in place of Yu'er

164
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,530
but you refused.

165
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,970
Now you're teaching me

166
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,500
who I should make my heir!

167
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,800
Your Majesty, did you say that

168
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,420
because you suspect me?

169
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,510
I've always been

170
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,030
loyal to you.

171
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,460
How can you think of me like that?

172
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,260
You're pushing me so hard.

173
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,920
What do you expect me to think?

174
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,300
Fine.

175
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Since you distrust me,

176
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,950
I will

177
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,060
just leave.

178
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,140
Leave?

179
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,310
I

180
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,180
spent half of my life on the battlefield

181
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,680
fighting enemies for you.

182
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,020
Now,

183
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,150
I'll just leave for Youzhou

184
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,150
to defend

185
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,590
the northern border for Da Xia.

186
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,180
Gaolang.

187
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,220
Are you

188
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,670
going to leave me too?

189
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,020
I

190
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,080
hold an important position in the court.

191
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,860
With no respect for the young successor,

192
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,190
I'll only get suspected

193
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,100
if I stay in the Eastern Capital.

194
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,430
So I might as well leave.

195
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,980
If I die on the battlefield,

196
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,270
your mind

197
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,790
can be eased

198
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,470
for good.

199
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,940
Ease my mind?

200
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,550
Ease my mind?

201
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,890
Good.

202
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,500
Good.

203
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,270
You might as well leave.

204
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,660
You might as well leave.

205
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,580
I approve.

206
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

207
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,660
I shall take my leave.

208
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,190
Feng'er.

209
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,790
I can take you back to the Eastern Capital.

210
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,640
Your Highness,

211
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,190
I have a sordid past.

212
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,230
I may bring disgrace on you.

213
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,350
Don't worry.

214
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,100
I'm the Crown Prince.

215
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,100
No one dares to

216
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,450
talk about your past.

217
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,250
I don't care about what others say.

218
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:44,850
But what if

219
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,830
His Majesty finds out?

220
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,620
Even when faced with my father,

221
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,290
I won't lie about

222
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,190
who you are.

223
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,910
In the past three years,

224
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,430
I've been depressed

225
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,900
and excruciated.

226
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,380
It's you who helped me

227
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,660
get back on my feet.

228
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,800
No matter what others say,

229
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,800
you're the love of my life.

230
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,020
Six years ago,

231
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,450
when I first met you

232
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,110
in Lanxiao House in Yangzhou,

233
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,990
I could never imagine

234
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,380
that the person I met that day

235
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,860
was the most reliable man

236
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,180
in the world.

237
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,940
Unfortunately,

238
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,420
only you think so.

239
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,460
Otherwise, Father wouldn't

240
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,260
have left me in this remote place

241
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,280
for three years

242
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,960
without any words of concern.

243
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,500
His Majesty just doesn't know you well enough.

244
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
He still sees you as a kid.

245
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,300
Three years have passed.

246
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
He definitely misses you very much.

247
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,540
You must not be angry with him.

248
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,900
I know.

249
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,380
Young Master.

250
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,580
Something's happened.

251
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,700
A worker got injured.

252
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,060
A falling stone broke his leg.

253
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
Has he gotten treated?

254
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,780
Yes.

255
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,980
Don't worry.

256
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,030
But I'm afraid that guy

257
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,220
won't be able to work

258
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,220
to support his family in the future.

259
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,960
The workload is too heavy.

260
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,220
Every worker is doing the work of two.

261
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,280
If this continues,

262
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,080
bigger problems will come up.

263
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,440
How about this?

264
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,930
Give him my two month's salaries

265
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,930
as compensation.

266
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,220
Okay.

267
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,280
Prefect Wang is so bad.

268
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,340
He made all kinds of excuses

269
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,660
not to give us the funds.

270
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,620
He even embezzled the money

271
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,550
to build the dam.

272
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,300
What a heartless viper!

273
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,140
I submitted

274
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,220
so many complaints against him,

275
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,880
but they all went unanswered.

276
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,950
He must have

277
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,700
powerful connections in the Eastern Capital.

278
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,210
The priority now

279
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,470
is to hire more people.

280
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
But how are we going

281
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,060
to pay them?

282
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,980
Are we going

283
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,780
to ask Miss Shiyu for help again?

284
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,060
Although she never

285
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,060
refused to help us,

286
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,060
she earns her money

287
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,100
penny by penny

288
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,360
through hard work too.

289
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,080
But I have no other choice.

290
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:39,700
[Shiyu Store]

291
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,500
Supervisor Gu, please take a seat.

292
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,100
Miss Shiyu will be here soon.

293
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,940
Thank you.

294
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,790
Munan.

295
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,720
Put it down.

296
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,340
Young Master.

297
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,520
Look at this rouge.

298
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,660
It's like Huarong's rouge.

299
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,360
It has a similar smell too.

300
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,080
Supervisor Gu.

301
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,870
Put it back.

302
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,100
Are you looking at the rouge?

303
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,530
I'm Gu Jiusi, the Directorate of Waterways in Yongzhou.

304
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,860
Greetings, Miss Shiyu.

305
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,900
This is the newest product

306
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,660
of Shiyu Store.

307
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,510
It's called Searching for Plum Blossoms.

308
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,380
What a creative and elegant name.

309
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,900
I want a name

310
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,310
that is creative

311
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,230
and elegant.

312
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,690
It can't be too normal

313
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,980
or too obscure.

314
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,870
It should be very catchy

315
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,860
so that when people use rouge,

316
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,060
they think of my shop.

317
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,839
That's the kind of name I want.

318
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,599
Supervisor Gu,

319
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,060
is the lack of money

320
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,260
bothering you again?

321
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,770
It's the first time I visited you.

322
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,050
I should've brought some gifts

323
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,450
to express my gratitude.

324
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,589
But now…

325
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,510
Say no more.

326
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,490
I've asked the accounting office

327
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,890
to prepare 100,000 taels of silver for you.

328
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,220
Thank you, Miss Shiyu.

329
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,910
I'll forever be in your debt.

330
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,140
You're welcome.

331
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,270
Please rise.

332
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,460
Damming the Yellow River

333
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,420
is a great feat that will benefit both the people and our country.

334
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,060
For the well-being of the people,

335
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,660
I'm willing to donate all my family fortune,

336
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,860
let alone just 100,000 taels of silver.

337
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,630
Supervisor Gu,

338
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,120
what are you thinking?

339
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,580
A female merchant

340
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,350
once said

341
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,310
similar things before.

342
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,230
But she passed away.

343
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,960
Your words reminded me of her.

344
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,910
Miss Shiyu.

345
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,550
He's left.

346
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,750
Why didn't you

347
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,740
meet him yourself?

348
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,220
He must be missing you

349
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,300
day and night.

350
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,310
In the past three years,

351
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,810
I've been missing him

352
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,470
day and night too.

353
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,230
But I have to wait.

354
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,180
Only when the dam of the Yellow River is completed

355
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,590
to the benefit of all,

356
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,120
when he makes great achievements

357
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,350
and gets the honor he deserves,

358
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,180
can we meet again.

359
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:03,640
[Peace and Tranquil]

360
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,700
Your Majesty.

361
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,300
It's been long

362
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,580
since you last played chess with Administrator Zhou.

363
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,570
Do you want me

364
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,590
to summon him?

365
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,510
Forget it.

366
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,030
Recently,

367
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,580
he's been on medical leave and wouldn't come to court.

368
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,460
Even if he comes here,

369
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,980
he gets nothing to say to me.

370
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,140
What's the point of summoning him?

371
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,340
Back then,

372
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,270
when I wasn't on the throne,

373
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,110
I had brothers

374
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,420
who went through thick and thin with me,

375
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,220
a son

376
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,740
who cared about me,

377
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,740
and friends

378
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,700
who brought me lots of joy.

379
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,830
I always know

380
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,800
that sitting on the throne

381
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,420
means being lonely.

382
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,580
However,

383
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,560
only when my days are numbered

384
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,350
did I realize

385
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,980
that loneliness

386
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,860
is actually so bitter and agonizing.

387
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220

They're two diamonds in the rough.

578
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,420
They're

579
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,040
the most important two pieces

580
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,180
on my chess board.

581
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,780
[Lingnan]

582
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:33,750
[Yongzhou]

583
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,100
[Yongzhou]

584
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,750
It's full. Go.

585
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,430
Go.

586
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,800
Be careful.

587
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,630
One, two.

588
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,480
Put it here.

589
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,420
Put it here.

590
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,480
Be careful.

591
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,670
This way.

592
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,140
[Shiyu Store]

593
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,350
Here.

594
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,940
No matter how much he needs for the dam,

595
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,060
just give him.

596
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,340
Tell the accounting office

597
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,020
that the donation money

598
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,300
should be given to Supervisor Gu

599
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,310
without delay.

600
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,300
Yes.

601
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,960
[Yongzhou]

602
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,080
When these two diamonds in the rough

603
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,440
[Yongzhou]

604
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,990
are reunited,

605
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,860
they'll be

606
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,660
the pillar of Da Xia.

607
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,990
Here goes the imperial edict.

608
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,960
The treasury case has finally been solved.

609
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,880
[Mercy and Kindness]

610
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,260
Corrupt officials like Lu Yong were brought to justice.

611
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,740
Most of the money they embezzled

612
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,340
has been reclaimed.

613
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,470
In charge of this case,

614
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,820
Official Ye made great contributions.

615
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,350
His Majesty feels relieved

616
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,340
and appoints Official Ye as the Minister of Revenue

617
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,250
with the salary of a second-rank official.

618
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,780
The end.

619
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,750
With respect,

620
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,760
I take the imperial edict.

621
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,340
Congratulations, Minister Ye.

622
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,190
Minister Ye, please get up.

623
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,800
You're not the only one gotten promoted in your family.

624
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,590
What do you mean?

625
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,780
Ye Yun, your sister,

626
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,340
invented the Miracle Powder

627
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,300
that can cure sword wounds and fever.

628
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,960
It saved countless soldiers.

629
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,790
His Majesty is elated

630
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,140
and lauded her unrivaled expertise in herbal medicine.

631
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,890
She's been given the title Hanlin Medical Master.

632
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,580
The imperial edict

633
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,300
has been sent

634
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,960
to the front line of Bingzhou.

635
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,260
I didn't know my sister made such a great achievement.

636
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,990
It's an achievement

637
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,980
that will keep benefiting countless people.

638
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,989
Exactly.

639
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,780
Many great things

640
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,620
have happened in Da Xia recently.

641
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,630
We won the war in Yuzhou.

642
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,610
[Mercy and Kindness]

643
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,820
Zhou Ye, the Commander-in-chief, was promoted

644
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,810
to second-rank official

645
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,500
and awarded the title Grand General Pacifying the South.

646
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,840
Deputy General Qin Wanzhi

647
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,659
was promoted

648
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,540
to third-rank official and awarded the title General Embodying Martial Prowess.

649
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,739
What about Shen Ming?

650
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,940
I heard that he killed lots of enemies

651
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,139
on the battlefield.

652
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,480
His Majesty rewarded him too.

653
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,800
His Majesty

654
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,810
has made him

655
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,340
General Guarding the Far-away Territories.

656
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,380
They intimidated the enemy

657
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,510
and boosted morale.

658
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,730
Looks like you've accepted

659
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,860
General Shen as your brother-in-law.

660
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,100
That's a different matter.

661
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:47,389
We'll see about that.

662
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,469
[Mercy and Kindness]

663
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,540
Yeah.

664
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,590
These young and accomplished

665
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,510
officials

666
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,300
should be rewarded.

667
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,580
One more thing.

668
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,300
The feat of damming the Yellow River

669
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,950
will go down in history.

670
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,940
But the man

671
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,250
supervising the construction of the dam in Yongzhou

672
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,700
is Gu Jiusi

673
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,190
who was expelled from the Eastern Capital three years ago.

674
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,990
Officials,

675
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,310
in your opinion,

676
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,180
how should he be rewarded?

677
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,220
Your Majesty,

678
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,250
although I took the credit

679
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,510
for the treasury case,

680
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,030
it was Gu Jiusi

681
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,380
who started the investigation.

682
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,430
Without him,

683
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,760
this case would've stayed unsolved.

684
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,660
So I think

685
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,540
the rewards

686
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,510
you gave me

687
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,030
should be given to Gu Jiusi.

688
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,500
Deputy Minister Luo.

689
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

690
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,340
You've been quiet

691
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,870
in the court recently.

692
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,120
Tell me what you think.

693
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,190
I dare not overstep my boundaries.

694
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,810
The decision shall be left entirely to you.

695
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,260
What if

696
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,240
I insist on you saying something?

697
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,900
Damming the Yellow River

698
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,180
is a great feat.

699
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,940
Gu Jiusi made such a great contribution

700
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,660
and should be generously rewarded.

701
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,630
I think

702
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,480
he should be summoned back

703
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,820
and reinstated

704
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,950
as the Deputy Minister of Revenue.

705
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,620
You have a point.

706
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,900
Then

707
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,750
after the dam is completed,

708
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,780
I will

709
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,550
appoint Gu Jiusi as Left Counsellor.

710
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,520
He'll be

711
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,180
the head of the six Ministers,

712
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,700
assisting the emperor

713
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,830
and leading all the officials.

714
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,660
Everything will be under unified governance

715
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,860
to achieve efficient administration.

716
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,180
It's a wise decision, Your Majesty.

717
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,060
All right.

718
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,870
We've talked about the good news.

719
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,640
Now let's talk about the bad news.

720
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,460
Since Princess Yunchang

721
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,310
was married off,

722
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,300
Empress Dowager

723
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,870
has been unwell.

724
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,290
Deputy Minister Luo,

725
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
Empress Dowager sees you as her son.

726
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,060
How is she now?

727
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,180
I know

728
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,070
you're very filial.

729
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,350
You must be very worried.

730
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,110
Then say no more.

731
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,700
How about this?

732
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,780
Deputy Minister Luo,

733
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,740
from tomorrow onwards,

734
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,550
you don't have to come to the morning court again.

735
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,830
Just

736
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,060
go take care of Empress Dowager

737
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,270
at her bedside.

738
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,430
Thank you,

739
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,910
Your Majesty.

740
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,900
During the three years

741
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,830
we worked today,

742
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,220
on the surface,

743
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,870
you helped me a lot.

744
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,950
But in fact,

745
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,260
I hit wall after wall

746
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,110
on the verge of success.

747
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,590
It turns out

748
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,060
that Minister Jiang is a spy

749
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,470
planted by my side by Gu Jiusi.

750
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,950
You're so good at disguising.

751
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,100
You taught me a great lesson.

752
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,830
Deputy Minister Luo,

753
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,340
if I say

754
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,590
I never lied to you,

755
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,950
will you believe me?

756
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,580
You're a very smart person.

757
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,390
Only you

758
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,180
can deceive you.

759
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,310
Minister Jiang,

760
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,200
no need to be smooth at this point.

761
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,550
I'm not a tactless person.

762
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,940
If I lose,

763
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,270
I lose.

764
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,110
I won't put up a meaningless struggle.

765
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,830
What are your plans for the future?

766
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,750
Just leave the court

767
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,750
and idle around for the rest of my life.

768
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,030
It won't be that easy.

769
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,740
The free pass you got at the time of unrest

770
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,450
by the surrender of Yangzhou

771
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,710
has expired.

772
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,510
Now we live in peace.

773
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,910
Your collusion with Wang Shanquan

774
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,300
and the massacre in Yangzhou

775
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,260
will be brought up very soon.

776
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,710
By then,

777
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,440
no matter where you go,

778
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,910
you'll be

779
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,140
hunted down eventually.

780
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,540
No one can help you.

781
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,910
Minister Jiang,

782
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,270
are you worried about me?

783
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,670
Forget it.

784
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,660
You've done too many terrible things.

785
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,460
There's no turning back for you.

786
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,310
Since you want to stop,

787
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,700
I'll help you.

788
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,160
Go somewhere far away.

789
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,910
Somewhere overseas is better.

790
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,470
Find a place

791
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,830
where no one can find you.

792
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,950
Thank you. Farewell.

793
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,700
My lord,

794
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,420
should Baiyujing

795
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
keep an eye on him?

796
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,540
No need.

797
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:25,860
Let him go.

798
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,420
If he does evil deeds again,

799
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,270
I'll

800
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,260
kill him myself.

801
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,580
The dam is completed?

802
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,030
Really?

803
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,180
Yes.

804
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,470
We just got the news.

805
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,740
He made it.

806
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,110
He really made it.

807
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,790
Building the dam

808
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,070
is a great feat

809
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,780
that will go down the history.

810
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,660
In the future,

811
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
he'll be deeply loved by the people.

812
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,880
No one can defame him anymore.

813
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,500
Why do you

814
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,630
look even prouder than Supervisor Gu?

815
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,160
There's something

816
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,180
I've never mentioned to you

817
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,380
in the past few years.

818
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,260
Gu Jiusi

819
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,700
is my husband.

820
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,800
Of course I'm proud of him.

821
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,830
One more thing.

822
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,670
My real name

823
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,060
is Liu Yuru.

824
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,390
From now on,

825
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,310
you can also call me Boss Liu.
