On the third day of March,

Lord Liang, the rebel was executed.

57
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,080
Empress Dowager led the officials to open the palace gate

59
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,320
His era was named Da Xia.

60
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,230
Since then, a new reign began.

61
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,690

For the rebuilding of Wangdu,

70
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,440
the two of you donated everything again?

71
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,120
Out of all the women I've met, Yuru

72
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720
is the best at earning money,

73
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,820
and the best at spending them too.

74
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,680
But we're happy

75
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,630
to spend this money.

77
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,180
Wangdu is my hometown.

78
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,420
You risked your life to protect my hometown.

79
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,220
In the future,

80
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,190
I won't hesitate to risk my life for you.

81
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,250
Alright. Alright.

82
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,310
Zhou, look at you.

83
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,730
Don’t be so polite to me.

84
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,990
I'm not being polite.

85
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,840
I really feel bad.

86
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,120
Wangdu is your hometown.

87
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,590
But now,

88
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,140
it's also the second hometown

89
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,190
for Yuru and me.

90
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,220
Zhou,

91
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,790
you must have paid a price

92
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,650
for bringing the troops back to help us, right?

93
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,630
What price?

94
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,760
Let's not talk about this.

95
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,760
Was Commissioner Fan unwilling?

96
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,850
How could he be unwilling?

97
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,240
He loves his people as his children. You know that.

98
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
How could he

99
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,300
have given up on Wangdu?

100
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,500
That means General Zhou was unwilling.

101
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,300
Jiusi.

102
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,060
He is my father.

103
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,170
He won't do anything to me.

104
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,180
Come on, drink.

105
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,390
Zhou,

106
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,690
you are an honest man.

107
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,170
So it's very obvious

108
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,730
when you lie.

109
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,680
I really cannot hide

110
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,740
anything from you.

111
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,800
He dismissed my military power

112
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,110
and told me to retire.

113
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,810
I know.

114
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,910
He never took me seriously

115
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,170
ever since I was young.

116
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,610
But I didn't expect

117
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,340
that I was not fit to be a general

118
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,970
in his heart.

119
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,280
It's our day of victory,

120
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,740
let's not talk about

121
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,830
such an unhappy thing.

122
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,750
Let's talk about something happy.

123
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,720
Let's drink.

124
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,870
Well...

125
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,600
Let's talk about something happy.

126
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,860
Yes.

127
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,640
Then...

128
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,990
How is Miss Qin?

129
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,860
What do you mean?

130
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,870
What do I mean?

131
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,420
Miss Qin!

132
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,190
Isn't she

133
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,870
the daughter of Commander-in-chief Qin,

134
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,430
the one you father wanted you to marry?

135
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,930
Yes.

136
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,240
You two are destined

137
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,090
and you are like old friends at first sight.

138
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,850
When can I

139
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,030
call her sister-in-law?

140
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,230
Don't talk nonsense.

141
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,550
We are

142
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,190
like comrades.

143
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Besides, you saw it too.

144
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,160
On the battlefield,

145
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,880
our cooperation

146
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,840
was seamless.

147
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,770
After we got off the battlefield,

148
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,830
we became sworn siblings in two days.

149
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,300
Sworn siblings?

150
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,600
Sworn siblings!

151
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,180
Yes.

152
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,860
So you're in stage two already.

153
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,250
I'm familiar with the procedure.

154
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,250
What is stage two?

155
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,910
Stage one, you reluctantly negotiate the marriage.

156
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,050
Then, you become sworn siblings.

157
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,050
Stage three, she becomes your wife.

158
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,450
I have experience in this.

159
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,620
I've been there before.

160
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,130
Jiusi.

161
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,890
She's ambitious.

162
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,700
She wants to be a general forever.

163
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,170
Let's not talk about this. Let's drink.

164
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,630
Here.

165
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,990
It's no problem.

166
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,630
Have another drink.

167
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,730
Soon.

[Tie the Red Sash and Carry the Gold Stamp]

169
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:32,910
I can't believe it.

170
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,500
How dare you become sworn siblings

171
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,160
with Zhou without us knowing?

172
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,530
As punishment, you must drink.

173
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,730
You must be punished.

174
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,480
Yes, you should be punished.

175
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,840
Fine, I accept the punishment.

176
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,160
It's nothing special

177
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,170
getting along with men.

178
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,430

179
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,660
You are all heroines.

180
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,920
We've experienced

181
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,340
life and death together this time.

182
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,350
If you don't mind,

183
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,330
the three of us can become sworn sisters.

184
00:11:59,330 --> 00:11:59,960
What do you think?

185
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,500
Sure.

186
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,190
You call Sister Yuru

187
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,160
by her name.

188
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,850
But why do you call me Young Miss Ye?

189
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,430
Yun'er.

190
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,280
Yun'er.

191
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,710
Alright?

192
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,000
That's more like it.

193
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,860
Actually, I envy you, Sister Qin.

194
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,130
You can slay enemies on the battlefield.

195
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,270
You're just like my grandmother

196
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,330
when she was young.

197
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,720
Your grandmother was a female general too?

198
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,610
When my grandmother was 15，

199
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,340
she led an army and won a battle.

200
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,300
Unfortunately,

201
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,600
when she was 20,

202
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,360
she became a wife and a mother,

203
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,620
and never joined the battlefield again.

204
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,180
Is your grandmother

205
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,460
the famous general of the garrison,

206
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,470
Liang Qingyu?

207
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,110
Liang Qingyu is my grandmother's given name.

208
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,000
Sister Qin.

209
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,090
How did you know?

210
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,410
Of course I know.

211
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,460
I grew up listening to her stories.

212
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,020
I aspired to serve the military

213
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,490
because I was inspired by her.

214
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,450
I didn't expect

215
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,050
to be sworn sisters

216
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,100
with her descendant.

217
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,820
It's like a dream come true!

218
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,800
But...

219
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,470
I'm nowhere as impressive.

220
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,250
No way.

221
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,880
General Liang's descendants

222
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,640
can never be too bad.

223
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,270
Exactly.

224
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,070
All three of us are pretty impressive.

225
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,770
Let's drink.

226
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,300
That's right. Let's drink.

227
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:18,960
Let's drink.

228
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,460
Here.

229
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,140
Congratulations on the wedding, Boss Liu.

230
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,750
What are you doing?

231
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,030
We have already shared the cross-cupped wine.

232
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,890
The next step is

233
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,350
to take you to the bridal chamber.

234
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,640
Liu Yuru, Boss Liu, Fairy Yuru.

235
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,410
As your husband,

236
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,920
can I make two

237
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,490
unreasonable requests?

238
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,040
What requests?

239
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,510
In this life,

240
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,080
you will only love me.

241
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,300
♫Caressing this springtime feeling♫

242
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,530
♫The lake reflects your eyes like a mirror♫

243

What about the other one?

244
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,980
From now on,

245
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,980
♫Who writes letters♫

Jiusi.

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,510
I will always be with you.

263

Your soothing medicinal decoction

264
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,140
is too bitter.

265
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,980
The past few days,

266
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,160
I couldn't sleep

267
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,420
because I was worried.

268
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,440
Now that Wangdu is secured and

269
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,320
Jiusi and Yuru

270
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,460
are both safe.

271
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,500
I don't need to take the medicine anymore.

272
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,370
Madam,

273
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,210
I brought you something sweet

274
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,270
to wash down the medicine with today.

275
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,070
Your dried persimmons

276
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,460
and candied fruits were all useless.

277
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,790
The medicine was still bitter in my mouth.

278
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,960
What are you laughing at?

279
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,840
Congratulations, Madam.

280
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,440
Young Master and Young Madam

281
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,960
finally consummated their marriage.

282
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,550
You're not lying, right?

283
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,050
Why would I lie to you?

284
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,450
It's true.

285
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,880
Really?

286
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,420
Hurry up.

287
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,000
Give me the medicine.

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,920
From now on,

289
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,480
I'll take good care of my health.

290
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,490
I have to live a long life.

291
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,740
In the future,

292
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,620
I have to hold my grandchildren.

293
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,640
In the future,

294
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,990
this family will surely be lively.

295
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,680
You should rest early too.

296
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,930
Get up early tomorrow

297
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,960
and prepare some

298
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,490
nourishing stuff for Yuru.

299
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,430
Yes.

300
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,530
Rest early, Madam.

301
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,320
Look.

302
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,300
Heaven is really nice to us.

303
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,460
The children are sensible,

304
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,070
our family is harmonious,

305
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,760
and we have survived

306
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,030
all those hardships.

307
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,170
Langhua,

308
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,860
have you heard?

309
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,829
Langhua.

310
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,270
You must have seen it too.

311
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,350
The children

312
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,680
have really grown up.

313
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,740
They can support this family now.

314
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,730
I'll take care of myself too.

315
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,590
Everything in the Gu family

316
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,580
will get better.

317
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,240
The Deputy Minister of Revenue?

318
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,290
You contributed the most

319
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,550
to Wangdu's safety.

320
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,750
This is only natural.

321
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,910
Mr. Ye and Shen Ming

322
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,990
have both been appointed too.

323
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,980
Zhou.

324
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,840
What about you?

325
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,880
I will go to Eastern Capital too.

326
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,310
His Majesty appointed me as

327
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,840
the Commandant of Fleet-as-clouds Cavalry.

328
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,600
The Commandant of Fleet-as-clouds Cavalry.

329
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,900
But that is just

330
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,420
a figurehead title.

331
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,020
Did your father really make up his mind

332
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,820
to stop you from leading troops?

333
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,930
No matter what,

334
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,240
I won't regret it.

335
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:36,680
Jiusi.

336
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,550
You're all here.

337
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,950
Have you heard?

338
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,320
Qin Wanzhi from Bingzhou

339
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,680
was made an exception to be a general.

340
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
A female general!

341
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,590
How many years has it been since there was one?

342
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,430
Is it true?

343
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,680
She deserves it.

344
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,290
Not only that,

345
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,540
she is now

346
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,730
the chief commandant of Bingzhou.

347
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,950
She's in charge of 100,000 soldiers in Bingzhou.

348
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,550
She happens to be the immediate superior

349
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,810
of her father, Commander-in-chief Qin.

350
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,940
It's a strange thing for the daughter

351
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,000
to give orders to the father instead.

352
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,590
It seems His Majesty did it on purpose.

353
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:15,990
Why?

354
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,500
Commander-in-chief Qin

355
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,160
didn’t send troops to Wangdu.

356
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,190
He should be punished.

357
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,030
But his daughter

358
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,500
was loyal, courageous, and made great contributions.

359
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,800
She should be rewarded.

360
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,440
If you reward the daughter and punish the father,

361
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,240
it is immoral.

362
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,960
Since the new reign has just begun,

363
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,050
he cannot be too harsh

364
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,100
to any states either.

365
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,700
That's why

366
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,410
His Majesty asked General Qin to be

367
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,850
the immediate superior of Commander-in-chief Qin.

368
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,070
This way, her father

369
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,250
will feel ashamed.

370
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,400
It's a high-profile yet light punishment. What a smart move.

371
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,800
He showed both mercy and authority.

372
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,660
That's the sign of a wise emperor.

373
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,380
[Youzhou]

374
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,090
Magistrate Gu is here!

375
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
-Magistrate Gu!
-Magistrate Gu!

376
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,660
Magistrate Gu is here.

377
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,670
Magistrate Gu.

378
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,700
Magistrate Gu, thank you.

379
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,590
Have a safe journey.

380
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,570
Safe journey.

381

Please get up.

Please get up.

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,320
I can't accept this.

Magistrate Gu.

385
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,720
We heard that

you are going to the Eastern Capital.

387
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,640
So we came to see you off.

388

Thank you for saving Wangdu

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,430
and all of us.

397
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,460
would like to thank everyone too.

Thank you.

399
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,180
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

400
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,810
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

401
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,780
Magistrate Gu.

402
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,490
Thank you.

403
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,420
You are a good official

404
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,730
who loves the people like your own son.

405
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,040
Even if you go to Eastern Capital,

the people of Wangdu

407
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,770
will never forget

408
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,580
your kindness.

409
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,220
We will never forget

We will never forget

your kindness.

413
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,780
Speaking of kindness,

414
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,840
Youzhou took me in first.

415
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,310
This place

416
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,960
is my second hometown.

417
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,930
Fellow folks and elders,

418
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,600
we'll meet again.

419
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,650
See you.

420
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,100
See you.

and Shen Ming

to the hall to be appointed.

427
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,130
I, Gu Jiusi.

428
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,020
I, Ye Shi'an.

429
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,490
I, Shen Ming.

430
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

431
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,320
Announce the decree.

432
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,580
During the battle in Wangdu,

433
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,650
the group of you defeated the rebels and captured their leader.

434
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,250
You defended Wangdu and protected the people.

435
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,850
You have done well.

436
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,090
I hereby promote Gu Jiusi, Wangdu Magistrate,

437
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,980
to Deputy Minister of Revenue.

438
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,000
I promote Ye Shi'an, Jiangnan scholar,

439
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,870
[Lu Yong]

440
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,610
to 7th rank Right Remonstrator.

441
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,710
I promote Shen Ming, accompanying Youzhou Deputy Commandant,

442
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,140
to 6th rank

443
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,080
Palace-front Commandant of Cavalry.

444
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,890
You shall be appointed to these positions.

445
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,320
Respect this.

446
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

447
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,830
Mother, do you believe it now?

448
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,320
Of course.

449
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,380
Before Jiusi went to the palace to be appointed,

450
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,570
I didn't believe that he actually became

451
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,950
the Deputy Minister of Revenue.

452
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,960
I kept thinking

453
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,510
it was some kind of joke.

454
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,650
How is this a joke?

455
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm really capable.

456
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,060
Look at you, so full of yourself.

457
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,030
Think about it.

458
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,420
Whose credit is it?

459
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,490
Before you married Yuru,

460
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,130
my biggest hope was for you

461
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,030
to stay out of trouble for life.

462
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,530
I think

463
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,290
even if you add 10,000 of you together,

464
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,020
you won't be as capable as Yuru.

465
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,650
Yes, yes.

466
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,110
How can I compare with her?

467
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,050
She is the most capable one

468
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,270
in our family.

469
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,370
She's not as good as you said.

470
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,720
Jiusi is the capable one.

471
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,200
Mother.

472
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,340
It was all thanks to Jiusi.

473
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,810
He is capable.

474
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,600
I didn't do anything.

475
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,570
But don't worry, Mother.

476
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,740
Jiusi has become the Deputy Minister of Revenue.

477
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,540
Our family has moved to Eastern Capital.

478
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,890
I can't lag behind either.

479
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,950
I'll go out to look for a shop tomorrow

480
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,210
and continue my Huarong operation here.

481
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,020
I want to expand my business

482
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,450
and make our family

483
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,710
the richest family in our dynasty again.

484
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:16,920
Mother.

485
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,720
What's wrong?

486
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,970
Our family is reunited today.

487
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,060
I'm happy.

488
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,790
But,

489
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,050
somehow.

490
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,870
I suddenly thought of your uncle.

491
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,590
The imperial prison

492
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,280
is a terrible place.

493
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,080
I wonder

494
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,850
how he's doing inside,

495
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,110
and if he's being bullied.

496
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,620
It's likely inevitable

497
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,780
that he suffers from hunger and cold.

498
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,490
Nianming lived in comfort

499
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,100
since he was young.

500
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,040
He had never suffered like this before.

501
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,620
Mother.

502
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,050
Don't worry.

503
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,600
When we settle down,

504
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,940
I'll find a chance to get some information

505
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,930
to see what His Majesty's attitude

506
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,930
towards Uncle is.

507
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,240
Then, we'll find a way

508
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,900
to save Uncle from the prison.

509
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,010
Good boy.

00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,120
You have no foundation in Eastern Capital right now.

Don't act recklessly.

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,770
His Majesty thinks highly of you.

513
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,030
It is already very forgiving of him

514
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,590
to not consider the relationship

515
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,650
between Lord Liang and the Gu family.

516
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,540
Don't worry.

517
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,660
I understand.

Without my permission,

545
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,690
without the cooperation of the officials,

546
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,240
would Fan Xuan have so easily

acquired the throne?

572
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,010
young officials from Youzhou to join the Six Ministries.

573
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,100
Especially Gu Jiusi.

574
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,530
He became the Deputy Minister of Revenue

575
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,260
at such a young age.

576
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,820
If you're really worried,

577
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,630
why don't you listen to me

578
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,280
and advance with a retreat?

579
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,970
Please enlighten me.

580
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,120
His Majesty's current attitude

581
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,500
is clearly to make peace

582
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,640
with the old ministers.

583
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,670
You can request His Majesty

584
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,440
to order the Deputy Minister of Revenue's relatives

585
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,900
to give up doing business,

586
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,480
to show loyalty to the new policy of the new dynasty,

587
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,580
and expel the former dynasty's flaw

588
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,310
of collusion between government and businesses.

589
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,530
If you do that, I'm sure

590
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,120
His Majesty can see

591
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,930
your sincerity.

592
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,490
Your Majesty.

593
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,060
When Gu Jiusi left Wangdu,

594
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,160
everyone in the city

595
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,670
saw him off for miles.

596
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,640
Have you heard about it, Your Majesty?

597
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,880
This is a good thing.

598
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,250
I don't think so.

599
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,480
Your Majesty.

600
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,750
Gu Jiusi's current reputation

601
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,590
is so good, it's blinding.

602
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,160
So many people struggled

603
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
and fought their entire life

604
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,730
for fame and fortune.

605
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Now,

606
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,880
he got them easily.

607
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,660
I'm worried that

608
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,250
his early success and pride

609
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,640
will develop into

610
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,450
a terrible and unimaginable

611
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,260
ambition in the future.

612
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,920
As the saying goes, doubt not the people you employ.

613
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,890
Young people like Gu Jiusi

614
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,080
are smart and determined.

615
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,380
They are earnest and willing to work hard.

616
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,850
Besides, he has a heart

617
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,120
that cares about the people.

618
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,440
He deserves the responsibility.

619
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,220
The old ministers in the court

620
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,940
are full of conflicting interests.

621
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,540
Although they claim to serve the Emperor,

622
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,300
they each have their own intentions.

623
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,600
You and I are old friends.

624
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,200
I'm sure we both understand.

625
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,770
The court of Da Xia

626
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,500
needs fresh blood

627
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,590
like Gu Jiusi.

628
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,830
You're right, Your Majesty.

629
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,680
The one you should be most cautious of right now

630
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,860
is not Gu Jiusi,

631
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,460
who still has a long way to go.

632
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,060
Those sly old ministers

633
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,190
with their strong backing

634
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,920
are the most troublesome ones.

635
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,250
It's not difficult to govern the state.

636
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,170
We cannot offend the big families.

637
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,350
Now the most important thing

638
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,320
for Da Xia

639
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,840
is to recuperate.

640
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,060
The country has been in chaos for a long time.

641
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,990
It cannot withstand another wave.

642
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,800
No matter what those old ministers

643
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,400
are thinking,

644
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,250
or what evil intentions they have,

645
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,460
we should gather them

646
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,640
together for now

647
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,700
and let Da Xia settle down first.

648
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,820
As for the new recruits from Youzhou,

649
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,620
let them grow gradually.

650
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,590
Sooner or later,

651
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,870
they will grow into massive trees

652
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,470
and replace this tangle of roots right now.

653
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,300
But Your Majesty,

654
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,500
it's easier said than done.

655
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,700
This matter

656
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,840
can't be achieved overnight.

657
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,120
I wonder if the two of us

658
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:43,830
will live

659
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,630
long enough to witness that day.

660
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,380
Look at you, so dramatic.

661
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,010
There's no rush.

662
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,510
Let's take our time.

663
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,030
If we can't accomplish it

664
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,210
in our lifetime,

665
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,760
we can

666
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,400
let our descendants do it.

667
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,960
Let Yu'er do it.

668
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,670
Your Majesty.

669
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,840
I have something to say.

670
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,660
Don't get mad about it.

671
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,940
At Yu'er's age,

672
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,540
we've already joined the military

673
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,270
and slain enemies.

674
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,620
He will eventually take over the throne.

675
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,060
If he can't establish himself

676
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,900
and we're already so old...

677
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,120
Gaolang.

678
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,390
Alright.

679
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,690
Let's not talk about Yu'er.

680
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,380
Here...

681
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,990
I've read your merit proposal.

682
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,090
You suggested dispatching Ran'er and Zhuo'er

683
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,180
to Youzhou

684
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,780
to guard Youzhou and Yumen Pass

685
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,580
in our stead.

686
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,300
I fully approve of this.

687
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,110
But why don't I see

688
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,000
Ye'er's name

689
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,050
in your proposal?

690
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,100
The three of them

691
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,360
are all your children.

692
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,450
Why are you

693
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,850
not treating them equally?

694
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,830
He is an unfilial and rebellious son.

695
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,880
In the past,

696
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,860
he was always too considerate and benevolent.

697
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,500
This time,

698
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,150
he disobeyed the military order first.

699
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,490
Even if he had contributed to the safety of Wangdu,

700
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,420
it only made up for his wrongdoing.

701
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,930
So I thought

702
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,160
to give him a useless job

703
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,010
and let him reflect on himself.

704
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:26,900
You.

705
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,670
Don't be too harsh.

706
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,690
Ye'er is kind-hearted, loyal,

707
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,990
and a man of his word.

708
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,250
He's a good child.

709
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,270
Let's not talk about the future.

710
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,910
Let's talk about the present.

711
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,050
If he didn't disobey the military order,

712
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,110
we would have lost Wangdu to the enemies.

713
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,240
Could the two of us

714
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,960
really feel at ease?

715
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,710
As a father,

716
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,390
you always have

717
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,660
too much bias against Ye'er.

718
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,010
Even an outsider like me

719
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,390
can see it clearly.

720
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,380
Forget it.

721
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,790
Since

722
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,310
Ye'er has stayed in Eastern Capital

723
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,570
and received his duty,

724
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,780
you should stop

725
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,710
being mad at him.

726
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Give him a chance.

727
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,400
Maybe

728
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,920
he can make some achievements.

729
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,630
What do you think?

730
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,350
Fine.

731
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,530
I'll listen to

732
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,870
what Your Majesty says.

733
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,199
Oh, you.

734
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,530
[List of Transfer]

735
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,970
What is this nonsense?

736
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,410
That unfilial Zhou Ye

737
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,960
is hopeless.

738
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,870
General.

739
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,900
Calm down.

740
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
See for yourself.

741
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,800
He's weak-tempered

742
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,260
and ill-fitted to be a general. That's fine.

743
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,970
I gave him a useless job so he'd reflect on his mistakes.

744
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,310
But he couldn't even handle these

745
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,710
trivial matters in the military properly.

746
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,390
Da Xia has just been established.

747
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,950
[List of Transfer]

748
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,680
The world is still unsettled.

749
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,390
Internal and external threats are just waiting to strike.

750
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,820
We need the Youzhou troops

751
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,740
to be prepared to fight now

752
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,130
more than ever.

753
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,140
Yet here he is,

754
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,550
asking to let 30% of the soldiers return to their hometowns.

755
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,180
Cheng Quan?

756
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,940
Cheng Quan!

757
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,190
General.

758
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,280
What's wrong?

759
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,520
I really miss home.

760
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,100
Has it been three years?

761
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,070
Two years and eleven months.

762
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,800
When I joined the battle against the Liang rebels,

763
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,420
my grandson was just one month old.

764
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,070
Now, he's three years old.

765
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,950
I wonder

766
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,090
if he can

767
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,570
recognize me, his grandfather?

768
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,540
General.

769
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,440
If the soldier is the only son of his family,

770
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,040
he is allowed to return home.

771
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,680
If both father and son or brothers are in the military,

772
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,570
one of them is allowed to return home

773
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,830
to tend to the farm.

774
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,550
Where is

775
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,810
Zhou Ye right now?

776
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,010
Will Commander-in-chief

777
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,480
really let us go home?

778
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,500
I miss my mother.

779
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,970
How old are you already?

780
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,830
Be more useful.

781
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,220
You don't want to go home?

782
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,720
I don't believe it.

783
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,890
Of course I want to go home.

784
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,950
My parents

785
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,290
only have one son.

786
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,470
Yes, I want to go home too.

787
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,200
It's okay.

788
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,020
If we fail once,

789
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,680
we just need to

790
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,310
appeal a few more times.

791
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,340
Junior General.

792
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,310
Don't do that.

793
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,730
If you anger the Commander-in-chief,

794
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,870
you will be scolded again.

795
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,370
Yes.

796
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,290
Yes.

797
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,020
How much could my father's scolding

798
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
possibly hurt me?

799
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,790
Right?

800
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,220
Anyway, whether I can go back or not,

801
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,820
I'll remember your kindness, Junior General.

802
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,330
How many times have I told you?

803
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,350
I'm not a general anymore.

804
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,300
Everyone's families only survived because

805
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,900
you fought with your life on the line

806
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,830
to defend Wangdu and protect them.

807
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,050
In our hearts,

808
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,020
you'll always be the Junior General.

809
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,350
Yes, you'll always be the Junior General.

810
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,760
Commander-in-chief.

811
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,990
-Commander-in-chief.
-Commander-in-chief.

812
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,040
You may leave.

813
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,520
Commander-in-chief,

814
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,200
don't be angry with Junior General.

815
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,630
Yes, Commander-in-chief.

816
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,600
Actually,

817
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,270
we don't really miss home.

818
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:43,990
Yeah.

819
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,260
What?

820
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,030
Planning to polish spears

821
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,380
in the barracks for the rest of your life?

822
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
From tomorrow on,

823
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,960
go back to the camp and lead the troops.

824
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,510
Father.

825
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,220
What?

826
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,630
Do you want me to invite you?

827
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,480
I will remember

828
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,490
your teachings, Father.

829
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,490
I won't make the same mistake again.

830
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,220
Ye'er.

831
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,620
You did nothing wrong.

832
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,490
I was at fault.

833
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,420
Father.

834
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,600
I...

835
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,790
have done

836
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,850
the men of Youzhou Army a disservice.

837
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,210
They followed me

838
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,480
north and south, fighting life and death.

839
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,010
They entrusted their lives to me.

840
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,160
But I gave up on the families

841
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,720
they left behind.

842
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,750
If Wangdu had really been raided,

843
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,420
I would not be able to close my eyes

844
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,350
even on the day I die.

845
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,800
I

846
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,320
feel guilty.

847
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,300
Father.

848
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,120
Don't say that.

849
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,660
I have something to tell you too.

850
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,740
But I don't know if I should say it.

851
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,410
Go ahead.

852
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:47,780
If you really

853
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,580
sent reinforcements that day,

854
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,510
the Eastern Capital

855
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,030
would have fallen into several days of stalemate.

856
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,760
It would have resulted in countless casualties.

857
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,810
We had different considerations.

858
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,370
So we made

859
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,470
different decisions.

860
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,530
But in the end,

861
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,300
we both wish for a peaceful country

862
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,620
where people can live and work.

863
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,160
Da Xia

864
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,600
needs talents with different personalities

865
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
and different ways of doing things.

866
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,180
This way,

867
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,020
more people's talents can be of use,

868
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,450
and the country will become better.

869
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,780
[Victory Always]

870
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,800
Are you all homesick?

871
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,990
Yes.

872
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,440
You're allowed to go home.

873
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,800
We're going home! We're going home!

874
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,900
Thank you, Commander-in-chief. Thank you, Junior General.

875
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,740
Commander-in-chief, don't worry.

876
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,140
We’ll come back as soon as

877
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,470
we have harvested the wheat crops.

878
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,060
Okay.

879
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,640
Good boy.

880
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,660
Good job.

881
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,200
We're going home.

882
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,770
We can finally go home. Great.
