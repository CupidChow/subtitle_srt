358
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,665
It was inconvenient to verify the killer,
so I brought the witness here instead.

359
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,395
Is this the guy?

360
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,489
He saw you at the patrol division

361
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,735
on the day Kang Su died.

362
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,245
Darn it.

363
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,385
Have you been acting up because you were
counting on this lousy camera?

364
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,485
Find out if there's more.

365
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,385
Oh, what?

366
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,349
Why are you touching me?
This is sexual harassment!

367
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,719
Don't you know I'm a TV director?

368
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,695
Do you want me to get you in trouble?

369
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,995
Hey!

370
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,995
Gosh, you're well prepared.

371
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,165
You're doing this
because there's no evidence.

372
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,975
The witness will be dead soon.

373
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,069
Get rid of both.

374
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,399
Gosh. Why do you guys always say that?

375
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,845
We're not some kind of recyclables.
That's offensive.

376
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,145
Your name is Kang Moo-young?

377
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,485
Aren't you afraid of anything?

378
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,755
If that's some kind
of psychological question, I'll pass.

379
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,055
That's none of your business.

380
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,495
What was that?

381
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,735
Hey.

382
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,889
Was that why you were so fearless?

383
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,935
I don't want to count on him,

384
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,705
but he wants to return my favor so badly.

385
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,199
Gosh, my man.
Why aren't you resting if you're retired?

386
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,005
I've rested enough thanks to you
while thinking about the old days.

387
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,375
Why are you holding people hostage though?

388
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,015
Can't you tell?

389
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,509
Hey, take them.

390
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,739
Yes, sir!

391
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,255
Goodness, you guys hit me
in my temple a lot last time.

392
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,385
Do you know how much it hurt?

393
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,655
Hey!

394
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,305
You little...

395
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,025
You...

396
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,545
Bare Hands!

397
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,485
That's it for today.

398
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,285
You came right on time. Thank you.

399
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,255
Well, I had time before opening my store.

400
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,995
And there was no traffic.

401
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,390
Gosh.

402
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,459
Are you hurt?

403
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,705
- I'm so sorry.
- Well...

404
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,975
I didn't do anything, and it was fun.

405
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,175
Thank you.

406
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,745
You're so thorough, Director Kang.

407
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,545
Right.

408
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,685
Are you sure it's Lee Tae-seong
who killed Kang Su?

409
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,455
It... It was too dark to see.

410
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,825
- You didn't see him?
- No.

411
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,635
Director Kang.

[ Major Crimes Team 1 ]

413
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,185
How can I help you?

414
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,739
- Are you looking for someone?
- I'm here to turn myself in.

415
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,015
Turn yourself in?

416
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,055
Where's Detective Jin Gang-ho?

417
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,885
At the moment... Oh, there he is.

418
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,465
Jang Seong-su.

419
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,965
You cut the wires for fun?

420
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,035
And it just so happened to be
the security cameras at the murder scene?

421
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,845
Next time you're having fun,
you're going to cut off

422
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,915
all the wires in the neighborhood
at this rate.

423
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,545
Please don't be sarcastic.

424
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,585
He is a bit slower than most,
and you know it too.

425
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,785
But I didn't kill anybody.

426
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,495
Here's his alibi.

427
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,019
At the time when Lee Seon-mi was killed,

428
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,795
he was at an internet cafe.

429
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,289
As you can see on the monitor next to him,

430
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,775
it was 8 p.m.

431
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,775
Exactly.

432
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,569
It's so solid

433
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,905
like it was prepared in advance.

434
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,815
But how do you know
the exact time of the murder?

435
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,145
Well, that's...

436
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,155
I've seen it on the news.

437
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,009
So, you've been remembering
the estimated time

438
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,125
they said on the news all this time?

439
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,025
Let me see your hand.

440
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,035
What? You don't have the phocomelia?

441
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,135
What are you doing?
Are you still suspecting him?

442
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,475
Anyhow, he confessed to damaging property,

443
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,559
so you'll hear from us soon.

444
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,545
You'll hear from the Human Rights
Commission too, detective.

445
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,075
You accused an innocent civilian of murder
and even searched his house.

446
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,385
I can't just let this go.

447
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,185
Let's go.

448
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,025
Why you...

449
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,119
Just use your words.

450
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,189
Why would a democratic police use force?

451
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,919
You want me to be democratic?
What about you?

452
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,859
You can be the democratic one.

453
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,705
I'm just going to be an alcoholic.

454
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,105
Gosh, I want to drink so bad.

455
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,835
What will you do
when the chief hears about this?

456
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,399
I know, right? So do me a favor

457
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,199
and don't tell him anything.

458
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,039
He has really bad hearing anyway.

459
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,869
Plus, he says he did cut the wires
to the cameras at Lee Seon-mi's studio.

460
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,315
You talk so well.

461
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,579
Gosh, what in the world did I do
to deserve this?

462
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,055
Why did I ever have to meet you?

463
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,279
I want everyone to stay quiet.

464
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,889
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

465
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,049
Oh, right. She'll report him
to the Human Rights Commission.

466
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,259
Then the chief will find out.

467
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,319
Thanks for the information, you punk.

468
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,465

00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,819
Hey, Director Kang.
I got discharged today.

472
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,265
I just called to tell you not to worry.

473
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,835
[ You got discharged already? ]

474
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,235
[ I guess it wasn't that bad. ]

475
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,405
"Already"?

476
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,759
Yes, I'm already out.

477
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,205
I guess I recovered too quickly.

478
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,705
[ I know, right?
Meanwhile, I'm really busy. ]

479
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,015
[ I'll call you later when I'm free. ]

480
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,919
Hey, Ban-seok. I got discharged today.

481
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,525
[ So? Why are you calling me? ]

482
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,995
[ I'm busting skulls right now. I'm busy. ]

483
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,905
Oh, dear.

484
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,869
[ I almost forgot.
I have something important for you. ]

485
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,045
[ Meet me at my workplace. ]

486
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,515
He's asking a patient to come and go?

487
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,255
Gosh, these people are so cold-hearted.

00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,155
Surprise!

492
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,955
He looks so startled.

493
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,325
My gosh, this is so corny.

494
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,619
Why did you invite me here?

00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,935
Gosh, stop it.

Oh, the cake.

498
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,274
Thank you for this,
but I kind of guessed you'd do this.

499
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,285
Your voice was a bit shaky
when we talked earlier...

500
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,455
What are you doing?

501
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,718
What? You told me to do this.

502
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,725
When? I told you to...

503
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,335
Forget it then.

504
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,865
Did you predict this as well?

505
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,265
Not at all.

506
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,159
I never thought you'd do this
to a guy who just got discharged.

507
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,145
Now, that's what you call prejudice.

508
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,145
That's one point for me.

509
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,215
Congratulations on your recovery.

510
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,439

Kang Su was a good friend of mine.

513
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,509
It's nice to meet you.

514
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,449
I'm Lee Ban-seok, a trustworthy mortician.

515
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,449
If there's a corpse you deeply care about,

516
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,049
- I will... No, no.
- "Corpse"?

517
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,295
I will do my best to prepare the corpse...
No, no.

518
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,735
I'll do my best to prepare the deceased
for the funeral.

519
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,529
I'm the owner of a small bar
name Red-Zone.

520
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,759
Oh, a zone that's red?

521
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,329
I'm Tak Won, a private detective.

522
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,139

Do you think this is some kind of party?

525
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,879
Do you have anything
regarding the Butterfly Serial Killer?

526
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,479
I thought I had the right guy,

527
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,979
but he didn't have phocomelia,
and he had an alibi,

528
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,155
so we're back to square one.

529
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,119
What about the copycat
who murdered Kang Su?

530
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,065
I know who it was.

531
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,759
But there's no evidence.

532
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,729
So you practically let the murder happen
when it could've been avoided?

533
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,135
If you want to catch a raccoon,
you need to start a smoke bomb.

534
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,599
What?

535
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,345
Yes, that's a good idea.

536
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,085
Director Kang,
you should start the smoke bomb.

537
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,209
You earn the most money from this.

538
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,285
Gosh, don't be so cheap.
You have a black credit card.

539
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,355

542
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,819
Okay, we're on.

543
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,919

I worked with you guys today

the labor conditions of subcontractors.

567
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,359

Please help me just this once.

578
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,129
I'm sorry.

I did a lot of things for you, sir.

585
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,355
Lee Su-ho, one of our subcontractors.

586
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,649
He died an unfair death. Didn't he, sir?

587
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:00,719
Yes.

588
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,089
That's why Kang Su went to prison.

589
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,559
He was imprisoned
for professional negligence.

590
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,329
But unfortunately,
he was murdered by Jang Min-gi,

591

592
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,039
Then what would you do

593
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,675
if I tell the world
the truth behind Lee Su-ho's death?

594
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,445
Are you serious?

595
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,409
Are you trying to dig your own grave?

596
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,309
I won't be the only one getting hurt.

If you're going to make threats,

599
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,595
you should be smart about it, you punk.

He doesn't even do anything.

I'm a little taken aback.

610
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,889
Why are you showing me this?

611
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,595
Even a mouse can bite
if it's backed into a corner.

612
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,835
I need to save myself too.

613

What do you say? Deal?

614
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,635
So, you want to stow away?

615
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,145
But isn't that too typical
for an escape plan?

616

And I don't know anybody who can...

617
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,245
I can't be a fool
who gets caught at the airport!

618
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,385
If you're a director
of a current affairs program,

619
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,015
isn't it easy for you to find me a guy?

620
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,125

Come on.

631
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,599
You couldn't even control a cable TV show
and make this happen?

632

After the show aired last night,
we're getting constant complaint calls.

633
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,569
Call the legal team. Either give them

634
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:04,175
- an explanation or sue them. Do something.
- Well...

635
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,969
You need to go somewhere first.

636

- What? Where?
- Follow me, sir.

638
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,655
You can't arrest an innocent person
like this.

Since we have a lot of spare time,
let's find out if you're innocent.

640

The other day,

641
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,375
by looking at you and Jang Seong-su,
it got me wondered.

[ I felt a little uneasy, looking at you.
How should I put it? ]

643
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,675
You two looked more like
a mother and son than a couple.

644
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,655
It's probably because
I love that boy so much.

645
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,785
Oh, love?

646
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,455

male DNAs on the cigarette butt.

[ Found two different males' DNA ]

651
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,345
It means there was another man
in the house other than Jang Seong-su.

652
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,675
Two men?

653
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,045

00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,485
that both males' last names are Jang.

[ Subjects 1 and 2 are brothers. ]

658
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,395
Jang Seong-su had an older brother
named Jang Do-il.

659

He was the doctor
of the butterfly case's victims.

660
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,935
Then Jang Seong-su's brother,
Jang Do-il is the real killer?

661
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,775
And Jang Seong-su cut the wires
on the security cameras for his brother?

662
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,505
What a shame.

663
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,715
Jang Do-il died seven years ago.

664
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,015
You're right. He's dead on paper

665
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:52,379
since Jang Seong-su reported his death.

666
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,925
What? Then he reported his brother's death
when he's alive?

667
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,755
What are you talking about?

668
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,695
Come on. Take a deep breath.

669
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,005

The two male DNAs we found at your house.

671
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,445
But what's funny is
that those are the only DNAs

672
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,445
we were able to find.

673
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,275
Only two male DNAs.

674
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,715
All right. This is the last highlight.

What's he saying?

685

Before Lee Seon-mi died,
she bit the killer's hand.

686
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,214
From the bloodstain left on her tooth,

687
00:46:29,215 --> 00:46:30,990
we found out
the killer's last name was Jang.

688
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:34,224
And with the finger marks left on
the necks of the butterfly case's victims,

689
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:37,054
we found out
that the killer had a uniquely thick

690
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,730
and short thumb.

691
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:40,740

before you became Choi Mi-na.

694
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:49,234
Since you got a new identity

695
00:46:49,235 --> 00:46:52,034
and acted like your brother's girlfriend,

696
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:53,880
she was like a time bomb for you.

Is that why you killed her?

698

when you heard that Jang Min-gi escaped?

699

No.
