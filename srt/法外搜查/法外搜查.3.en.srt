Your food is here.

It smells amazing.

180

Put it here. Thanks.

181
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,405
Gosh, it stinks of cheonggukjang.

182
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,715
Gang-ho, you can't spend
your entire budget on food.

183
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,945
Pho, sushi, malatang.

184
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,455
Are you trying to taste
all the foods of the world?

185
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,779
You're not even
paying attention to the videos.

186

- I bought this with my money.
- You punk.

187

Why are you so selfish?

188

Do you think we like eating ramyeon?

189
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,795
I love ramyeon.

190
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,659
I already bought grilled beef
for everyone yesterday.

191
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,865
- I just didn't invite you.
- Why not?

192

If you have too much energy,
you'll only nag at me.

193
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,805
I'll take you to a salad buffet next time

194
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,715
so you can eat a lot of vegetables
and become calmer.

195
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,045
If you keep acting up,
you'll have to pay for it one day.

196
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,955
Let me do my job before that happens.

197
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,449

- This part?

Stop.

200

Look. It's a burn mark.

201
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,535
You're right.

202
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,605
There should be a medical record for this.

Way to go, Gang-ho.

205
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,945
Wait. Did Jang Min-gi have a burn scar?

206
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,115
- Just a second.
- Let's check.

207
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,879
[ Name: Jang Min-gi,
Date of Birth: April 27, 1981 ]

208

No, there's no scar.

209
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,525
Then what is this?

210
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,935
Do you think
Jang Min-gi might not be the culprit?

211
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,735
Then what about the butterfly signature?

212
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,165
It doesn't make sense.

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,035
Do you think it could be an accomplice?

214
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,945
I hope you understand.

215
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,939
This car belongs to the company,
so if I leave it vacant for too long,

216
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,745
I get a call from the company right away.

217
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,239
I'm just grateful that you agreed
to do the interview

218
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,879
Everything will be fine
as long as you blur out my face.

219
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,325
Of course. Don't worry.

220
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,749
Did you say you served time
in the same prison

221
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,689
as the two fugitives,
Jang Min-gi and Kang Soo?

222
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,935
To be honest, the moment I saw the news
regarding their escape,

223
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,659
I instantly had a feeling
that they must have

224
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,405
- planned it together.
- I see.

225
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,075
- So you think it was planned?
- Yes.

226
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,645
They fought like crazy
the moment they first met.

227
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,599
But once they cleared the air,

228
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,439
they suddenly became pretty close.

229
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,469
I guess gangsters
are also scared of serial killers

230
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,485
seeing that Kang Soo
became Jang Min-gi's minion.

231
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,649
But then again, Jang Min-gi killed someone
as soon as he escaped.

232
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,425
That already shows
that he's one of a kind.

233
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,665
[ I could tell that he was brutal. ]

234
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,089
Did you notice anything else?

235
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,835
That's all I know.

236
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,729
Did that help?

237
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,605
Yes, of course. It helped a lot.

238
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,705

239
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,875

No, it's okay.

- No problem.

I was going to pay him 50 dollars
for the interview.

253
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,155
No wonder he went to jail ten times
for fraud.

- Gosh.

352
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,625
Did someone move in here?

353
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,125
It's... Yes, you punk!

354
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,355
I rented out the storage room.

355
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,889
What are you talking about? Rent out?

356
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,249
Why would you do that
without discussing it with me first?

357
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,019
This is my house.

358
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,405
You're living in my house for free.

359
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,229
Why would I discuss with you

360
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,029
about renting out a room in my own house?

361
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,259
You didn't let me use your father's money.

362
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,905
So this is my solution.

363
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,969
I told you to pretend that we don't have.

364
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,839
That's not our money.

365
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,415
My gosh, you are
such a clean and upright son.

366
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,639
Shut your mouth.

367
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,779
Make sure to wire me the money
for your monthly expenses.

368
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,279
And how come you never got a raise

369
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,849
over the last five years?

370
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,825
Gosh. I don't know.
Let's talk later. I'm busy now.

371
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,665
Ma'am, you're back.

372
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,989
There's a lot of stuff inside.

373
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,259
Can I throw them all out?

374
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,265
- What?
- Well...

375
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,505
Hey. You...

376
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,505
What are you doing here?

377
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,049
Let's cut to the chase.

378
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,025
Move out first thing tomorrow morning.

379
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,795
Why would I do that?

380
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,865
I signed the contract
with your mother, not you.

381
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,659
So you're going to live
in this house with me?

382
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,535
Don't put it that way.

383
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,629
I'm not living with you.

384
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,299
The room is detached from your house.

385
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,969
I don't care about that.

386
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,039
The room is moldy.

387
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,909
No one can live in there.
It's just a storage room.

388
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,269
My mother fooled you.

389
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,809
What? Should I register this as a fraud?

390
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,639
Gang-ho, I did no such thing.

391
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,925
She saw the room herself
and made her decision.

392
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,749
Before you get dry patches on your face
because of the mold,

393
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,325
you should move out while I'm being nice.

394
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,329
If you can return my deposit
and the month's rent I paid in advance,

395
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,475
pay the moving fee,

396
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,399
and compensate me for
the psychological damage you have caused,

397
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,415
I'll think about moving out.

398
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,845
I'll cover the moving fee.

399
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,255
As for the deposit and the rent...

400
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,949
I don't have it. I already spent it all.

401
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,725
For my trip savings to Hawaii.

402
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,159
How much is that in total?

403
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,465
5,000 dollars deposit and 200 rent.

404
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,029
And 1,000 dollars for the moving fee.

405
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,805
No. It's 2,000 dollars to move back.

406
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,675
As for the psychological damage,

407
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,405
it's about 10,000 dollars.

408
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,675
What?

409
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,739
You only moved in an hour ago.

410
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,315
Are you saying

411
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,979
you had 1,660 dollars' worth
of psychological damage every 10 minutes?

412
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,909
Goodness. What kind of dummy

413
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,309
divides the money by the minute
to evaluate the damage?

414
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,319
I'm in despair, enraged, and dejected

415
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,565
as I can't move in here.

416
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,665
And you must consider the anxiety
I have to move somewhere else.

417
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,699
Ma'am, your son knows nothing about women.
This must be hard on you.

418
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,905
Gosh, I finally have a person
with whom I see eye to eye.

419
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,569
Right. For your information,
he has 120 dollars

420
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,015
in his paycheck account.

421
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,939
What?

422
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,539
That's right. He's broke.

423
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,685
Mom, come on!

424
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,119
Anyway, I didn't say yes to this.

425
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,765
Let's talk about this later. Okay?

426
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,365
Yes, sir.

427
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,405
By the way,

428
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,605
I guess your son
isn't financially well-off.

429
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,799
That jerk is rich.

430
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,075
He carries around a black credit card.

431
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,269
What? You just said he's broke.

432
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,769
He has 120 dollars.

433
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,715
On paper, he's rich.

434
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,555
But in reality, he's broke.

435
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,825

436
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,935

437
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,435

this lousy cop's stuff too.

440
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,295

[ I'm at your place right now. ]

442
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,235
What?

443
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,435
Then you must know
that I moved out yesterday.

444
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,689
[ Yes, you wench. ]

445
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,529
[ Now you're moving in secret
and trying to cut ties with me? ]

446
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,129
I didn't move in secret.

447
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,129
I got kicked out
because I was behind my rent.

448
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,445
Now I moved to a storage room
where I pay 200,000 per month.

449

but you look especially bad today.

452
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,649
Did something happen?

453
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,995
I moved yesterday.

454
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,149
Again?

455
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,665
Well, you've got sued a lot.

456
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,835
Did you cover them
with your house deposit again?

457
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,465
This is why it's so hard
to achieve justice.

458
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,305
- To achieve ratings, you mean.
- Be quiet.

459
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,005
Shut it, Mr. Never-Had-A-Girlfriend.

460
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,175
- What is it, anyway?
- Oh, this?

461
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,815
This is the wife of the truck driver,
Kim Jeong-man, who caused the crash.

462
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,569
I've looked into it.

463
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,015
Kim Jeong-man grew up with Kang Soo
in the same town.

464
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,785
So the driver of the dump truck
was a friend of Kang Soo?

465
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,025
- That's suspicious.
- That's why I dug further into it.

466
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,889
This is the case
where Kang Soo was a suspect

467
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,665
of the murder of a worker two years ago.

468
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,505
And this is the butterfly serial murder
of Jang Min-gi.

469
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,435
These cases were assigned
to the same prosecutor and police officer.

470
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,905
What?

471
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,105
The prosecutor and the police officer
for the escaped convicts were the same?

472
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,915
I mean, this could be a coincidence,

473
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,445
- but we can make a story out of this.
- Right?

474
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,815
Yu Seong-guk
of Seoul District Prosecutor's Office,

475
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,555

Prosecutor Yu Seong-guk...

479
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,235
- Hey, is he the current mayor of Seoul?
- Yes.

480
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,059
His last case
before he became a politician

481
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,875
was this murder case of the worker.

482
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,969
Any other prosecutors would've put
this guy in jail for about ten months,

483

or in probation.

484
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,409
But he demanded ten years' imprisonment
with additional punishment.

485
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,455
He became the talk of the town
at that time.

486
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,185
That's right.
That's how he became the mayor so easily.

487
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,755

Yes, but...

The police arrested Jang Min-gi

Yes.

The victims for both cases

942

were hit on the back of their heads.
