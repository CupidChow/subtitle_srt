180

Then you just had to compare them
with his fingerprints.

181

he wouldn't have gotten released.

to know so much about the case?

or something.

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,685
It's bound to be a hit.

352
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,495
All right. Keep wasting your energy here.

353
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,665
My gosh, that sly geezer!

354
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,635
I'm going to get the highest ratings.

355
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,375
Darn it.

356
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,005
What is it?

357
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,675
Moo-young, someone is here to see you.

358
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,175
[ "The Bible" ]

359
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,029
Hey. What's wrong with you?

360
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,999
Are you a hybrid Buddhist-Catholic?

361
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,999
If you keep this up, believers of
both religions will stone you.

362
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,169
On my way to the temple,
I met an old priest.

363
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,435
What's wrong with him?

364
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,639
I'll skip my long story.
You should make a donation.

365
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,709
As if.

366
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,379
Why? You're dressed like a priest.

367
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,345
Right.

368
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,879
- How about an offertory?
- What kind of priest pays a home visit...

369
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,119
I mean, a personal visit
to collect donations?

370
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,915
Based on that, you think of the TV station
as your home.

371
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,455
That must be why you exposed me,
your only brother, on TV.

372
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,855
And that's why I'm broke.

373
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,995
I see.

374
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,129
Hey, I don't have cash.

375
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,195
Sister.

376
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,795
What will you do
with your mobile banking app?

377
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,335
How much?

378
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,349
Let me tell you
that my balance is 320 dollars.

379
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,845
Just give me 320 dollars.

380
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,189
[ I analyzed the culprit as a profiler. ]

381
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,059
[ And a significant part of my analysis
matches Kim Min-soo. ]

382
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,389
[ I found out that
the culprit was left-handed. ]

383
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,289
[ All right. This is a painting
by Kim Min-soo. ]

384
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,325
[ It's called "Cross Section of Death". ]

385
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,129
[ As you can see,
the direction of the brush strokes ]

386
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,069
[ goes from left to right evenly. ]

387
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,435
[ This means that he's left-handed,
just like the culprit. ]

388
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,205
What do you think? Can you see it?

389
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,039
It kind of got weak in the end.
I'm not sure.

390
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,149
We're not cops.
We can get it started first.

391
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,019
It's a reasonable doubt.
And it's up to the viewers to decide.

392
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,219
In our industry,
getting the scoop first is important.

393
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,515
But, Ms. Kang,

394
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,619
a lot of people are left-handed.

395
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,959
To say there's a reasonable doubt
with this,

396
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,689
isn't it unreasonable?

397
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,929
Why not?
We have his nickname and IP address.

398
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,059
"It was stolen. I was hacked."
If he says that,

399
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,429
we have no rebuttal.

400
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,969
She has a point.

401
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,669
Besides, this is Ido Pharmaceuticals.

402
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,769
If we make claims
without any hard evidence,

403
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,469
they might sue us.
Gosh, that will be a hassle.

404
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,439
My gosh, you and your words.

405
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,979
Mr. Never-Had-A-Girlfriend.

406
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,675
How can you launch your own show
if you're such a coward?

407
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,279
Last month, you aired an episode
that AX Group rigged stock prices

408
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,915
to succeed the management rights.

409
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,749
And AX Group filed a lawsuit.

410
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,915
Your trial against them is still ongoing.

411
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,089
I should have stopped you to the end.

412
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,259
It's all right.

413
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,029
I would've done it
even if you didn't approve.

414
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,325
Why bring that up?

415
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,699
What about you?

416
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,865
We definitely need more than this
to narrate a story.

417
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,365
Do we have any visual materials
that could shock the viewers?

418
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,299
So far, we only have suspicions.

419
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,939
Something shocking

420
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,905
that would make the viewers believe
that he really is the culprit.

421
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,345
Visual materials that
would be shocking to the viewers?

422
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,375
Let me see.

423
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,055
I might be able to find it.

424
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,895
I'm so thirsty.

425
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,465
Hey, Dae-jin.

426
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,535
Are you sure Kim Min-soo is home?

427
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,679
Yes, he's home according
to his cellphone signal.

428
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,475
But how come he never comes out
once all day?

429
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,775
Don't you think he left his phone at home?

430
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,115
[ You said the basic rules of investigation
are determination and persistence. ]

431
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,315
Then a stakeout is
like the highlight of investigations.

432
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,615
- Detective Min.
- Yes, coming.

433
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,885
I hope you become the highlight
of determination and persistence.

434
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,365
My goodness.

435
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,765
That is some annoying support.

436
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,765
Darn it.

437
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,335
What? What's that?

438
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,745
What?

439
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,385
Excuse me, ma'am.

440
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,625
Why are you covering your face?

441
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,839
- Do I know you?
- No, I don't know you.

442
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,565
You can just keep going.

443
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,835
What's wrong with her?

444
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,775
What are you modifying your voice for?

445
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,915
What? Director Kang?

446
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,575
Just pretend you didn't see me.
It'll be over soon.

447
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,085
Look at her.

448
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,385
You must know that this is illegal, right?

449
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,859
Where did you get this tall ladder though?

450
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,789
I borrowed it from the construction site
over there.

451
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,225
You think I stole it?

452
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,455
Okay.

453
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,695
You're filming here illegally
without permission.

454
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,369
I got you. As a guardian of the law,

455
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,265
I will make you pay for your actions.

456
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,705
Gosh, it's Kim Min-soo.

457
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,375
Hide!

458
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,355
Forget it.

459
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,525
Fine, then.

460
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,165
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

461
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,165
You just did that on purpose, didn't you?

462
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,605
So, that's Kim Min-soo?

463
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,705
He's the twin brother of Kim Min-seok.

464
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,919
No way. That's Kim Min-seok.

465
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,715
How can you tell which one is which?

466
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,085
My scientific gut is telling me.

467
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,525
I haven't just been slacking off as a cop,
you know.

468
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,729
How can your gut feeling be scientific?
You're joking.

469
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,895
Hey, one second.

470
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,529
- There. That guy who just came out.
- Where?

471
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,735
That's Kim Min-soo. Record it now.

472
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,665
On what grounds are you saying that?

473
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,505
Let's go.

474
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,775
Who's there?

475
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,275
Who is it?

476
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,685
What in the world...

477
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,555
It's just a horse.

478
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,625
A horse? Hey, wait!

479
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,699
- Hey, there's someone out there!
- Gosh.

480
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,199
Are you crazy? You're insane. You must be.

481
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,835
How can you think to mimic a horse
right then and there?

482
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,439
And why are you so good at it?

483
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,305
I was so startled that it just came out.

484
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,105
- Let's hurry and run.
- Gosh, I was so shocked.

485
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,145
What were you thinking, seriously?

486
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,685
- Hey, hey.
- My goodness.

487
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,355
- Hey, go!
- What's wrong?

488
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,819
- Who are you?
- Why are you getting in this car?

489
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,495
Mine is over there.
Let's just go first. Drive.

490
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,295

a lousy car to Guchon

- She doesn't.

- Hey.
- I get that you don't have one.

504
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,915
Just share the video of Kim Min-soo

505
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,945
Why should I?
Are you trying to steal this too?

506
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,825
I've filmed you filming illegally,
all right?

507
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,185
So? Should I issue a warrant?

508
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,325
Is this a threat?

509
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,295

So this is the solid proof that the guy
who followed Gu Hyeong-jin

520
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,425

00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,799
So is their stride and joint movement.

524
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,135
We can analyze such data
to find out the real culprit.

525
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,009
You can see the example
of the circumduction gait here.

526
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,905
Both of these guys kick their left legs
while walking.

527
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,575
And the right foot is an out-toed gait.

528
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,549
It means the right foot points outward.

529
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,945
It is extremely rare
that these two cases show in one person.

530
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,925
Which means, it's highly likely
that these two are the same person.

531
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,795
Seriously, that's amazing.
How did you figure this out?

532
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,495
It's not that I analyzed it
so scientifically...

533
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,139
This is what years of experience
looks like, you know.

534
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,395
Look up to me all you want.

535
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,909
Oh, right. We should report it
to the section chief.

536
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,035
No, don't.

537
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,479
Why not? We have the perfect evidence.

538
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,305
What if he says he only followed him
but didn't murder him?

539
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,045
Let me make sure of one more thing.

540
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,285
Okay, let's compare these two photos.

541
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,459
This mansion that belongs to Kim Min-seok

542
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,999
was owned by three generations
of Ido Pharmaceuticals owners.

543
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,795
Look at this place in the video.

544
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,125
What do you think? It's the same, right?

545
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,739
Is this the perfect evidence or what?

546
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,169
Now, he can't say

547
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,305
- his IP was hacked or stolen.
- Exactly.

548
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,679
The dirty secret of the twins
of Ido Pharmaceuticals.

549
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,179
That'll work.

550
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,679
I knew it, Director Kang.
You nailed it eventually.

551
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,015
No, no. There's something more important.

552
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,145
All right. These two men
who were at Kim Min-seok's house.

553
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,515
Doesn't one of them

554
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,685
look familiar to you?

555
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,625
I think we might have interviewed him.

556
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,495
Isn't that Kang Pil-du,
the Director of KFDA?

557
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,365
We interviewed him
for the humidifier case before.

558
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:50,095
He was a professor
of Pharmaceutical Sciences back then.

559
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:53,609
Right, he lied that there was no issue
with the product.

560
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,705
Bingo.

561
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,839
It's three days before Ido's new drug
gets approved by the KFDA.

562
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,079
And the Director
of Ido Pharmaceuticals secretly met

563
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,575
with the Director of KFDA at his home.

564
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,719
The time and place seem suspicious, right?

565
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,885
That's enough for reasonable doubt.

566
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,255
But that man

567
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,725
always sues people. Will it be okay?

568
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,659
Goodness, that's fine.

569
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,365
Let's put it out there
and worry about it later.

570
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,899
Those two men could be our key.

571
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,695
So please dig up some dirt
on them quickly.

572
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,309
Hey, I'll go and interview Kim Min-soo,

573
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,809
so you go ahead and meet with the victims
of the new drug test.

574
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,679
There's got to be something.

575
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,175
- Yes, sure.
- Gosh, you get on my nerves.

576
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,275
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

577
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,385
Okay.

578
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,295
[ Mom ]

579
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,195
Mom, please stop calling.

580
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,235
He already got 320 dollars from me.

581
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,945
My gosh!

582
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,545
What are you doing here?

583
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,379
How did you know I'd get off here?

584
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,089
It looks like you're off
to Kim Min-soo's house.

585
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,245
What?

586
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,455
Did you wiretap me or something?

587
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,129
How did you know? Tell me.

588
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,029
You weren't calling me,

589
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,969
so that had to mean you found something.

590
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,965
And I figured you'll go see him
to do the prepping.

591
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,339
You're exactly correct.

592
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,035
It's as if you scanned my brain.

593
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,809
Let me go with you.
This might be the last time I see him,

594
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,475
so I want to go, too.

595
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,075
Is that really necessary?

596
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,675
I also solved the puzzle.

597
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,515
The mystery behind
the unidentified fingerprints.

598
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,354
What?

599
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,229
Seriously? What are you guys doing here?

600
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,725
That's what I want to ask.

601
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:03,999
I have to ask him something first.

602
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,865
So count to 100 before you come in.

603
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,635
Where are you going?

604
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:09,705
We get to ask him first this time.

605
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,275
Really? Do you have something?

606
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,175
I'm not going to tell you.

607
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,019
And just go home
if you're going to tank it like last time.

608
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,119
Don't get in our way.

609
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,519
Gosh, why would I get in your way?

610
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,815
I know you worked really hard
to get this far.

611
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,159
Make sure you film this

612
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,955
if you don't want me
to beat you to it again.

613
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,805
...

614
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,909
All the paintings in the gallery

615
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,449
were painted by my little brother.

616
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,485
This is creative.

617
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,345
He was very talented from a young age,
unlike me.

618
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,159
Your paintings always give me goosebumps.

619
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,199
Your last piece was
"Cross Section of Death",

620
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,555
and now, "The Dark Side of Death".

621
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,795
We all die one day.

622
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,335
And that is a very beautiful thing.

623
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,095
You think it's beautiful?

624
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:16,835
Death is the only thing
that's fair and peaceful to everyone.

625
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,949
In other words...

626
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,705
Hey, Min-soo!

627
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,915
What? It's them again?

628
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,615
Stop right there.

629
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,455
You should leave.

630
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,389
I'm from "Fact Check"!

631
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,129
We have a question for you,
Mr. Kim Min-soo!

632
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,729
If you don't leave, we'll call the cops.

633
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,999
There's no need for that. I'm a cop.

634
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,195
I came just in case you might call.
Now, get lost.

635
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,295
Hey.

636
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,209
He got suspended, so just kick him out.

637
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,239
You punk.

638
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,335
That's my privacy.
You can't just tell them that.

639
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,779
Listen. I'm not a cop, and I don't work
at the broadcasting station.

640
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,879
I'm just a big fan of Mr. Kim Min-soo.

641
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,375
So will you let me through?

642
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,685
I guess not.

643
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,185
Mr. Kim, do you remember me?

644
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,055
Do you know him?

645
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,499
How could you not remember me?

646
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,995
- You called me your number one fan.
- My gosh.

647
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,199
You can hold your fan meeting in prison.

648
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,109
But before that, you need to sign
a few things in the interrogation room.

649
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,105
Come on.

650
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,935
My gosh, you punk.

651
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,075
You darn punk.

652
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,175
Why won't you listen to me?

653
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,415
What?

654
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,719
Where are the others?

655
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,719
"The others"?

656
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,889
They probably won't make it here.

657
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,885
My gosh!

658
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,889
You startled me!

659
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,489
My goodness.

660
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,695
Don't come near me! Just don't!

661
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,235
You guys! We have a lot of time!

662
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,095
So let's make this a work of art!

663
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,155
Put your arms up properly.

664
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,599
Let me make this clear.

665
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,165
If you use physical violence
to stop us from investigating,

666
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,729
it's considered
an obstruction of business.

667
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,235
That's enough.

668
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,535
Shouldn't you be filming something?

669
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,535
Do you understand?

670
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,635
Mr. Kim Min-soo.

671
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,745
Did you upload a video of yourself
killing a cat on the dark web?

672
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,215
You're that lady from last time.

673
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,185
I'm Kim Min-seok.

674
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,489
Gosh, you punks.

675
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,525
You guys should be wearing name tags.

676
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,625
You know Lee Jong-dae, right?

677
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,499
The culprit's fingerprints were
on the weapon that was found at the scene.

678
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,239
And the same fingerprints were also found

679
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,595
on the weapon that was left
at the scene of a recent murder.

680
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,009
You solved the mystery behind
the unidentified fingerprints?

681
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,005
Yes.

682
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,775
Here is a possible explanation.

683
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,079
What are you doing?

684
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,119
Don't interrupt during the shoot.

685
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,045
It's my turn to talk, so hush.

686
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,355
Twelve years ago,

687
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,859
when Mr. Kim Min-soo found out
that he had left the weapon at the scene,

688
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,495
it was too late to go back for it.

689
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,625
[ But his fingerprints weren't
registered yet since he was only 17. ]

690
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,765
[ So he came up with an idea. ]

691
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,369
[ Something only twins could do. ]

692
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,239
...

693
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,565
[ Kim Min-soo ]

694
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,779
[ Left four fingers, Right four fingers ]

695
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,919
[ Right thumb ]

696
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,819
That is how he was able to leave
his weapon behind

697
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,915
after he committed the recent murder.

698
