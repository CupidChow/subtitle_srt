by the Oni Family.

532
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,634
But if you look at each case individually,

533
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,750
you can tell that they were committed
by different people.

534
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,474
I already know that.

535
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:35,874
The main point of profiling
is to present an analysis

536
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,244
instead of just stating the facts.

537
00:34:37,245 --> 00:34:39,590
It's a pity. This is worth recording.

538
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:42,730
Will you please hurry up? So what's next?

539
00:34:43,455 --> 00:34:46,484
Okay. Runaways normally form a group
called a "Family" of 4 or 5 people.

540
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:49,254
But when it comes to the Oni Family,

541
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,500
separate groups all answer to Oni.

542
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,570
Right. It's really similar

543
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:55,710
to a pyramid scheme.

544
00:34:56,735 --> 00:35:00,304
Therefore, unless you round up
all the runaways in Korea,

545
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:02,274
Oni's group will continue to grow.

546
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:04,080
It's like cell division.

547
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,244
As long as Oni, the mother cell,
continues to exist?

548
00:35:07,245 --> 00:35:10,650
That's right. And here's the clue
that will lead you to him.

549
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:12,020
The clue is...

550
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:18,930

551

552
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:24,000

You already arrested all the guys
near Bugyeong Station.

558

to find anyone near here.

like I didn't even exist.
