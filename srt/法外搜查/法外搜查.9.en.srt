00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,120
Jae Min? Are you sleeping?

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,220
If you were here, why didn't you answer my calls?

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,800
Jae Min, get up. Jae Min.

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,610
Jin Soo? You mean Jo Jin Soo from middle school?

9
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,860
Let's just say I did that. Do you think I would've hidden him here?

10
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,740
It's obvious that I would get suspected like this once he got found out.

11
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,440
You can't punish me by law. I was a minor. 

12
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,110
What did I tell you? You can't caught me.

Excuse us, coming through!

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,830
You're all working hard.

19
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,660
Hello.

20
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,720
Maknae, you're really getting a good first case. It's your first time seeing a corpse, right?

21
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,730
No, sir. I saw them a lot when I was still a constable.

22
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,280
It's just an everyday portion of the life of a police.

23
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,920
Is that so? Is that why you gagged so much?

24
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,640
Well that... I think the cockle I had for lunch was spoiled.

25
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,050
Isn't this the Utility Knife serial killer?

26
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,310
What? Utility Knife?

27
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,010
There's another victim here! Hurry and call the ambulance!

28
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,940
Will you find something if you keep staring at it like that?

29
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,680
What is it? Is it really another Utility Knife case?

30
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,750
You went to the sauna again...

31
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,610
Then the Gwangsu office probably took it.

32
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,980
I mean, obviously.

33
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,460
I was so shocked by something suddenly just standing up.

34
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,980
There is a survivor in a Utility Knife case...

35
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,240
But my question is

36
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,910
It happened in our precinct, but why is the Gwangsu office taking the case?

37
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,570
Not only did be mobilize first, but we also did all the on-site investigations.

38
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,430
Since it's a serial killer case. Why? Does it feel like someone took something you were eating?

39
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,730
Yes! I mean, there's not reason for us to not be able to investigate it.

40
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,100
It's related to our precinct!

41
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,070
Sure, sure. At your stage, it's a time when you're full with just your excitement and passion.

42
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,850
I'm not full. I threw up everything I ate earlier.

43
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,910
Wait a minute... What the maknae is saying doesn't not have a good point.

44
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,570
If we can catch the serial killer, not only will we all receive special promotions,

45
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,290
I'd probably be promoted to Chief right away.

46
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,320
Why are you being like this too, Team Director. He's just spouting immature nonsense.

47
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,980
I mean, if we catch the serial killer it'll be thanks to us, but if we miss him, it won't be our fault!

48
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,150
That's exactly right! Since it's officially the responsibility of the Gwangsu team,

49
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,280
there's nothing for us to lose. On top of that, there's a survivor. Let's try it.

50
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,900
Team Director, are you being serious?

51
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,900
Since they kidnapped two people, there must be more than one culprit, right?

52
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,480
No jumping to conclusions. If you take this in the wrong  direction during the primary investigation, then it's all done for.

53
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,020
Yes, sir. That's what I think as well. The primary investigation is the most important!

54
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,780
Goodness...

55
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,610
Victim Na Jeong Min and survivor Son Ji Young were

56
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,100
high school classmates. They met three days ago

57
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,860
and were reported as missing.

58
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,740
Do you know what the Utility Knife serial killer is about?

59
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,490
Of course I know. Haven't they killed a total of 22 people starting in 2000?

60
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,880
The important thing is that the culprit is so different from the others.

61
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,760
Unlike the other serial killers who murder their victims after committing acts of sexaul assault,

62
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,490
this criminal murders for the purpose of murdering,

63
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,030
without discriminating against male or female.

64
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,330
He tortures the victims by making cuts all over their bodies with a utility knife,

65
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,770
then strangled them to death.

66
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,130
Then, he wipes down the corpse with bleach

67
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,560
before clothing them again and throwing them away near a dumpster.

68
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,870
The point here is that he always takes a square cut of the victim's clothes.

69
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,170
Given the cut on victim Na Jeong Min's neck,

70
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,710
do you think that his crimes have gotten even more cruel?

71
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,880
Well, even serial killers evolve their methods.

72
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,140
Why would someone as cruel as him let Son Ji Young live?

73
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,940
I wonder...

74
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,830
I didn't see anything

75
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,000

The facility was dissolved because government funds were cut off,

115

This is the Grandpa from the shoe store yesteray. What about this?

132
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,960
Ji Su Cheol. 62 years old. He moved to the north end of Kyeonggido in the 1990's,

133
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,110
but starting at that time, the Utility Knife serial killer cases began.

134
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,250
On top of that, as soon as he moved to this area last year, Na Jeong Min's incident occurred.

135
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,400
- It must just be a coincidence. 
 - What? 

136
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,690
Yesterday, when I asked him about Na Jeong Min's case,

137
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,880
he said that he didn't even know there had been a murder.

138
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,420
However, look at this.

139
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,500
This is a picture of the site of the case. 

140
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,330
He was pictured here among the onlookers.

141
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:06,050
But that's not all. I looked into it, just in case,

142
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,180
but even in 5-6 other crime scenes,

143
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,440
he's pictured like this. Don't they say that criminals always go back to the site of the crimes?

144
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,340
It's only 5-6 out of 22 total cases. 

145
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,180
Maybe that elderly man just thinks those cases are interesting, so seeks out the crime sites.

146
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,410
And with what strength would a 62 year old man kidnap his victims?

147
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,550
There were two in this case. I told you not to jump to conclusions!

148
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,940
Isn't it hasty to eliminate someone as a potential criminal just because they're old?

149
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,330
That's not hasty, but just logical.

150
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,880
Instead of being like this, please just give me one search warrant!

151
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,170
Isn't it weird to not check when all the evidence is laid out like this?

152
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,750
Just once, please? Sunbaenim!

153
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,130
Okay, okay. It's only a search warrant for his place of residence, okay? If you find nothing, forget about all of this.

154
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,140
Okay. I understand.

155
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,920

But the person pictured here. This is you, right Mr. Ji Su Cheol? 

162
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,300
I wonder... I guess it does seem like me...

163
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,490
I think it must've been taken by coincidence.

164
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,950
Are all of these coincidences too?

165
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,510
These are all you.

166
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:36,050
How are you going to explain all the different blood samples we collected from your bathroom?

169
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,240
These are the results of the tests run on the blood samples found in the elder's home.

170
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,780
I'm sorry. I think there must have been an accident.

171
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,170
The blood found in the bathroom all belongs to the grandmother. 

172
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,920
The grandmother has a lung disease, so she frequently coughs up blood. 

173
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,270
I'm really sorry. We didn't even know that.

174
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,430
No worries. It's a relief that the truth was revealed.

175
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,560
Thank you so much for being understanding.

176
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,550
Then, can I head back now?

177
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,700
If I'm gone for lone, Granny will get uneasy.

178
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,230
Yes, of course. You can return now.

179
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,260
What are you doing? Escort him home.

180
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,880
- Me? 
 - Who else would take care of the mess you made?

181
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,360
Let's go sir.

182
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,190
I'm very sorry about what happened.

183
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:56,150
 It's alright. You were doing it to catch the culprit.

184
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:01,370
Please just drop me off there. I just thought of somewhere I should stop by.

185
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,100
Okay. 

186
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:27,100
- But Detective, will the other miss be okay? 
 - What? 

187
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,500
You could be lucky once, but I wonder if that could last long.

188
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,680
Why are there so many cars?

189
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,410
Geumpyeong Hospital

190
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,580
Excuse me. Where did patient Son Ji Young go?

191
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,790
One moment please.

192
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,090
That patient was just discharged.

193
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,600
- Discharged? 
 - Yes. 

194
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,940
- Why are you here? 
 - That's what I should be asking you, Detective. 

195
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,200
Is the survivor of the incident at this hospital?

196
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,590
I came to get medicine because Granny's all out.

197
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,220
Then, please take care.

198
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,280
Who is it? 
 It's the police.

199
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,110
Hello. 

200
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,830
Is this Son Ji Young's house?

201
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,500
She just left. It was a monthly rent anyways, and she used up her deposit.

202
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,350
Did she not say anything about where she was going?

203
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:51,410
What time would she have for that? She left in a hurry, as if she was being chased by someone. 

204
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,040
- Thank you. 
 - Sure. 

205
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,890
Son Ji Young

206
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,850
The person you are trying to call...

207
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,360
Son Ji Young's mother

208
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,410
The person you are trying to call...

209
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,490
Where could she have gone...

210
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,230
Where...

211
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,300
I'm not sure... I can recognize most of the ladies in this neighborhood, but these two...

212
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,710
You could be lucky once, but I wonder if that could last long.

213
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,880
Hello, I'm a police.

214
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,170
How many surveillance cameras are in this area?

215
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,650
You said you've never seen Na Jeong Min. Then what is this?

216
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,320
This miss?

217
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,400
I was wondering what I should do about this...

218
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,550
The lady wore shoes that seemed to be too rough for her tastes.

219
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,770
Is... Is this... 

220
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,480
Yes, these are her shoes. I didn't even clean them off because I didn't think she'd be able to wear them anyways.

221
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,450
What?

222
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:12,430
Does that mean you-  Did you kill her?

223
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,260
Are you calling me the culprit just because I didn't clean her shoes?

224
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,630
This crazy !

225
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,240
- You're the Utility Knife serial killer! 
 - Let go of this. 

226
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,120
Let's go. Go,

227
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,900
Go confess at the police station! 

228
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,850
- Come here! 
 - Please let go! 

229
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,930
- Follow me! 
 - Sir! 

230
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,300
Why are you doing this?

231
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,830
What did I do wrong?

232
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,090
You killed the girls!

233
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,380
Please help me, Detective! I don't know anything!

234
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,730
- Save me! 
 - Don't take any pictures!

235
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,370
Today at 4 pm near Dongnam Market, with many civilians present, 

236
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:07,660
there was an unbelievable case of a police assaulting an elderly man.

237
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,780
Let go! Let go!

238
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,830
Stop it! I'm a police!

239
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,290
Cutter Knife Serial Killer Case 3rd

240
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,520
I mean, a detective can make a mistake while trying to catch the culprit.

241
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,670
How could you put a kid who just became a detective on probation for 6 months?

242
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,640
This is how cold-hearted this group is.

243
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,560
Just think of it was a 6-month vacation, and don't be too hard on yourself.

244
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,760
It's not a mistake. The elderly man at the shoe store is the victim.

245
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,380
Can you say that after you've completely flipped this place upside down?

246
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,210
Since a restraining order was placed on you, don't even go near that area.

247
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,970
There's already lots of talk about you being an unethical cop and a loony cop.

248
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,120
I like that. Loony cop. 

249
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,860
- Makes me seem ignorant and fear nothing. 
 - Is this exciting for you? 

250
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,900
No! It'll get more exciting from here on out. 

251
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,960
As a loony cop, I'm going to live my life!

252
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,850
- Long time no see, Detective. 
 - Why?

253
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,200
Has your body been itching again?

254
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,260
It's already been ten years now.

255
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,090
Already ten years?

256
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,880
It's only been ten years, if you think of those who died.

257
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,770
That's why you should just sit there and wait patiently.

258
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,050
Don't go anywhere.

259
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,000
You're talking about that again?

260
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,780
He cut her neck with a knife, wiped the blood, and even cut out a square of her clothes.

261
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,960
It's the same as the last Utility Knife killing that happened 10 years ago.

262
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,870
How could this be a Utility Knife case when there's no evidence of the body being cut with it?

263
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,750
Are you will suspecting that elderly man?

264
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,870
It's not a suspicion, but a fact! Ji Su Cheol is the culprit!

265
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,720
It's already been 10 years.

266
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,410
Don't you even find that old man pitiful?

267
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:10,890
You don't think that I, who has been claiming he's the suspect for ten years no, am pitiful at all?

268
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,250
I feel like I'm talking to a dead horse. Do I need to make my own support team?

269
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,270
What is all this?

270
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:21,220
Are you saying the Jae Min was killed by the Utility Knife serial killer?

271
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,260
Who's the weak elderly man?

272
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,230
Anyways, you just dare doing as you want like last time.

273
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,430
If you do that, I'll just-!

274
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,750
The new chief is asking everyone to gather in his office.

275
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,630
You. Don't do anything, okay?

276
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,190
I'll think about it.

277
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,600
What are you doing? They say to gather. Come on.

278
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,840
I'm a quite flexible person.

279
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,940
The reason I called everyone together is because I wanted to let everyone know

280
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,290
that I place significance in the results, not the process.

281
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,250
I heard you were looking into Park Jae Min's case, but you haven't a single suspect?

282
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,340
There's a chance that he is a serial killer.

283
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,050
We aren't certain yet. We'll have to look into it more.

284
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,240
A serial killer?

285
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,930
That's nice. It'll be great for me to get media coverage immediately after being given this position.

286
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,840
I won't stop you from doing anything.

287
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,430
If you all work a little faster and harder, then I can go to the headquarters faster as well.

288
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,630
Please remember this one thing. I'm different from the previous Chief.

289
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,050
There will not be an instance in which I take blame for something and surrender.

290
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:35,820
I will not forgive any action that may taint my reputation.

291
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,130
You should all be on your best behavior.

292
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,880
Jeez...

293
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,450
Am I the only one that feels something eerie about this?

294
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,210
Kang Ho, you should be on your best behavior. What does that mean?

295
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:56,040
If things go well, then he'll take credit. If not, you take the blame.

296
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,380
I heard it more as he won't stop me from doing whatever I can to catch the criminal...

297
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,710
His cold expression that looks like he would show absolutely no remorse, and his perfect 2:8 split of his hairline.

298
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,860
He's totally my style.

299
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,480

Oh my? 1-10th place are all last week's item...

305
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,060
There's nothing from Fact Trackers...

306
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:51,660
On top of that, the viewer rating that went to 7% with PD Hong hit 2% with your broadcast.

307
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,290
We were just barely able to get ads in the beginning and the end. You had to ruin it with that?

308
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,170
But thanks to Park Jae Min's murder, the flame hasn't been completely extinguished,

309
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,520
so use Park Jae Min's murder as your next topic.

310
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:10,750
However, each team investigate separately. Whoever has the best report will get to air.

311
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,970
What? Are you telling me to go against my junior?

312
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,780
Why not? I like it. It'll add some tension.

313
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,890
What are you doing? Go out there and run until the bottoms of your feet sweat!

314
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,190
Yes, I'll start right away!

315
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,550
Aren't you going to leave?

316
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,330
This time, it'll really be a head to head victory.

317
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,320
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

318
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,900
If we want to beat them, we'll need to have a strong topic or sense of direction.

319
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,280
We have sincerity when handling a topic, which they lack.

320
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,060
But our viewer rating was 2%.

321
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,380
Sorry, I meant to just think it to myself...

322
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,250
It's okay. It's the truth.

323
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,720
That's why this time, we need both sincerity

324
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,660
and and viewer ratings. Let's catch both rabbits- No. Let's catch lion instead.

325
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,240
Lion... Won't we the ones be getting caught by the lion?

326
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,150
Even if we end up getting caught, we have to put up a good fight.

327
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,430
Let's just eat for now. I really spent my entire month's budget for food in this one meal.

328
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,100
You'll have to eat up to have the strength to catch anything.

329
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:38,700
So eat this, and Writers, make use of all your infrastructure to investigate the Park Jae Min murder case.

330
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,110
You. Grab some materials to film some content at the crime scene.

331
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,200
This time, we have to show them what we're made of!

332
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,340
Hwaiting!

333
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,810
They're checking everyone so carefully.

334
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,480
Let's go.

335
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,470
- Hello. 
 - Where are you from?

336
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,330
I'm PD Kang from OCN's 'Fact Trackers'.

337
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,810
OCN 'Fact Trackers' just went in.

338
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:18,360
- What? 
 - Only a certain number of people per broadcasting station is allowed in to preserve the crime scene.

339
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,800
Wait, what do you mean?

340
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,950
Sunbae!

341
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,800
Hey, PD Hong!

342
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,920
I'll investigate it well!

343
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,870
Let's go. Thank you.

344
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,430
What should we do? We're already behind.

345
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:43,540
What do you mean, what should we do? We have to make up for it.

346
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,230
How?

347
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,490
Hey. Follow me.

348
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,100
What are you up to?

349
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,630
Hurry up, you punk! What are you doing?

350
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,850
Even a ghost would find this strange.

351
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:20,390
There are so many CCTV's in this luxury villa, there's no such thing as a blind spot.

352
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,770
There's no evidence of even an ant going in and out of the premises, but he was found dead in his home...

353
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,130
So there's nobody suspicious who entered the place before the incident happened?

354
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,170
The police already came to check everything.

355
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,600
I'll let you know this specific piece of information since we're from the same home town.

356
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,630
But exactly where in Kyeongnam is your home town?

357
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,340
What do you mean, nobody was here?

358
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,550
Was there someone who came?

359
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:47,680
I'm only letting you know because it's so good to see someone from Sabuk in Seoul.

360
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,270
Yesterday, we did an extensive cleaning of the windows on the outer walls.

361
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,990
Could you enter through the windows?

362
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:58,210
Sure, sure. If they wanted to.

363
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,160
Did you find out anything?

364
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,880
I wonder...

365
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,800
Why?

366
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,550
- Here you go. 
 - What about my change?

367
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,570
Thank you.

368
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,680
But what are you so curious about?

369
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,270
It's not much, but I have something to ask.

370
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,360
How are you speaking in the Yeonbyeon dialect?

371
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,340
My father was from Yeonbyeon.

372
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,480
Oh my goodness, it's so nice to meet you.

373
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,300
Ask away. I'll answer as best as I can.

374
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:58,170
Then... would it be okay if I filmed a bit?

375
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,810
- Film? 
 - Yes.

376
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,980
Sure.

377
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,850
Did you also make a delivery to Apt. 203 yesterday?

378
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,970
Yes, but something did seem a bit weird.

379
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,170
What do you mean?

380
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:36,600
I rang the bell because I thought someone was inside.

381
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:43,040
We have some new products. Would you like to try some?

382
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,560
Just leave it outside.

383
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,600
It didn't seem like the owner's voice.

384
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,500
It sounded more like rusty iron?

385
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,340
Anyways, it sounded like he was a bit older.

386
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,420
It didn't seem like the owner's voice.

387
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,000
Is this all? What about the crime scene?

388
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,120
We couldn't go. Only a few people could go per broadcasting station, but PD Hong got inside first.

389
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,160
How could a senior be one-upped by her junior?

390
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,270
We've already made a mistake, and it's just the first step. What should we do now?

391
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,250
Let's all cheer up. Even though we've already messed up the first step,

392
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,120
we can just take another step!

393
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,480
How? Shall I show you?

394
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,740
I'll show you, with my energy!

395
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,820
Like this!

396
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,720
Okay, next time.

397
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,320
But if there was no evidence of anyone entering or leaving the room, isn't this a locked-room murder mystery?

398
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,600
A locked-room murder? It has a nice catch to it.

399
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,390
We've dealt with this a few times before.

400
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,810
The locked-room murder in the apartments in Guamdong, and the unresolved locked-room serial muder.

401
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,720
If we combine Park Jae Min's case as a locked-room murder related to one of those cases,

402
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,860
You mean like "a never-ending locked-room murder case",

403
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,300
or "the identity of a criminal who leaves behind no evidence".

404
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,670
And the bonus is the neverending

405
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,700
dance and passion of Kang Moo Yeong.

406
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,940
It's a joke. Can I not even joke around after being one-upped by my junior?

407
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,420
Fact Trackers

408
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,590
A locked-room serial murder case?

409
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,470
But if you want to connect Park Jae Min's case with the locked-room serial killer cases,

410
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,600
doesn't there need to be a knot?

411
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,090
There does.

412
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,670
That's the signature of the locked-room serial killer.

413
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:50,530
All the victims were tied with different types of ropes, but they were all knotted with the special knot.

414
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,480
It's a type of knot that's very complicated and strong when knotted but easy to undo,

415
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,990
so there was speculation that the culprit would run a banner-tying company or work for a moving company.

416
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:03,050
All the ropes used to tie the victims and weapns used to hurt the victim were things found in the victim's homes.

417
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,850
That's right. There were never signs of not just the criminal entering or leaving the homes of the victims,

418
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:12,680
but also no weapons entering or leaving. That's why it became known as the single-person locked room serial murderer.

419
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,840
The first person who discovered the cases

420
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,050
were all social welfare workers because most of the victims in the locked-room murders

421
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,610
had low socio-economic statuses.

422
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:24,500
Do you want to meet the social welfare workers?

423
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:34,150
I've never received such a kind hand-written letter before.

424
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,180
I'm so relieved to hear that Ka Eun is doing better.

425
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,310
Our Ka Eun is so grateful that you saved her.

426
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,370
If that's the case, I can save her again 100, no 1,000 times, so-

427
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,770
So she should get kidnapped again?

428
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,680
Not at all. I was being uselessly considerate.

429
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:01,660
I'm also kidding. I won't forget what you did for us for life.

430
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,920
But where is Detective Jin?

431
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,210
I have no intent of calling him. All he did was suspect our nice little Ka Eun.

432
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,350
Detective Jin is the one who properly punished Oni, who kidnapped Ka Eun.

433
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,820
We also found out her location thanks to my profiling.

434
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,440
Okay. Then let's just say I am grateful to everyone.

435
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,200
Everybody satisfied, right?

436
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,240
Okay then.

437
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,360
Okay! I will make for the two of you a special cocktail.

438
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,610
But Teddy, you look a bit ashen.

439
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,140
We've just come out with a new face mask from '100-year Life',

440
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,570
there's green tea, lemon,

441
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,700
Why? Is your throat a bit dry?

442
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,190
What's wrong with your voice?

443
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:59,050
What do you mean what's wrong? I drank the bellflower root and pear extract you sold me and lost my precious voice.

444
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,850
It'll get better soon. The healing crisis is-

445
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,930
It's getting worse before it starts getting better.

446
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,820
Is this the process of eczema getting better?

447
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,380
This is the process of...

448
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,070
pimples replacing eczema!

449
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,950
Antagonism is something '100 Year Life' really believes in and-

450
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,500
That's too far.

451
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,440
Too far?

452
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,170
Mr. Tak, leave those face masks here.

453
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,920
I knew I could count on you, Teddy.

454
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,520
Why are you still alone, CEO Jung?

455
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,060
You're manly and considerate. Women love men like you.

456
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,400
In a case like this, it's due to the man having been hurt in the past.

457
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,120
For example, he may have parted ways in an unfortunate way with someone he loved.

458
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,440
That doesn't even make sense. Are you filming an 80's movie?

459
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,570
Why? You might as well say they died of leukemia.

460
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:09,430
It was osteoporosis.

461
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,750
What?

462
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:17,990
My Young Sook Noonim (formal way to say "noona") had weak bones, she slipped on a snowy road and hit her head...

463
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,490
How... much older was she?

464
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,770
If she was in that health at that age, she was very healthy..

 (Jo Yong Pil's "Tragic Love")

466
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,430
Hello. I'm PD Kang from Fact Trackers. I contacted you earlier.

467
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,440
I came to meet social welfare worker Ko Seung Woo.

468
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,490
You called me, right?

469
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,940
- Oh yes, hello. 
 - Hello.

470
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,670
One moment please.

471
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,170
Welcome in.

472
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:03,170
I should've dressed up a bit more, but I was in a rush.

473
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:07,710
We're grateful that you were able to even come. The weather has been so cold these days,

474
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,340
you must have many boiler maintenance cases to catch up on.

475
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,870
Yes, well. I'll have to try my best to make time to help all the elders.

476
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,640
Thanks to you, Mr. Noh, I always feel assured.

477
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,020
- Please head inside. 
 - Sure.

478
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,390
Hello, welcome in.

479
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,660
I'm sorry about that. Hello.

480
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:29,930
No worries. Is there an event going on?

481
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,580
Every year, we invite all the social welfare volunteers

482
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,080
and give everyone a plaque of our appreciation. 
 - I see.

483
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,440
- Please come this way. 
 - Okay.

484
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:46,240
It's already been five years.

485
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,000
I went looking for one of the elderly men I was in charge of because I couldn't reach him for a few days.

486
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,940
Elders just take an instant...

487
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,200
Grandpa?

488
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,340
Grandpa Bong Goo, are you in there?

489
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,140
The password...

490
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,900
Grandpa?

491
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,400
Grandpa Bong Goo?

492
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,840
Grandpa?

493
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,240
Grandpa Bong Goo?

494
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,500
Grandpa, are you sleeping?

495
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,460
It's so cold.

496
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,400
Grandpa!

497
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,580
He was such a kind man.

498
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,740
According to the police who investigated at the time,

499
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,890
there were no signs of the criminal having entered his home.

500
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,950
But... why are you suddenly asking about such an old case?

501
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:19,060
About that... The show that I'm working on is thinking of

502
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,190
trying to analyze the locked-room serial killer case.

503
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:24,940
I seemed that most of the victims were from this area,

504
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,330
that you're in charge of.

505
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:29,840
Don't even mention it. I suffered so much because of those cases.

506
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,380
I was even investigated by the police as a suspect for the murders.

507
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,640
I gave my alibi and stripped myself of all suspicion,

508
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,010
but there were still fake news about me all over the internet.

509
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,660
This time, we will make sure to be careful about the broadcast so you don't face similar misunderstandings.

510
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,850
Thank you so much for agreeing to do this interview.

511
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,020
One moment please.

512
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,440
- What? 
 - Sunbae, hurry up and check YouTube live.

513
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,290
Hello dear viewers.

514
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:08,710
Today, we will be hosting a live Fact Trackers YouTube session

515
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,340
with the best profiler in the country, Mr. Pi Cheon Woo.

516
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,940
- Professor, thank you so much for being our guest today. 
 - It's a pleasure to be here.

517
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:19,440
Recently, Park Jae Min, who faced no charges despite having murdered someone because he was a minor at the time the crime was committed

518
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,140
and boiled the blood of all citizens of our country, was found murdered in his own home. 
 - Yes.

519
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:28,580
Do you think this case could be related to the locked-room serial killer cases?

520
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,060
I think there is a good possibility.

521
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,800
The locked-room serial cases are also

522
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,980
discussed in depth in this book I recently published.

523
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,050
Because the criminal who killed Park Jae Min believes that his victim deserved to die,

524
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,470
he is likely very similar to Im Moo Hyeong,

525
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,770
who feels no regret towards his actions.

526
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:45,870
I see. In that case,

527
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:50,580
does that mean the criminal thinks of himself as a judge who purifies society?

528
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,890
Yes. On top of being addicted to murder, they have their own rationale

529
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,160
as well as their delusions of grandeur adding to the picture.

530
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,020
It's likely they think that, since they killed Park Jae Min, who many people criticized,

531
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:04,020
they think they could become some sort of hero.

532
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:09,580
A serial murderer who also rationalizes their behavior and has delusions of grandeur. Just the thought is chilling.

533
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:14,580
Our precinct in Geumpyeong is trying our best to find and arrest the culprit of Park Jae Min's murder.

534
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,160
To all the citizens of our country: Please don't be bewildered or shaken by rumors

535
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,770
floating around, but wait and trust in our work.

536
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:25,260
Is it true that Park Jae Min's case is related to the locked-room serial killer?

537
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,840
We are investing with all possibilities open.

538
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,550
Whether the culprit is a serial killer or not, we will be sure to catch him.

539
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:36,960
The person preparing the meal has no intentions of feeding him, but he's already thinking of dessert.

540
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,300
Anyways, Fact Trackers is always the problem.

541
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,240
They've really done it again this time.

542
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,880
That 2:8 is also an issue.

543
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,120
Today, it's almost 1:9, isn't?

544
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:53,270
How can your hair part like that?

545
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,320
He pulled it all the way to the side. So much.

546
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,950
Shoe Repair
 Zipper and Bag Repair
Key Copies

547
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,280
We are investing with all possibilities open.

548
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,760
Whether the culprit is a serial killer or not, we will be sure to catch him.

549
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,680
On top of being addicted to murder, they have their own rationale

550
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,180
as well as their delusions of grandeur adding to the picture.

551
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,890
It's likely they think that, since they killed Park Jae Min, who many people criticized,

552
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,310
they think they could become some sort of hero.

553
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,490
I think that's what their psychological process may be.

554
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:25,680
A serial murderer who also rationalizes their behavior and has delusions of grandeur.

555
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,680
Just the thought is chilling. 
 - Hey!

556
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,440
Goodness, you scared me. What's wrong?

557
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,370
I'm already at a loss for word that you stole someone else's item,

558
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,330
but you dare to use such sly methods to release that information? 
 - Goodness.

559
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:41,310
Did you also think that Park Jae Min's case would be related to the locked-room serial killer?

560
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,710
Wow... People must all really think the same thing.

561
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,810
We must be having some kind of connection now.

562
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,190
What?

563
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,110
One minute.

564
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,890
It's the chief.

565
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:54,270
Yes, Chief?

566
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,280
Did you see the YouTube broadcast?

567
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,340
Of course! Yes!

568
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:09,880
There's ethics in our field of work, too.

569
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,570
She's eating us up too raw.

570
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,370
She's really asking for it.

571
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:20,130
It's a war now. They blasted the first shot.

572
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,740
What do we do now?

573
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:26,640
Since our hook has been stolen, we need to do something else that will captivate the audience.

574
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,620
I'll take a look, so you should go grab a meal.

575
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,510
- Can I really do that? 
 - Yea, go eat.

576
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,580
What the hell? Why won't it turn on?

577
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,220
Who are you?

578
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,210
Who the hell are you?

579
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,200
Wait a minute!

580
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,720
Who are you?

581
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,960
What the heck?

582
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,100
Ouch, my hair! My hair!

583
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,000
My hair! Wait!

584
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,520
Who are you? Hey!

585
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,560
What the hell?

586
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,300
Fact Trackers?

587
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,780
What? It's poodle?

588
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,400
Are you crazy? Are you a dog? Why would you bite a person?

589
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,740
You're the one that attacked us first!

590
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,000
When did you last wash your hair.

591
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,670
Maybe 10 days ago?

592
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,710
It's a joke! A joke! How did you even get in here?

593
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:27,520
This window.

594
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:32,480
How can ordinary citizens just enter a crime scene like this?

595
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,610
People who are in the broadcasting industry really...

596
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,440
You broadcast cases that are still being investigated.

597
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,170
How is that different from fake news?

598
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,650
Fake news? It's a rational suspicion!

599
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:44,040
Even the famous Dr. Pi said that there was a good chance.

600
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,850
Famous? Fame can turn into fate in an instant.

601
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:54,980
Forget it. Was Park Jae Min tied up when he was found?

602
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,420
This.

603
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,430
Was he tied up?

604
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,320
Were his hands...

605
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,280
It's not it.

606
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,310
Why? What? What are you trying to speculate now?

607
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,530
Get out of there. Get up!

608
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:14,070
- Wait. 
 - Why would you lay down there?

609
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,930
Goodness, get up!

610
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,370
Stop moving. Stop!

611
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:22,300
This person is crazy! Won't you put that away? Put it away.

612
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,520
Get out, get out.

613
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,110
Leave, leave, leave. Okay?

614
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:28,700
Get out of there before I put you in jail for interfering with

615
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,680
the work of a public officer! 
 - There wasn't even much for us to interfere with!

616
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,550
Wait, wait. Just tell me if Park Jae Min was tied.

617
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:37,210
Was there anything special about his body? Just tell me that!

618
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,200
Then I'll leave? I'll walk out!

619
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,430
Let go of me! Come on!

620
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,570
Did you film anything?

621
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,700
I could've only filmed if there was an opportunity for me to.

622
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,770
That punk... If only he wasn't a cop I would've killed him already.

623
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:58,410
My back is killing me, it hurts so much.

624
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,540
Why are you complaining about your back when you've been single all your life?

625
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,370
I even chewed on that person's hair.

626
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,210
Goodness, just thinking of it is disgusting.

627
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:10,270
Why did he have to come in at that exact timing?

628
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:15,460
- You take this camera and look around the area. See if there's anything that points towards the locked-room case. 
 - Okay.

629
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,740
Hurry. Hurry!

630
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:24,440
If they've investigated the scene, they should've locked the windows.

631
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,420
Are they even trying to preserve the premises?

632
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,680
There must be a way to get in here...

633
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,240
If the criminal wasn't even caught on camera...

634
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,430
He's so petty.

635
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,170
What the hell?

636
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,580
Unidentified Caller

637
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,520
Hello?

638
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,070
Listen from your car.

639
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,080
What the hell?

640
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,850
In case of fire, destroy this wall?

641
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,720
Who are you?

642
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,080
I know who killed Park Jae Min.

643
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,990
What is this?

Well, there are always two options.

656

Be an outstanding producer,

We're part of the same team.

00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:02,980
- Start! 
 - Like a dog?

661
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,890
There's someone I really want to catch.

662
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:10,020
Are you going to arrest me again?
