Episode 10

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,780
Huh?

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,480
What is this?

7
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,600
Unidentified Caller

8
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,140
Unidentified Caller

9
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,410
Hello?

10
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,480
Stay in your car and listen.

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,050
Who are you?

12
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,590
I know who killed Park Jae Min.

13
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,440
Um... Wow, is that so?

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,470
If you want to know who the culprit is, do as I say.

15
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,630
Are you not the culprit?

16
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,040
How are you going to prove this isn't some kind of prank?

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,870
If I had time to prove things like that, I would have poked out your eyeballs and cut off your tongue first.

18
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,190
If you want to know who the criminal is, take down that stupid YouTube video,

19
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,590
and acknowledge that you were wrong. If you do that, I'll call you back.

20
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,370
Hell- Hello? Hello?

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,240
Unidentified Caller

22
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,370
What the hell? Is this real?

23
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,660
What's this? In case of fire, destroy this wall?

24
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,250
Huh?

25
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,480
What?

26
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,500
What is this?

27
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,680
Oh, right. They put a fake wall in the veranda so you can escape to your neighbor's apartment in case of a fire.

28
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,050
They came in through the neighbor...

29
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,930
Check the CCTV and see if anyone entering or leaving the neighborhood's home before and after the incident.

30
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,700
There will be lots of people who came here, because it was a model home.

31
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,390
Okay.

32
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,260

34
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,590
I look good.

35
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,960
My jawline is great.

Team Bulldog: Off-duty Investigation

37
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,520
Great Detective, Tak Won's Office. A different scale detective with...

38
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,850
a dog-like ability to handle business. Woof Woof?

39
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,390
What do you mean?

40
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,950
Goodness...

41
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,610
A different scale detective with a thunder-like ability to handle business.

42
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,480
Dammit. The 'bun' character is missing. 
 (T/N - thunder is 'bun gae' and dog is 'gae')

43
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,280
But looking at the subcontractors, I think people will ask you to commit murder, not come to you with cases of incidents.

44
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,420
'Bun'

45
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,720
So you're saying someone left this phone in your car?

46
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,380
Have you checked the name on the phone and your dash cam?

47
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,990
I looked into the phone but of course it was a cloned phone,

48
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,920
and I sold my dash cam ages ago, because I was running low on cash.

49
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,410
Oh no. Years are forming at news of your poverty.

50
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,100
Do you have no interest of joining me in my work?

51
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,430
Nope. Please just help me with generosity as great as Einstein's.

52
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,110
You mean Schiweitzer, not Einstein.

53
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,430
This looks like the 10th locked-room case which occurred in 2012.

54
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,530
It's the same person, and the knot is tied the same way.

55
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,520
Oh? Wa-wait a minute.

56
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,310
Does that mean I really had a phone call with the locked-room serial killer?

57
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,930
There's a high chance that's true. What did he say to you?

58
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,560
I know who killed Park Jae Min. If you want to know the culprit, do as I say.

59
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,760
That's the basics of a deal. Take and give.

60
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,290
It's it backwards? Give and take.

61
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,550
No, no. Since it's more advantageous to get what you want first.

62
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,820
So what did he tell you to do?

63
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,480
He told me to first take down the YouTube Live video that PD Hong put up.

64
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,310
- Oh, the one that featured Dr. Pi, who isn't as attractive as me? 
 - Yes, Detective Durian.

65
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,690
He also told us to post a video saying that we were wrong.

66
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,390
I guess his pride must have taken a hit.

67
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,610
A character trait of serial killers

68
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:17,170
is an inability to contain their anger when people don't recognize or misinterpret their murders.

69
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,710
Then what should we do? We can try to do something about the posted video,

70
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,130
but in the perspective of a broadcasting station, an apology video

71
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,300
is not something I can decide on myself.

72
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, there are always two options.

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,570
Do as the man says,

74
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,800
and become an outstanding PD that conducted the first interview in history with the serial killer himself,

75
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,350
or just ignore him and continue living as one of many PD's in this world.

76
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,870
What if this is all just a prank?

77
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,240
Don't worry about that.

78
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,070
We have 100 Year's Good Life. I'll help you.

79
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,290
Shut up. Even if I become unemployed, I wouldn't go there.

80
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,590
Why did he have to live next to the model home? Everyone's fingerprints and DNA is mixed in the apartment complex.

81
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sure he used that to his advantage.

82
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,460
Why does everyone already look so down?

83
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,820
- What is this? 
 - Share it.

84
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,850
Everyone, drink one and recharge your sugar levels.

85
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,360
Thank you!

86
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,920
Amatta, did you find anything in the CCTV's?

87
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,410
Yes, look at this.

88
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,420
Doesn't this person look like the culprit?

89
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,600
So he went in pretending to be looking around the apartment,

90
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,030
then used the fake wall in the veranda to enter Park Jae Min's home and kill him,

91
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,600
then slipped out after everyone else left.

92
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,610
Wow... I just got the chills.

93
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,490
The materials he used for his crime must be in that suitcase, since he left the body as is.

94
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,480
If we can just find that suitcase, then we would have overflowing amounts of evidence.

95
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,410
We can't tell at all who it is because he's wearing a hat and a mask.

96
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,830
Well, since we have the CCTV footage now,

97
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,260
conduct a witness investigation on all the people who entered and left the apartment.

98
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,690
Check all of their alibi's again.

99
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,750
Okay.

100
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,110
Can you see something? It's the same screen.

101
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,600
I know. I can see it with my eyes.

102
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,240
Really? Who is it?

103
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,730
- Hey Amatta. 
 - Yes?

104
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,720
Let's be sneaky and use a search warrant.

105
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,250
Huh? 
 [Geumpyeong Police Station]

106
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,680
A search warrant for a home?

107
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,410
Even though 10 years as passed, I can't even use a search warrant as I please.

108
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,280
I opened the door for you since you brought a search warrant, but what's going on?

109
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,900
The old couple are very proper, law-abiding people.

110
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,030
Well, it'll be over soon, so don't worry. Thank you.

111
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,660
Why is she so suspicious? Hey, look around carefully okay?

112
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,560
Okay.

113
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,800
Huh? Hey, long time no see! How have you been?

114
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,460
- L-Leave right now. 
 - What's wrong?

115
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,860
- Leave! Leave! 
 - Do you need to pee again?

116
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,540
Why are you being like this? Let go! Let's just talk.

117
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,830
Goodness, I can't flip you over. So heavy.

118
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,750
Ouch!

119
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,930
Let's just talk.

120
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,270
I'm looking for a suit case, but I have a feeling it'll be here.

121
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,750
I found it!

122
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,200
He found it.

123
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,260
It's identical to the one that's in the CCTV footage.

124
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,000
Wow, this is irrefutable evidence.

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,040
Let's take him first and conduct an investigation.

126
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,750
No. If we catch him without conclusive evidence and then have to let him go again,

127
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,320
it's hard to re-arrest him.

128
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,540
Goodness. I can't repeat the mistake I made 10 years ago.

129
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,600
Ask the forensics team to process this immediately.

130
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,850
- Okay. 
 - Goodness...

131
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,050
Long time no see. I knew you would come after I got Deok Su's call.

132
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,190
I heard you took a suitcase.

133
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,360
Are you going to arrest me again?

134
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,530
Well, I wonder. I'm a bit busy these days.

135
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,440
How long will it take to clean these?

136
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,620
They're dress shoes.

137
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,380
They're the pair that I cherish the most. My mom bought them for me on my birthday.

138
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,600
There's someone I really want to arrest,

139
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,800
but I'm going to wear these and show them off after I catch him.

140
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,290
So please clean them well, with all your sincerity. I'll be back soon to get them.

141
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,780
So with this video that we don't even know if it's real or fake,

142
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,410
you want to not only take down PD Hong's video but also post an apology video? After we've gotten over a million views?

143
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,690
Station Chief.

144
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,220
I'm certain this video is real. I've confirmed it with a professional.

145
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,720
Who's a more skilled professional than Dr. Pi in this field?

146
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,140
There is! He's called Detective Durian.

147
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,030
Who's that?

148
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,590
Anyways, please help us. Don't you think this seems like it would be an exclusive scoop?

149
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,780
Trust is the life of running a successful show. The risk of making an apology requires a guaranteed benefit to counteract it.

150
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,940
If we correct ourselves, we just become wrong.

151
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,690
There is a guaranteed benefit to counter act it. He said he would call me back if we took down the video.

152
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,480
Who said that? This so-called Mr. Serial Killer? And if he doesn't?

153
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,090
Why are you being so pessimistic. We need to live with a bit more trust around here.

154
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,620
You want to live with more trust towards a serial killer?

155
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,800
I mean... what I mean is that he could be a serial killer who is unexpectedly like a knife to his promise. 
 (T/N expression meaning 'true to his word')

156
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,580
What if my neck becomes cut with that knife?

157
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,340
This is not just an issue pertaining to Fact Trackers!

158
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,410
Without any certainty, you definitely cannot do this.

159
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,680
What do you all think?

160
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,110
You want to conduct an interview with a serial killer that hasn't even been caught?

161
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,190
This isn't the first case in our nation's history.

162
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,130
It's the first in the world.

163
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,670
But won't it be too dangerous?

164
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:26,110
There's an issue of morals regarding what we can broadcast. Since even the Chief is against it, if things go wrong, I think you'll be fired...

165
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:32,040
We can't just keep acting leisurely like this. The broadcast is just a nose's length away, and it's true we're miles behind the other team.

166
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,680
It's another possibility that we post the video, but then the serial killer ghosts us.

167
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,590
They would have gotten everything they want at that point. Would they bother contacting us again?

168
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,140
We can make him contact us again.

169
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,330
How?

170
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,540
We provoke him.

171
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,580
He only told us to take down the original video and then post a new one correcting ourselves, but he didn't give us a detailed guide as to what content to include.

172
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,450
Hello, I am PD Kang Moo Yeong of Fact Trackers.

173
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,070
First, I offer you an apology.

174
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,520
The video that we released in advance which states that the murderer could be a "secret room" serial killer,

175
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,390
we've concluded that it was a hasty conclusion, so we are issuing a correction.

176
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:40,750
The "secret room" serial killer has been targeting the elderly because they were weak and easy to dominate.

177
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,380
We estimated that based on his crime pattern, he is smaller than normal,

178
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,780
and that there is a high possibility that he suffers from antisocial personality disorder.

179
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,000
As a result, the killer who killed Park Jae Min, a robust man in his 20s

180
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,840
would appear to be a little different.

181
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,790
PD Kang is properly messing with him.

182
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,140
She is definitely provoking him. That he doesn't have the capability to kill Park Jae Min.

183
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,070
With this much belittling, the "secret room" serial killer may even sue for damages.

184
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:14,190
He appears to be someone who has the shameful desire to show off his strength as a man by killing these victims.

185
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,650
What is that?

186
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,820
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

187
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,790
It looks like he won't call, will he? It's been a while since the broadcast was aired.

188
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,980
Looks like the provocation didn't work.

189
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,930
Station Chief

190
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,690
It's Station Chief. What do we do now?

191
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,820
It can't be helped.

192
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,890
We go to Plan B.

193
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,480
- Do we have such a thing?
 - We don't. I'm trying to think of one now.

194
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,480
Since he won't contact you, you will catch him yourself?

195
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,440
You are passionate as always, PD Kang.

196
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,650
If I don't get an interview with the "secret room" serial killer, my neck will be on the line.

197
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,190
I flattered you quite a bit, so how about helped me out?

198
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,440
Okay.

199
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,550
Why saying yes so easily all of a sudden?

200
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,620
If you pay me appropriate fees for my services, that is.

201
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,560
To someone who sold her dashcam because she didn't have money for food? How cruel.

202
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,990
To compare, I received 1,000,000 wons from Detective Jin last time.

203
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,610
For you, I will be sympathetic to your circumstance and settle for 300,000 wons. ($300)

204
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,660
50,000 wons ($50) including transportation and food.

205
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,400
PD Kang, I am Tak Won, the best profiler in all of Korea—

206
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,550
- 30,000 wons, then ($30).
 - Hey.

207
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,120
PD Kang, are you really going to be like this? 30,000 wons? You are being too much.

208
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,530
Fine, 50,000 wons.

209
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,140
Of course, you should give me at least that much. Goodness...

210
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,370
End of negotiation.

211
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,620
Hold on.

212
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,640
Let's begin work now, huh?

213
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,340
Doctor?

214
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,450
You startled me.

215
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,820
There's a new product, so I'm testing it out. They may be deceased, but you still can't just use anything, can you?

216
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,440
How about it? Do I look alive?

217
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,220
Yes, you look so alive that you look like you will convulse.

218
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,110
What brings you here at this hour?

219
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:27,390
Doctor, when you were at the NFS, did you work on the "secret room" serial killing case?

220
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,400
I worked on all of them, except the ones that happened after I resigned. But why?

221
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,290
I am reporting on that case and I need you help, Doctor Lee.

222
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,950
If it's your request, PD Kang, I will do anything.

223
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,090
You rescued my Ka Eun, what wouldn't I do for you?

224
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:48,220
Oh, come on, you're embarrassing me. I really do love this attitude.

225
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,080
I heard about it from Mr. Tak. For something like this, we must help you.

226
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,850
Ah, indeed.

227
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,190
Red-Zone is a subcontractor of my private investigator firm, so you can negotiate with me on the fees.

228
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,220
Who says you can do that?

229
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,320
I know best what I am worth.

230
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:11,620
Unfortunately, I don't have money. Maybe we can work out a payment plan?

231
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,030
Then just give us 20,000 wons. ($20)

232
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,420
In that case, I will accept 15,000 wons. ($15)

233
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,480
I don't need money, PD Kang. We are on the same team, after all.

234
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,650
Look here, fellows. You can't sell your precious selves for such a pittance.

235
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,030
You should negotiate properly like I did

236
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,010
and receive at least 50,000 wons, don't you think?

237
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,950
Owner gives us 5,000,000 wons for our wages. ($5,000)

238
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,770
We don't need much money.

239
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,870
It's true.

240
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,080
Yes, some land I purchased previously is being redeveloped.

241
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,410
So I am not as rich as Detective Jin, but I do alright.

242
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,930
Do you need a part-time worker, by any chance?

243
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,900
How can this be?

244
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,030
Park Jae Min's DNA wasn't found in the suitcase.

245
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:18,580
If there were weapons in the suitcase, I'm positive we would have found Jae Min's DNA on it.

246
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,030
What were the results?

247
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,610
Just the grandma and grandpa's fingerprints and hair.

248
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,230
Results 
 99% mismatch

249
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,890
No wonder...

250
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,370
I thought it was weird we found it so easily.

251
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,640
What do we do now?

252
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,720
We have to start over from square one.

253
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,920
There's a singular survivor to the locked-room serial murder.

254
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Witness

255
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,580
Son Ji Young. This woman?

256
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,000
I met her at the time,

257
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,380
I didn't see anything. 

258
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,980
I was too scared.

259
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,850
she couldn't remember because she was so shocked. Then she disappeared.

260
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,350
There wasn't even a trace of her living anywhere.

261
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:14,010
She just moved out. She was in a rush, as if she was being chased by something.

262
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,460
She probably went into hiding because she's scared.

263
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,300
That's why I'm going to meet her family.

264
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,770
You, try to find out the call history of people who knew Son Ji Young.

265
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,770
See if anyone was in contact with her.

266
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,430
Okay.

267
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,060
I heard you were looking for me?

268
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,490
Hello.

269
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,830
I'm Detective Jin from the Geumpyeong precinct.

270
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,650
Are you Ms. Son Ji Young's father?

271
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,750
I got a divorce with my wife a few years ago, so it's been a while since I've last seen her.

272
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,890
I am aware of that. I came because I was wondering if I could get her phone number.

273
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,650
There's no way for us to find Ms. Son Ji Young or her mother.

274
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,640
I don't know either. We've never been in contact after we got a divorce.

275
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,790
Please don't come looking for me again.

276
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,100
Don't you think there's a reason for her disappearance?

277
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,090
I'll send you the address and the phone number. 

278
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,050
I'll send you the address and the phone number. 

279
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,070
I'll send you the address and the phone number. 

280
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,980
I'll send you the address and the phone number. 

281
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,710
I'll send you the address and the phone number. 

282
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,150
143 26th Giyeon Road, Yang Mi Villa 2nd Floor 

283
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,830
143 26th Giyeon Road 

284
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,130
Is anyone home?

285
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,670
Excuse me?

286
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,820
Who are you?

287
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,750
Do you remember me?

288
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,280
10 years ago, I met Ms. Son Ji Young in the hospital ward.

289
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,990
Excuse me- Ma'am, please.

290
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,910
Can you please make just a little bit of time for me?

291
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,810
Why did you come looking for us again? Why?

292
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,970
Can't you tell from us living in hiding like this?

293
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,660
I'm very sorry. There has been another case in 10 years.

294
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,220
In order to catch the victim, we need Ms. Ji Young to act as a witness.

295
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,570
T-T-Then...

296
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,250
that's more reason that you shouldn't have come!

297
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,110
That thing happened to us last time after you came!

298
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,870
Please go back. Never come back!

299
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,840
Wait-

300
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,910
What do you mean, that thing?

301
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,450
Did someone come to your hospital ward 10 years ago?

302
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:03,280
Does that change anything?

303
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,330
Do you know how we've endured up til now?

304
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:12,820
Do you know how our child is living?

305
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,370
Ji Young.

306
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,410
The detective that we've met before is here.

307
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,530
He wants to speak with you.

308
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,000
Ji Young, I'll open the door, okay?

309
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,200
Ms. Son Ji Young?

310
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,770
Can you recognize me? I met you briefly 10 years ago.

311
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,980
I have a few things to ask you. It'll be short.

312
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,020
Why did you suddenly disappear then?

313
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,720
Did someone visit you in the hospital ward?

314
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,780
Was it... this person?

315
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,310
Leave. Leave. Leave!

316
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,890
Leave! Mom. Mom!

317
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,750
Ji Young, it's okay. It's okay.

318
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,100
Mom! Mom!

319
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,840
It's okay. It's okay.

320
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,180
- Ji Young! It's okay. 
 - I don't want to!

321
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,890
Mom is here.

322
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,410
Mom?

323
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,480
I told you you wouldn't be living even if you're alive.

324
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,210
If I meet you again, I'll definitely kill you then.

325
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,450
What's wrong? What?

326
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,250
Mom... He was here.

327
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,290
He's here!

328
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,580
Ji Young, come to your senses!

329
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,040
Mom, let's run away.

330
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,610
If you've seen that, then please stop coming here.

331
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm sick of moving now.

332
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,660
I'm sorry.

333
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:30,840
This is an organization that protects and supports victims of crimes.

334
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,740
If you give them a call, you should be able to get assistance.

335
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,800
And this... It isn't much, but pleas use it for

336
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,340
your daughter's treatment and living costs.

337
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,180
I will be sure to catch that criminal.

338
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,520
The report is lengthy, but it basically means you still haven't been able to narrow down a list of suspects.

339
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,780
Well, we haven't found any conclusive evidence or found any witnesses.

340
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,450
I can't tell if you're all lazy or lack skill.

341
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,090
It's been two full days since my press conference,

342
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,800
but you must not be considering the citizens who are shaking in fear.

343
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,940
Next time, instead of a report that discusses just the process in length, bring me a report with some results!

344
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,760
I'm telling you to use any means necessary to catch the criminal!

345
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,850
Why is he telling us to do the work after saying whatever the hell he wanted during the press conference?

346
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,930
Goodness... Think of the citizens shaking in fear? He only cares about his promotion.

347
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,320
They said you can't even find dog poop to use as medicine when you're desperate. Where did this punk go?

348
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,800
Huh? It's coming right over there, the dog poop.

349
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,930
Who's dog poo?

350
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,620
- There's someone like that. You don't have to know. 
 - I feel like you're talking about me.

351
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,960
Amatta. Did you find her? Was it Son Ji Young?

352
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,050
I did, but it'll be too much to expect anything from her.

353
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,900
Goodness... This isn't some kind of repeat sign.

354
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,920
The case keeps returning to square one.

355
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,620
Wait ,wait. Son Ji Young?

356
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,500
Are you still thinking that the Utility Knife serial murderer is the person who killed Park Jae Min?

357
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:29,090
It's not like they're not related at all. We don't even have a single suspect!

358
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,840
Sure. Do whatever you want. Whatever.

359
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,110
Who could stop you? It'll be a relief if you get lucky.

360
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,570
However, don't act rashly like you did ten years ago.

361
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,580
- Nice! With age, you lose energy and give up quickly. 
 - This little punk-

362
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,080
Okay! This dog poop who can't even be used as medicine will try finding something.

363
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,010
Let's see. 
 Utility Knife Serial Killer

364
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,130
Is this all materials from the Utility Knife case?

365
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:58,940
Look through all of it from the very beginning. I'm sure we've missed something.

366
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,000
You want me to go through all of this alone?

367
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,570
If you have the persistence to call your ex-girlfriend 100 times, this will be easy.

368
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,150
With your endless attachment and shamelessness,

369
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,950
dig in deep through all of the files.

370
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:16,140
"Though I may not have caught my ex, I will definitely catch the serial killer!"

371
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,320
Use those qualities that made your ex girlfriend shiver in dislike

372
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,900
to your advantage here, okay? 
 - Sunbae, please!

373
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,570
Amatta, you embodiment of lingering attachment.

374
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,700
Good luck. I have lots of work to do.

375
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,870
Wow...

376
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,650
Hello.

377
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,530
Why are you so late? We're already done setting everything up.

378
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,760
I was stopping by the forensics office.

379
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,060
But don't you think that you're putting the cart before the horse? Why is it a given that we meet here?

380
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:59,770
Detective Tak's office is a bit hective, and Mr. Teddy's place is his business.

381
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,630
This office is the most spacious and convenient. Plus the AC is great, too.

382
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,180
What's the point of the AC being great when it's not even summer? Did you turn it on?

383
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,920
I'm just saying I'm comfortable here. Shall we start?

384
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,110
Jeez...

385
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,530
Is Detective Jin not coming? He said he was going to catch the culprit.

386
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,240
No chance. If the poodle joins us, he'll go to prison as soon as he's caught. We can't have that.

387
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,910
I need to get an interview first, and then hand him over to the police.

388
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:25,520
I mean, even if you don't want to use hand-cuffs, won't we need someone's wallet. It'll be costly to investigate all of this.

389
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,880
You must all have gotten a taste of money, judging from how much you spent last time.

390
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,130
For today, let's just go with us. We'll debate adding Detective Jin to the picture later.

391
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,760
- Sure. 
 - Okay.

392
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,530
Let's start.

393
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,710
First, what are the locked-room serial killings?

394
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:47,240
The locked-room serial killings refer to a total of 15 cases which range from 2005 until now.

395
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,040
The victims were all elders who lived alone.

396
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,750
The reason we started calling these 'locked-room murders' is because

397
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:57,610
the victims were all killed in their homes, but there were no evidences of people entering or leaving the premises.

398
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,590
In addition, all of the weapons used were materials found in the victim's homes.

399
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,780
The most obvious commonality in all these cases are the knots used when the victims were tied together.

400
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,430
It's a type of knot that makes it very easy to pull apart.

401
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,420
Things like this usually are done subconsciously, because it's so habitual for them.

402
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:18,880
That's exactly correct. It's likely this occurred as part of a habit in their workplace or hobby.

403
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,720
Then, what interesting details were found in the autopsy results?

404
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,240
The cause of deaths were all due to excessive bleeding as a result of lacerations and wounds.

405
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,760
However, the victims bodies show no signs of attempted defense.

406
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,840
Drug tests results turned positive for sedatives, but there were no signs of a needle being used on the victim's bodies.

407
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,960
It's obvious. They probably put it in some food before feeding it to the victims.

408
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,260
If they knew of all the elderly people who were living alone,

409
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,020
it's likely the criminal was a local social welfare worker or the director of the community service center.

410
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,180
No, not at all.

411
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:52,010
We found trace evidence in on of the screws of the cell phone that was left in PD Kang's car.

412
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,230
Hmm...

413
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,210
We found nitrogen oxide and phosphate traces.

414
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,020
Nitrogen oxide is typically found in industrial areas,

415
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,940
and phosphate traces are used in food processing or fertilizers.

416
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,650
So it's likely the criminal works in the food processing industry or a fertilizing industry.

417
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:27,100
There are plenty of such companies in Seoul. This will be as difficult as finding a Mr. Kim in all of Seoul.

418
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,880
Oh! I recently got a picture that tells us a bit more about the knot.

419
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,290
- What is it? 
 - Here.

420
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,410
It's the same knot, right?

421
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,510
It's near a dumpster. Where is this?

422
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,880
It didn't say the location. They just sent me this picture.

423
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,870
Don't worry. If it's an area, I can narrow it down.

424
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,350
In the case of a serial killer, if they don't get caught for their crimes,

425
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:56,240
they gain confidence and the location of the crimes committed get closer and closer to the actual home of the criminal.

426
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,450
It's called the return tendencies of a serial killer.

427
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:04,100
Look here. In the locked-room serial killer, they stuck around the northwest part of Seoul at first.

428
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,300
Recently, cases have been coming up in Dongpyeonggu,

429
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,010
so it's likely the criminal lives in Dongpyeonggu.

430
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,290
Dongpyeonggu... Dongpyeonggu.

431
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,410
Wait a minute. Dongpyeonggu...

432
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,340
Dongpyeonggu, huh? 
 Dongpyeong Foods

433
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,150
Oh right! There's a foods factory in Dongpyeong.

434
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,540
Then are we finally catching him?

435
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,960
Let's not jump to conclusions, Teddy.

436
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,660
We can't be sure yet that the person who left the phone in PD Kang's car is the locked-room serial killer.

437
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,040
He could've just been doing it for the killer.

438
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,250
We should still try searching.

439
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,120
Everyone should also keep an eye out for any waste papers, too.

440
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,860
- Okay. Let's go. 
 - Okay.

441
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,010
Sounds good.

442
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,010
What brings you here?

443
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,580
Hello. We called earlier.

444
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,630
I'm PD Kang from OCN's Fact Trackers.

445
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,590
Please come this way.

446
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,340
All of you worked after hours three days ago?

447
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,500
Did nobody leave earlier?

448
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,760
Not at all. That day was right before our delivery date.

449
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,930
But what case are you investigating?

450
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:45,690
This man must be the detective.

451
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:50,130
- I'm- 
 - Yes. He's Team Leader Jung Man Bok from the Geumpyeong precinct.

452
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,270
We're investigating a stolen vehicle.

453
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,420
Oh no! None of our workers would do something like that.

454
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,220
Though I'm sure you'll be able to find the culprit and do investigations.

455
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,090
I'm going to find that punk and bury him alive.

456
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,830
What?

457
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,800
It's just an expression meaning he will do whatever it takes to catch the criminal.

458
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,860
Oh... Yes, you should catch him.

459
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,910
Factories that produce carcinogens must be destroyed!

460
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,450
Are you okay?

461
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,730
I'm fine.

462
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,990
I guess it'll be a bit difficult for the residents here.

463
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:37,740
I guess it's because the dust from the factory spreads throughout the town.

464
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,470
Wait. Then that means even if it isn't an employee at this factory,

465
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:48,020
if they live in this village, nitrogen oxide and phosphates could be found in their personal belongings.

466
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,230
I guess that's true.

467
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,220
Sir! One moment please!

468
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,160
You dropped this.

469
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,380
Thank you, thank you.

470
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,360
Huh?

471
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:14,430
Sir, did you tie this knot yourself?

472
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,970
No. I brought what was in the market over there.

473
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,530
Market?

474
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,470
Wait a minute.

475
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,100
Hello, Granny.

476
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,500
Can I just ask one question? Did you tie these waste papers yourself?

477
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,210
This? Not at all. Dr. Do did it for me.

478
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,440
Dr. Do?

479
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,710
Not a thief!

480
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:52,480
There's someone named Do Gi Tae, who fixes all of our boilers for free in the winter when the days get cold.

481
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,130
A person who fixes boilers for free?

482
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,580
Hello, you've arrived?

483
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,770
You must have lots of boilers to fix, since the days have gotten so cold so suddenly.

484
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,540
I have to do whatever possible to make time to help the elders.

485
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,310
Thanks to you, Dr. Do, I feel assured. 

486
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,680
The social welfare volunteer?

487
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,660
Yes? You know the trace materials found on the phone?

488
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,990
Could it come out from someone who fixes boilers?

489
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,660
It's possible. Nitrogen oxide is definitely possible,

490
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,040
and phosphates are used to clean the boilers.

491
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,010
I think we've found a prime suspect.

492
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,830
He's a boiler fixer who volunteers at the social welfare center.

493
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,720
For now, I'll send you his address, so please go look for evidence with Detective Tak.

494
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,800
We'll go directly to his workplace.

495
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,010
- Let's go. 
 - Sure.

496
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,830
Wait. I found it. Someone witnessed a corpse being disposed of.

497
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,440
The 20th case? The corpse was found in a drain next to Yangseo Bridge.

498
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,340
How did you know?

499
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,410
I've gone through those hundreds of times.

500
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,750
-It's been engrained in my head. 
 - Wow.

501
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,110
Then why are you telling me to go through these again?

502
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,400
In case I missed something. Let me see that.

503
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,820
Utility Knife Serial Killer - 20th Case

504
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,330
Evidence: 
 1. Triangular shape of victim's cloth
 2. Blood sample on plastic wrap 
 3. Dash Cam Footage

505
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,810
3 
  Okay.

506
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,420
Dammit... the quality sucks.

507
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,830
Well, it's a dash cam from more than 10 years ago.

508
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,210
Even up until recently, it would have been difficult to recover such a low-quality video.

509
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,830
But now, technology has advanced so much that it's become possible.

510
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,820
It captures the screen every 1/60th of a second,

511
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,340
then increases the clarity of each screenshot before threading it all together again.

512
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,380
How long will it take?

513
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,490
I'll have to try it to know,

514
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,850
but if I can do it properly, I think the face could be identifiable.

515
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,710
It was worth saving all the materials from this case.

516
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,950
What if we can get the suspect's face?

517
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,580
Anyone can tell you this would be considered an illegal breach of private property.

518
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,960
If the police get here, we'll be caught immediately.

519
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,880
Shall we just return?

520
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,480
If I were my normal self, that's what I would do,

521
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:50,510
but I have a debt to repay to PD Kang.

522
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,100
Didn't you also get paid for your work?

523
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:57,000
Well, it wasn't enough for me to consider illegally trespassing in someone's home.

524
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,070
There's a fence and the gates are locked.

525
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:04,220
You said nobody was home. We can just hop the fence.

526
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,120
- What are you doing? 
 - Me?

527
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,930
Ouch...

528
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,800
- Ouch. 
 - Get out of there. Take this.

529
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,950
It hurts.

530
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,480
Wow.

531
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,260
Surprising, right? I know I normally just look intellectual and refined,

532
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,480
but I used to be in the special forces.

533
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,920
You don't look particularly intelligent and refined, but it is unexpected that you're from the special forces.

534
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,030
Look at this.

535
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,180
You want me to go in again?

536
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,750
You should be the one to initiate the illegal act of entering his home. I used to be a police, so.

537
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,530
I'm a necropsy doctor!

538
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,660
You used to be a part of special forces.

539
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,240
Good job.

540
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:38,780
Wow... Profiler Tak Won.

541
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,600
He found proper learning materials.

542
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,840
He stays fit to commit the perfect crimes.

543
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,680
Can you stay fit with this?

544
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,780
- S-Sunbae. 
 - What?

545
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,140
He went home?

546
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:35,930
Yes, he did. He left right after he fixed my boiler.

547
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,360
You don't look like thieves.

548
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,380
Um. We're YouTubers who explore deserted homes.

549
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,680
I guess this house wasn't deserted, assuming you're the home owners. We apologize.

550
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,040
You thought this normal house was deserted?

551
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,530
Yes, well. We must have made a mistake. Why don't we leave?

552
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,140
I think you've seen too much for me to just let you go.

553
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,540
You're one, and we're two.

554
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,330
So what?

555
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:13,960
I'm just saying in case things get physical, the situation will likely turn in favor against you.

556
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,610
Forget it. Attack me at once.

557
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,260
At once?

558
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,340
As someone who used to be a part of the special forces, I decline such unfair conditions.

559
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:31,420
I'll start. Oh, you're taking it off?

560
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,120
Okay then. I will also.

561
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,150
Hold this.

562
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,630
Sunbae! Sunbae!

563
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,040
B-Blood.

564
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,410
Im my simulation, I wasn't supposed to get a bloody nose at this timing.

565
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,790
Next. You.

566
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,700
Avenge me.

567
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,120
I think you're underestimating me.

568
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,820
You're judgement is correct.

569
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,840
2:0

570
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:31,210
Then I will also... Oops.

571
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,090
It's you. The profiler that was adopted into the States and returned with high honor.

572
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,670
Return with high honor?

573
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:47,420
I'm just working as part of a pyramid scheme.

574
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,770
You told me it wasn't a pyramid scheme.

575
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:51,510
Networking Marketing is basically a pyramid scheme.

576
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,970
But you eventually found me out. Good for you.

577
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,080
I'll take it as a compliment.

578
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,060
What do you mean, take it as a compliment? We're about to die because of you.

579
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,410
You're going to die anyway. It's good to be complimented beforehand.

580
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,760
Sure, sure.

581
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,350
But... sir. If you do this in your own home,

582
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,850
wouldn't it break your history of locked-room serial killings?

583
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,920
You have a reputation to uphold.

584
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,570
That's just something that people like you, who like patterns, made up for me. I don't care.

585
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,210
He says he doesn't care. All we have to do is just die for him.

586
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,050
Shut up! There's two of us, so it'll be difficult for you to get rid of our bodies.

587
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:28,540
That's my problem. Worry about yourselves.

588
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,720
Wow...

589
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,920
I've only ever killed wrinkly old people.

590
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,530
I'm so excited to be cutting into soft and clear skin.

591
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,930
Wait, serial killer sir!

592
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:54,110
You'll definitely make a mistake if you suddenly change your methods of killing.

593
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,320
On top of that, we're not great candidates to be victims of a crime.

594
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,020
You talk too much.

595
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,090
Were you here the whole time?

596
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,900
Are you not hurt?

597
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,550
Locked-room!

598
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,190
Locked-room serial killer!

599
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,140
Was it you?

600
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,970
Locked-room!

601
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,240
Locked-room!

602
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:29,090
Serial killer! Serial killer!

603
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,690
Wow, he did it! He did it!

604
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,220
Want to play with me?

605
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,310
Teddy!

606
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:20,380
It's endless.

607
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,620
Are you the boss?

608
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:26,310
I'm not the boss, but I am CEO.

609
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,370
Yes! Yes!

610
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,860
There you go!

611
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,980
He's stronger than I thought.

612
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,110
Are you okay?

613
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,000
Blood...

614
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,580
Are you okay?

615
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,750
Here.

616
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,480
Teddy. Here.

617
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,780
Yeon Jang.

618
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,510
- Are you alive? 
 - Of course.

619
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,030
PD Kang! PD Kang!

620
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,240
What happened? Are you okay? How much did you get hit?

621
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,030
Just once.

622
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,520
- Once? 
 - Yup.

623
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,620
Is that what's important right now? Is it?

624
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,560
Hurry up and untie me.

625
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,300
I'm okay PD Kang.

626
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,230
Even in this emergency situation, I was calmly stalling so you guys could get here.

627
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,630
You saved your life with just your words.

628
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:50,300
As expected, Mr. Tak!

629
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,140
Thank you, Teddy.

630
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,870
Shut up and change your underwear.

631
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,680
What are you talking about?

632
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,840
My underwear is very dry right now.

633
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,950
If you can't believe me, let me just-

634
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,190
Why won't you untie mine?

635
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,880
Huh? The knot.

636
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,080
We can't just get rid of such decisive evidence.

637
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,020
Exactly.

638
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,120
Why did you untie him then? Why me?

639
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,750
I mean, he got hurt.

640
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,280
I need the hospital. Hospital...

641
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,780
He doesn't look that different from how he usually looks.

642
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,980
Tak Won, you need to learn to think before you speak.

643
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,420
Huh?

644
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,550
You need to remember you cannot defend yourself right now.

645
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,870
Okay?

646
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:30,690
Okay, let's go move him.

647
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,370
- Let me go. 
 - Just stand up exactly like that.

648
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,780
Exactly like that. Let's go.

649
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,650
Ouch.

650
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,120
Untie me!

651
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,060
I don't think this is a police station. Who are you guys?

652
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,120
I kind of hate that a serial killer is angry at me.

653
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,670
You're the one who broke your promise. How dare you ghost me?

654
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,680
You're the one who provoked me first.

655
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,480
What? Saying you're undersized, anti-social, and have a personality disorder?

656
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,270
It's all correct.

657
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:41,230
Hey, you punk! All the people you killed

658
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:44,750
were weak and frail elderly. Do you know that?

659
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:51,020
They were all just disposable people who were useless to society.

660
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,940
They're just pest that eat up the money of tax payers.

661
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,570
It feels weird that a serial killer is worrying about tax.

662
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,480
So weird. Don't you agree?

663
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,150
Hey you bastard.

664
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:06,060
Do you think you'll never age?

665
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,300
Who are you to judge their lives as you wish?

666
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,910
Are you using violence because you can't handle me with just your words?

667
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:21,340
Seeing someone who killed fifteen people talk about assault

668
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,700
is pissing me off.

669
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,270
Sure, it's assault!

670
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,310
Wait a minute. Wait.

671
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,480
Anyways. Is what you said before true?

672
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,370
Do you really know who killed Park Jae Min?

673
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,010
I wonder.

674
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:43,510
Serial killers have a tendency to claim that they've killed more people,

675
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:49,240
but interestingly enough, you're even claiming that it wasn't you that killed him.

676
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:56,160
But I didn't have a partner. That would be embarassing.

677
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:01,010
What does that mean?

678
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:04,120
You didn't have a partner because that would be embarrassing?

679
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,510
I don't want jjamppong.

680
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,100
This punk didn't like jjamppong, huh?

681
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,420
I don't want it.

682
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,460
- It's done. 
 - Huh?

683
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,110
Let's see... 14 - 9113

684
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,750
And... here.

685
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,510
T-this?

686
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,700
Ham Deok Su...

687
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,490
14-9113

688
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:06,760
Are you saying two people killed Park Jae Min?

689
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,240
There's an accomplice?

690
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:23,260
Yes, Detective Choi.

691
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,920
What?

692
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,270
Excuse me.

693
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,160
Excuse me. Wait...

694
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,450
By chance...

695
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:01,480
It is. It's Son Ji Young.

696
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,540
The only survivor of the Utility Knife serial killings.

697
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:15,320
Then he let her live, and then killed her again in 10 years?

698
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,880
Right in front of our precinct?

699
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,280
He didn't kill her here.

700
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,050
Son Ji Young lives in Janghyeonggu, so he intentionally disposed of her body here.

701
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,210
Intentionally? Why?

702
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,940
Because I keep digging into the case!

703
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,020
It must be a warning that he's sending to me.

704
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,040
What the hell?

705
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,880
Let go! My daughter...

706
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,090
Ma'am, please calm down.

707
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:54,950
My daughter...

708
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,250
No, Ji Young!

709
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,210
No! Get up Ji Young!

710
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:05,050
No...

711
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,550
Ji Young!

712
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,150
Ji Young, get up!

716

♫ You can run all night, I won’t get tired ♫

♫ You will eventually get caught anyway ♫

719
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,160
Is it wrong to want to reveal the truth?

720
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,590
That's what you think.

721
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,320
Kang Ho, stop it.

722
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,330
The case is over.

723
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:03,150
There's another criminal. What do you mean, the case is over?

724
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,280
Isn't this suppression of the press?

725
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,140
It is suppression of the press.

726
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,800
So you're saying our program could be discontinued?

727
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,820
I'm going to prove that I'm correct take counteraction against you.

728
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:16,780
We're not so much a team. I'm the boss and you're my subordinates. Understand?

729
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,170
It's what the organization decided. We have a responsibility to follow the regulations.

730
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,850
I don't! I think that people

731
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,660
are more important that the rules.
