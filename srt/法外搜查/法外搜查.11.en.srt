00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,020
I'm the one who needs an adult diaper.

181
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,520
Big and dangerous things are coming.

182
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:45,534
No, not here!

183
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:46,664
Then help me out here.

184
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:49,060
- I really need to go.
- Help you with what?

185
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:53,600
- Are you asking me to help you...
- Just a second.

186
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:56,870
Hey, what's up?

187
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:00,610
What? Are you serious?

188
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,990
According to the news,

189
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:25,270
there's been another
Boxcutter Serial Murder Case.

190
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:27,800
What? That hasn't occurred
in the past ten years.

191
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,070
Director Kang.

192
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,873
It doesn't seem like he'll talk
from the looks of things.

193
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:34,709
Why don't we hand him over to the cops?

194
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,544
Even if he tells who killed Park Jae-min,

195
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,054
there's no way we can prove that now.

196
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:40,184
More importantly,
this is unlawful confinement.

197
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:42,623
I'm not saying this because
I need to use the restroom urgently.

198
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:45,290
Then, should we call Detective Jin?

199
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:46,390
No.

200
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:48,820
I'd rather waste my effort.

201
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,623
I can't hand him over to that lousy cop.

202
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:51,790
What's your plan then?

203
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:56,200
This is what we'll do.

204
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:10,110
[ Geumpyeong Police Station ]

205
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:25,690
- Hey, call it in now.
- Okay.

206
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:30,130
[ I'm the real Locked-room Killer. ]

207
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:33,974
Well, we were zealous and persistent.

208
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:37,304
Through cutting-edge forensic science
that could rival developed countries,

209
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:39,114
we were able to solve
our biggest two cold cases.

210
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:41,484
We apprehended the Boxcutter Serial Killer

211
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:44,014
and Locked-room Killer

212
00:17:44,015 --> 00:17:47,014
on the same day.
It was indeed a victory for us.

213
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,854
As we have gathered conclusive evidence,

214
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:51,624
we plan to inquire
into other possible crimes

215
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,254
and extract their confessions.

216
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:55,820
Please refer to the press release
for other information.

217
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,194
Is there other evidence?

218
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:59,130
- Is there another accomplice?
- What about...

219
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:00,260
Read the press release.

220
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,534
- Hold on.
- Are you sure?

221
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:05,204
- I have a question.
- Please answer our question.

222
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:06,570
Where did you get the evidence?

223
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:13,244
Oh, my.
This is all thanks to you, Chief Shin.

224
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:15,844
As we literally were spoon-fed
the Locked-room Serial Murder Case,

225
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,850
we could have been called incompetent
and told to hand in our badges.

226
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,484
It could have been a big mess.

227
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:24,184
And that's when you caught
the Boxcutter Serial Killer.

228
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:26,424
Thank you. It's all thanks to your help.

229
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:29,090
Oh, my. He's humble too.

230
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,794
I knew it.
A graduate of the Police Academy is

231
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,460
indeed extraordinary.

232
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,560
- I hope we meet at headquarters soon.
- Yes, sir.

233
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:41,940

What will you do now?

239
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,794
Everything you worked for has
come to nothing.

240
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:01,660
We're supposed to shoot today.
We'll have nothing to broadcast!

241
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:04,094
Why are you always so reckless?

242
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:05,464
- Hey, Director Hong.
- Yes.

243
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:06,794
Among the topics you have,

244
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,360
- do you...
- What are you talking about?

245
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:12,330
The only thing I'll miss in my life
is a credit card payment.

246
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:18,000
The material that can turn
a crisis into a chance

247
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:19,770
is right here.

248
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:21,044
What is that?

249
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:24,680
Since it already happened,
let's be the game-changer.

250
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:26,984
[ How interesting. ]

251
00:19:26,985 --> 00:19:30,320
[ You're proactively telling us
that you didn't kill him. ]

252
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,720
[ But at least, ]

253
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:36,790
[ I didn't have an accomplice.
That'd be embarrassing. ]

254
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:40,730
Are you sure

255
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:42,800
this is legit?

256
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:47,070
I even secretly confirmed it
with an expert.

257
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:52,140
Okay.

258
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:56,040
Let's be the game-changers.
It's either go big or go home.

259
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:58,184
What a surprise. You're not objecting.

260
00:19:58,185 --> 00:20:01,180
I should bite if this is a big scoop
before someone else takes it.

261
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:04,124
You won't regret it.

262
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,620
Let me make myself clear.

263
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,450
It's not you whom I trust.

264
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,860
I'm giving you a green light
because it's too good to waste it.

265
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:24,270
Look.

266
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:27,310
Wasn't that you ten years ago?

267
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:29,280
The guy abandoning the body here.

268
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:32,780
Yes.

269
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,594
This is the photo of you entering

270
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:45,590
the unit next to Park Jae-min's
before he was murdered.

271
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:49,034
And this photo proves that
you passed through the alley

272
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:51,400
on the day of Son Ji-young's murder.

273
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:55,340
Deok-su, do you know what this means?

274
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:01,474
You can play dumb or innocent
all you want.

275
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:03,284
It means that you'll end up
going to the slammer.

276
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,550
The evidence is as clear as day.

277
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:12,350
Deok-su.

278
00:21:20,795 --> 00:21:22,530
These people here.

279
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:26,170
You didn't kill them, right?

280
00:21:30,045 --> 00:21:31,970
But why were you at the crime scenes?

281
00:21:32,515 --> 00:21:34,540
Why did you try to burn
the bloodstained plastic sheets?

282
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:39,780
I killed them.

283
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:42,550
But you just said it wasn't you.

284
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,490
Did this old man make you do it?

285
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:59,230
Did Ji Su-cheol tell you
to say that you killed them?

286
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:08,370
What's wrong?

287
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:11,680
- I need to pee.
- What?

288
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:13,284
I have to pee.

289
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:15,124
- Hey.
- I have to pee.

290
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,284
- Hey, hold on. Wait.
- I have to pee.

291
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:19,154
- I'm going to pee.
- You can't pee there!

292
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:20,924
- Hey! Darn it.
- I have to pee.

293
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,290
What are you doing?

294
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:25,864
The case was closed.
Transfer him to the prosecution now.

295
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:27,534
The case isn't closed.

296
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:28,704
Isn't that obvious?

297
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:30,500
I have to pee. I must pee.

298
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:32,004
As you can see,

299
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:34,474
he has a level-three
intellectual disability.

300
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:36,104
He's not smart enough

301
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,174
to commit these crimes by himself.

302
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:39,314
Don't just stand there.

303
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:41,170
Transfer him right now.

304
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:42,514
Yes, sir.

305
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:44,140
Wait. Sir.

306
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:47,054
- All right.
- But sir... No!

307
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:48,784
- Hey, Inspector Jin.
- Where's the restroom?

308
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,550
All right. That way. Okay.

309
00:22:53,195 --> 00:22:54,820
I understand that you made a contribution.

310
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:59,230
But don't you know that a small mistake
can wipe out your contribution?

311
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,364
A mistake?

312
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:02,934
I'm trying to uncover the truth.
How is that wrong?

313
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:04,564
We have definite evidence.

314
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:07,574
And he even confessed that he killed them.
What other truth?

315
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:10,200
We couldn't find the boxcutter
which is the murder weapon.

316
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:13,014
And he even recanted
his confession just now.

317
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:16,284
Besides, he's jumping all over the place
because he has to urinate.

318
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:17,844
Do you seriously believe

319
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:20,180
he's the serial killer
who murdered dozens of people?

320
00:23:20,955 --> 00:23:22,680
That's your opinion.

321
00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:25,394
Didn't it cross your mind that

322
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:27,920
your petty sense of ambition
would harm the organization?

323
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:32,064
Aren't you just worried that I might mar
your precious reputation?

324
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:34,260
Even if that's the case,
is that a problem?

325
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,864
It won't be a problem

326
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:39,430
for someone who believes
getting promoted is everything in life.

327
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:41,700
Detective Jin.

328
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,240
You can try all you want,
but you can never go against me.

329
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:47,140
If you keep this up,

330
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,280
I'll have to take disciplinary measures
against you.

331
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:52,414
If you want to,
why don't you just go ahead and do it?

332
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:54,084
I've got all the time in the world.

333
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:57,350
I can just go home and get some sleep.

334
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:05,460
- Gang-ho.
- Stop it.

335
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:11,664
Calm down.

336
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:13,934
Hey, I'm not worked up right now.

337
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:17,374
I'm very rational right now.
I'm about to befriend Kant.

338
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,140
Hey, this way. Zip up. Okay.

339
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,040
- Detective Min, take him. Go with him.
- Yes.

340
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:30,584
- Gang-ho, stop it. The case was closed.
- This way.

341
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:33,324
The real culprit is still at large.
What are you talking about?

342
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:34,724
I can't stop.

343
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,824
I can't stop for the sake
of the victims' families.

344
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:39,490
Will you keep being stubborn like this?

345
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:42,300
Look at him. Just look at the guy.

346
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:45,334
He can't even order his food
at a restaurant on his own.

347
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:47,630
But he was meticulous enough
to kill over 20 people?

348
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:50,804
Do you honestly believe
that it's possible?

349
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:52,110
The organization made a decision.

350
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:53,614
Our duty is to follow it.

351
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:56,144
That might be your duty,
but it's not mine.

That's a bit far-stretched.

684
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:27,564

685
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,034
and they seemed like very honest people.

686
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:32,730
Well, don't let him fool you
because he killed all those people.

687

from Geumpyeong Police Station was here.

I was also tied up
for over 30 hours that day.

and embarrassment

- On what occasion did a detective

716
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:06,330
from Geumpyeong Police Station who has
no ties to the case come to see me?

But it's not like you're going to reduce
my sentence if I talk.

Since there's no way you can get out now,

you should find a way
to live comfortably here, don't you think?

725

that detectives are poor.

726
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:41,100
Detective Jin is totally rich.
He even has a black credit card.

727

So what will you do for me?

728
00:46:46,575 --> 00:46:50,370
That depends on what you do for me.

729

I still recall it clearly.

was killed.
