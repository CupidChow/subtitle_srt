- Deal.

180
00:13:03,945 --> 00:13:06,490
I can tell you also
have housewife's eczema.

181
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:08,754
Oh, this? I have to wash dishes and stuff.

182
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,614
My hands are always wet.

183
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:13,554
This is a great choice
for a man's delicate hands.

184
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:14,594
I recommend men's ointment

185
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:16,324
from Hundred Year Good Life.

186
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,800
I didn't know about this product.

187
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,994
If your wife beats you,

188
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:21,594
I have bruise removal cream for men.

189
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:23,640
- I'm single.
- Oh, no.

190
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:24,904
I also have cream to remove

191
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,834
laugh lines to help you
get out of a single life.

192
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:29,074
Come on, that's enough.

193
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,450
This isn't some marketplace. Stop that.

194
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:35,390
But whatever Mr. Tak says
sounds pretty convincing.

195
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:36,474
Let me see.

196
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:39,084
You know, over there. That cream.

197
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,314
I applied this cream on a corpse.
But the corpse got a zit.

198
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:42,490
- What?
- What?

199
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,884
It's for the living.
Why did you apply it on a corpse?

200
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:47,630
I was doing a clinical trial.

201
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:49,994
But why are you getting mad at me?

202
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,194
Hey, all right. Listen.

203
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:56,894
Given that a group of lacking individuals
came together for this case,

204
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:59,704
the result was pretty good. Okay?

205
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,010
But let's make this
our last case together.

206
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:05,374
Whenever I see you guys,
it embarrasses me.

207
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,444
Seriously? You're the biggest beneficiary
of this joint investigation.

208
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:09,650
We shouldn't hear that from you.

209
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:12,444
Thanks to us, you caught
the real culprit and the copycat.

210
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,914
You even got promoted.

211
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,284
What about you?

212
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:18,330
Your TV show almost got canceled
which could have put you on the streets.

213
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:20,630
You got the highest ratings,
so your show didn't get canceled.

214
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,864
Then, only the two of you
benefited from this.

215
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:25,840
Look here.

216
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,670
Mr. Tak, you cleared Jang Min-gi's name.

217
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,504
And Mr. Jeong was able
to get justice for his friend.

218
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:34,910
Once again,
I'd like to thank you for that.

219
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:38,320
Excuse me. The ribs are boiling.

220
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,050
- What about me?
- What?

221
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:43,450
What did I get out of it?

222
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:47,090
Dr. Lee...

223
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:51,530
Oh, right. You should ask that guy
for a bigger fee.

224
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,554
Oh, right.

225
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:56,000
This is the repair fee for my camera.

226
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:58,170
- There.
- My medical bill.

227
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,140
I got shot.

228
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:04,034
You owe me the fee
for using my space and 500 skulls.

229
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,640
You'll give me a good price, right?

230
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:08,434
I'm raising a daughter.
Gosh, raising a kid costs a lot.

231
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:11,320
Goodness. You guys are unbelievable.

232
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:15,190
It looks like you needed my wallet,
not my cuffs.

233
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,460
- What's that?
- But still, I should settle them.

234
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:22,260
My gosh, Gang-ho!

235
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:25,060
I mean, Detective Jin.

236
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:28,794
All right.
Director Kang whom I don't like,

237
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,124
buy a new camera.

238
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,240
- Thank you.
- My gosh.

239
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:34,194
- All right. Mr. Tak, the pyramid schemer.
- Yes.

240
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:37,434
Go and put in a brand-new shoulder.

241
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:38,480
Thank you.

242
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,204
- Let's see. Dr. Lee.
- How much?

243
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:44,844
- Yes.
- It's 45 dollars for renting the space.

244
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,174
The skulls you busted.
That's about 52 dollars.

245
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:48,650
The total would be 97 dollars.

246
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:51,244
Let's settle it at 97 dollars.

247
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:54,044
Here you go.
Give me back three dollars for the change.

248
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:55,960
And please issue me the cash receipt.

249
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:02,500
You were very generous with the others.
Why are you being so cheap with me?

250
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,030
You're sensitive.

251
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:06,040
You are indeed.

252
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,640
Here you go.

253
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,670
- My gosh. Thank you.
- Gosh.

254
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,304
You love money, don't you?

255
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,080
Who would say no to money?

256
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:17,820
Hey, Dae-jin.

257
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,350
What?

258
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,230
- You're here.
- Hey.

259
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:34,630
- Is this the place?
- Yes. Over there.

260
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:35,770
Excuse me.

261
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:54,890
Gang-ho.

262
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:56,474
- Hey.
- He found the body.

263
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,860
Hello.

264
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:00,390
So you found the body
when you were about to clean it.

265
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:04,524
At first, I wondered why someone
would throw away a bag down there.

266
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,184
As you can see,
a manhole lid is pretty heavy

267
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:08,354
and it doesn't have handles.

268
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,494
You can't open it up without proper tools.

269
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:13,923
That means you wouldn't open it
unless when you have to clean.

270
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:16,370
But we rarely clean it.
We clean it once every decade.

271
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,933
A lot of places don't clean them.

272
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:19,204
This is probably the first time

273
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,880
they opened this sewer manhole
since the hospital opened.

274
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:24,704
I see. Thank you.

275
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:26,350
- Sure.
- Thank you.

276
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:27,749
- Come this way.
- Okay.

277
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,060
This is the perfect place
to dispose of a body.

278
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:35,590
No security cameras.

279
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:38,630
And they rarely open the manhole.

280
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:44,700
That means unless he worked here,
the culprit wouldn't have known about it.

281
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:48,494
...

282
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:49,864
The corpse turned into grave wax.

283
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:52,510
So we received an urgent request
to perform an autopsy. What do we do?

284
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,874
Gosh, we received such a hard case

285
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,804
when the chief is away at a symposium.

286
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:00,274
Other medical examiners'
schedules are already full.

287
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:01,450
This puts us in a tight spot.

288
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,274
We have part-time medical examiners.

289
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,514
Right. But they are busy too.

290
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:08,284
They're not usually available
unless we schedule it in advance.

291
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,990
Is there anyone we can call?
Anyone who retired?

292
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,700
A retired medical examiner?

293
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:34,990
[ Ka-eun, did you sleep well
at your friend's house? ]

294
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:36,650
[ Are you at school now? ]

295
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:53,100
[ Jeong Gu-yeong of NFS ]

296
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:15,260
What?

297
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,224
What are you doing here,
Mr. Funeral Director?

298
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,824
"Mr. Funeral Director"?
He's not a medical examiner?

299
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,670
He's a designated medical examiner
of the NFS.

300
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:24,400
- I see.
- All right.

301
00:19:25,325 --> 00:19:26,400
Let's start.

302
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:33,140
This guy has a lot to say.

303
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,074
The corpse that turned into grave wax
can hold its initial shape

304
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,474
even after many years.

305
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:40,674
That won't be hard to pinpoint
the year he was murdered.

306
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:43,644
It takes about a year
for the corpse to turn into grave wax.

307
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:45,660
So he must have been murdered before that.

308
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,584
All right. Please tell me how you died.

309
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:53,100
We will listen to everything.

310
00:19:53,555 --> 00:19:54,530
Let's take a look.

311
00:19:58,495 --> 00:19:59,640
This side.

312
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:09,904
I don't see any external injuries.

313
00:20:09,905 --> 00:20:11,380
Right. It's way too clean.

314
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,350
But he still has his fingerprints.

315
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:17,844
I ran his prints in the system,
but we couldn't identify him.

316
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:18,890
I bet.

317
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,060
Let's look at his teeth.

318
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:27,260
Given the development of his teeth,
he might be a teenager.

319
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:31,324
My gosh. The width of his pelvis
supports my assumption too.

320
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:34,040
He was an adolescent,
so his fingerprints weren't registered.

321
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:35,594
If there are no external injuries,

322
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:37,264
should we check if he was poisoned?

323
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:38,640
Hold on.

324
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:41,040
I see something underneath his nails.

325
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:45,250
It's blood.

326
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,920
It's highly likely
it's the culprit's blood, right?

327
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,820
Scalpel.

328
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,530
His stomach is clean.

329
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:05,064
I don't see any needle marks on his body.

330
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,564
That means he drank it.

331
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,810
But I don't think
poison was what killed him.

332
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:12,340
There are no external injuries,
but his rib was fractured.

333
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:14,850
And his liver and lungs were ruptured.

334
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:19,320
We need to get a CT scan.

335
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:28,990
Gosh, his rib wasn't the only thing
that was fractured.

336
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:31,484
His entire body must have been bruised.

337
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:33,254
His skin covered them up
when grave wax formed.

338
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:34,870
So I couldn't detect
any external injuries.

339
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:38,224
I don't see a single bone intact.
They are all fractured.

340
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:41,394
Multiple fractures
due to a severe beating.

341
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:43,194
He was probably beaten up by a group.

342
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:44,680
Or he was habitually assaulted.

343
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,704
As soon as you get the DNA result,

344
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:50,404
try finding a match among teenagers
on the missing persons list.

345
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:52,250
- Yes.
- Goodness.

346
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:02,830
Ka-eun.

347
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:06,330
Ka-eun, are you back?

348
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:14,600
Ka-eun.

349
00:22:24,805 --> 00:22:27,880
[ The person you have reached
is not available... ]

350
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,960
[ Ka-eun, are you done at the academy? ]

351
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,830
[ Do you want me to pick you up? ]

352

00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:02,040
Right? Ka-eun would never
do those kinds of stuff.

876
00:54:02,135 --> 00:54:05,810
Gosh, I wouldn't call this a conversation.

877
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:07,504
Why? What's wrong?

878
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:09,320
It looks like Ka-eun replies to you

879
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:12,020
only because she has to
every time you send her messages.

880
00:54:13,645 --> 00:54:16,390
She's very shy.

881
00:54:16,815 --> 00:54:18,754
Can I look at the texts?

882
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,660
Sure.

883
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:22,830
Here.

884
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,670
[ I'm sorry. Something came up
with a friend yesterday. ]

885
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:31,070
The last text is a bit weird.

886
00:54:31,565 --> 00:54:34,464
The overall tone of the text
is different from her usual texts.

887
00:54:34,465 --> 00:54:37,074
She used punctuation marks unlike usual.
She's like a different person.

888
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:38,880
That also bothered me as well.

889
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,504
Something felt off.

890
00:54:40,505 --> 00:54:42,544
If she found the virtual world
more comfortable,

891
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,720
wouldn't she have left something
to express how she felt?

892
00:54:46,415 --> 00:54:48,690
Here it is. Her drawings.

893
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:54,360
Ka-eun is very good at drawing.

894
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,500
They look a bit dangerous.

895
00:54:57,155 --> 00:54:58,970
- Why?
- They're figure drawings.

896
00:54:59,595 --> 00:55:00,800
But their eyes are all missing.

897
00:55:01,595 --> 00:55:03,570
She only drew eyes in her last drawing.

898
00:55:04,395 --> 00:55:05,434
What about that?

899
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:08,580
It looks like she recently
made up her mind to do something.

900
00:55:09,405 --> 00:55:10,550
Something big.

901
00:55:14,905 --> 00:55:16,350
The tip-off I got from Ka-eun.

902
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:19,614
"There's an incredibly scary group
of runaways that even cops can't touch."

903
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:22,984
"If I don't kill them first,
they will kill me."

904
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:24,190
That's what she said.

905
00:55:24,815 --> 00:55:25,830
What?

906
00:55:26,855 --> 00:55:28,760
My Ka-eun sent you that?

907
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,164
I didn't tell you because I thought

908
00:55:33,165 --> 00:55:34,670
you'd get worried.

909
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:36,300
Why are you telling me that now?

910
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:38,440
You should've told me!

911
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,744
They must've waited until their target
approached the blind spot

912
00:56:28,745 --> 00:56:31,030
to commit their crimes.

913
00:56:32,685 --> 00:56:35,230
But the camera didn't catch them entering.

914
00:56:40,195 --> 00:56:42,770
That means they left through that hill.

915
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,990
My goodness! Oh, gosh!

916
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:06,414
What... What's wrong? I'm a cop.

917
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:10,530
Over there!
There... There's a dead body over there!

918
00:57:10,555 --> 00:57:12,394
Goodness gracious!

919
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,970
Oh, gosh! Over there!

920
00:57:20,865 --> 00:57:21,810
What?

921
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:39,930
What's going on?

922
00:57:59,535 --> 00:58:00,580
Ka-eun?

923
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:04,914

924
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:06,514

927
00:58:10,915 --> 00:58:13,700
I'm sorry.
I'm not in the right mind for that.

[ I'll send you a photo and an address. ]

930
00:58:18,525 --> 00:58:19,940
