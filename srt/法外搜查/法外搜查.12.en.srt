Right, I didn't polish
the shoes you dropped off

Hey, we don't have much time.

358

It's dangerous to go alone.

359
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,619
We should split up into two groups
between Teddy and me.

360

- Okay.
- I'll follow Detective Jin.

I think that's Ilsim Welfare Center.

It was probably abandoned

What if that leads
to the underground bunker?

00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,515
Seeing you suffer will give me

533
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,545
much more joy.

534
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,255
You'll be the last one to die.

535
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,855
You'll be in pain having to watch

536
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,155
every single one of them die.

537
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,065
Are we going to your mommy?

538
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,365
Yes, we're going to Mommy.

539
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,005
We should all be good to our moms.

540
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,905
Is your dad here, too?

541
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,885
Is this it?

542
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,885
Yes, we're here.

543
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,755
Now, you guys are...

544
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,955
Thanks for bringing us here.

545
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,365
My mommy won't forgive you for this.

546
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,375
My mom won't forgive you for this either.

547
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,145
Can you help me untie this?

548
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,775
Let's go.

549
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,145
Hey.

550
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,845
This is Director Kang's camera.

551
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,055
Wait.

552
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,715
Something is coming.

553
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,305
So you won't take the deal?

554
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,245
Of course not.

555
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,045
You never had a choice to begin with.

556
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,785
Okay.

557
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,485
Go ahead and kill him.

558
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,425
You know what?

559
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,465
Then let me

560
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,295
have some jokbal before I die.

561
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,439
- What?
- What?

562
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,539
I came in a hurry,
so I didn't get to eat dinner.

563
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,479
I'm starving right now.

564
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,445
I don't want to die on an empty stomach.

565
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,979
Those who die while eating
even look better as ghosts.

566
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,345
Detective Jin, what are you...

567
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,725
He really is an idiot.

568
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,969
I may be an idiot,

569
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,209
but I can't be worse than serial killers.

570
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,649
Why don't you show some generosity?

571
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,709
Give me a piece of jokbal
with a lot of meat on it.

572
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,919
Dip it in the salted shrimp.

573
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,675
There's a big piece over there.

574
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,555
If you're hungry, you can eat that.

575
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,829
My gosh, you old people are unbelievable.

576
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,229
You're so unkind.

577
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,769
This is half-eaten.

578
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,369
Hey, you guys. Detective Jin has a point.

579
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:51,279
In North America and Europe,

580
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,909
they give death-row convicts
a proper meal before they die.

581
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,275
I think it's time that we learn
their beautiful custom...

582
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,205
It hurts.

583
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,735
It hurts.

584
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,335
How could you

585
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,305
cut a human being with a boxcutter
like a piece of paper?

586
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,775
Have you lost your mind?

587
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,985
You crazy psychos!

588
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,455
You guys are done for anyway.

589
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:21,029
Do you think we came here
without any support?

590
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,365
Do you think this is it?

591
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,469
No way. Never.
There's no way we'd come alone.

592
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,239
We're not stupid!

593
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,739
You didn't know that, did you?

594
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,305
The cops will be here soon.

595
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,645
Then it'll be the end for all of you!
The end!

I'm sorry, Grandma.

602
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:10,145
My child, you must really want to die.

603
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,645
I'm sorry.

604
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,185
I won't sing again.

605
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,045
Yes, that's it.

606
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,955
Keep fighting for your life.

607
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,025
That makes choking you more fun.

608
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:22,625
You evil...

609
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,595
You evil... You evil old lady.

610
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,965
I hope you go...

611
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,195
I hope you go to...

612
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,165
Go to the fiery...

613
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,015
Okay, that's enough.

614
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,985
I loved the song, Director Kang.

615
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,259
My gosh, how could you not give me
a piece of jokbal?

616
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,629
You cheap old lady.

617
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,595
What are you doing?

618
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,925
Get him.

619
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,525
Detective Tak.

620
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,109
Get him!

621
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,005
What? Hey, don't come near me.

622
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,805
Stop it! Don't come near me!

623
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,345
Let me go!

624
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,485
My gosh.

625
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,855
My gosh. Come on. Stop it.

626
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,295
What is the matter with...

627
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,235
My gosh!

628
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,779
You're always so late!

629
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,375
I wanted to get here faster.

630
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,875
But as you can see...

631
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,385
We got tied up on our way here.

632
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,585
Move!

633
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,785
Get him!

634
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,529
Won! Won, wake up! Stay with me!

635
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,195
Ban-seok, am I going to die?

636
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,899
This won't kill you.

637
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,725
The wound needs to be deeper for that.

638
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,435
My gosh, that hurts.

639
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,835
What is the matter with you guys?

640
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,185
What's wrong with these guys?

641
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,429
Will you stay still?

642
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,059
We're here to help you!

643
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,695
Get off me!

644
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,325
Let me go!

645
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:42,895
You guys, we're here to save you.

646
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,665
My gosh, will you let me go? Let go!

647
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,605
My gosh.

648
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,075
Hey!

649
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,895
What is this?

650
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,875
Just a bit more. Come on.

651
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,145
Come on.

652
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,745
Stop. That's enough.

653
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,055
Go on. Get on my back.

654
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,625
I can't go any further.

655
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,105
It's about time to finish this.

656
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,805
We had a good run.

657
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,685
Are you ready?

658
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,925
Why? You can't stab me?

659
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,799
This is your problem.

660
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,935
I told you so many times
that you'll die if you hesitate.

661
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,165
You idiot!

662
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,325
No!

663
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,675
I told you not to die
without my permission.

664
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,045
Not until you pay for your sins!

665
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,615
You think I'll let that happen?

666
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,815
I had a debt to repay.

667
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,695
Let me tell you once more.

668
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:37,295
You have been brainwashed

669
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:38,895
by those old murderers.

670
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,935
For decades!

671
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:45,175
Now let's open the door and get out there

672
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,709
to breathe the air of freedom.
And eat something delicious...

673
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,575
Ban-seok, I won't die, will I?

674
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,049
I said you won't.

675
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:56,185
Let's start a new life!

676
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,195
- Yes, they should.
- Goodness.

677
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,939
- See you later.
- Oh, no.

678
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,565
- A new life...
- Ban-seok, take me with you.

679
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,665
Grow your hair too.

680
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,205
Come meet me at Red-Zone Bar.

681
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,355
The old couple really were the culprits.

682
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,725
Where did Gang-ho go?

683
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,725
Oh, there.

684
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:32,545
- What was that? What just passed us by?
- Gosh.

685
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,845
My gosh! Darn dogs.

686
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:36,585
That scared me.

687
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,159
Where are we going?

688
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,925
Let's never work together again.

689
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,555
Gosh,

690
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,999
I'm seriously so embarrassed.

691
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,295
You're more embarrassing.

692
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,565
- You say this after we risked our lives.
- I was slashed with a knife.

693
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,539
Why does no one care?

694
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,395
I told Bare Hands and Tools to go home,
and they really did.

695
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,069
How do I get home?

696
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,905
I almost became the subject of an autopsy.

697
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,975
Please don't ever come to me.

698
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,425
[ The reason the Boxcutter Serial Murder
was able to continue for such a long time ]

699
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:22,625
[ was due to the dark side of our society. ]

700
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:26,039

government subsidy. ]

702

[ Not only did they abused them, ]

703
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:33,805

[ The crimes they committed

705
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,889
It's Detective Jin.

706
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:50,185
Detective Jin!

707
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,055
You!

708
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,825
Stop it.

709
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,065
Gang-ho!

710
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,909
Gang-ho, my man.

711
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,179
I'm not your man, so save it.

712
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,649
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

713
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:12,245
I heard you said to the higher-ups
