513
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,115
Because we couldn't identify
the fingerprints.

514

the victim's body,

the two are likely to know each other.

527

Once the victim is identified,
we get to learn about his relationships.

528
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,089

529
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,159
However, this guy made an effort
to cut off the hands,

530
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,899

Yes. But he was like that with everyone.

And that's when I saw a guy
hacking at Lee Jong-dae

764

765
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,729

to teach him a lesson.

they would've done it alone.

892
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,049

due to excessive bleeding.

The tissues near his mouth
were contracted and curled outwards.

920
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,445
That means he cut his mouth
before the victim died.

921

Wasn't it the same
with Lee Jong-dae's wrists?

could've been murdered by the same person?

on the autopsy report.

I think I'll beat you to it again.

981
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,215
The envelope had
a fingerprint analysis from the NFS.

982
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,615
What if Detective Jin found
a definite piece of evidence?

983
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,859
For example, he might have found
an unidentified fingerprint

984
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,715

985
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,455
And these two fingerprints matched?

986
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,995
Is that why he owes me one?

987
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,465
It's certain that these two victims
were murdered by the same culprit.

988
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:13,735
Then, we must catch the culprit
before that cop does.

989

I can't lose out to that lousy cop again.

990
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,275

of hearty rib soup,

993
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,645

Oh, right. Bring me the tools.

995
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,499
Wait. We're living in the 21st century,
and there are security cameras here.

996
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,625
You're not going to beat me up, right?

997
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,579
Most of his clients were minors
who ran away from home.

998
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,375
And he operated on them without a license.

999
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,645
Should we start with abduction
and confinement of minors?

1000
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,005
Okay.

1001
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,445
He performed surgeries without a license.

1002
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,545
He abducted and locked up minors.
Right here.

1003
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,689
Hold on. What are you guys doing?

1004
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,689
Five years for practicing
medicine without a license.

1005
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,529
And add 15 years for abducting
and locking up minors.

1006
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,295

1007
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:14,065
- He should be in prison when he turns 70.
- You bet.

1008

- and human trafficking.
- The last one is serious.

1011

- Should we go with this list for now?
- He won't be able to get out then.

1012

- He'll die in prison.
- Sir.

Go on.

1016
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,745
That teacher went around to look
for his students who ran away from home.

1017
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,455
And one of the students
got surgery from me.

1018

1035
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,809
Why would I call you up in advance?
I don't need your money.

1036
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,235
The VIP room.

1037
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,979
There are no security cameras
in the VIP room.

1038
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,615
That way, our clients won't be worried.

1039
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,785
- What about the list of your clients?
- My gosh, I'm sure you know how it works.

1040
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,885
The VIP list is confidential information.

1041
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,459
Is that so? I also have confidential
information about the business.

1042
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,655
- Right here.
- What?

1043
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,655
- Are you running the place properly?
- Wait. Sir.

1044
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,865
- Why are you doing this?
- Let me take a look.

1045
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:57,499
- Please?
- My gosh, this is dirty.

1046
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,999
We clean the kitchen every day.

1047
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,069
My goodness.

1048
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,539
- What are you doing?
- Look at this. Gosh.

1049
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,939
You're supposed to help the people.

1050
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,675
