35
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,939

might be similar

53

We're only trying to replicate the face.

54

Do we still need to scan the whole body?

55
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,599
It's because the body shape affects
the face shape.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,899
Now we've got the basic shape

57

the thickness of Koreans' skin.

I can't even get close

And I heard they're running a DNA test

on the blood found underneath
Jin-su's nails.

We found a corpse of a teenager
from the hill behind Bugyeong Station.

00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:16,274
I heard that they found a match
to his paternal DNA

00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:17,800
from the missing persons database.

[ Restricted area,
Authorized personnel only ]

417
00:28:24,915 --> 00:28:28,014
Their paternal line matches,
which means they have the same father.

418
00:28:28,015 --> 00:28:29,320
That makes them brothers.

419
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:32,820
As you can see,
the paternal lines of the bodies

420
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:36,120
found on the hill and the manhole
are a match.

421
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,120
Cho Jin-su?

422
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,860
Myeong-su!

423
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:44,934
- Myeong-su, are you okay?
- Jin-su.

424
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:47,930
Then, the body that was found
on the hill near Bugyeong Station

425
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:51,040
was Jin-su's little brother?

426
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:53,974
Did you get the DNA result of the blood

427
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:55,780
that was found on Cho Jin-su's body?

428
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:59,010
Yes, we got the result earlier and sent it
to the Cold Case Unit in Seoul.

429
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:02,284
But there were two sets of DNA.

430
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:03,480
What?

431
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:09,820
Both the brothers were beaten to death.

432
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:11,694
How sad.

433
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:13,790
Since there were two sets of DNA,

434
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:16,260
they must belong to
Park Jae-min and Kwon Ki-woong.

435
00:29:23,145 --> 00:29:24,900
Hey, Detective Jo. How did it go?

436
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:27,910
It wasn't Park Jae-min's?

437
00:29:29,615 --> 00:29:30,810
Okay, bye.

438
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:34,180
He says the culprit's DNA

439
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:36,920
and Park Jae-min's don't match.

440
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:38,490
That's impossible.

441
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:40,590
How could it be?

442
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,820
Why don't they match?

443
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:44,820
That can't be, Gang-ho.

444

It's not that I don't understand
how you feel,

445
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:51,630

with your mind set on one suspect.

Hey, don't you remember
what happened to the Chief of Police?

Let's start with what we can do.

448

The body found on the hill
near Bugyeong Station

449
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:04,580
was Cho Jin-su's brother,
Cho Myeong-su, right?

450
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:06,480
Yes.

451
00:30:06,615 --> 00:30:08,650

454
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,244
as well as the recent assault cases,
happening near Bugyeong Station?

455
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:40,110
Including the hill where
Cho Myeong-su's body was found,

456
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:43,650
all the assault cases occurred
near Bugyeong Station.

457
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,924
Teenage crimes have increased a lot
within this month indeed.

458
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:48,920
We have to get these guys all at once

459
00:30:49,025 --> 00:30:50,490
because they learn bad things quickly.

460
00:30:52,635 --> 00:30:55,060
I think it's somewhere around here.

461
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:58,730
Oh, there they are.

What am I looking at right now?

466
00:31:23,725 --> 00:31:25,790
Oh, no. Why did I drop this here?

467
00:31:26,065 --> 00:31:28,864
I was working on a case.

Why would you kids target someone so poor?

00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:44,140
Anyway, you guys should come with me
since I caught you red-handed.

00:32:04,265 --> 00:32:06,134

482

You called us criminals,
so go ahead and try to catch us.

There are so many of them.

- Should we call for back-up?
- Now?

485
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:22,424
If it takes 20 minutes
for back-up to arrive,

486
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:25,494
since there are 14 of them,
while Detective Jin knocks 3 of them out,

487
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:27,694
we'd get hit about 7.6 times each.

488
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,894
Do you even calculate
how many times you'd get hit?

489
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:31,360
It's less painful when you know.

490
00:32:31,495 --> 00:32:33,560
And it feels good
if you get hit less than expected.

491
00:32:34,595 --> 00:32:36,930

797
00:50:48,605 --> 00:50:50,710
I just go ahead and treat them like one.

798
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:54,744
If you approach a prime suspect generously
just because she is a minor,

799
00:50:54,745 --> 00:50:57,414
you're basically allowing
more serious crimes.

Don't you think
that the cold attitude of yours

801

to become criminals even more?

802
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:06,020
No, I don't, because a guy
who missed his window of opportunity

803
00:51:06,325 --> 00:51:08,390

835
00:53:31,635 --> 00:53:35,540
My hunch as a TV director tells me
that this is a really serious case.

836
00:53:35,975 --> 00:53:39,684

the leader of the runaways.

837
00:53:39,685 --> 00:53:42,910
And they say that Oni is making kids
take turns to kill people.

is risky for sure.

840

Did Ka-eun also...

842
00:53:57,035 --> 00:53:58,630
No, not yet.

843
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:02,004
Since Ka-eun is not a runaway
without a family to go home to,

844
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,670
she doesn't need to follow their rules.

845
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:07,904
But with time, things could change.

846
00:54:07,905 --> 00:54:09,770
It'll be hard to refuse at some point.

847
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:12,740

00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:15,510
Of course, there is. I'm Tak Won.

The main stages will be

And they must be staying here

858
