at an abandoned police station?

You're right.

Jang Min-gi escaped with Kang Su,

34
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,529

35
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,499

- We'll have to do some more research

is guilty or not.

00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,539
the shape of the fracture
on the fugitive's head is different.

180
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,785
It means that
the murder weapon is different.

181
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,255
So...

182
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,509
- Director Kang.
- Yes?

183
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,419
Can you film me with a bust shot?

184
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,119
That way, viewers can trust me more.

185
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,349
Bust shot and credibility. Okay.

186
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,719
Listen. Concluding that this was done
by a copycat

187
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,829
because of the murder weapon
might be far-fetched.

188
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,289
Gosh, far-fetched or not.

189
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,359
You should argue
after hearing them out first. Action.

190
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,235
What did you say? That was insulting.

191
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,629
Be quiet. The camera is rolling.

192
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,299
Rolling? What's rolling here?

193
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,115
My gosh. Do I continue?

194
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,275
Okay.

195
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,945
From the handprints on
the other victims' necks,

196
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,879
I can tell that his thumb
is especially thick and short.

197
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,649
But as for the shape of the handprint
on this dead body,

198
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,249
it doesn't match.

199
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,419
It's because this killer
doesn't have phocomelia.

200
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,925
- So...
- Hold on.

201
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,019
- Isn't he just a funeral director?
- Darn it.

202
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,559
It said so on the sign.

203
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,389
Limited knowledge can be
a dangerous thing.

204
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,659
How can you conclude that with photos
without seeing the body?

205
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,899
My goodness, you people seem
to take things to the extreme.

206
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,575
There's no middle ground for you.

207
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,245
Don't you know the best medical examiner
of the NFS, Lee Ban-seok?

208
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,245
- He used to be somewhat famous.
- "Somewhat"?

209
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,245
It's embarrassing to say this myself,
but I was the best.

210
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,715
This doctor was the one who helped me
on the Ido Pharmaceuticals case.

211
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,325
- Well...
- Gosh.

212
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,609
A medical examiner
became a funeral director.

213
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,079
You did make quite a big career change.

214
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,665
I moved from a technical profession
to the service sector.

215
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,265
To me, all corpses are precious.

216
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,459
Hold on.

217
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,459
If the copycat killed Kang Su,

218
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,559
it also means Jang Min-gi
could have killed Kang Su.

219
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,829
Jang Min-gi could have known
where Kang Su was hiding.

220
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,945
No. Never.

221
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,385
How can you be so sure?

222
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,915
He has an alibi.

223
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,525
Around the estimated time
of Kang Su's death, he was with me.

224
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,375
Min-gi.

225
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,515
How...

226
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,275
Listen to me from there.

227
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,639
You paid my mom's medical bills

228
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,755
and mailed the letters for her.
Is that true?

229
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,485
I stopped them
from telling you about her death.

230
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,355
- I'm sorry.
- Who said you could do that?

231
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,519
Who are you to hold a funeral for her

232
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,889
and stop me from sending her off?

233
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,265
It was what she wanted.

234
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,165
She was worried
that you might become unstable.

235
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,035
And who caused her
to go through so much pain?

236
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,115
To get my revenge,

237
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,869
I drew the butterfly countless times,

238
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,655
so I won't forget it even for a moment.

239
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,455
I'll kill everyone
who's responsible for this.

240
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,255
Nothing will change.

241
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,355
- I'll catch the real culprit.
- No.

242
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,625
I don't trust anyone now.

243
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,705
You just wait. You'll be the last.

244
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,905
Wait. There are detectives outside.

245
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,025
Min-gi, there are still...

246
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,525
You just let him get away?

247
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,135
You should have stopped him
no matter what.

248
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,705
It happened so fast.

249
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,405
So he's going to get back at people
who framed him as the culprit?

250
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,575
Yes.

251
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,239
Anyway, the police are hard at work
looking for Jang Min-gi.

252
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,575
We should catch
the real culprit and copycat.

253
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,109
Why would I work with you?

254
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,539
I'll work with the cops.

255
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,809
Listen. At a glance,

256
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,609
you might think we're lacking.

257
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,625
But we have everything we need.

258
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,895
We have the best profiler, or so he says,

259
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,789
and the best former medical examiner.

260
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,089
I'm still the best.

261
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,849
Everyone recognizes me as the best.

262
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,829
Wait. It's better for you
to stay out of this.

263
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,734
You used to be very close
with Jang Min-gi.

264
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,658
Are you sure you can stay rational?

265
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:09,444
Of course, I'm a professional.

266
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,069
And it's a golden chance

267
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,345
to clear Min-gi's name.

268
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:15,345
Well, Mr. Detective.

269
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,015
You're the most useless one here.

270
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,555
But then again, we need a lousy cop
to put the cuffs on them.

271
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,985
A lousy cop?

272
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,749
Hey.

273
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,519
You're the freeloader here.

274
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,725
What? You're ridiculous.

275
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,389
Did you forget I caught the twin brother,
Kim Min-seok,

276
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,895
the police let get away?

277
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,165
The biggest power the media has
is its power to move the public.

278
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,829
Anyway, we, the police,
will catch the culprits.

279
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,999
Just accept that.

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,969
I doubt that.

281
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,799
I'm sure you're not with them.

282
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,639
Didn't you get kicked out when you said

283
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,139
Jang Min-gi wasn't the real culprit?

284
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,309
So that's why

285
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,045
you came here with all the files
I asked for.

286
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,585
What? You are a deliveryman.

287
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,055
I didn't get kicked out of my team.

288
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,255
We just had a small argument.

289
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,749
Hey. Why don't you just join us
when you have the chance

290
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,359
to use your handcuffs?

291
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,329
We need your handcuffs.

292
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,605
We don't need you, per se.

293
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,999
You're inconsiderate and impolite.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,575
You're always so opinionated
and never listen to others.

295
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,569
You have one nasty personality.

296
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,075
Thank you for the compliment.

297
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,315
So what will it be?

298
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,395
Fine.

299
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,095
Let's give it a try.

300
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,989
To be honest, everyone seems lacking

301
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,889
and I can't trust anyone here.

302
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,989
But since we're all here, let's do it.
I don't expect much anyway.

303
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,429
Well, this will be causal. Okay?

304
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,699
Gosh, you're so chatty.

305
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,169
He's playing hard-to-get.

306
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,045
Hey. Wait.

307
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,239
But why am I involved in this?

308
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,685
We need a place.

309
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,985
I see. A place.

310
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,009
Oh, right. Before we start
our investigation, let me say something.

311
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,219
Starting now, all the expenses
regarding the investigation

312
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,025
will be covered by me.

313
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,319
So please gather your receipts
and hand them to me.

314
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,359
I'll give you the money on the spot.

315
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,659
You're a real man
unlike my first impression of you.

316
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,259
You're a real man.

317
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,629
I see. This is what she meant that
you're broke in real life,

318
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,999
but you're rich on paper.

319
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,939
Stop insulting me.

320
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,009
All right. Shall we discuss
how we'll proceed with our investigation?

321
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,239
- Shall we?
- Yes.

322
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,715
All right. Look.

323
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,515
Here. Take this.

324
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,455
Let me see.

325
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,325
[ Afterlife, Funeral Service ]

326
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,105
We live in the same house. Give me a ride.

327
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,659
People might get the wrong idea.
Take the bus.

328
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,399
My bottom is used to fancy seats.
The bus seats are a bit too hard.

329
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,475
Put on your seatbelt.

330
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,175
What?

331
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,185
Drop me off on your way home.

332
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,379
Gosh. What is this?

333
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,525
How can you guys be so shameless?

334
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,079
We're not shameless.
You're just inconsiderate.

335
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,979
Step on it.

336
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,755
What?

337
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,419
Did you just drop the honorifics?

338
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,265
When did I do that?

339
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,565
I guess his hearing is going bad too.

340
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,889
Your left wing mirror is a bit high.

341
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,365
Adjust it before you drive.

342
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,345
Come on.

343
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,665
I'll see you here tomorrow at 10 a.m.

344
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,235
What? Why would I... Hey

345
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,969
You've got my respect!

346
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,575
Gosh, seriously.
He's got the thickest skin of all.

347
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,515
Let's keep going.

348
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,295
Oh, my. Are you coming home together?

349
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,095
Ma'am, we just bumped into each other.

350
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,089
Did you go grocery shopping?

351
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,375
Yes, I'm going to make some fresh kimchi.

352
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,729
Aren't you supposed to be busy working?

353
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,999
Another person died.

354

why would he make Kang Su
get sentenced to ten years in prison?

880
