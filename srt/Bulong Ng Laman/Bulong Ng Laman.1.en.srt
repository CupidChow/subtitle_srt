1
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,917
Wait!

2
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:32,198
Wait!

3
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,838
What the... Hold on!

4
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:36,677
Wait!

5
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:47,485
What the heck!

6
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:54,450
Hey! I'm sorry.

7
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:55,995
It just feels so good.

8
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,448
Alright, fine.

9
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,773
Just lie down.

10
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:02,174
I’ll find a way.

11
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,861
We can still go for
another round.

12
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:05,487
I just need to recharge.

13
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:08,342
This is my power bank.

14
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,127
How does it feel that...

15
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,794
You’ve now moved into
your own apartment.

16
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,284
[muffled speaking]

17
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:36,686
Huh?

18
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:37,824
Oh.

19
00:07:38,662 --> 00:07:39,578
What do you mean huh?

20
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:42,666
Here I am figuring this out,

21
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,522
so we can have
a chance to finish.

22
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:46,759
Think about how to get it up!

23
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:03,025
Damn it!

24
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:06,648
It feels like I'm
just eating jelly!

25
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:07,859
That's useless already!

26
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:09,942
Hey!

27
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:12,039
How are you?

28
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:14,563
Are you happy here
in your apartment?

29
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,926
I guess.

30
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:35,917
Actually, I am happy.

31
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:40,449
But you ruined it, you bastard.

32
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:41,833
You're a bad start.

33
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:43,977
Idiot!

34
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:48,365
- Shit.
- Me? Seriously?

35
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,124
That design is beautiful, dear.

36
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:07,860
It will suit...

37
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:10,539
any kind of interior.

38
00:12:21,092 --> 00:13:03,641
[murmuring]

39
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,819
That comes with a
big discount, dear.

40
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:08,987
When the customer is pretty,

41
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,996
and young.

42
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:15,706
What?

43
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:19,461
[murmuring]

44
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:47,256
[murmuring]

45
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,493
That’s really meant for you,

46
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:57,706
dear.

47
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:18,640
[murmuring]

48
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:26,153
Come on.

49
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:32,592
- Ma’am, where should we put this?
- Oh, just place it inside.

50
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:33,909
- Thank you.
- Okay.

51
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:36,513
There, just go straight ahead.

52
00:14:36,538 --> 00:14:37,538
Okay, ma’am.

53
00:18:50,657 --> 00:18:52,159
You are so beautiful.

54
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,311
You don't need anyone else.

55
00:20:57,224 --> 00:21:32,149
[chattering]

56
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,190
Hey girls,

57
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:44,567
have you submitted to HR
your offset forms?

58
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,127
Yes, mother!

59
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:48,376
Oh, you should definitely
submit that to them, okay?

60
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,485
So we can maintain,

61
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,929
and sustain work-life balance.

62
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:52,955
Oh, wow!

63
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,732
Going for a management
trainee vibe, girl?

64
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,025
You know what, stop fighting
for it because it's lacking.

65
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:58,121
It’s really lacking!

66
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:00,575
Right, it’s lacking.

67
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,497
Hey, you guys are too much.

68
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,065
Our salary is still better

69
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,096
compared to others.

70
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:08,179
Compared to others.

71
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:11,552
Didn’t you manage to
move to a new apartment?

72
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:15,877
Yes, because I wanted
it to for myself.

73
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,618
But that’s not the
only thing I want.

74
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:20,273
I still have a long
list of things I want.

75
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:21,579
Me,

76
00:23:21,604 --> 00:23:23,635
I even struggled just to pay
for my motorcycle installment.

77
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:26,125
Why did you even
get a motorcycle

78
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,781
for your boyfriend?

79
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,642
You should've just bought shoes.

80
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:31,881
Because if it’s shoes,

81
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,472
it’s a one-time payment.

82
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:34,907
But if it’s a motorcycle,

83
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,094
it’s two years to pay.

84
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,205
That’s why her boyfriends
will leech off her more.

85
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,348
What’s wrong with you!

86
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:41,375
Oh, whatever!

87
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:43,496
There should be more to life.

88
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:46,630
So what happened to
work-life balance, France?

89
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,564
Oh no, we should
really maintain that

90
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:50,707
work-life balance, okay?

91
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:53,326
Geez, work-life balance?

92
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:55,434
Love life, and sex life.

93
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:57,115
Oh, you know, it’s
always not enough,

94
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,355
there’s always something missing.

95
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:00,059
Tell me about it.

96
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,036
And never ever start with me

97
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,731
when it comes to sex life talk.

98
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:06,607
- Huh?
- Oh, wait.

99
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:09,594
Enough with the smoking life.

100
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:11,904
Let’s get back to our work-life.

101
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:13,316
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go, girl.

102
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:15,139
My boyfriend.

103
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:17,701
Excuse me.

104
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,573
Damn that!

105
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,125
What the heck!

106
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,135
Wait!

107
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:17,553
Hold on!

108
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:05,535
Stop.

109
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,686
Just here.

110
00:27:56,712 --> 00:27:58,047
You are so beautiful.

111
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,176
Told you...

112
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:05,346
You don’t need anyone else.

113
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,519
Hey, girl.

114
00:28:13,162 --> 00:28:14,205
What are you talking
about yesterday

115
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,565
that sex life is off limits?

116
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,334
But your flower garden

117
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,708
always gets watered, right?

118
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:23,444
[chuckles] Wow, seriously?

119
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:27,843
Yeah, I water it often.

120
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:30,150
But let’s say...

121
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:33,403
The water doesn’t
reach the roots.

122
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,084
To the roots.

123
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:37,586
- You asshole.
- I do water it but...

124
00:28:38,604 --> 00:28:40,762
Your damn garden never blooms.

125
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:42,716
Are you barren?

126
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:44,212
Stupid, no.

127
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,343
Then what?

128
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,888
You feel numb? No sensation?

129
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:50,886
No!

130
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,365
I’m not satisfied.

131
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:55,424
That’s how it is!

132
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:56,872
It’s just that

133
00:28:56,897 --> 00:28:58,941
my partners just really
can’t make me come.

134
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:01,609
Why? Have you seen a doctor?

135
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:05,270
No, it’s not like that.

136
00:29:06,924 --> 00:29:07,975
Because,

137
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,775
I can orgasm by myself but...

138
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:14,415
my partners just really
can’t make me come.

139
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,858
It just never happens.

140
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:17,810
- Hello!
- Hello!

141
00:29:17,835 --> 00:29:19,558
Girl!

142
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,441
Oh! Babe, what about later?

143
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:24,842
Two bats, yeah? Game?

144
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:25,968
- Game!
- Okay!

145
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:26,993
Yes, I'm okay with it.

146
00:29:27,018 --> 00:29:28,395
- I’m in.
- Right!

147
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:30,097
Let’s get drunk again.

148
00:29:30,097 --> 00:29:32,658
Oh... Drunk with dick?

149
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:34,601
- Oh! My God!
- Oh!

150
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,246
Hey, even if— Ouch!

151
00:29:37,271 --> 00:29:39,190
Even if it’s already danger days.

152
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,484
My vagina is in danger.

153
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:43,569
It’s scarier when there’s no sex.

154
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:45,529
Oh! True.

155
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:47,767
Oh, what?

156
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:49,508
- Alright. Game?
- Game!

One more?

167
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:12,523
One more before we go.

168
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:25,869
Wait, what's up
with the angry face?

169
00:35:26,286 --> 00:35:28,872
- Nothing, just a small dick.
- Oh, really?

170
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:30,510
Yeah. Really.

171
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:32,625
Failure. Incomplete.

172
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:35,129

Finished, or not finished!

174
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:39,818
Damn it. I'll just go home.

175
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:41,092
Huh?

176
00:35:41,465 --> 00:35:43,754
- You’re so high-maintenance.

You’re so beautiful.

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
Denise.

191
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:18,007
Denise!

192
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:23,728
Hey, babe!

193
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:25,481
Look, is this okay for you?

194
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:27,720
What the...

195
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:29,102
You applied it all over,

196
00:43:29,127 --> 00:43:30,268
you don’t know how.

197
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:31,855
- Ugly.
- I told you,

198
00:43:31,855 --> 00:43:34,095
I’m really not good at
applying it on others.

199
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:35,702
On myself, it’s fine.

200
00:43:35,942 --> 00:43:37,557
Just wait for Badet.

201
00:43:37,961 --> 00:43:40,046
She might still be
at a client meeting.

202
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:42,273
My break time’s almost over.

203
00:43:43,441 --> 00:43:45,427
- You’re really bad at this.
- Hey!

204
00:43:45,452 --> 00:43:46,912
Hello!

205
00:43:46,937 --> 00:43:48,063
There!

206
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:50,290
Badet, you take over here.

207
00:43:50,315 --> 00:43:51,746
Because this one

208
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:53,018
is complaining so much.

209
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:54,336
She said my work’s ugly.

210
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:55,862
What? You do it!

211
00:43:56,313 --> 00:43:57,606
And finish the other foot!

212
00:43:57,631 --> 00:44:00,555
Denise only complained
after I finish the left foot.

213
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,749
Then she starts whining.

214
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:04,779
Grandma's totally zoned out.

215
00:44:04,804 --> 00:44:06,765
What happened to you?
What’s up with you, girl?

216
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:08,349
Hangover.

217
00:44:08,642 --> 00:44:09,642
Ah!

218
00:44:09,977 --> 00:44:11,966
Said she’d go home early.

219
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:13,622
But I saw you

220
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:15,167
right in the middle
of the dance floor.

221
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:18,467
- You saw me there?
- Of course.

222
00:44:18,735 --> 00:44:20,320
You were a showstopper, girl.

223
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,281
True.

224
00:44:35,168 --> 00:44:37,379
Ah! Damn it!

225
00:44:39,172 --> 00:44:40,891
If you don’t want a pedicure,

226
00:44:41,107 --> 00:44:42,442
don’t kick me, you ugly!

227
00:44:42,467 --> 00:44:43,551
You bitch!

228
00:44:43,576 --> 00:44:44,744
Are you good shit?

229
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,971
Come, let's smoke!
Damn you.

230
00:45:24,876 --> 00:45:26,820
Hey, guys! Come.

231
00:45:26,845 --> 00:45:28,054
- Yes?
- Let’s go for a smoke.

232
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,581
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

233
00:45:32,142 --> 00:45:33,810
Let me guide you.

234
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,811
Here.

235
00:45:34,811 --> 00:45:35,895
Come here.

236
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:40,667
Hmm!

237
00:45:40,984 --> 00:45:42,782
Bebs, later,

238
00:45:42,944 --> 00:45:45,447
mandatory fieldwork, okay?

239
00:45:45,472 --> 00:45:47,007
Is there pay for that?

240
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:49,909
You’re the one
we’ll get paid with.

241
00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:52,337
I’m in, but...

242
00:45:52,412 --> 00:45:53,943
Can we bring Mike along?

243
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:56,904
So we’ll have a dick with us.

244
00:45:58,393 --> 00:46:00,395
As long as it's BYOB.

245
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,880
Bring your own meal.

246
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,495
So Dins isn’t the only
one getting watered.

247
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:06,509
- Hey!
- Just kidding!

248
00:46:14,142 --> 00:46:15,226
Solid, right?

249
00:46:16,144 --> 00:46:17,144
Oh, sorry.

250
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:19,814
But you like it?

251
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:25,090
[upbeat music playing,
people chattering]

252
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,577
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

253
00:46:30,443 --> 00:46:31,444
Erika!

254
00:46:32,202 --> 00:46:33,549
- Erika!
- Erika!

255
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,401
Erika!

256
00:46:35,747 --> 00:46:37,040
Erika!

257
00:46:37,624 --> 00:46:38,624
Erika!

258
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:40,585
Five seconds!

259
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,253
- Five seconds!
- Five seconds!

260
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,385
- Five seconds!
- Five seconds!

261
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:46,303
- Five seconds!
- Five seconds!

262
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:48,385
Five seconds!

263
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,260
Five seconds!

264
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:51,679
- Five seconds!
- Five seconds!

265
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:53,348
- Five seconds!
- Five seconds!

266
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,178
[upbeat music playing,
people cheering]

267
00:46:56,212 --> 00:47:52,828
[upbeat music playing,
people chattering]

268
00:47:53,005 --> 00:47:54,052
Mike,

269
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:56,374
I’ll take you out later, okay?

270
00:47:57,704 --> 00:47:58,833
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:47:58,987 --> 00:48:42,253
[upbeat music playing,
people chattering]

272
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:04,789
What are you doing?

273
00:50:06,249 --> 00:50:07,458
Calm down.

274
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,088
Calm your dick.

275
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:10,628
I'll take care of you.

276
01:02:16,061 --> 01:02:17,396
Since when has

277
01:02:17,396 --> 01:02:19,386
Miss Denise Fuentes
been missing?

278
01:02:24,528 --> 01:02:27,239
She started being absent on

279
01:02:27,406 --> 01:02:29,436
the twenty-second of last month.

280
01:02:35,706 --> 01:02:37,529
She’s hardworking.

281
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:41,950
So we thought

282
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:45,328
maybe she just got
sick or something.

283
01:02:53,932 --> 01:02:55,648
She wasn’t answering her phone,

284
01:02:55,673 --> 01:02:58,461
so we went to her apartment.

285
01:03:00,388 --> 01:03:03,097
I didn’t notice anything unusual.

286
01:03:03,609 --> 01:03:05,056
Sometimes,

287
01:03:06,295 --> 01:03:08,814
I peeked into her house,

288
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:11,654
but I didn’t hear any
movement or noise.

289
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:15,035
Even the lights,
I didn’t see them turn on and off.

290
01:03:15,954 --> 01:03:18,045
There was a time I knocked,

291
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:19,922
but no one answered.

292
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:24,355
The landlady even said
she already reported it

293
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,853
to your station a long time ago.

294
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:31,136
Did you not receive
even a text message?

295
01:03:31,161 --> 01:03:32,956
Or even a missed call?

296
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,130
No, nothing.

297
01:03:39,995 --> 01:03:42,164
No, she didn’t mention

298
01:03:42,189 --> 01:03:45,665
any relatives,
or even an HR reference.

299
01:03:48,212 --> 01:03:51,019
Ms. Fuentes has been
missing for so long.

300
01:03:51,439 --> 01:03:55,039
We’ll be forced to file this
as a cold case

301
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,664
and all the belongings
left on your property

302
01:03:58,689 --> 01:04:00,803
will be turned over to your custody.

303
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,840
Here, here.

304
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:11,468
Bring it out here.

305
01:04:11,493 --> 01:04:12,536
Where’s your companion?

306
01:04:13,053 --> 01:04:14,594
Bro, come on!

307
01:04:15,973 --> 01:04:16,973
Let me sit here.

308
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:20,268
Hurry up.

309
01:04:21,353 --> 01:04:22,356
There’s more of that.

310
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:23,381
Yes, ma’am.

311
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:44,396
Are you disposing that already?

312
01:04:48,714 --> 01:04:49,714
I could.

313
01:04:54,428 --> 01:04:55,428
Narra.

314
01:04:57,097 --> 01:04:58,390
Good quality wood.

315
01:05:00,017 --> 01:05:01,017
Fifteen thousand.

316
01:05:02,536 --> 01:05:03,662
I’ll pay now.

317
01:05:04,394 --> 01:05:06,145
Perfect. I brought my vehicle.

318
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:12,070
Looks like you don’t
have space for it anyway.

319
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:14,631
Also, to save you the hassle.

320
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:16,783
Easy money, too.

321
01:05:18,243 --> 01:05:19,243
Come on now.

322
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,120
Alright then.

323
01:05:23,631 --> 01:05:24,631
That’s complete.

324
01:05:26,997 --> 01:05:27,997
What now?

325
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:29,171
Load it up?

326
01:05:29,196 --> 01:05:31,622
- Alright, load this there.
- Okay.

327
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:32,774
Handle it carefully, okay?

328
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,681
- Come on.
- Careful with that.

329
01:05:45,229 --> 01:05:46,396
We’ll go ahead now.

330
01:05:58,909 --> 01:06:03,914
Soon after...

331
01:07:46,933 --> 01:07:48,310
You’re so beautiful,

332
01:07:49,342 --> 01:07:50,885
you don’t need anyone else.
