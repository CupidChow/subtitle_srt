(So This Is How You Play?)

16
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,890
For all these shampoos and other stuff,

17
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,860
I let Huan'er bring them.

18
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,900
Buy two more bottles later.

19
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,470
Close it tightly,
so they don't leak.

20
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,220
Dad, Mom,

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,750
I'm home!

22
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,560
My dear, you're back.

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,060
You're back.

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,300
My dear girl,

25
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,750
you've become slimmer.

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,200
- Have you been too tired lately?
- No, I haven't.

27
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,460
Why do I think she...

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,300
Mom, what are you doing?

29
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,790
See, your mom is so forgetful.

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,280
Your admission letter already arrived,

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,230
and I just remembered

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,600
to get things ready for you.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,420
Oh, right. You have to report
on the 28th.

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
So soon?

35
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,790
Here, you see.

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,300
(Wuan University)

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,550
(Jing Xichi, how about you?)

38
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,790
(I'm the same as Song.)

39
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,580
What about your second choice?

40
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,020
I didn't fill up a second choice.

41
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,180
You didn't?

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,830
How bold you are!

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,350
What if

44
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,070
you don't get in?

45
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,140
What else?

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,390
I'll just retake it.

47
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,020
Retake your head!

48
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,670
You know how struggling

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,580
this year was.

50
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,420
What's wrong?

51
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:50,990
Not happy?

52
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,180
Do you think the stuff Dad bought
is old-fashioned?

53
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,600
He doesn't have an eye for fashion.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,380
Doesn't look good?

55
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,460
I can get you something else.

56
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,230
No, Dad.

57
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,390
I just feel that...

58
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,230
I'm going to university.

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,580
Leaving home to another city,

60
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,230
being away from friends

61
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,670
and parents...

62
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,270
I feel a bit reluctant.

63
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,550
Tianhe isn't far from Wuan.

64
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,740
That's just less than
an hour away by high-speed rail.

65
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,280
If you're homesick,
come back every week.

66
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,580
Yeah.

67
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,990
When I have time,

68
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,230
I'll visit you whenever I can.

69
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,580
Huan'er,

70
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,070
your mom is right.

71
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,670
Just come back if you miss home.

72
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,700
If it gets too hard,

73
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,300
it's fine for not going to university.

74
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,950
Dad!

75
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,270
Can you wish me something good for once?

76
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,900
Oh, yeah, Mom.

77
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,270
Has Jing Xichi

78
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,680
received his admission letter yet?

79
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,740
I don't know.

80
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,830
I do.

81
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,300
How do you know?

82
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,510
I saw it.

83
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,390
A delivery man went
to their house a few days ago

84
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,550
and delivered them a letter.

85
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,270
You've got sharp eyes.

86
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,180
What do you mean?

87
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,200
(Congratulations to you)

88
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,150
(that you got into
your dream university.)

89
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,110
(I also received the offer letter)

90
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,300
(from Wuan University.)

(is more meaningful.)

103
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,900
(Recipient: Piggy Jing)

104
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,740
Why are you here?

105
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,150
I was bored at home

106
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,380
as I had nothing to do,

107
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,060
so I came to find you.

108
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,030
How was your graduation trip?

109
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,940
It was fine.

110
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,590
I can tell from your response

111
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,230
that it was not fine.

112
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,470
Luckily, I decided not to go.

113
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,910
I knew

114
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,790
that it was a waste of money to suffer.

115
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,790
All of you

116
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,590
are too complicated.

117
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,500
With that time,

118
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,940
I'd rather study.

119
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,860
Yeah, it's so complicated.

120
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,230
I...

121
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,590
Never mind.

122
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,990
You should go home.

123
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,910
I'm closing up.

124
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,590
Fine.

125
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,790
Alright.

126
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,230
I'll come by tomorrow.

127
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,820
Don't come here tomorrow.

128
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,180
I won't be here tomorrow.

129
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,550
I have a tutoring job tomorrow.

130
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,420
Huan'er.

131
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,550
Song Cong.

132
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,940
Why are you here?

133
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,150
I just came out to get some air.

134
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,350
Congratulations

135
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,320
that you got into Yenching University.

136
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,260
Thanks.

137
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,460
Congratulations to you too.

138
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,180
Thank you.

139
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,860
I was just watering the plants.

140
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,550
I get to go now.

141
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,150
Huan'er.

142
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,670
Stop avoiding me.

143
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,030
I think

144
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,820
there are things

145
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,670
I should clarify to you.

146
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,190
I want to apologize to you.

147
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,900
What I said that day

148
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,900
must have made things awkward for you.

149
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,070
I...

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,140
I drank too much that day

151
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,350
and I got a little carried away.

152
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,780
It's fine.

153
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,430
You don't have to apologize for that.

154
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,470
Just pretend I never say that.

155
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,540
Well...

156
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,780
Can we

157
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,310
still be friends after this?

158
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,660
Honestly...

159
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,260
It's hard for now.

160
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,190
Please give me some time

161
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,110
to process.

162
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,380
Alright.

163
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,500
It's okay.

164
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,470
If you feel

165
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,140
it's awkward,

166
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,900
you can just

167
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,540
think of me

168
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,620
as a neighbor.

169
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,590
I'm leaving.

170
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,950
(I'm at our secret base.)

171
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,500
(Do you want to come?)

172
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,660
(I'm working on the website.)

173
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,780
(I'm not going.)

174
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,860
Sit here.

175
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,430
Alright.

176
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,020
I'll go and order some drinks.

177
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,110
What do you want?

178
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,080
Anything is fine.

179
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Hello, waiter.

180
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,070
Hi.

181
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,470
Three orange juices, please.

182
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,140
Thank you.

183
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,500
Huan'er,

184
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,860
how do you resist

185
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,140
buying all those

186
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,260
pretty dresses?

187
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,740
I feel like none of the stores

188
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,350
have one that suits me.

189
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,540
Which one do you think

190
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,470
looks better? Is this gray one

191
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,110
or the white one

192
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,020
that I didn't buy?

193
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,350
White...

194
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,710
I think they both look nice.

195
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,540
They look the same to me.

196
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,740
I think

197
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,230
white is more elegant.

198
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,190
And I feel like

199
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,990
my boyfriend

200
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,230
likes that style more too.

201
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,950
You have a boyfriend?

202
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,310
Xinyan!

203
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,140
Babe!

204
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,660
I'm sorry. There was a long

205
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,860
line in the ice cream store

206
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,780
where I bought this.

207
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,880
Sorry to keep you waiting.

208
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,640
Thank you.

209
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,230
Oops, sorry.

210
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,540
You have a friend with you here.

211
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,950
I only bought one.

212
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,140
I'll go and buy another for your friend.

213
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,140
That's so sweet of you.

214
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,140
It's so hot outside.

215
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,950
It's fine. Not a big deal.

216
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,540
Just wait for me a while.

217
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,710
Wait a minute.

218
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,470
Help me pick.

219
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,490
Which dress looks better?

220
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,860
Gray or white?

221
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,780
I love them both and I can't decide.

222
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,350
They both look great.

223
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,500
If you like them both,

224
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,470
just buy them both.

225
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,540
I'll pay for it.

226
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,140
I'm not that greedy.

227
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,430
They are similar.

228
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,430
One is enough.

229
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,190
You go and buy the ice cream.

230
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
I have another friend coming later.

231
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,200
Get one more.

232
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,470
Alright.

233
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,350
Chen Huan'er!

234
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,780
What's with that face?

235
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,380
Nothing.

236
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,830
Huan'er!

237
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,380
Xinyan!

238
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,710
Why are you so late?

239
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,950
I just finished my piano lesson

240
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,020
and came straight here.

241
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,990
Did you see

242
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,980
my boyfriend just now?

243
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,340
- What?
- Is he handsome?

244
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,280
She has a boyfriend now.

245
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,700
The one who just walked out.

246
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,740
Boyfriend?

247
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
Why this expression?

248
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,620
Is it strange for me

249
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,860
to have a boyfriend?

250
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,140
Not strange.

251
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,900
Just...

252
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,500
Just a little too fast.

253
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,900
I got rejected three days ago.

254
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,260
Just three days?

255
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,070
Are you

256
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,830
getting upset

257
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,480
because you got rejected by Jing Xichi,

258
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,720
and you want to get back at him?

259
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,840
How is that possible?

260
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,860
I like my boyfriend very much.

261
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,590
Then...

262
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,230
When did you meet

263
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,190
your boyfriend?

264
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,020
Yesterday.

265
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,070
Yesterday?

266
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,190
On a soccer field.

267
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,430
It was love at first sight.

268
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,620
Soccer field?

269
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,780
So...

270
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,190
He's a substitute?

271
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,830
How should I put it...

272
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,950
Not exactly.

273
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,230
I thought about it,

274
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,990
and I just like

275
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,710
this kind of athletic guy.

276
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,540
So,

277
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,660
do you still like Jing Xichi?

278
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,590
Yes, I do.

279
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,590
You like them both?

280
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,190
It's just like with these dresses.

281
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,500
I like them both,

282
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,780
just in different colors.

283
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,110
If circumstances allowed,

284
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,310
I'd want them both.

285
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,830
That sounds

286
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,260
reasonable...

287
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,190
How can this be reasonable?

288
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,950
Dresses and people aren't the same.

289
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,500
Why not?

290
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,350
Are you planning

291
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,070
to be hung up on Song Cong forever?

292
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,430
You...

293
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,470
How did you...

294
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,540
You're way too obvious about Song Cong.

295
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,620
I don't know.

296
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,140
But,

297
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,140
Song Cong doesn't like me.

298
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,900
There's nothing

299
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,070
between us.

300
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,140
Qi Qi,

301
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,430
I already made things clear

302
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,350
with him that day.

303
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,260
I knew something was
going on between you two.

304
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,140
I could tell
from the agriculture study lesson.

305
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,540
No, there's nothing!

306
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:57,740
Qi Qi,

307
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,260
don't misunderstand me.

308
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,740
I made it clear to him.

309
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,310
Don't worry.

310
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,280
Whether Song Cong
likes or doesn't like you,

311
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,440
or whoever he likes,

312
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,320
you will always be
my most important friend.

313
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,470
So, since there's nothing
between you and Song Cong...

314
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,950
Doesn't that mean you have a chance?

315
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,020
Me?

316
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,430
Think about it.

317
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,020
For four years of university life,

318
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,900
you two are far away from home

319
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,590
with parents not around

320
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,310
to watch over you,

321
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,540
and there will be plenty of chances

322
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,110
you two study together.

323
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,500
Isn't that

324
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,190
your opportunity?

325
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,260
Tell me more.

326
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,430
First,

327
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,920
you have to take the initiative.

328
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:37,990
In Year 1,

329
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,780
you need to seize the moment.

330
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,700
Well, how does she take the initiative?

331
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,540
Make sure he knows

332
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,230
you like him.

333
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,830
He already knows.

334
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,190
Then, you're halfway there.

335
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,900
That's already halfway?

336
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,740
So,

337
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,580
what about the other half?

338
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,020
Since you two are serious

339
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,070
about learning this,

340
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,110
I'll share my unbeatable

341
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,140
dating strategies

342
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,350
with you.

343
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,190
Xinyan, stop keeping us in suspense.

344
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,150
Just tell us.

345
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,260
No desire means strength.

346
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,670
The ice cream is here.

347
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,390
Thanks, babe.

348
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,340
This is my boyfriend.

349
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,060
This is my friend Qi Qi,
and this is Huan'er. You just saw her.

350
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,820
Nice to meet you.

351
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,100
Don't just sit there. Try it.

352
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,540
Let me feed you.

353
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,300
Is it sweet?

354
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,260
Sweet?

355
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,580
Want another bite?

356
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,150
Dad, Mom.

357
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,340
You're back, my dear.

358
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:41,870
You're back.

359
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,740
I'm hungry.

360
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,990
What did you guys make?

361
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,200
We thought you wouldn't
be eating at home,

362
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,660
so your dad and I just mixed everything

363
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,580
and made a cold dish,
and some Zhajiangmian.

364
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,820
Come, let's eat together.

365
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,540
Is this enough?

366
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,380
It smells so good.

367
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,260
Is it okay?

368
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,710
How could this not be okay, Mom?

369
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,580
I was planning to eat out
with my classmates,

370
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,540
but then I thought,

371
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,020
since university is starting soon,

372
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,500
I should enjoy more
of my mom's homemade food.

373
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,710
What a liar!

374
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,950
Your classmates must've had other plans

375
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,230
and didn't invite you.

376
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,540
How did you know?

377
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,630
Is it that they had a date

378
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,910
and didn't want you to be a third wheel?

379
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,870
Dad!

380
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,060
Mom must've put a GPS on me.

381
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,870
I just simply guess.

382
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:23,630
Wait, wait.

383
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,760
What does it mean, Huan'er?

384
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,150
Your classmates started dating?

385
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,260
Yeah.

386
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,300
No need to act so shocked.

387
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,710
They'll be university students soon.

388
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,870
What's wrong with dating?

389
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,880
No. What do you mean
by “what's wrong with it”?

390
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,710
Huan'er is still a young lady.

391
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,150
Huan'er, listen to your dad.

392
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,000
In university,

393
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,020
the most important thing is
to focus on your studies,

394
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,140
not on starting a date soon.

395
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,240
I absolutely won't allow it.

396
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,990
Don't listen to him.

397
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,740
I tell you,

398
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,300
it's your university life.

399
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,580
It lasts four years.

400
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,910
Why not enjoy your youth?

401
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,950
Hold on, don't feed her
with all this thought,

402
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,670
okay?

403
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,260
What do you mean by enjoying the youth?

404
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,670
What do you mean by that?

405
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,910
When I was in medical school,

406
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,640
weren't you who always
appeared in my school

407
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,390
and chased after me?

408
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,600
During your postgraduate years!

409
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,360
Don't mess around.

410
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,640
She's just in her freshman year.

411
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,670
You're unbelievable.

412
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,710
Absolutely no dating!

413
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,990
Let me ask you something.

414
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,710
Someone likes your classmates.

415
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,360
Does anyone in your class like you?

416
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,060
Chen Huan'er,

417
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,740
I like you.

418
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,300
No one...

419
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,230
How could anyone like me?

420
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,190
It makes sense.

421
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,780
Slurping down noodles like that.

422
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,020
You are not ladylike at all.

423
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,520
It'd be weird if someone liked you.

424
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,340
Just like you.

425
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,820
Just like you.

426
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,820
Well.

427
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,780
Jing Xichi and Song Cong

428
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,390
are around you all the time.

429
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,100
Why don't

430
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,300
they like you?

431
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,060
That makes sense.

432
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,190
They must

433
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,430
not see you as a girl.

434
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,710
Dad.

435
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,020
Mom says I'm not even a girl.

436
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,260
Can't you stop talking?

437
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,540
My daughter is wonderful!

438
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,820
She's beautiful and nice.

439
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,910
Look at the way you eat.

440
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,500
She learned it from you.

441
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,020
Still, no dating!

442
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,390
Don't listen to him.

443
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:12,910
Dad.

444
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,220
Are you done eating?

445
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,740
It's all yours.

446
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,910
Take this big bowl.

447
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,150
Have some vitamin C after your meal.

448
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,260
Mom, I can't eat anymore.

449
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,300
Eat slowly.

450
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,920
Oh, right.

451
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,320
Since it's back-to-school season,

452
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,260
book your ticket soon

453
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,740
or it'll be too late.

454
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,710
Got it.

455
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,950
By the way,

456
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,470
Aunt Hao Mei told me

457
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,300
Song Cong is heading to school early.

458
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,230
Is Jing Xichi

459
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,100
going with him?

460
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,190
I don't know.

461
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,500
Aren't you always

462
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,710
hanging out with him?

463
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,020
He's been disappearing lately.

464
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,470
I have no idea what he's up to.

465
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,390
Huan'er,

466
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,990
I have something to discuss with you.

467
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,340
It's your first time
going to university.

468
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,910
What about us going with you?

469
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,580
Yeah, yeah.

470
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,580
No way!

471
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,100
Why not?

472
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,820
Dad, Mom,

473
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,230
none of my classmates

474
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,340
go with their parents.

475
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,580
That's fine, we can.

476
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,190
How do you know

477
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,300
no one's parents are going?

478
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
Xinyan isn't going with her parents.

479
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,060
Dad, Mom.

480
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,670
We can go.

481
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,150
At least let me spend time with you.

482
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,670
I'm going to university

483
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,940
to learn to live independently.

484
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,680
Really!

485
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:27,950
Help me!

486
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:42,260
(139088 Tianhe Railway)

487
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,460
(It's almost time to enter university.)

488
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,600
(When are you leaving?)

489
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,300
(Not decided yet.)

490
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,950
(Are you free?)

491
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,710
(Come and meet me at our secret base.)

492
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,430
(He finally remembered me.)

493
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,150
(What's up?)

494
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,910
(I have something to tell you.)

495
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,740
(Let's talk about it when we meet.)

496
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,500
Mom,

497
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,100
I'm going out for a while.

498
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,740
Jing Xichi,

499
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,300
I sent you so many messages,

500
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,220
but you didn't reply.

501
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,860
And you're finally
willing to contact me.

502
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,470
What happens?

503
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,300
What is this?

504
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,400
The money from selling our books.

505
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,100
Qi Qi, Xinyan,

506
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,950
and Song Cong

507
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,060
have already taken theirs.

508
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,390
You're the last one.

509
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,950
That much?

510
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,500
Did you call me here

511
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,670
just to give me money?

512
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,340
Yeah.

513
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,150
We're going to university soon.

514
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,100
Don't you have

515
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,670
anything else to say?

516
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,390
I mean,

517
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,710
I haven't seen you these past few days.

518
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,340
I have no idea what you've been up to.

519
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,950
I was selling books,

520
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,780
working on my website,

521
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,740
and handling all sorts

522
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,430
of random things.

523
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,540
It's fine.

524
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,710
Anyway,

525
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,870
we'll see each other

526
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,950
during school breaks.

527
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,430
If you need anything,

528
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,470
just call me.

529
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,300
Honestly,

530
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,100
when I got

531
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,630
my admission letter,

532
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,820
I was really happy.

533
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,710
But the moment I realized

534
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,500
we were all going our separate ways

535
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,580
and living in different cities...

536
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,190
I couldn't feel happy anymore.

537
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,950
Do you think

538
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,710
we will

539
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,580
slowly lose touch?

540
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,430
Why?

541
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,630
You

542
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,950
can't bear to leave me?

543
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,150
Yeah.

544
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,580
I can't bear to leave you.

545
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,430
Alright.

546
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,260
I get to go.

547
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,710
Oh yeah.

548
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,260
Well...

549
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,470
Before we part,

550
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,780
let's have a hug.

551
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,260
I'm leaving.

552
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,430
Thank you.

553
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,560
Not a big deal.

554
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,190
We're not that far apart.

555
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,640
(Tianhe No.3 Central Hospital Compound)
I'll come back soon.

556
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,940
Driver, can you open the boot?

557
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,580
Make sure

558
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,580
to keep your ID safe.

559
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,910
Keep your wallet secure.

560
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,580
And,

561
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,160
as soon as you get off the train,

562
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,060
call Mom. Got it?

563
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,190
Yes, I'll text you.

564
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,710
Huan'er,

565
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,150
do you have enough phone credit?

566
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,300
If not, I can top it up.

567
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,500
You just topped it up
with a hundred yesterday.

568
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,180
Remember,

569
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,140
when you get there,

570
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,740
eat well and buy whatever you need.

571
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,680
Don't worry,
I won't let myself go hungry.

572
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,100
Oh yeah...

573
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,020
Stop nagging.

574
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,380
She still has to catch the train.

575
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,260
If you hold her up,

576
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,540
she'll miss it.

577
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,150
Wait a second.

578
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,950
I want a hug.

579
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,470
Dad.

580
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,990
Take care of yourself.

581
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,710
One more hug for me.

582
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,950
Alright, didn't you say

583
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,740
she was in a hurry?

584
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,710
Go on, go on.

585
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:52,990
I'm off.

586
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,870
Bye, Mom.

587
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,910
By the way,

588
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,060
there's a pack of medicine in your bag.

589
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,390
And, remember to wear more layers
when it gets cold.

590
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,580
Drink less cold beverages.

591
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,470
Got it.

592
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,860
Go on. Driver, please drive carefully.

593
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,340
Be safe.

594
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,910
Bye, Mom.

595
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,840
Take care of yourself!

596
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,060
Stay safe.

597
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,430
Got it.

598
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:06,910
You hear me?

599
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,910
Bye!

600
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,190
Dad, take care of Mom.

601
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,580
Don't worry.

602
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,540
I'm just as worried as you.

603
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,760
How about I apply to be
a security guard at her school?

604
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,340
Even if I'm just watching
the gates...

605
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,390
Forget it.

606
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,710
You're always traveling abroad,

607
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,540
and I never feel
that you're worried about her.

608
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,630
She's just going to Wuan now.

609
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,500
It's not far away.

610
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,540
And, you became so worried about her.

611
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,740
It's different. She was at home before.

612
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,520
You were here to keep an eye on her.

613
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,630
Now, someone else

614
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,000
will be watching out for her.

615
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,580
Who?

616
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,630
Did you arrange something?

617
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,150
See,

618
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,710
you're totally out of the loop.

619
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,300
What?

620
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,390
What are you talking about?

621
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,180
(Wuan City)

622
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,960
(Wuan University)

623
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,992
(Hello! Welcome, new students!)

624
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:14,780
(Warm welcome to the
2010 batch freshmen of Wuan University.)

627
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,540
(Did you check in yet?)

628
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,780
Thank you.

629
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:19,380
(Second Choice:
Wuan University, Computer Science)

630
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,020
What do you think?

631
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,300
At a crucial moment like this,

632
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,660
you still had to rely on me, huh?

633
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,100
Jing Xichi!

634
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,470
Wait,

635
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,300
why are you here?

636
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,500
Wuan University.

637

Computer Science.

Student ID: 110101.

639
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,100
Chen Huan'er,

640
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,580
we're classmates again.

641
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,710
Surprised?

642
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,060
Didn't you apply
to Yenching University?

643
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,540
I missed the mark by a few points.

644
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,990
Didn't you tell me

645
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,300
you only put down one school?

646
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,320
You think I'm silly?
I put down more than one!

647
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,020
I lied to you.

648
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,230
What's wrong?

649
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,060
Too happy to speak?

650
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,300
Let's go.

651
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,300
I'll take you to your dorm.

652
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,340
Are the girls' dorms

653
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:05,990
over there?

654
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,400
I can handle it myself.

655
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,150
It's fine, I can help you.

656
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,990
I said, I can handle it.

657
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,260
Are you mad?

658
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
I just wanted

659
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,390
to mess with you

660
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,060
as I wanted to give you a surprise.

661
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,340
Can you be more mature?

662
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,150
I was worried about you all summer.

663
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,430
It's not that serious.

664
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,710
You're mad?

665
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,300
Chen Huan'er.

666
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,430
I didn't mean to.

667
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,470
Are you Chen Huan'er?

668
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,950
You are?

669
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,430
Hi, I'm Tian Chi,

670
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,820
a senior in the School of Pharmacy.

671
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,950
I'm helping
with freshman orientation today.

672
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,100
Are you from Tianhe No.1 Middle School?

673
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,470
Yes, I am.

674
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,180
I'm from Tianhe No.1 Middle School too.

675
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,380
I'm two years ahead of you.

676
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,870
Nice to meet you, Senior!

677
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,020
And you are?

678
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,200
I'm from Tianhe No.1
Middle School as well.

679
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,240
I just got into Wuan University's
Computer Science.

680
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,020
I'm Jing Xichi.

681
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,240
Welcome to Wuan University.

682
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,470
Are you heading to the dorms?

683
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,580
Yeah, I am.

684
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,190
I also had to go
to the dorm supervisor

685
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,480
to check students' information.

686
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,420
I can take you there.

687
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,470
Thank you, but no need.

688
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,340
We'll go ourselves.

689
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,190
Thanks, Tian Chi.

690
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,230
Let me help you.

691
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,630
Thanks.

692
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,670
You're welcome.

693
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,190
We met at the library back then.

694
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:27,910
I don't know

695
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,160
if you still remember.

696
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,580
Really? When was that?

697
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,910
I remember there was

698
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,990
a Bookcrossing Event.

699
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,380
It left quite an impression on me.

700
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,820
I borrowed a book back then

701
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,300
and never returned it.

702
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,880
The book I put in the exchange

703
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,040
also never came back.

704
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,500
Could it be that you took it?

705
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,190
The book you put in...

706
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,260
Was it...

707
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,820
(Neuropsychology)

708
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,990
Neuropsychology?

709
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,630
So, it was you!

710
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,470
What a coincidence!

711
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,920
I'll return it to you another day.

712
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:10,820
Sorry about that.

713
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,870
It's fine.

714
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,710
Since it's fate that we meet again,

715
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,990
I will just give it to you.

716
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,580
Really?

717
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,020
Let's go.

718
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,780
(Aunt, don't worry.)

719
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,520
(Huan'er has arrived at the dorm.)

720
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,300
(You didn't get
into Yenching University?)

721
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,950
Why?

722
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,260
I missed it by two points.

723
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,340
Then, what was your second choice?

724
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,260
Wuan University.

725
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,230
Wuan University?

726
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,320
Wuan University is pretty good too.

727
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,900
You'll be at the same school as Huan'er.

728
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,400
Yeah.

729
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,740
Can you do me a little favor?

730
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,990
Aunt, I got it.

731
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,230
Chen Huan'er.

732
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,860
I'll definitely take good care of her.

733
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,100
But, Aunt,

734
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,500
can you

735
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,780
keep this a secret

736
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,580
for me?

737
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,340
You got to save face.

738
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,150
I understand.

739
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,340
Who are you?

740
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,060
Hello.

741
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,260
You're also
in the Computer Science course?

742
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,390
How do you know?

743
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,990
I just overheard it earlier.

744
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,420
You could hear that from there?

745
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,150
I have sharp ears.

746
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,300
I'm a freshman too.

747
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,430
Which room are you in?

748
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:25,740
258.

749
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,500
258?

750
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,300
Really 258?

751
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,100
Yes, 258.

752
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,150
A man of destiny, buddy.

753
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,920
What? What destiny?

754
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,300
Let's go.

755
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,820
My suitcase.

756
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,580
Just come with me.

757
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,160
Who are you?

758
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,910
I'll take you there.

759
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,340
Wait...

760
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,980
Come with me.

761
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,870
Give me my suitcase first.

762
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,660
Just come with me.

763
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,260
Who are you?

764
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,060
Did you come

765
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,100
with that guy from earlier?

766
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,060
No, I came alone.

767
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,150
I saw him drop you off downstairs,

768
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,780
so I thought you two were close.

769
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,190
We were high school classmates.

770
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,150
Let's go.

771
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,150
I reached.

772
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,660
I'll help you bring it inside.

773
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,140
It's fine. I can do it myself.

774
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,700
Hello.

775
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,870
I'm Huang Lu.

776
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:13,950
You can call me Huang

777
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:14,950
or Lu.

778
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,700
Hi.

779
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:16,910
I'm Chen Huan'er.

780
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,950
Huan'er.

781
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,270
Well...

782
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,470
And this is?

783
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,500
This is our direct senior.

784
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,470
Hi, I'm Tian Chi.

785
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:27,350
Hi, Tian Chi.

786
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,180
Hi.

787
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,660
Well.

788
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,580
If there's nothing else, I get to go.

789
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,310
Alright, thank you, Tian Chi.

790
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:33,830
Thanks.

791
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,540
Bye, Tian Chi.

792
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,140
Bye!

793
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,660
Wow, such a handsome senior.

794
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,100
Is he your boyfriend?

795
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,620
No, no.

796
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,910
We just met downstairs.

797
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,350
He's my high school alumnus.

798
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,950
A potential boyfriend, huh?

799
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,750
No, don't simply say that.

800
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,500
Don't be shy.

801
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,700
What's the big deal?

802
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,310
Or

803
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,100
do you have a boyfriend in high school?

804
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,390
So, you can't make him yours.

805
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,140
No!

806
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,350
Really?

807
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,430
Really.

808
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,310
Really no?

809
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,310
Really.

810
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,100
Look into my eyes.

811
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,830
Really no?

812
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,790
No, no.

813
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,790
Hi, nice to meet you.

814
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,310
Hi, juniors.

815
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,090
- Hello, senior.
- Hello, senior.

816
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:12,870
Qiu Li,

817
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,100
we left your luggage here.

818
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,350
Thank you.

819
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,100
Well,

820
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,000
if there's nothing else, we'll head out.

821
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,380
Feel free to contact us anytime.

822
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,790
We're in the same major,

823
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,240
so we should help each other out.

824
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,620
Alright.

825
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,220
We get to go.

826
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:23,700
Bye.

827
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,470
We're leaving.

828
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,500
Bye, seniors.

829
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,640
We'll keep in touch.

830
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,700
Hello, I'm Qiu Li.

831
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,310
Hi.

832
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,540
I'm Chen Huan'er.

833
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,310
I'm Huang Lu.

834
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,700
We're all roommates now.

835
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,140
Let's take care of each other.

836
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,470
Of course!

837
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,860
Oh, right!

838
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,790
My roommates,

839
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,270
since we're all here,

840
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,280
I bring some specialty snacks
from my hometown.

841
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,560
Take whatever you like.

842
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,430
That's a lot!

843
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,430
Take a look.

844
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,220
Thank you.

845
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,430
No problem.

846
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,220
Wait...

847
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,750
Aren't we missing one person?

848
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,270
Oh, her?

849
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,390
She arrived early.

850
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,390
Where is she now?

851
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,840
She went to the library

852
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,750
early in the morning.

853
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,060
That early?

854
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:04,470
It's only the first day.

855
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,220
Alright, I'll go unpack.

856
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,470
Help yourselves.

857
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,700
Thanks!

858
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,020
Come on!

859
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,580
From today on,

860
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,500
we'll be

861
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,350
living under the same roof.

862
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,870
He's Yan Mu.

863
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,580
He doesn't talk much.

864
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
This is your place.

865
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,390
You are the one

866
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,870
who obtained the highest score
in our major?

867
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,700
My student ID is 02.

868
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,430
You scored even higher than me.

869
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,940
Why did you come to Wuan University?

870
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,270
I didn't get into my first choice.

871
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,540
Is your first choice...

872
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,750
Wow, we're really in the same boat.

873
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,750
Such a coincidence!

874
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,180
I...

875
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,620
Come on!

876
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,870
What a coincidence!

877
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,950
Come on, take this.

878
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,800
Since we're so similar,
just take this with you.

879
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,390
Thank you.

880
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,180
Don't mention it. We're too similar!

881
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,470
Buddy, your gear

882
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,990
is quite a mix.

883
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,620
It's pretty nice.

884
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,140
Listen, Jing,

885
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,470
as guys,

886
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,680
we need to be delicate too.

887
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,990
I think you also

888
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,950
have a good base too.

889
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,540
But, you shouldn't slack off.

890
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,660
Or you won't be able
to get a girlfriend here either.

891
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,100
Thank you.

892
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,350
Wait.

893
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,100
You didn't disinfect it.

894
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,580
Are you...

895
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,660
A Virgo?

896
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,780
I'm tough on the outside,
and soft on the inside.

897
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,220
I'm a meticulous person.

898
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,910
It's done.

899
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,870
What did you mean just now?

900
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,180
In other words,

901
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,180
I'm a "hidden gem" type of guy

902
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,060
with rich emotions.

903
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,700
Alright.

904
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,310
You, carry on.

905
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:03,950
Alright.

906
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,180
Where is this roommate?

907
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,220
He is Zhang Yang.

908
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,460
He went out to play soccer.

909
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,350
You unpack first.

910
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,140
Come on.

911
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,620
Such a coincidence.

912
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,020
Thanks.

913
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,100
Disinfectant.

914
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,140
Disinfectant.

915
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,580
Thanks.

916
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,500
Not a big deal.

917
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,310
Song Cong,

918
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,660
do you know whose bed

919
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,430
is opposite?

920
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:53,790
Who?

921
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,950
Lin Jingyi.

922
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,220
Our school's top scorer.

923
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,790
I really want to see

924
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,060
what kind of person he is

925
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,020
who can obtain

926
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,100
such a crazy high score.

927
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,910
Hello, Song.

928
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:21,830
What's up?

929
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,540
When are you coming to register?

930
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,990
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

931
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,750
I didn't get into Yenching University.

932
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,420
I'm at Wuan University now.

933
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,790
You applied for a second choice?

934
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,750
Then, why didn't you tell me

935
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,960
when I asked you the other day

936
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,260
if you wanted to come with me?

937
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,790
Because I was afraid that if I told you,

938
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,220
you'd tell Aunt Hao,

939
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,830
and then the whole family
housing compound would know.

940
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,480
How would I surprise Chen Huan'er then?

941
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,350
Are you sure it's a surprise

942
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,430
and not a shock?

943
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,270
You're right.

944
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
It probably was a shock.

945
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,540
She's mad at me.

946
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,830
You're so bad, Jing Xichi.

947
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,940
I suggest you properly apologize to her.

948
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,910
Alright, I got it.

949
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:03,990
Anything else?

950
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,280
If not, I'm hanging up.

951
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,780
Fighting with your girlfriend?

952
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,470
No.

953
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,440
It's just my childhood friend.

954
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,470
It's childhood sweethearts then.

955
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,270
(Have you finished unpacking?)

956
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,140
(Our dorm doesn't
have air conditioning.)

957
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,360
(Do you have one in your dorm?)

958
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,060
(And,)

959
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,880
(what about we have
dinner together tonight?)

960
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,720
Who wants to have dinner with you?

961
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,310
What's this?

962
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,140
(Huan'er,)

963
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,860
(this is a medicine kit
I prepared for you)

964
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,440
(for preventing acclimatization issues.)

965
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,350
(One pack for you,)

966
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,620
(one pack for Xichi.)

967
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,020
So, I was the only one who didn't know?

968
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,600
Everyone was keeping this from me?

969
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,910
(I'm Tian Chi.)

970
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,180
(This is my phone number.)

971
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,620
(If you need any help,)

972
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,540
(feel free to ask.)

973
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,830
(Senior Tian Chi,)

974
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,580
(how did you get)

975
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,660
(my phone number?)

976
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,000
(I'm in charge
of freshman registration.)

977
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,200
(Your personal information)

978
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,460
(is in the student handbook.)

979
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,140
(Thank you for your help this morning.)

980
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,270
(Don't mention it.)

981
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:03,900
How bad!

982
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,180
They are too bad!
