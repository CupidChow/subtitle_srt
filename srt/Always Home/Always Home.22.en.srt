(Qi Qi's Victory)

16
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,450
How are they now?

17
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,600
I don't know.
I haven't contacted them yet.

18
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,659
Hello, can you take a photo

19
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,700
of the three of us?

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,379
Sure.

21
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,140
Okay.

22
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,549
Are you done?

23
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,300
Yes.

24
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,949
- Thank you.
- Are the photos alright?

25
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,650
- Thank you.
-  It's alright.

26
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,300
Were you taking photos of me?

27
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,549
No. I'm taking photos of the scenery.

28
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,650
You saw it wrong.

29
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,220
Ms. Qi.

30
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,019
You studied law.

31
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,499
You should know

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,149
that infringing
on others' portrait rights

33
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,410
is illegal.

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,669
Mr. Song.

35
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,459
I'm creating art.

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,949
You're the one who came into my shot

37
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,370
and became my scenery.

38
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,620
Can I take a look
at your art creation then?

39
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,320
You can only take a look.
You're not allowed to delete it.

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,810
Okay.

41
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,949
I didn't even see it.

42
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,179
Shall I show you again?

43
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,339
You didn't even turn on your phone.
How can I see it?

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,549
Enough.

45
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,019
Let's go up.

46
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,180
The mountain is beautiful.

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,740
Hurry up.

48
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,410
(Speaking of,)

49
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,739
(it's your birthday tomorrow.)

50
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,300
(I prepared a gift for you)

51
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,340
(and wanted
to give it to you in private.)

52
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,410
(What gift?)

53
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,229
(Since it's a gift,)

54
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,109
(I want to maintain)

55
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,090
(some sense of mystery.)

56
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,620
(You'll find out tomorrow.)

57
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,620
There doesn't seem to be

58
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,130
much to see

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,740
in this ancient town.

60
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,090
Yeah.

61
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,229
Well...

62
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,139
Let's sit for a while.

63
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,940
Sure.

64
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,700
Let's sit for a while.

65
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,229
I wonder

66
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,970
how they're doing.

67
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,820
Yes.

68
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,220
I'm thinking

69
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,050
if we should take our time

70
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,869
with the plan of sharing a room

71
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,090
we mentioned earlier.

72
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,380
Is it a bit too much?

73
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,090
It seems so.

74
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,780
Mr. Song might

75
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,220
not be able to accept it.

76
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,850
I can't accept it either.

77
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,499
I meant Mr. Song

78
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,730
definitely can't accept it.

79
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Is it cold?

80
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,220
No.

81
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,469
I told you

82
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,029
to wear extra clothing when going out.

83
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,020
It's so cold outside.

84
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,020
Wear mine first.

85
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,700
No need, it's okay.

86
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,819
Won't you feel cold
if you give it to me?

87
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,340
I'm not cold.

88
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,490
I was a student athlete.

89
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,090
It's really hot today.

90
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,730
Qi Qi.

91
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,059
Song Cong looked happy

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,410
when he came back today.

93
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,220
What did you do?

94
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,349
We didn't do anything.

95
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,820
We just strolled around.

96
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,299
Maybe people become happy

97
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,989
when

98
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,380
they're in an open space.

99
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,650
What about you and Jing Xichi?

100
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,109
You two seemed to be acting weird

101
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,170
since we came back?

102
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,820
Did you argue again?

103
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,820
No.

104
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,780
Haven't we

105
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,410
always been like this?

106
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,410
It's a little strange.

107
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,780
What's strange?

108
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,380
Go to bed.

109
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,379
You're tossing and turning.

110
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,490
Are you making pancakes?

111
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,020
I'm just a bit particular about my bed

112
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,260
and can't sleep.

113
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,020
I haven't even started on you.

114
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,580
Couldn't you book a standard room?

115
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,490
Boss.

116
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,220
I would have booked one if there's any.

117
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,120
You think I want to sleep
in the same bed with you?

118
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,090
Go upstairs and share a room
with Qi Qi then.

119
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,730
I think you want
to share a room with Chen Huan'er.

120
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,549
I haven't started
on you two during the day.

121
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,349
What's with repairing faucets

122
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,610
and shower heads?

123
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,589
Go to bed, okay?

124
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,020
How long-winded and annoying.

125
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,499
What kind of gifts

126
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,179
do you think

127
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,020
need to be given privately?

128
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,499
Qi Qi wants to privately

129
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,589
give you a gift?

130
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,429
No.

131
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,460
No.

132
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,340
I'm just asking.

133
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,170
In my opinion,

134
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,970
what does it mean

135
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,349
when a girl

136
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,669
gives you a gift in private?

137
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,939
It means she's embarrassed

138
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,380
to take it out in public.

139
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,109
Right?

140
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,220
For example,

141
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,850
a hug

142
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,940
or

143
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,490
a kiss.

144
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,619
A kiss?

145
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,780
Go to bed.

146
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,940
It's cold at night. Don't catch a cold.

147
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,600
I've told you everything I need to say.
You can decide for yourself.

148
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,300
Are you okay?

149
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,779
I probably caught a chill

150
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,250
from the night breeze yesterday.

151
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,220
I have a bit of a cold.

152
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,180
I'm alright.

153
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,220
Mr. Song.

154
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,010
I'm really sorry.

155
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,540
Today is your birthday.

156
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,090
I can't go out

157
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,090
and have fun with you.

158
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,220
It's alright.

159
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,309
You don't have

160
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,820
to keep guarding me.

161
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,619
It will put me

162
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,060
under a lot of psychological pressure.

163
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,610
I really don't want

164
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,420
to

165
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,970
ruin your fun because of me.

166
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,460
Really.

167
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,300
Go have fun.

168
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,090
Don't mind me.

169
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,709
Yeah, you should go.

170
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,499
I'll stay here alone

171
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,770
to take care of him.

172
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,340
Hurry.

173
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,010
Well...

174
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,420
Let's go then.

175
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,019
Go.

176
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,060
Go.

177
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,259
Here. Cover up.

178
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,139
We'll get going then.

179
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,060
Sure.

180
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,060
Let's go.

181
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,090
Mr. Song.

182
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,610
Have fun.

183
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,250
Have fun.

184
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,060
Keep an eye on him.

185
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,250
Let's go.

186
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,770
Not bad.

187
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,419
Your acting is good.

188
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,309
Get up.

189
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,700
They're all gone. Hurry.

190
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,949
Get up, Jing Xichi.

191
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,400
- Ms. Warrior.
- What's the matter?

192
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,490
Spare me. I...

193
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,949
I really have a fever.

194
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,010
Stop pretending.

195
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,130
I'm not pretending.

196
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,660
You really have a fever.

197
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,109
Really.

198
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,010
Lie down.

199
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,659
I'm a patient now.

200
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,610
Be a little gentler to me.

201
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,250
Drink some water.

202
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,460
Here.

203
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,730
Drink slowly.

204
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,560
I brought medicine.
I'll get it for you in a moment.

205
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,250
Are you hungry?

206
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,970
Yes.

207
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,770
There's a kitchen here.
Why don't I cook something for you?

208
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,499
You can only eat something light.

209
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,280
Is preserved egg
and lean meat porridge, okay?

210
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,460
I can eat porridge.

211
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,109
Sure.

212
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,139
Wait here.

213
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,130
Huan'er.

214
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,420
Add more preserved eggs for me

215
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,130
and

216
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,850
sprinkle some pepper.

217
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,019
You have so many requests.

218
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,899
Wait here.

219
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,770
Wait here.

220
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,660
Jing Xichi, you...

221
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,730
It's good that your fever reduced.

222
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,659
(If someone you like)

223
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,139
(touches you,)

224
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,709
(will you feel uncomfortable?)

225
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,139
(If you like someone,)

226
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,379
(you'll want to cuddle)

227
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,989
(with him)

228
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,580
(and be with him all the time.)

229
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,460
What are you doing?

230
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,540
What are you doing?

231
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,779
I'm just sitting here.

232
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,469
And you suddenly grabbed my hand.

233
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,019
Are you a pervert?

234
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,250
You took advantage of me.

235
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,250
I had a dream.

236
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,660
I dreamed of politics teacher.

237
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,250
I was begging him not to fail me.

238
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,610
I don't know why either.

239
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,090
Sorry.

240
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,610
Look at you.

241
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,760
You don't behave even while dreaming.

242
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,340
Our politics teacher is a man.

243
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,770
You want to hold his hand?

244
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,610
I was begging him.

245
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,940
Well...

246
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,730
The porridge is ready.

247
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,610
Get up and eat it.

248
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,770
Here.

249
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,220
What are you doing?

250
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,349
Am I not a patient?

251
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,940
I have no energy.

252
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,019
Drink it yourself.

253
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,640
It won't taste good when it's cold. Hurry.

254
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,970
(Has my fondness)

255
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,660
(reached this level?)

256
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,300
(I want to hold her hand
even in my dreams.)

257
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,700
(How dangerous.)

258
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,180
Are you okay?

259
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,890
I'm fine.

260
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,820
There's so much pepper.

261
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,139
What's the matter?

262
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,970
Sit down.

263
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,620
Your gift.

264
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,380
Open it and have a look.

265
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,109
I saw online that the stethoscope
is the 19th century's

266
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,730
greatest medical invention.

267
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,050
I think it suits you.

268
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,700
I believe

269
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,659
you'll become

270
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,250
a brilliant doctor.

271
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,770
Thank you.

272
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,940
I love it.

273
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,380
Try it on.

274
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,139
I was afraid that they would be noisy.

275
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,140
That's why I asked you out alone.

276
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,940
Is it here?

277
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,530
Can you hear me clearly?

278
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,730
Yes.

279
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,490
I want to hear it too.

280
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,269
What you're hearing now

281
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,730
is the mitral valve area.

282
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,700
It's where the heartbeat is strongest.

283
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,770
And...

284
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,050
the second intercostal space

285
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,620
on the left side of the sternum

286
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,180
is the pulmonary valve area.

287
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,380
Further down...

288
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,010
I want to ask you something.

289
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,380
What is it?

290
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,490
Your heart

291
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,380
is beating fast.

292
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,330
Do you

293
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,330
also like me?

294
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,180
Thank you.

295
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,730
Thank you.

296
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,659
Are these enough?

297
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,570
Yes.

298
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,660
- Where shall we sit?
- Here.

299
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,069
Did you bring your gift?

300
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,860
Yes.

301
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,380
Go there.

302
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,269
It's so cold.

303
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,490
Give him a glass.

304
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,509
Are we drinking?

305
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,509
Have a drink.

306
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,349
You can't drink.

307
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,460
You took cefalexin.

308
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,509
I took cefalexin.

309
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,770
It's that serious?

310
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,219
Did you have a fever?

311
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,029
Yes.

312
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,789
How many degrees?

313
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,940
38.5 degrees.

314
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,029
That high?

315
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,730
- It's better now. The fever has subsided.
- His fever has subsided.

316
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,460
Huan'er is so caring.

317
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,140
It's basic.

318
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,100
Mr. Song.

319
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,379
This

320
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,940
is the birthday present
I bought for you.

321
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,100
A small can of coffee
as a small token of my respect.

322
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,459
I heard medical school students
stay up late every day.

323
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,029
You can use it

324
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,269
to refresh yourself at night.

325
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,939
- You gave me coffee to stay up late?
- Yeah.

326
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,570
How stingy.

327
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,829
This coffee is expensive.

328
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,320
- Do you know how much it is?
- How much?

329
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,109
You better not know.

330
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,900
It's expensive.

331
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,029
I'm really curious.

332
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,379
- How much is it?
- How much is it?

333
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,960
- Several hundred.
- Several hundred?

334
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,810
Check out mine.

335
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,940
My human anatomy diagram.

336
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,029
Here. Take it.

337
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,659
You're not stingy? You gave him a book.
It's his birthday. 19th birthday.

338
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,379
It's knowledgeable

339
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,939
and has a great learning atmosphere.

340
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,829
It's his 19th birthday,
yet you gave him a book.

341
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,509
What's wrong?

342
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,530
Are books not okay?

343
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:45,979
No.

344
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,309
- Sea of knowledge.
- Pretty good.

345
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,749
Fine.

346
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,419
You should drink less coffee

347
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,730
and rest more.

348
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,700
This is resting?

349
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,829
It's okay. Thank you both.

350
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,509
Thank you both.

351
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,420
Thank you.

352
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,570
I like it very much.

353
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,789
Qi Qi, what about you?

354
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,490
What gift did you prepare?

355
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,940
Me?

356
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,659
I gave him a stethoscope.

357
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,069
Yes.

358
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,010
Nothing fancy.

359
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,939
It's practical.

360
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,419
- A stethoscope is good.
- Yes.

361
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,349
Stethoscopes

362
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,589
let you listen to the heartbeat.

363
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,789
A stethoscope is good.

364
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,749
All doctors need it.

365
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,570
Yes.

366
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,139
Well...

367
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,029
Let's drink.

368
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,789
- Drink.
- Drink.

369
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,659
- Drink.
- Drink.

370
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,309
Drink up.

371
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,699
- Drink.
- I'll open it for you.

372
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
- Yes.
- Sure.

373
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,549
Did you two

374
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,570
not have fun today?

375
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,530
Why do I feel like you two
are feeling down?

376
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,349
Do we?

377
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,179
No.

378
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,109
We had fun.

379
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,899
We had fun.

380
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,530
What did you two do today?

381
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,029
We...

382
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,069
We...

383
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,860
We went to the mountain behind.

384
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,939
Then...

385
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,100
Well...

386
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,029
Is that all?

387
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,789
The mountain behind is beautiful.
You two should check it out tomorrow.

388
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,900
Did you take photos?

389
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,970
Yes.

390
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,290
It's just that...

391
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,549
I'm going to open this, friends.

392
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,939
- Open it.
- Open it.

393
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,069
Slow down.

394
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,010
Slow down.

395
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,029
Sorry.

396
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,509
I'm nervous.

397
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,860
That's a deceptive move.

398
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,330
Here.

399
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,749
- Drink it.
- Happy birthday.

400
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,660
Give it to me.

401
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:09,970
Thank you.

402
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,770
I'll get you hot water.

403
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,810
Waiter, do you have hot water?

404
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,939
Pour him hot water.

405
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,530
I'll bring the pot.

406
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,100
Here's the glass.

407
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,509
It's okay. Take this.

408
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,220
Okay.

409
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,419
Can I take this?

410
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,180
Sure.

411
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,050
Drink more hot water.

412
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,899
Here.

413
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,509
We wish...

414
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:30,899
We wish

415
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,789
- Mr. Song,
- Mr. Song,

416
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,349
- happy birthday.
- happy birthday.

417
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,490
Thank you.

418
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,459
What? What's wrong?

419
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,589
You poured hot water for him.

420
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,789
I didn't.

421
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,589
No.

422
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,699
Is it that hot?

423
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,659
Try it yourself.

424
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,869
- You're adding more?
- Fine, I'll pour you some more.

425
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,100
Let it cool for a while.

426
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,420
Class is starting.

427
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,899
Mr. Xu is going abroad
for further studies.

428
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,770
I'll teach the last few classes.

429
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,659
My last name is Qiu, not Chou.

430
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,280
Please don't call me by the wrong name.

431
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,180
A brief analysis on the development
of innovative anti-tumor drugs.

432
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,789
The name of this class is a bit long,

433
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,939
but it's nothing compared
to the gene sequence.

434
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,100
If all the base pairs
in adult human cells

435
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,139
are laid out,

436
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,939
it could roughly

437
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,699
circle the Earth

438
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,619
2.68 million times.

439
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,050
This number is huge.

440
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,970
Right?

441
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,269
But I've always believed

442
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,900
that the greatest knowledge...

443
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,730
(A new semester has begun.)

444
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,109
(The tug of war
between Qi Qi and Song Cong)

445
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,570
(continues.)

446
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,380
(But I have a hunch)

447
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,380
(there will be results soon.)

448
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,829
(As for me and Jing Xichi,)

449
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,140
(it's much more mundane.)

450
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,970
(We're all busy with our own affairs.)

451
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,290
Jing Xichi.

452
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,069
It's time to optimize

453
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,290
your website's customer system.

454
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,250
The user experience is so bad.

455
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,379
How did you know I have a website?

456
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,269
How could I not know

457
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,330
your little secret?

458
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,269
Hurry and check it out.

459
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,880
Many people left messages
in the backend, but no one bothered.

460
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,459
I know.

461
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,109
Aren't I

462
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,220
dealing with it now?

463
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,420
How about I help?

464
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,220
This is simple.

465
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,380
Look.

466
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,459
Not bad, you even know about this?

467
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,179
Of course.

468
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,770
My score isn't much lower than yours.

469
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,460
Thanks.

470
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,010
Do you need help?

471
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,109
Yes.

472
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,960
But I have no money.

473
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,029
It doesn't matter.
I don't need you to pay me.

474
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,459
With our relationship,
you just need to be responsible for me

475
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,660
when you make money.

476
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,380
Help!

477
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,080
They all say
that choosing courses is easy,

478
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,600
but the end of the semester
is a disaster.

479
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,139
Looks like our senior is right.

480
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,420
We have to learn something
that's easy to get high scores.

481
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,620
This is all from experience.

482
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,860
Never mind.

483
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,139
I'll go to the library tomorrow

484
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,460
to study hard.

485
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,290
I'm happy with scoring 60 marks.

486
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
No.

487
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,200
Didn't Professor Qiu say

488
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,010
the scores must be calculated
according to the normal distribution?

489
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,970
You need 75 points to pass.

490
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,250
Today,

491
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,899
let's send off

492
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,860
the fairy, Huang Lu, together.

493
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,420
She left everyone a message
before she died.

494
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,419
Humans

495
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,330
should not

496
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,730
learn pharmacy.

497
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,080
You're using a programming language
to create a pre-trained model.

498
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,250
You're quite hardcore.

499
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,749
Hello.

500
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,100
I'm Fu Ying from Year 4.

501
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,699
Hello.

502
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,570
We met before at the orientation.

503
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,699
Are you free now?

504
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,970
Let's go out and have a chat.

505
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,899
Sure.

506
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,770
- I'll wait for you outside then.
- Sure.

507
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,970
Let's go.

508
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,810
Hello, Fu Ying.
Is there something you need from me?

509
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,530
You founded Yangwu Website, right?

510
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,900
Yes.

511
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,290
I'm currently interning at a tech company.

512
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,179
Have you ever thought

513
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,619
about developing Yangwu Website

514
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,100
into a profit-making website?

515
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,140
I can introduce you to our company.

516
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,899
Thank you, Fu Ying.

517
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,699
But

518
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,050
I just did it for fun.

519
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,490
You really don't want to think about it?

520
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,730
I'm actually quite optimistic
about your website.

521
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,600
- I'll think about it.
- How about I give you my number?

522
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,160
Let me know
when you've made up your mind.

523
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,900
Sure.

524
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,619
Let me help you.

525
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,420
Okay.

526
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,700
Alright.

527
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,549
Okay.

528
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,509
I'll wait for your news.

529
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:32,979
Sure.

530
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,770
Well...

531
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,140
- Bye.
- Bye.

532
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,050
Qiu Li.

533
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,570
Something happened.

534
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,979
Something big happened.

535
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,869
What happened?

536
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,179
Jing Xichi kissed

537
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,069
his female senior in the library.

538
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,109
Really?

539
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,069
Really.

540
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,940
Don't believe her nonsense.

541
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,490
Look.

542
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,900
They didn't kiss each other.

543
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,290
They'll kiss each other soon.

544
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,549
I'm telling you.

545
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,810
They were this close.

546
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,010
Really?

547
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,530
Then what?

548
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,330
Then,
he went out with the female senior.

549
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,770
Why do you think

550
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,620
Jing Xichi is so popular
with female seniors?

551
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,490
What do you think he did
with the female senior outside?

552
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,770
Boys.

553
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,810
Look at this good stuff.

554
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,100
What is it?

555
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,940
Real exam papers.

556
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,730
Really?

557
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Yes.

558
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,829
I bought them at a high price
from a senior.

559
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,659
It can't be fake.

560
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,320
It's exactly the same
as the exam questions.

561
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,619
Why would you be so kind

562
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,859
to share it with us?

563
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,000
(Advanced Mathematics Final Exam Paper)
You're a devoted believer.

564
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,290
How could you think that way? Look.

565
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,660
Something's wrong.

566
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,660
What's wrong?

567
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,490
Why are there only questions?

568
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,810
What about the answers?

569
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,899
Here.

570
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,770
Let me see.

571
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,970
What are you doing?

572
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,530
Aren't the answers here?

573
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,010
He's the answer.

574
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,620
What answer?

575
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,660
Take a look.

576
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,700
Jing. Flashlight.

577
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,940
What's this?

578
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,749
Exam questions.

579
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,750
Guaranteed to be authentic.

580
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,180
How is it? Is it difficult?

581
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
It's quite difficult.

582
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,250
Two questions are beyond the syllabus.

583
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,860
Answers.

584
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,570
My only answer.

585
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,100
Solve it for me.

586
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,940
Sure.

587
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,869
But you have to give me a copy
after I solve it for you.

588
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,770
I need it.

589
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,700
Sure.

590
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,309
Alright.

591
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,570
Thank you.

592
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,420
Doomed.

593
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,250
I'm doomed.

594
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,460
How come this book
is all about key points?

595
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,619
Maths.

596
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,379
You eventually became

597
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,290
something I hate.

598
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,619
I thought it was okay

599
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,330
when I was attending the lectures.

600
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,380
Why is it that when solving it,
I know nothing?

601
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,420
Well...

602
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,720
I have a set of exam papers here.

603
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,560
It's said to be
advanced mathematics' real exam paper.

604
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,699
- Do you want to check it out?
- Good job, Top Student.

605
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,570
Why didn't you take
out this good stuff sooner?

606
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,309
- This exam paper looks like the real deal.
- Let me take a look.

607
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,570
A friend gave it to me.

608
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,829
I didn't think it's reliable.

609
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,250
That's why I didn't give it to you.

610
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,979
Just take it as a reference.

611
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,080
Don't believe it completely.

612
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,459
You can only feel secure

613
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,730
by relying on yourself in exams.

614
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,490
Isn't this Jing Xichi's handwriting?

615
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,050
You must have seen it wrong.

616
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,699
No way.

617
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,029
I can recognize his handwriting
even if they turn into ashes.

618
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,349
He always writes this word long.

619
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,379
And this dot.

620
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,349
He's always leaving dots

621
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,109
on the sentences

622
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,420
when he's thinking.

623
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,660
Did Jing Xichi give this to you?

624
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,379
But why did Jing Xichi give it to you

625
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,460
and not to Huan'er?

626
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,220
Could it be...

627
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,970
Could it be that you and Jing Xichi
are having a secret relationship?

628
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,179
No.

629
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,700
You're indeed the oldest here.

630
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,960
Fu Ying and Du Wei?

631
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,029
Turns out they're all covers
for you and Jing Xichi.

632
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,979
No.

633
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,069
Ms. Chen Huan'er.

634
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,549
Do you know

635
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,659
that your roommate

636
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,010
is dating your childhood friend?

637
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,139
I'm not dating Jing Xichi.

638
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,829
That means Jing Xichi is pursuing you.

639
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,659
No.

640
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,620
Tell the truth.

641
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,069
What is it then?

642
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,700
Stop guessing.

643
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,530
It's not Jing Xichi.

644
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,010
It's...

645
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,860
It's

646
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,330
Zhou Ye.

647
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,290
- Zhou Ye?
- Zhou Ye?

648
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,180
Boss.

649
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,810
When did you two get together?

650
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,900
You can tell them.

651
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,810
Just last month.

652
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,770
I wanted to wait until things
were more stable before telling you all.

653
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,490
Don't you like top students?

654
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,699
He

655
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,869
actually

656
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,570
has good grades
during senior middle school.

657
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,770
He just stopped studying so much

658
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,050
after starting university.

659
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,549
Looks like
when it comes to the person you like,

660
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,220
all standards become unimportant.

661
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,379
Enough.

662
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,660
Stop speaking.

663
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,620
Here, Huixin.

664
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,810
It's okay, Huixin.

665
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,620
If you really like top students,

666
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,730
I'll pick up my studies again.

667
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,099
It's not like I can't learn.

668
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,869
Right?

669
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,579
How sweet.

670
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,290
Boss, shouldn't you encourage him?

671
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,099
Enough.

672
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,770
They're making me feel embarrassed.

673
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,730
By the way, this is for you.

674
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,979
Look at Boss.

675
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,899
Jeez.

676
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,419
How insincere.

677
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,459
You only remembered me

678
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,850
after Zhou Ye gave it away.

679
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,539
What's

680
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,539
their relationship?

681
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,330
- How is it the same as ours?
- The two of us...

682
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,349
Don't be ungrateful.

683
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,140
- Give it to me if you don't it.
- I want it.

684
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,379
Boss told me yesterday

685
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,850
that you wrote it overnight.

686
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,370
Thank you.

687
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,789
I was worried
that you won't do well in the exam

688
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,100
and won't enjoy your new year.

689
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,059
But

690
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,309
I think this exam paper

691
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,450
isn't that reliable.

692
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,060
Just use it as a reference.

693
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,980
You still have to study hard
on your own.

694
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,379
I've been reduced to the point

695
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,140
where you remind me to study hard.

696
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,250
What are you laughing at?

697
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,700
(Your heart)

698
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,770
(is beating fast.)

699
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,810
(Do you)

700
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,890
(also like me?)

701
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,620
(Are you free tomorrow?)

702
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,980
(Can we meet?)

703
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,580
Well...

704
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,330
It's getting late today.

705
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:33,730
I got to go back.

706
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,290
Qi Qi.

707
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:46,980
I already have the answer to the question
you asked me the other day.

708
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,940
After coming back from the ancient town,
I considered it for a long time.

709
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,930
I think the heartbeat is real.

710
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,330
Qi Qi.

711
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,980

Hello, Qi Qi?

727
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,220
What's up?

728
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,180
Huan'er.

729
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,709
I want to tell you something.

730
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,700
Go ahead.

731
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:21,250
Song Cong and I are a couple now.

732
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,500
What?

733
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,890
No.

734
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,419
How did you get together?

735
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,499
How did it happen?

736
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,730
Who confessed?

737
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,349
How should I put it?

738
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,269
Just tell me the key points.

739
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,700
Qi Qi.

740
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,459
Do you remember the last time
I asked Song Cong

741
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,899
to go to the mountains alone?

742
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,450
I gave him a stethoscope.

743
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,060
I kissed him.

744
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,499
I knew something happened

745
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,629
between you two that night.

746
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,240
I asked you, but you won't tell me.

747
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,330
It wasn't that day.

748
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,730
It was after we got back

749
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,580
that Song Cong confessed to me.

750
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,250
Anyway,

751
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,890
I feel elated,

752
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,100
but it feels surreal.

753
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,189
I can't explain

754
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,450
how it feels.

755
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,829
I understand.

756
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,419
All that matters is that you're happy.

757
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,789
Do you know

758
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,579
that I can smell the stench of your love

759
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,140
even through the screen?

760
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,979
I'm telling you.

761
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,019
Liao Xinyan's dating guide

762
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,059
really works.

763
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,229
I got him

764
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,660
in just one month.

765
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,539
No way.

766
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,459
You used

767
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,000
Liao Xinyan's dating guide?

768
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,349
I have something else to do,
so I'll stop talking. Bye.

769
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,410
No, Qi.

770
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,660
Hello?

771
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,250
Let me tell you a shocking gossip.

772
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,730
Go ahead.

773
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,580
Song Cong and Qi Qi are a couple now.

774
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,629
They're a couple now?

775
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,669
Do you remember the night
we were in the mountains?

776
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,700
The two of them...

777
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,789
That night,

778
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,810
the two of them...

779
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,899
did that thing.

780
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,020
What is it?

781
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,180
You know what it is.

782
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,810
Scumbag.

783
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,020
I got it.

784
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,980
He didn't even let me finish.

785
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,370
Hello?

786
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,620
Scumbag.

787
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,189
- How can you be one step ahead of me?
- What are you talking about?

788
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,939
No, weren't you lying next to me that night?

789
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,180
When did you go out?

790
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,789
I didn't go out.

791
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,149
You still won't admit it.

792
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,770
You're really a scumbag.

793
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,229
I'm telling you.

794
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,579
As your buddy, since you two
have already done it, you must treat her well.

795
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,620
You know that?

796
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,059
I'm hanging up.

797
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,930
Scumbag.

798
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:04,099
(Exam Paper Seal)

799
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,490
(Subject: Advanced Mathematics)

800
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,709
Don't be so cocky.

801
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,410
Extreme joy may lead to sorrow.

802
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,810
That can't happen.

803
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,869
I'm telling you.

804
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,810
I've engraved
that exam paper in my mind.

805
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,149
Don't you have any doubt

806
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,850
about its authenticity?

807
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,220
No, think about it.

808
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,309
If he sold it to me for 50 yuan,
I'll doubt it, right?

809
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,330
But he sold it to me for 500 yuan.
If it was fake, would he sell it for 500 yuan?

810
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,580
Okay, get ready for the exam.

811
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,290
Pass the exam papers
to the students at the back.

812
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,140
Why is it completely different?

813
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,250
That fraud.

814
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,540
I must say.

815
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,539
The exam paper Zhou Ye gave

816
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,980
is amazing.

817
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,019
Not only
is it irrelevant to the real exam,

818
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,019
but it also avoids

819
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,829
all the exam points.

820
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,540
I can't even apply the formula.

821
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,419
Fortunately, the questions aren't difficult.
You got all the basic points.

822
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,100
You won't fail, right?

823
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,450
It's my fault.

824
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,229
I shouldn't have listened to Zhou Ye

825
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,660
and given you the exam paper.

826
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,540
What does it have to do with you?

827
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,459
Never apologize

828
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,250
for a man's mistake.

829
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,770
That's right.

830
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,309
Aren't you

831
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,930
also afraid that we'll fail?

832
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,250
If you really want to apologize,

833
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,669
help us study

834
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,540
when we take the make-up exam.

835
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,660
Boss.

836
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,269
No problem.

837
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,459
Let's go. I'll buy you a meal.

838
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,349
Thank you, Li.

839
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,290
What do you want to eat?

840
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,810
