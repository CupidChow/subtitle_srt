(Pain of Youth Is Not Just Literature)

16
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,860
It's okay, sit down.

17
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,630
Regarding Xichi,

18
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,580
I'm not sure whether I should be frank.

19
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,140
But I reckon you already know.

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,860
Go ahead. He's already in this state.

21
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,990
Honestly, he's very talented.

22
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,070
He's also hardworking,

23
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,140
a great talent for professional soccer.

24
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,830
But the boy...

25
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,160
His ambitions are sky-high.

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,700
I worry that if I praise him too much,

27
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,230
he'll lose himself completely.

28
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,270
So,

29
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,110
I've never directly praised him.

30
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,990
Thinking about it now,

31
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,270
I should've

32
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,550
communicated with him more.

33
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,790
And I only just found out today

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,890
that you didn't approve
of him playing soccer.

35
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,510
Coach,

36
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,900
please don't say that.

37
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,790
Think about it.

38
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,230
If he can't even protect his legs,

39
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,670
how can he play soccer?

40
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,830
To be honest,

41
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,740
his injury is so serious

42
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,350
because he was
too desperate to prove himself

43
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,380
in this competition.

44
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,860
And our school's team

45
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,950
doesn't have

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,500
a proper professional training system.

47
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,830
So, he had to train on his own.

48
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,900
Without professional guidance,

49
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,740
he used the wrong methods.

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,580
That's why his old injuries didn't heal,

51
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,750
and he ended up with new ones.

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,100
Through this selection tournament,

53
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,620
several teams have already

54
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,180
shown interest in growing his talent.

55
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,070
So

56
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,270
if he only plays

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,140
on our school team,

58
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,990
it's really a waste of his talent.

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,420
I just hope you'd reconsider

60
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,140
about him going pro.

61
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,270
Eight...

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,110
Why are you here?

63
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,580
You're awake?

64
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,790
I came to check on you.

65
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,460
How are you feeling? Does it hurt?

66
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,820
Chen Huan'er...

67
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,110
I'll call the doctor.

68
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,030
No, no, no! No need.

69
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,940
Painkillers...

70
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,380
This one, right?

71
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,300
How many?

72
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,110
One.

73
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,030
Can you be more careful?

74
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,060
Sorry, sorry!

75
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,910
Really sorry, bro.

76
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,260
Here.

77
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,260
Does it hurt that bad?

78
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Of course!

79
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,030
The doctor said you need to rest

80
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,260
and shouldn't move around.

81
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,030
What's that?

82
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,550
It's not bone broth, is it?

83
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,240
Aunt Hao just brought some over at noon.

84
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,060
I've been drinking it like water
these days.

85
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,590
Then I'll just leave it here.

86
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,470
No, no.

87
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,260
I'll drink it.

88
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,990
I rather finish it quickly
and get better sooner.

89
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,300
You know what?

90
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,470
Last night, I dreamed

91
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,860
I was playing soccer.

92
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,620
I played so well.

93
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,910
Look at you showing off.

94
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,300
Thanks.

95
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,790
Why were you so careless?

96
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,470
Maybe because

97
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,960
I wanted to win too badly this time.

98
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,180
I've had enough.

99
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,670
This medicine makes me drowsy.

100
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,820
Then go on and sleep.

101
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,990
I'll leave when Aunt Lin gets here.

102
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,060
(This was the first time
I had ever seen Xichi)

103
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,860
(so down and defeated.)

104
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,180
(He's always bright, optimistic,
and full of energy.)

105
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,940
(Always the one encouraging
and uplifting us.)

106
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,670
(But at this moment I realized)

107
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,180
(that in fact,)

108
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,590
(he had just been silently)

109
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,590
(digesting all his negative emotions)

110
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,300
(on his own.)

111
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,300
Who is it?

112
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,260
Lina, how come you're here?

113
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,620
Yifan, I came to see you!

114
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,110
You came as well, Huan'er.

115
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,990
Um... can I use the restroom?

116
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,940
Over here, this way.

117
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,300
Go ahead.

118
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,620
Go on.

119
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,470
We especially went to that old shop

120
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,080
where you used to love getting pastries

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,100
and bought some for you.

122
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,960
Try them, and see if they
still taste the same.

123
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,710
Thank you.

124
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,600
If I hadn't come,
you wouldn't have come either.

125
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,380
- You followed the scent, huh?
- That's right.

126
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,740
If you're here, how could I not be?

127
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,180
Have some tea.

128
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,860
Thanks.

129
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,710
You two

130
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,940
have been working
and still made time to visit me.

131
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,670
It must be exhausting.
I really appreciate it.

132
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,550
What are you saying?

133
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,620
Why are you thanking us?

134
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,380
Are you going
to act all formal with us?

135
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,710
Song Hang said it.

136
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,150
Xichi is young

137
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,620
and has great physical fitness.

138
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,470
As long as he does proper rehab,

139
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,710
he'll fully recover

140
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,740
with no problem.

141
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,420
Exactly.

142
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,180
But Yifan,

143
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,300
why do you look

144
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,110
so worn out lately?

145
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,550
Why are you tearing up

146
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,820
as we talk?

147
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,550
Yeah.

148
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,620
Is it because it's exhausting
running back and forth

149
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,920
between the clinic and the ward?

150
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,710
You need to rest.

151
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,030
Just tell us if there's anything.

152
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,280
No need to be polite with us.

153
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
I'm fine, really.

154
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,260
I know my own limits.

155
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,520
But these past few days,

156
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,180
I have been a little worried.

157
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,620
I need you guys' advice.

158
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,380
Do you think

159
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,180
I should let him
take a year off from school?

160
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,380
Give him some time to adjust?

161
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,230
That could work.

162
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,860
Aunt Lin,

163
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,110
Jing Xichi can do it.

164
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,470
Don't worry.

165
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,590
If needed,

166
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,150
I...

167
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,110
I, along with Song Cong can tutor him.

168
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,670
He'll catch up for sure.

169
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,590
Yes.

170
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,940
I'll tell Song Cong

171
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,910
that once school is out,

172
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,240
he should come over to tutor him.

173
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,740
No problem.

174
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,260
Yes, that should work.

175
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,710
Thank you, Huan'er.

176
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,700
It's nothing, really.

177
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,470
I'm really jealous of you two.

178
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,940
Your kids are so well-behaved.

179
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,590
Unlike my little troublemaker at home.

180
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,380
Oh, come on.

181
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,990
Here, try this pastry.

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
See if it still tastes the same.

183
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,260
Thanks, I got it.

184
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,860
I'll just have one.

185
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,660
Take a guess!

186
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,110
Guess what we brought you?

187
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,540
What is it?

188
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,470
I was just celebrating the fact

189
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,300
that being hospitalized
means no homework...

190
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,940
But you guys...

191
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,380
You wish!

192
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,140
Starting today,

193
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,260
we're tutoring you every day.

194
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,380
My head hurts...
I think I need to sleep.

195
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,710
In this chapter, we're exploring

196
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,520
the periodicity of the cosine function.

197
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,540
Got it?

198
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,700
What did your brain absorb?

199
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,440
I'm begging you...

200
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,020
Pay attention.

201
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,720
Alright, Song.
Explain it to him again.

202
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm done.

203
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,620
I'm done!

204
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,260
Who's next? Who's next?

205
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm not studying anymore!

206
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,140
No more!

207
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,470
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

208
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,900
Time to study, study, study!

209
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,190
Before, he often struggled

210
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,780
to understand the confusing
world he lived in.

211
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,950
Song...

212
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,230
I'm fine, thank you.

213
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,140
And you?

214
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,140
Song Cong. And you, Song Cong?

215
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,310
Pay attention.

216
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,590
Today, we're using chemicals...

217
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,980
♪Saying too much, no 'what ifs'♪

218
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,940
♪Might as well take the risk♪

219
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,780
I give up.

220
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,740
No more!

221
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,250
You will study.

222
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,310
I won't listen to anyone.

223
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,430
I don't care who it is.
I'm not going to study.

224
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,260
Take away his phone.

225
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,660
Fine, I'll study.

226
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,660
Don't take my phone.

227
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,070
Wake up!

228
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,470
My dear child, Jing Xichi!

229
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,190
Wake up!

230
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,990
Let your brain absorb
all the knowledge.

231
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,260
Look closely.

232
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,110
The periodicity of the cosine function

233
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,020
will yield...

234
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,540
Wrong! A is the answer.

235
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,470
What's your answer?

236
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:12,950
Have a fruit.

237
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,380
No!

238
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,830
Have a bite.

239
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,230
No.

240
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,350
Hurry up.

241
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,020
Are you going to eat?

242
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,660
Are you going to eat or not? Eat it...

243
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,580
(Sports)

244
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,020
The weather is so nice.

245
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,060
The sun is shining bright
on the day Jing Xichi is discharged.

246
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,860
My mom was just talking
about the good weather.

247
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,740
She said she wanted to find
a time to go to Sishui together.

248
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,160
The wintersweet flowers there
should be blooming.

249
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,500
I almost forgot!

250
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:06,990
Yeah.

251
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,070
Once Xichi recovers,

252
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,360
let's go see them together.

253
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,350
Sounds good! Let's go quickly, then.

254
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,100
Jing Xichi is probably
getting impatient.

255
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,740
Finally! You can go home!

256
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,960
We won't have to come
to the hospital every day.

257
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,060
Here, let me take that.

258
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,660
Where's Song?

259
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,230
He said he wanted to learn more
about your condition.

260
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,020
Let's go.

261
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:36,710
Wait.

262
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,070
What's this?

263
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,860
For you.

264
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,620
(Finals Entry Ticket)

265
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,500
Where did you

266
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,640
get this match ticket?

267
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,780
It's a secret.

268
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,350
Come on, let's go.

269
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,310
Come on.

270
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,230
Thanks.

271
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,430
No need to thank me.

272
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,020
Take it slow.

273
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
Don't put too much pressure
on your foot.

274
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,230
Dad, Mom.

275
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,900
So um...

276
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,110
This Sunday

277
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,540
is the league finals.

278
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,830
I have an extra ticket.

279
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,500
Is either of you free

280
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,710
to go with me?

281
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,380
It's your dad's day off.

282
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,350
You go with him.

283
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,660
Look after your son.

284
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,660
Don't worry about that.

285
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,900
I'll help you to your room.

286
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,600
It's okay, Dad.

287
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,590
I can manage.

288
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,950
Be gentle with that leg.

289
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:25,060
(Soccer Weekly)

290
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,230
Yes, that's it! Keep at it!

291
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,500
Engage your hamstring. Go.

292
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,380
You can do it.

293
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,500
Slowly lower down.

294
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,350
That's good.

295
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
Go back and rest more.

296
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,780
Pay attention to your dosage.

297
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,900
Ease up on the painkillers.

298
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,830
Thank you.

299
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,800
Let's go, Zhang.

300
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,260
Are you tired?

301
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,190
Have some weather.

302
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,470
Here.

303
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,950
Why are you here?

304
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,430
I came to see you.

305
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,950
Are you tired?

306
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,500
Here.

307
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,540
Thanks.

308
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,470
Is it going well?

309
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,070
Not too bad.

310
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,860
It's just that...

311
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,020
I think I oversimplified the matter.

312
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,780
I've actually thought it through.

313
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,590
Many great soccer players

314
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,190
have been injured before.

315
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,740
This injury of mine
is nothing in comparison.

316
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,260
But, Huan'er...

317
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:36,990
I...

318
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,900
I feel like my body

319
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,780
is not listening to me.

320
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,310
Perhaps...

321
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,140
God is giving me a warning.

322
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,590
I should have quit earlier.

323
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,830
That way, I would have caused

324
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,950
my parents less worry.

325
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,590
I've been thinking a lot lately.

326
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,430
You know, they both have

327
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,950
their own jobs and careers.

328
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,020
I can't just let them

329
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,620
keep living in constant worry

330
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,310
because of me,

331
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,260
right?

332
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,990
This is just the beginning, isn't it?

333
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,020
You have to be patient

334
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,070
with your body.

335
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,310
Listen to me.

336
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,110
You will definitely get better.

337
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,380
Once you're well,
we'll go to school together.

338
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,500
You have no idea.

339
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,220
When Song Cong and I
go to school together,

340
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,350
he actually...

341
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,950
He what?

342
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,590
He went and discussed Math problems

343
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,430
with me

344
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:53,990
in school.

345
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,900
You've got to save me.

346
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,900
Song is driving me crazy.

347
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,500
You need to save me.

348
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,910
Chen Huan'er.

349
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,820
Don't come to see me anymore.

350
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,670
You don't want us to visit you, huh?

351
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,390
It's not that.

352
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,580
Look, all I do every day

353
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,300
is rehabilitation.

354
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,060
There's nothing else going on.

355
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,200
I don't want to delay your studies.

356
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,300
That won't happen.

357
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,020
Fine, then I'll tell Song
not to come.

358
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,190
I mean,

359
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,260
you shouldn't come either.

360
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,150
I'll help you.

361
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,100
Here.

362
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,260
Here.

363
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,870
Come on, go slow.

364
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,060
Here.

365
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,900
I've got you.

366
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,390
I'm fine.

367
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,230
I can do it.

368
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,670
It's fine. I can manage.

369
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,060
(The intense pain
and the doctor's words)

370
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,910
(made Jing Xichi fully realize)

371
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,820
(the reality he is facing.)

372
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,260
(He didn't want us to go)

373
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,190
(not because he's worried
about affecting our studies,)

374
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
(but because he doesn't want us to see)

375
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,470
(his fearful state.)

376
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,470
Oh my God.

377
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,260
This is a huge challenge.

378
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,190
(To be honest, these names...)

379
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,060
(I can't even tell
who's right or wrong.)

380
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,740
(Absolutely no clue.)

381
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,580
(But I will definitely find)

382
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,740
(enough evidence to prove to him)

383
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,580
(that the road ahead is still long.)

384
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,820
(Everything can start over.)

385
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,910
(There's still time for everything.)

386
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,540
Let me help you.

387
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,020
No, it's fine. No need.

388
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,580
I'm good.

389
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,470
I can do it myself.

390
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,710
Where's Song?

391
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,150
The teacher called him away.

392
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
What, you want Song to help you?

393
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,060
No, I was just thinking...

394
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,340
His big brother is back in school now.

395
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,200
Shouldn't he personally come to greet me?

396
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,920
(Tianhe No.1 Middle School welcomes you!)

397
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,430
I'm fine. I can do it.

398
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,710
It's okay. Let me help.

399
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,820
No need, really.

400
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,630
If you don't want to go back to class,

401
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,230
I can stay here with you for a bit.

402
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,820
I used to do pull-ups on the goalpost,

403
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,870
and the coach would tell me off.

404
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,630
He said it wasn't solid.

405
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,260
Jing Xichi.

406
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,150
How old are you this year?

407
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,580
Did you fry your brain?

408
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,390
I'm only a few months older than you.

409
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,020
You're 17 years old, right?

410
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,230
Obviously.

411
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,100
Do you know Baggio?

412
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,670
When he was 17,

413
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,880
Baggio suffered a ligament tear
on his right knee.

414
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,150
He had 220 stitches.

415
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,100
In total, he underwent six surgeries.

416
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,190
Finally, at the age of 28,

417
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,190
he made his Champions League debut.

418
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,190
In 1998, Piero

419
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,670
also suffered a ligament tear.

420
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,390
In 2006,

421
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,230
he scored a hat-trick during

422
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,100
the second half

423
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,260
of Italy's quarter-finals.

424
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,580
In 1999,

425
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,710
Ronaldo suffered

426
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,910
a complete rupture of cruciate ligament.

427
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,190
When everyone thought he would retire,

428
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,020
he returned in the 2001-2002 season

429
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,990
with an improved form.

430
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,300
In 2006,

431
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,540
Irving tore his ligament.

432
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,910
In 2008,

433
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,340
he became the captain of Newscal.

434
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,470
Newcastle.

435
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,300
Captain of Newcastle.

436
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,430
He scored 11 goals in that season.

437
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,190
Chen Huan'er.

438
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,150
In 1999, the UEFA Cup.

439
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,840
At Celtic Park...

440
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,400
Chen Huan'er.

441
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,020
Larsson

442
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,500
suffered a double leg fracture.

443
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,520
- In the following season, he made it...
- Huan'er.

444
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,540
Thank you.

445
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,990
(Actually, I'm a very forgetful person.)

446
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,580
(I stay optimistic
by leaving the past behind.)

447
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,400
(But no matter how much
time has passed,)

448
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,780
(I will always remember this morning.)

449
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,230
(This ever-refreshing morning)

450
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,390
(made me believe)

451
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,710
(that only when we lose
the courage to start over)

452
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,020
(does youth)

453
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,470
(truly come to an end.)

454
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,580
Are you going back?

455
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,190
Let me see that cheat sheet you wrote.

456
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,230
Jing Xichi! Give it back!

457
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,670
Why did you write so much?

458
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,870
Xichi,

459
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,630
when your leg heals,

460
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,020
do you still want to play soccer?

461
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,710
Dad,

462
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,340
you know what?

463
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,780
I don't really remember clearly

464
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,990
how I started

465
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,470
playing soccer in the first place.

466
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,580
It feels like,

467
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,340
ever since I could remember,

468
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,740
I've already loved playing.

469
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,340
Mom always told me

470
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,190
that it was also the dream you never

471
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,760
got to fulfill when you were young.

472
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,780
As a kid, I didn't really understand.

473
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,870
You told me to train,

474
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,740
so I just followed along.

475
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,540
Your mom just cares too much about you.

476
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,190
She's afraid you'd get hurt.

477
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,470
She said every time
she watched you play,

478
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,150
her heart was constantly in her throat.

479
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,910
Mom has watched me play?

480
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,390
Alright.

481
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,390
No matter what,

482
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,500
remember our promise.

483
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,910
No matter what happens,

484
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,540
stick it out until the end.

485
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,150
Let's go home,

486
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,340
okay?

487
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,260
Come on.

488
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,540
Take it slow.

489
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,580
Don't put too much pressure
on that foot.

490
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,260
I'm fine, Dad.

491
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,710
You okay?

492
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,300
Yeah.

493
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:28,740
Mom.

494
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,150
I just got off work,
and happened to pass by here,

495
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,390
so I'll go home with you.

496
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,020
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

497
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,580
Listen to yourself.

498
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,580
It's not like Xichi is playing.

499
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,190
What's there to watch?

500
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,390
Yesterday, your school coach called.

501
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,670
He said the youth team coach

502
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,470
asked about you

503
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
and wanted to visit.

504
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,130
They think you have a lot of potential.

505
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,230
I thanked them

506
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,540
and told them not to come.

507
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,540
You need to fully recover first.

508
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,020
Once you're better,

509
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,190
I'll personally take you

510
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,260
to visit them.

511
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,740
Mom.

512
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,340
Thank you.

513
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,190
I've thought it through too.

514
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,580
I'm letting go.

515
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,630
From now on,
you'll make your own decisions.

516
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,540
I used to meddle too much,
worrying and running around for nothing,

517
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,820
and it didn't necessarily help.

518
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,540
Mom.

519
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,340
I was never mad

520
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,150
at you.

521
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,630
I knew in my heart.

522
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,060
If you weren't the one

523
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,740
playing the serious role in this family,

524
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,390
with Dad and I being so overly dramatic,

525
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,140
we'd turn the house
upside down sooner or later.

526
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,190
Alright, now.

527
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,100
Let's go home.

528
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,780
We don't want to make your mom cry.

529
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:39,820
Slowly.

530
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,340
Be careful.

531
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,100
Okay.

532
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,390
Did you hear what I said?

533
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,320
Your dad is away on a business trip

534
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,630
so I'll take you to school
for these few days.

535
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,470
You don't have to.

536
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,580
Why? How will you get there then?

537
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,320
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

538
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,900
(Modern Sports)

539
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,620
(Finals Entry Ticket)

540
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,470
Mom.

541
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,740
Mom.

542
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,950
Explain this to me?

543
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,230
Actually, I did have a meeting that day.

544
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,950
I planned to tell you guys
and go together,

545
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,820
but I was afraid I wouldn't make it
and didn't want to disappoint you.

546
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,040
So, as soon as the meeting ended,
I rushed over.

547
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,990
But it was already over.

548
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,430
Then where did you get this ticket?

549
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,520
Huan'er gave it to me.

550
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,580
Thanks, Mom.

551
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,260
Wait!

552
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,240
Let me keep it as a souvenir.

553
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,870
Give it to me.

554
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,840
If I had known,
I would've asked her to come along.

555
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,580
What did you say?

556
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,820
Nothing.

557
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,340
From now on, after school,
I'll be walking home

558
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,480
with Huan'er and Song. Rest assured.

559
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,190
Slowly.

560
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,100
I'm okay.

561
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,780
My leg is fine.

562
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,390
Gosh, this kid...

563
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,340
(Finals Entry Ticket)

564
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,220
(Baggio tore the ligament
in his right knee when he was 17...)

565
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,580
(Little Bro)

566
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,660
(Calling)

567
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,230
Hello, what's up?

568
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,390
Chen Huan'er.

569
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,300
Some tricks you've got there.

570
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,780
Leniency for confession,

571
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,000
resisting authoritarianism.

572
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,670
Tell me.

573
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,300
Where did you get so many tickets from?

574
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,100
I got them from Coach Li.

575
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,390
Pay attention to your steps!

576
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,540
Faster, faster!

577
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,190
What are you doing?

578
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,780
Watch your step!

579
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,580
Hello, sir.

580
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,580
The tickets for Sunday's finals.

581
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,020
Can I have one?

582
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,990
Sure. Help yourself.

583
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,470
Next. Hurry up!

584
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,150
Thanks.

585
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,540
I'm taking three.

586
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,910
Hey, are you listening?

587
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,460
Did you not eat breakfast this morning?

588
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,150
It was that easy?

589
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,260
What did you think?

590
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,820
Did you think I had to beg on my knees

591
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,990
just to get the tickets?

592
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,780
Okay.

593
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,190
Never mind, just asking.

594
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,580
That's all. Bye.

595
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,340
Take it slow. Be careful.

596
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,060
I'm fine, Mom.

597
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,260
I'm almost fully recovered.

598
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,670
Good morning, Aunt Lin.

599
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,060
Morning, Huan'er.

600
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,300
Jing Xichi, I'll take you today.

601
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,950
Didn't Song say he'd take me?

602
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,120
The teacher asked him
to go for a competition.

603
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,060
Why don't I call a cab for you guys?

604
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,820
It's okay. We can get there on the bike.

605
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,220
You're going to be late for work.

606
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,190
Don't worry about us.

607
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,400
Okay, I'm going to be late.

608
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,340
I'll leave him to you.

609
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,240
You guys figure it out.

610
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,820
I'll handle it.

611
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,320
Thank you.

612
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,060
Got it.

613
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,140
Call a cab if you need to.

614
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,900
Don't worry.

615
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,670
Come on, get on.

616
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,710
You added a cushion for me?

617
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,540
That's right.

618
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,500
Aren't I considerate?

619
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,920
Don't want your butt to bruise.

620
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,780
Come on then.

621
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,580
Are you sure you can do it?

622
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,710
Why not?

623
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,100
Just get on and see.

624
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,390
Give me your bag then.

625
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,300
No biggie. I can still ride
with the bag.

626
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,390
I'm going to get on.

627
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:29,820
Go on.

628
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:31,990
Here, take a seat.

629
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,430
Sit tight.

630
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,060
Here I go.

631
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,740
Hang on.

632
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,580
Okay, go ahead.

633
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,540
I'm going to go fast.

634
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,780
Not too fast, please.

635
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,260
My leg just healed.

636
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,580
Are you tired?

637
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,060
No.

638
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,390
This is nothing.

639
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,340
Chen Huan'er.

640
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,060
Even though you added
such an ugly backseat

641
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,780
to my beloved bike,

642
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,670
I'm actually pretty touched.

643
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,780
But at this speed,

644
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,390
when are we ever going to get to school?

645
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,950
Well, you could take a taxi.

646
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,910
No.

647
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,630
I'm a disabled man.

648
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,820
Even if I'm late,

649
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,060
I have a legitimate excuse.

650
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,820
But I don't, bro.

651
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,740
Exactly.

652
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,150
So you better hurry up and push,

653
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,640
or you're going to get punished.

654
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,100
Don't just stand there.

655
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:21,710
Push!

656
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,260
I...

657
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,910
Let's go! Hurry up!

658
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,120
Ugh, you're so annoying.

659
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,230
Careful! Don't make me fall.

660
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:26,780
Faster.

661
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,780
(That morning on the way to school,)

662
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,480
(I don't even know how long it took.)

663
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,260
(And even though he says
everything's back to normal,)

664
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,190
(I could tell.)

665
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,470
(His recovery)

666
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,500
(is dragging out
much longer than any before.)

667
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,470
(But Jing Xichi would never)

668
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,870
(say something cheesy like,)

669
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,580
("Pain is what makes youth real.")

670
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,350
(He'd just scoff,)

671
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,270
(call it dramatic,)

672
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,790
(and get right back to it.)

673
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,310
Look here, Jing Xichi.

674
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:56,180
Look here.

675
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,220
What?

676
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,220
Mountain pose. My dad taught me.

677
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,580
Stop kicking.

678
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,270
Your leg has only just healed.

679
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,350
You have no idea

680
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,060
how many rounds

681
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,430
my heart's been flying on the field.

682
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,990
Anyway, the physical therapist said

683
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,220
that I'm recovering well.

684
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,990
He said I could try out for the upcoming
special training recruitment.

685
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,350
You have no clue

686
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,580
how much I miss the smell

687
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,620
of the lawn.

688
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,790
Lawn?

689
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,870
You miss the smell of grass?

690
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,990
Okay.

691
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,540
I'll satisfy your wish.

692
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,660
You miss grass, right?

693
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,620
Here, have a whiff.

694
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,310
I know you know the smell of grass.

695
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,430
It's prickling my face!

696
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,320
Doesn't it smell good?

697
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:36,870
Chen Huan'er!

698
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,750
Don't you like it?

699
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,580
I don't like this.

700
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,860
I want a lawn, not just grass!

701
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,500
Why get me this?

702
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,310
It's nice!

703
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:41,980
You like it, huh?

704
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,000
I'll end up with allergies.

705
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,600
You like it.

706
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,320
I don't want this.

707
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,270
I know you like it.

708
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,660
Hello?

709
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:10,990
Hi.

710
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,910
The orthopedic book

711
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,350
you asked for last time has arrived.

712
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,950
You can pick it up when you're free.

713
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:16,990
Thanks.

714
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,430
I'll come get it tomorrow.

715
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,100
You're here.

716
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,750
Hey,

717
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,220
the book I ordered...

718
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,390
Here.

719
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,750
Thanks. It's 150, right?

720
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,430
180.

721
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,180
Wasn't it 150?

722
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,990
This book is out of print.

723
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,240
I had to check with
multiple publishers to find it,

724
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,100
so there's a markup.

725
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,800
Then why didn't you
mention that over the phone?

726
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,860
Do you want it or not?

727
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,790
I didn't bring enough money.

728
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,140
Can I pay you the rest next time?

729
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,830
I'll cover it.

730
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,540
This, too.

731
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,540
Just pay me back later.

732
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,700
Thanks.

733
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,340
You're here to buy books too?

734
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,620
Math in our second year
has gotten a lot harder,

735
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,830
so I bought two extra
exercise books to practice.

736
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,350
I heard that after
you transferred to the art class,

737
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,880
you've been studying really hard.

738
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,470
If you ever

739
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,540
need help with anything...

740
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,140
Song Cong,

741
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,790
is studying

742
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,430
the only thing in your life?

743
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,430
I just wanted to thank you
for helping me earlier.

744
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,790
I know. You don't want
to owe me a favor, right?

745
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,350
Every time before I go to tutoring,

746
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,180
I would come here for a bit.

747
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,640
Actually, back when
I was taking TOEFL classes,

748
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,240
I used to skip them and come here too.

749
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,580
You? Skipping class?

750
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,870
Why wouldn't I?

751
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,830
Everyone thinks I'm too perfect.

752
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,620
Even Xichi and Huan'er do.

753
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,700
What's up with you three?

754
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,310
Nothing.

755
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,830
Everything's fine.

756
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,020
Honestly,

757
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,320
I think there's still
some misunderstanding

758
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,060
between you guys.

759
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,180
Last time, I said some things

760
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,020
that were a bit too much.

761
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,020
I thought about it afterward.

762
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,990
I realized it was just me
being too stubborn.

763
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,020
My family's housekeeper told me before.

764
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,100
My problem is that I never say anything.

765
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,470
I get it.

766
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,140
Maybe if I just talked about it,
everything would be fine.

767
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,180
But I just can't get the words out.

768
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,870
Actually, I'm the same way.

769
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,790
Do you remember when you asked me

770
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,310
why I thought your essays were good?

771
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,020
It's because

772
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:08,060
you always manage to express things

773
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,270
that I don't know how to put into words.

774
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,990
Then do you know why

775
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,950
I just told you

776
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,320
all those things from my heart?

777
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,060
Why?

778
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,540
Because I like you.

779
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,500
What did you say?

780
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,180
I said...

781
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
I will become someone as amazing as you.

782
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,060
Huan'er.

783
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,660
Aunt Lin.

784
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,270
Here,

785
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,350
have some water. It's hot, isn't it?

786
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,270
Not too bad.

787
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,100
There are quite a lot of people today.

788
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,540
By the way, isn't Uncle Jing coming?

789
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,020
He's on duty today.

790
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,220
He'll come over
as soon as his shift ends.

791
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,750
Coach Li is over there.

792
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,020
I'll go ask him

793
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,310
about today's recruitment.

794
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,470
Alright.

795
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,660
Here, drink some water.

796
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,620
Thanks.

797
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,910
Give me your hand.

798
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,140
What for?

799
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,140
My mom made me

800
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,870
wear this red string since I was little.

801
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,580
Consider it me sharing
some of my luck with you.

802
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,750
It should help a bit, right?

803
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,310
Are you really giving me

804
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,580
something so important?

805
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,870
It's not a gift,

806
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,540
just a temporary loan.

807
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:16,470
If you like it,

808
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,940
I'll make you another one later.

809
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:23,870
Thanks.

810
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,620
But don't worry.

811
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,390
Now that I'm back in the game,

812
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,020
I'm going to dominate the field.

813
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,440
Of course! You're my Big Brother Jing!
