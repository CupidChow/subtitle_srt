00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:20,920


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,360
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,880
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,170
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,170
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,710
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,640
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,260
   

16
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,488
Here's the toothpaste.

18
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,900
Use this toothbrush.

19
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,520
Bath towel and face towel.

20
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:11,865
Wait a minute.

21
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,180
After you take a shower, you can wear this.

22
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,350
I washed it two days ago.

23
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,150
It's clean.

24
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,130
Thank you.

25
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,580
Well, I will go out first.

26
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,510
Call me if you need anything.

27
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,200
Well, I'll shower first.

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,700
Okay.

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,910
I didn't mean anything by it.

30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,350
Don't worry.

31
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,030
Just take a shower.

32
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,590
Jing Xi Chi.

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,460
I can't sleep.

34
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,350
Is it because my typing's too loud?

35
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,970
No.

36
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,830
I think I'm just not used to sleeping somewhere new.

37
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,070
When I couldn't sleep, I used to think of something happy and relaxing.

38
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,360
It usually helped me fall asleep.

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,300
Did it really work?

40
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,460
It worked for me.

41
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,230
What should I think about?

42
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,290
Why don't you try thinking about...

43
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,380
what our future home would be like?

44
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,270
Our home?

45
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:22,060
I'd like to have lots and lots of pictures, all over the wall.

46
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:29,260
Pictures of us in the family housing compound, pictures of us now,

47
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,420
and pictures of us when we're old.

48
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,380
 That's painful, Chen Huan Er! What are you doing? 

49
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,540
♫  Falling asleep on my shoulder in the afternoon  ♫

50
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:50,470
I'd like to have a garden where I can grow vegetables and flowers.

51
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,220
And I'd like to have a puppy like Little Brother.

52
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,030
And I want a big fridge.

53
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:07,100
The fridge is full of fridge magnets of all the places we've been.

54
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,060
♫  Pain and life  ♫

55
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,080
♫  Trouble me every year  ♫

56
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,450
I also want...

57
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,040
a kitchen...

58
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,280
The kitchen is...

59
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,460
♫  But the weather is clear  ♫

60
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,540
♫  And hope shines like light on the grasslands  ♫

61
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,220
♫  Your kindness I long for  ♫

62
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:39,018
♫  But the wind makes it cold  ♫

63
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,460
♫  You give me a short moment of sweetness  ♫

64
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,020
♫  But our love is long-lasting  ♫

65
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,900
♫  My baby  ♫

66
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,400
♫  My baby  ♫

67
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,900
♫  Running fast is about you  ♫

68
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,440
♫  Daydreaming is about you  ♫

69
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,640
♫  My baby  ♫

70
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,420
As long as I have you, that's enough for me.

71
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,810
Let's learn this today.

72
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,790
   
   

73
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,400
These are university courses.

74
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,053
I'm done with high school, so I'll advance to university.

75
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,890
Actually, you don't need to learn this now.

76
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,120
No, I have to learn.

77
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,360
There are other students in our class who are learning too.

78
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,570
Why do you have to compare yourself to others?

79
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,230
I can't accept that others are better than me.

80
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,222
I just want to be number one.

81
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,510
Why do you want to be number one so badly?

82
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,470
I have no idea.

83
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,060
I'm just used to being first.

84
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,620
You've never been second?

85
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,250
No.

86
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,940
You're a lot like the old me.

87
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,810
The old you?

88
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,620
From primary school to high school, I never came second.

89
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,380
At that time, I was a genius in the eyes of both students and parents.

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,890
Studying gave me a sense of achievement.

91
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:13,080
As time went by, I felt I was born to be better than others.

92
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,231
But then I went to Yenching University

93
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:20,160
and I realized... that it wasn't like that at all.

94
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,550
Because you couldn't easily be number one anymore?

95
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,380
That was the first time I found studying to be painful.

96
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,690
Then, I studied day and night.

97
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:43,590
Finally, on one exam, I came in second.

98
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,860
That's good. You can be number one after that.

99
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,900
I gave up.

100
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,930
Why?

101
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,560
Because I found out that the top student in our class

102
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,140
is a 15-year-old kid who barely even comes to class.

103
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,860
A whiz-kid?

104
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,620
   

105
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,470
   

106
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,830
 That was the moment I realized that 

107
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,860
 a lot of things I had to work very hard for 

108
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,850
 were as easy as drinking water for some people. 

109
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,900
From that moment on,

110
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,540
I gave up my obsession with being number one

111
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,580
and accepted the fact that I was just an ordinary person.

112
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,700
Are you happy now?

113
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,070
All I can say is that I'm a lot more relaxed.

114
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,310
Song Cong, wait a minute.

115
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,590
Here's the last tutoring fee.

116
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,090
They asked for a new teacher.

117
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you.

118
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,500
Sorry to trouble you.

119
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,470
Aren't you surprised?

120
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,160
I had a feeling.

121
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,120
Can I ask why?

122
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,919
It's certainly not a matter of professionalism.

123
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:54,260
If you can't teach them, I don't know who to recommend.

124
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,620
Probably because I couldn't meet their expectations.

125
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,860
He wants to always be first, but who can be number one forever?

126
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:10,440
I'm sorry for the trouble.

127
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,435
Let me buy you a meal.

128
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:13,710
It's payday.

129
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,280
I'm buying.

130
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,830
Okay.

131
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,617
I told you I'd buy you a meal.

132
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,950
Why don't you let me buy you a nice meal?

133
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,500
I think this is nice.

134
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,740
There's no need for formality.

135
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,310
Actually, you...

136
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,990
You didn't have to talk so much to that kid.

137
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,460
If you hadn't talked to him about life, you wouldn't have lost your job.

138
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,260
I saw him and thought of my old self.

139
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,490
I was also afraid that he'd lose his self-confidence

140
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,888
if he entered an environment like Yenching University.

141
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,955
But there are some things you can't understand until you've experienced them yourself.

142
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,710
I remember you were always in the top three in high school, right?

143
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,950
How did you adjust your mindset?

144
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,877
Do you know how much I wanted to be number one?

145
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,640
But as long as you're around, I'd never get it.

146
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,140
So, thanks to you, I'm used to it.

147
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,760
Shouldn't you thank me?

148
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,310
I found you a job.

149
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,740
And I grew up knowing that I don't always get what I want.

150
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:40,790
This dish is quite tasty.

151
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,810
Eat more.

152
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,500
Hello, guys.

153
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,020
- You're here. 
 - What took you so long?

154
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,440
Sorry, we're late.

155
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,511
- You have no sense of time. 
 - It's only five minutes, Xin Yan.

156
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:02,000
- Did you order? 
 - Yes.

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,620
I thought I'd wait for you before they serve the food.

158
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,244
- Start with some appetizers. 
 - Sure.

159
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,533
Okay.

160
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,540
Huan Er, you and Jing Xi Chi will stay in Wuan from now on?

161
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,280
Highly probable.

162
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,060
I applied for our school's graduate program.

163
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,540
And he handed both himself and his website over to the company.

164
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,740
Now he's working like a horse for them.

165
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,990
Not bad, Jing Xi Chi.

166
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:28,260
Whether or not the next Bill Gates or Zuckerberg appears in my circle depends on you.

167
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,830
I'll try my best.

168
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,200
You better finish your degree properly. No dropping out!

169
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,380
Of course not.

170
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,455
Time flies.

171
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:38,475
Even rebellious teens become henpecked husbands.

172
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,260
Who says otherwise?

173
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,977
You two are still the best.

174
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:45,161
Pursuing master's and doctoral degrees consecutively.

175
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,350
You've seen the pigs getting fed, but not them getting slaughtered.

176
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,380
I can't wait to graduate.

177
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,620
Hello, everyone!

178
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,860
You're so late.

179
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,780
You're finally here.

180
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,560
Isn't this Mr. Li?

181
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,310
I heard you're going back to Tianhe No. 3 Central Hospital for your internship.

182
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,803
Yes, that's the plan.

183
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:04,590
You're the most obedient.

184
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,230
What's wrong? He's doing well.

185
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,670
He lives and eats at home, and his immediate superior is his dad.

186
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,100
Unlike us, we work hard every day for our future.

187
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,740
He's already at the finish line, lying down and winning.

188
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,150
Real winner in life.

189
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,310
Don't say that. Real winner in life?

190
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,230
I haven't even had a girlfriend.

191
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,580
Liao Xin Yan, stop chatting on the phone.

192
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,848
It's a class reunion.

193
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,215
You can chat until you get home.

194
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:30,310
He's clingy.

195
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,310
No, no.

196
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,150
I suspect my recent toothache

197
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,480
must be due to seeing too many of your affectionate displays.

198
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,070
- Pissed me off. 
 - What? You want to fall in love?

199
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,670
- You don't? 
 - I don't.

200
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,804
You and Cong go to the same university.

201
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:45,415
- Why don't you two try to fall in... 
 - Hey!

202
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:47,190
Why are you still such a talker?

203
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,100
What's wrong?

204
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,620
If you criticize me again, I'll sing the alphabet song for everyone.

205
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,740
What alphabet song?

206
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,700
A, B, C, D...

207
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,980
- Come here. 
 - E, F, G.

208
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,004
- Keep singing. 
 - What?

209
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:58,604
- You still want to sing? 
 - Don't touch me!

210
00:14:58,604 --> 00:14:59,620
Are you singing or not?

211
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,480
- Sing loudly. Come on. 
 - Come in.

212
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,910
Hi, we got a call from a Mr. Bai.

213
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,170
He asked us to give this to Ms. Liao Xin Yan.

214
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,740
My tooth hurts even more.

215
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,340
It's been almost two and a half years.

216
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,030
Why is he still so sweet?

217
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,150
What?

218
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,550
Singles don't get to talk, right?

219
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,840
The one she's chatting with isn't this.

220
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,540
   

221
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,310
No wonder they say graduation season is break-up season.

222
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,030
Anyway, Xin Yan, we're in the second half of our third year.

223
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,920
Isn't it a bit early for you to break up?

224
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,860
I... I'm really fine.

225
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,740
I just want to graduate and take the civil service exam back to Tianhe.

226
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,280
He's an only child.

227
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,670
His home is near our school, and I can't come back.

228
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,390
I thought I'd let go and be free.

229
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,130
I'm looking for my next romance.

230
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,790
If that's the case, we'll wish you good luck on your civil service exam.

231
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,980
- Okay? 
 - Sure.

232
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,950
- Come on. 
 - Wait.

233
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,170
We're drinking before the food is served?

234
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,100
Jing Xi Chi, we didn't decide on a winner last time, did we?

235
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,760
Come on. This time, do you want to fight me again?

236
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,047
- Put that drink down. 
 - You can't get drunk today,

237
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:25,340
even if everyone else does.

238
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,337
Then let's cut the cake to celebrate my happy breakup.

239
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:31,070
- Cut the cake. 
 - Come on.

240
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,570
Waitress.

241
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,604
- Knife. 
 - Knife. I'll get her.

242
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:36,270
- Miss. 
 - What do you need?

243
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,950
Knife.

244
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,550
- Waitress. 
 - Here it is.

245
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,315
The knife is here.

246
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm so speechless.

247
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,500
- Xin Yan, you're making a fool of us... 
 - Be careful.

248
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,220
Cut the ties of love.

249
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,620
This knife is so big.

250
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,950
But I really didn't expect Xin Yan to take the civil service exam.

251
00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:00,430
Maybe she's the one who knows what she wants the most among us.

252
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,410
Jing Xi Chi, do you think we'll change?

253
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,980
No matter how you change, my love for you will never change.

254
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,260
Be serious.

255
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,150
- I'll go back now. 
 - I'm very serious. Hey!

256
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,120
You're just leaving like that.

257
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,910
Where is my kiss?

258
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,253
Stop it. What if my dad sees it?

259
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:22,020
There's no one here.

260
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,640
Don't.

261
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,182
Your dad already knows. What are you afraid of?

262
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:28,390
- Don't be late. 
 - I'm leaving.

263
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,390
Go back now.

264
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,870
- Get up early. 
 - Okay.

265
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,590
Got it.

266
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,630
 The second semester of third year arrived in a rush, 

267
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,700
 and our youth drew to a clumsy but abrupt halt. 

268
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,870
 As the notes of farewell started to play, 

269
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,910
 we stood at the threshold of society and the future. 

270
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,300
 But life always has unexpected surprises. 

271
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,350
I'll raise a toast.

272
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:57,910
There's a message from the counselor.

273
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,640
Let me see.

274
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,704
It's this late in the day and he's still sending out internship questionnaires.

275
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:09,760
The third year isn't over yet, and we're already looking forward to the future.

276
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,260
Right, Lu, I thought you said you were looking for a job in advance.

277
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,910
How is it?

278
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,260
I've been thinking about it,

279
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,110
and I've got maybe 30 or 40 years of time to work in the future.

280
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,060
But I only have a year or so left to fall in love in university.

281
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,910
So I've decided not to rush into finding a job.

282
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:34,060
I want to experience a proper "sunset romance" during my university days.

283
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,540
Be honest. What are your plans?

284
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,700
Senior year is coming.

285
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,670
It's the norm for couples to break up, and go their separate ways.

286
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,220
Huan Er, you've got to be careful.

287
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,910
Jing Xi Chi's work is on track now.

288
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,680
I think I'll stay in Wuan too.

289
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,060
You're going to graduate school?

290
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,840
I can't help it. My grades aren't good.

291
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,780
Hui Xin is number one, and I'm number five.

292
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,430
There are only four spots available.

293
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,880
Hui Xin, the future of pharmacy depends on you.

294
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,020
Enough about me.

295
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,590
Li, what's your plan?

296
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,190
My parents found me a job at a pharmaceutical company.

297
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,780
Is it Guangfeng?

298
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,120
It's a dream place for pharmacy graduates.

299
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,160
Their branch has business with my parents, so they helped me get in.

300
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,490
Don't forget us when you're doing great.

301
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,870
Researchers depend on you.

302
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,460
Let's raise a toast?

303
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,540
Come on.

304
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,490
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

305
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,360
I'll take a call.

306
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,630
Are the exam questions hard?

307
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,670
Not too hard.

308
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,830
 Come on, let's drink. 

309
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,070
 - Bottoms up. 
 - Cheers. 

310
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,190
Hui Xin.

311
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,980
Hui Xin, what took you so long?

312
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,500
Come here. Come sit with me for a while.

313
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,080
I haven't had a good chat with you.

314
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,693
Huan Er, do you still want to go for guaranteed admission?

315
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,490
What's wrong?

316
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,700
I...

317
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,060
I am not going to graduate school.

318
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,040
I'm going back to my hometown to look for a job after graduation.

319
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,220
Wait.

320
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,240
Why do you want to go back to your hometown?

321
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,780
Isn't it your ambition to go to graduate school since you entered university?

322
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,670
You work so hard every day.

323
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,500
You're just giving up like this?

324
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,870
My brother scored very well in his senior year of high school.

325
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,700
As an elder sister, I have to do my part.

326
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,420
Wait. What decade are we living in? Do things like this still happen?

327
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,680
Don't you have a scholarship and a grant? You are not dependent on your family.

328
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,590
How come your family won't let you study?

329
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,660
My parents called me just now.

330
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,451
They're getting old.

331
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,737
They can't afford to support another university student.

332
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:27,770
So they want me to go home early, help out, and start working early.

333
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:35,593
Besides, if I go home early, I can take care of them if anything happens to them.

334
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,590
As you know, I had to repeat a year to get in here.

335
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,400
Compared to my brother, I don't have much talent for studying.

336
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,693
Hui Xin.

337
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:18,220
I now realize that being able to study is one of the happiest things in the world.

338
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,840
There will be one more available spot if I quit.

339
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,460
If you have made up your mind, I can help you prepare the documents.

340
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,080
I don't want it.

341
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:46,582
Consider it a way to repay you for taking care of me these past three years.

342
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,220
Huan Er...

343
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,660
actually, I know what you and the girls did.

344
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,460
Like Li, she's a rich girl, but she asked for samples

345
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,210
when she bought things.

346
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:14,000
Lu is so lazy, but she always got a part-time job at the student union.

347
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,251
When she got back to the dorm, she told me she was going home

348
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:18,537
and asked me to go in her place.

349
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,690
As for you,

350
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,660
you're afraid I won't get enough to eat, so you always buy an extra dish.

351
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,390
No...

352
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,870
Hui Xin...

353
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,940
Think about it again.

354
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,460
Hui Xin, are you all right?

355
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,670
Why are you back?

356
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,180
Qiu Li sent me a message.

357
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,404
Dong Hui Xin, are you willing to do that?

358
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,680
Yes.

359
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,700
You don't get to choose your background,

360
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,690
but you do get to choose what kind of life you want to live.

361
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,040
Hui Xin, even if you don't go to graduate school, what can you do back home?

362
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,093
Why don't you stay in Wuan and prove yourself?

363
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:10,670
Yes, just stay.

364
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,710
Think about it.

365
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,020
Give me your parents' phone number.

366
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,800
I'll talk to them.

367
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,700
Stop it.

368
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,540
How do you know if you don't try?

369
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,580
- Try it. 
 - You're so young.

370
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,300
Okay. I'll reconsider. Let me think about it.

371
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,670
Let me think about it. Let me think about it.

372
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,870
Stop drinking.

373
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,980
- Come on. 
 - We'll drink with you.

374
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,271
- Qiu Li, get down. 
 - Qiu Li.

375
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,540
- Qiu Li. 
 - Let's drink.

376
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,190
Let's drink.

377
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,460
You girls...

378
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,490
Cheers!

379
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,020
- Don't go back. 
 - Don't go back.

380
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,430
Forget the unhappy things.

381
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,910
Let's drink. Come on, cheers!

382
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,450
Cheers!

383
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,670
Hui Xin.

384
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,800
Hui Xin.

385
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,040
Let's stay together, Hui Xin.

386
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,540
We love you.

387
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,020
Jing, come on.

388
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,826
I'll talk to HR tomorrow.

389
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:18,150
You can work here for now.

390
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,390
- Okay. 
 - Mr. Jiang.

391
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,060
Jing, let me introduce them to you.

392
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,093
Cai Wen Long, Mr. Cai. He's your senior.

393
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:24,770
I've brought you someone this time.

394
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,180
These are the pillars of our company's technical department.

395
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,138
Cherish the chance and learn from them.

396
00:25:29,138 --> 00:25:30,460
- That's great. 
 - Thank you.

397
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,020
Goodbye.

398
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,220
Hi, Mr. Cai.

399
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,980
Excuse me.

400
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,525
 The closer we get to graduation, 

401
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:53,950
 the more we feel that the previous four years of university life 

402
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,110
 were like a party with the purpose of saying goodbye. 

403
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,220
 Because once we step out of the campus, 

404
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,920
 all the privileges and advantages of being a student will disappear. 

405
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,396
 Time is like a whirlpool of great force, 

406
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:17,940
 silently pushing us into the vast sea of humanity. 

407
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,890
 There are those who wear out their feet for a salary, 

408
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,120
 and those who run for the moon in the sky. 

409
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,630
 No one knows what will become of themselves in the future, 

410
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:40,740
 only occasionally stopping to see the ignorant and happy 

411
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,470
 new students of the campus, and vaguely remembering that 

412
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,170
 we were also like this. 

413
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:56,520
   

414
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,020
Mr. Jiang asked me to remind you that the project's go-live date is confirmed.

415
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,000
The 31st.

416
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,346
It's set by the headquarters.

417
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:07,870
Didn't we agree on the middle of next month?

418
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,010
Why is it half a month earlier?

419
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,840
What Mr. Jiang means is that we have enough manpower now,

420
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,670
so he'd like to move it forward as much as possible.

421
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,570
Enough manpower?

422
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,590
I'd like to ask Mr. Jiang where he got these men.

423
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,604
Do they count as manpower?

424
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,870
All right, I got it.

425
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:36,640
These men were sent here to help, but they didn't do anything to help.

426
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,048
They even treat me like a waiter, and make me grind coffee for them.

427
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:42,560
Why didn't they let me do latte art?

428
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,450
Mr. Cai,

429
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:57,360
I'd like to have a word with you.

430
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,330
Surprise!

431
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,004
- Huan Er is here. 
 - What brings you here?

432
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:23,400
Well, I'm here to buy you a meal.

433
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,700
Let's go. You haven't had dinner, right?

434
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,000
Go now.

435
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,190
I'm not going. Just buy some food for me.

436
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,780
Zhou Ye, you should hurry back too.

437
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,500
Hui Xin hasn't had much luck in finding a job lately, so she's not in a good mood.

438
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,693
Really?

439
00:28:36,693 --> 00:28:38,350
- I... I'll get going now. 
 - Go, hurry up.

440
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,150
- Don't talk to her directly. 
 - Okay.

441
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,710
I'm leaving.

442
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,893
What are you waiting for?

443
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,290
Let's go.

444
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,626
Eat it while it's hot.

445
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:52,137
Your favorite Stir-fried Pork with Chili.

446
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,740
Okay.

447
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,010
Thanks.

448
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,490
Come on. Eat slowly.

449
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,110
Hello.

450
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,670
Mr. Jiang?

451
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,060
 Are you having any problems on your end? 

452
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,360
The go-live date has suddenly been moved up.

453
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,600
The workload's just too much.

454
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,065
- So far, it's just me and Zhou Ye... 
  - Then why did you kick 

455
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:23,271
 Cai and the others off the team? 

456
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,870
They weren't working anyway.

457
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,490
Why keep them around?

458
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,110
Should I be serving them every day?

459
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,320
Sorry, I'm not up for that.

460
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,737
 I'm obliged to provide you with manpower. 

461
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,204
 It's your freedom to use them or not. 

462
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:47,390
 Anyway, you must accomplish the task within the time limit. 

463
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,870
I know. By the end of the month.

464
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,160
Well, I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

465
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,220
Come on.

466
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,640
Eat it while it's hot.

467
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,980
I got rid of all those men sent by Jiang Sen.

468
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,360
I feel like... if you think they don't respect you,

469
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,160
you should show your ability and earn their respect.

470
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,110
Make them respect me?

471
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,730
That's not so easy.

472
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:30,640
So you'd rather get rid of them than try?

473
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,050
Or do you think you can't handle it?

474
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:38,190
No matter how hard you try, you can't change their minds?

475
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,660
Jing Xi Chi, do you remember what you were like in high school?

476
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:55,110
The one who wouldn't give up and move on, no matter what?

477
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,604
Mr. Cai, Mr. Qian, I bought your favorite roast goose with crispy skin.

478
00:31:08,604 --> 00:31:10,460
- Is that so? 
 - You've praised this place

479
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,020
out of all the restaurants in Wuan.

480
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,190
- Come on, eat it while it's hot. 
 - Fu, thank you.

481
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,590
We're in for a treat today.

482
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,880
Come on.

483
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,220
This...

484
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:25,150
Mr. Cai, is this roast goose to your liking?

485
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,260
They're the real hosts of today's meal.

486
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,160
For this meal, my junior has traveled

487
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,670
across the city to bring it back from the restaurant himself.

488
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,471
It's full of sincerity.

489
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,830
I remember when Mr. Jiang proposed the Yangwu Website,

490
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,260
Mr. Cai, you voted for it.

491
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,693
Maybe you could hear him out today.

492
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,160
The first order Yangwu got was the three years' worth of review materials

493
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,373
from my friends and me in high school.

494
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:58,910
 Inside those materials are not only the knowledge we learned in high school, 

495
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,350
 but also the time we spent with each other. 

496
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:07,260
 I think every old book carries the memories and ideals of many people. 

497
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,940
I don't want these things to be eroded by the passage of time.

498
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,060
Young man, your story is interesting.

499
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,910
Unfortunately, we don't buy your story.

500
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,260
Let's go.

501
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,840
I know it's naive to ask you to fulfill my wish with me.

502
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:35,150
Anyway, Mr. Cai, don't you want to do something for yourself?

503
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,740
What do you mean?

504
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,980
 Hello, Fu Ying. 

505
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,740
 Can you help me find out about Mr. Cai's preferences 

506
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,780
 and the projects he's worked on over the years? 

507
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,910
 Okay. Only his alone? 

508
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,300
 Yes. 

509
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,950
 Only his. 

510
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:02,060
As I know, Mr. Cai, you've been working in Huan Dao for seven years.

511
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,780
But you've only been promoted once.

512
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,830
In recent years, you haven't even successfully financed any of the projects

513
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,250
you're directly responsible for, right?

514
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:20,570
I wonder if it's your judgment in selecting a project, or your ability that's at fault.

515
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,460
Young man, mind your words.

516
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,300
I've seen all the projects you've worked on in Huan Dao.

517
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,870
I don't question your expertise.

518
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,150
It's far superior to mine.

519
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:38,350
It's just that in recent years, you've been discouraged by failure.

520
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,237
I also know that in your mind,

521
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:48,120
you feel aggrieved that the company sent you, such an experienced senior, to give me a hand.

522
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,200
But you need a project that will go live quickly.

523
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,780
The Yangwu Website needs your technical support.

524
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,950
Only if we work together can we win.

525
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,150
Mr. Cai,

526
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:07,840
please give me a chance, and give the Yangwu Website a chance.

527
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,560
At the same time, give yourself a chance.

528
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,790
Do you live far from the hospital?

529
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,270
Not far. It's only a five-minute walk.

530
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,293
I'm about the same.

531
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,671
Is there anything else you want to see me about?

532
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,020
Boys must be careful when they're out.

533
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,280
But don't be too nervous, or too self-absorbed.

534
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:42,960
   

535
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,140
   

536
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,880
How's it?

537
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,137
I... I've been accepted.

538
00:35:52,137 --> 00:35:53,960
   

539
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,270
That's great!

540
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,537
Your efforts have not been in vain.

541
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,937
Tonight, I'm buying dinner.

542
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,790
 I found out Hui Xin stopped looking for jobs. 

543
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,870
 Without further study in pharmacy, 

544
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:33,690
 you can't do anything as a pharmacist, doctor, 

545
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,930
 or researcher in Wuan. 

546
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,700
 Later, Dong Hui Xin returned home 

547
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,320
 and found an ordinary job 

548
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,120
 to pay for her brother's university education. 

549
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:56,380
 I didn't expect fate to be so unfair. 

550
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,390
 In the blink of an eye, my roommates and I are going our separate ways. 

551
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:13,200
 I wonder when we'll meet again. 

552
00:37:17,048 --> 00:37:18,815
Plug in oxygen.

553
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,770
One milligram of adrenaline every three minutes.

554
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,471
One milligram of adrenaline every three minutes.

555
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,240
Time of death, 20:37.

556
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,060
Take the family to get a death certificate.

557
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,300
Also, make sure to comfort them.

558
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,937
- Who's it? 
  - Your food delivery has arrived. 

559
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,180
What?

560
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,410
I didn't order any food. It's not my name.

561
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,680
I ordered it.

562
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,990
Thank you.

563
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,660
Have you eaten?

564
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,680
Thank you.

565
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,180
- Just eat. 
 - Okay.

566
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,870
Your apartment layout looks just like mine.

567
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,093
How much did you rent it for?

568
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,140
2,500 yuan.

569
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,290
What?

570
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,960
2,500 yuan.

571
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,270
What about you?

572
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,010
3,000 yuan.

573
00:40:53,910 --> 00:41:00,440
The landlord told me I got a great deal, saying it was the lowest price in the neighborhood.

574
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,320
It turns out that a top student gets tricked too.

575
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:31,530
I've actually imagined countless times a patient dying in front of me.

576
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,120
I thought I was ready for it.

577
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:45,340
But when it came to that moment... I realized I had overestimated myself.

578
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:15,500
Maybe one day we'll get used to it.

579
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,980
Get used to facing death?

580
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,315
Get used to accepting the cycle of life more openly

581
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,350
and understanding the true responsibility of being a doctor.

582
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:16,950


583
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:22,650
 "Yesterday’s Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

584
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:28,751
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

597

00:45:43,881 --> 00:45:47,781
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫

 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

600

00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,951

00:46:00,951 --> 00:46:04,361
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫
