1
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:20,850


2
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,880
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,170
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,260
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,710
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,150
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,270
   

16
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,890
   

18
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,620
It's all right.

19
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,030
Song Cong is fine.

20
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,380
I would feel so guilty otherwise.

21
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,140
All right, Miss Customer.

22
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,100
Since you've come to have your fortune told, what do you intend to pay me?

23
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,710
Didn't you ask me to come here?

24
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,420
I didn't want my fortune told.

25
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,030
Since you're here, just let me see your fortune.

26
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,150
I don't ask for much. Just give me some information.

27
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,760
Okay, go ahead.

28
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,260
Other than Salinger, which authors does Jing Xi Chi like?

29
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,950
Salinger?

30
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,380
Have you forgotten?

31
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,640
The book he exchanged was The Catcher in the Rye.

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,710
That's Salinger's book.

33
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,650
That wasn't his book. It was Song Cong's.

34
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,880
He just helped pass it on.

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,240
Xin Yan, did you think it was Jing Xi Chi's book?

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,150
Never mind. What else does Jing Xi Chi like besides playing football?

37
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,870
Besides football?

38
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,960
He seems to only like football.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,250
He likes Maradona.

40
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,160
He's also always hungry.

41
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,320
But he's actually really loyal.

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,800
The more I hear about him, the more he seems like a good guy.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,260
- Continue. 
 - That's everything I know.

44
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,670
What's wrong, Xin Yan?

45
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,540
Why are you so interested in Jing Xi Chi?

46
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,150
No reason. Be quiet.

47
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,860
Take a deep breath.

48
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,150
With your intuition, choose a card.

49
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,650
Choose one.

50
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,030
This one.

51
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,660
- This one. 
 - Can I open my eyes yet?

52
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,460
Yes.

53
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,240
The Hermit.

54
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,520
It means he is an extreme idealist.

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,288
Although on the surface you two seem very different,

56
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:54,670
in fact your souls are deeply in sync.

57
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,590
Song Cong is your perfect match.

58
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,680
Song Cong?

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,134
Xin Yan, why are you having these weird thoughts?

60
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:05,420
Okay, I'm weird. I must have hit the mark, right?

61
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,220
No. Song Cong and I are just good friends!

62
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,710
Sure. Of course, you're just friends.

63
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,040
- Yes. 
 - This is the classic "I have a friend" story.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,120
Don't worry, I understand everything.

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,440
Okay, next.

66
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,696
Du Man.

67
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:20,960
Du Man.

68
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,150
No, thanks.

69
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,320
If you keep reading here, you'll go blind.

70
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,450
Du Man, come here.

71
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,780
Come, let's go.

72
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,810
- No. 
 - Come on.

73
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,980
- Come here. 
 - I don't need it.

74
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,836
Let the class president read your academic future.

75
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:35,810
- I don't need it, really. 
 - Let's try it out together.

76
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,680
Here.

77
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,270
Follow your intuition.

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,080
- From here... 
  - Which room isn't asleep yet? 

79
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,450
 Why are you still making noise? 

80
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,450
The lights.

81
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,250
Has she left?

82
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,580
- She left. 
 - I don't think she found out, did she?

83
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,490
Cong.

84
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,920
Why are you acting weird lately?

85
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,610
Why do you say so?

86
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,200
Are you avoiding Chen Huan Er today?

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,120
Not really.

88
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,520
Jing Xi Chi.

89
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,270
Can you stop being a walking loudspeaker? You don’t have to announce everything.

90
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,160
Just go to sleep.

91
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,900
I think you've recovered. Seriously.

92
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,410
   

93
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,950
Song Cong, do you want to call your parents?

94
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,420
Do you want to ask them to come see you?

95
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm fine, Mr. Xu. I don't need to go home early.

96
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,650
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

97
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,610
That's great.

98
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,740
By the way, Song Cong, in the next extracurricular activity

99
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,220
you must watch your diet.

100
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,590
Take care of your stomach.

101
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,830
Okay.

102
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,030
- I'll excuse myself. 
 - Okay, go.

103
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,810
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

104
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,460
Song Cong.

105
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,130
I didn't see you earlier.

106
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,710
Are you feeling all right?

107
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,540
I'm okay.

108
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,930
You...

109
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,270
Are you, Huan Er, and Xi Chi all right lately?

110
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,540
I haven't been in contact with you for a long time.

111
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,410
We're pretty good.

112
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,050
It's raining heavily.

113
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,690
Why don't I walk with you for a bit?

114
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,590
Sure.

115
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,460
Let me do it.

116
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,840
   

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,480
Slow down.

118
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,340
Oh, right.

119
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,290
I just reported to the homeroom teacher that our class will hold a bonfire party.

120
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,640
I'm going to perform.

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,780
If you have time, come see me.

122
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,910
If the rain stops, that is.

123
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,490
Sure.

124
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,340
 I wondered why Cong is deliberately avoiding Chen Huan Er. 

125
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,780
 Hold on. 

126
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,490
 Does that mean... 

127
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,850
 So that means Huan Er... 

128
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,980
You weren't invited. Why are you here?

129
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,320
Didn't you also come uninvited?

130
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,950
- Quick, it's starting. 
 - It's starting.

131
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,800
Hello, everyone!

132
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm going to sing a song.

133
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,100
This is a song I heard by chance on my birthday.

134
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,710
I only found out later that a friend of mine really likes this song.

135
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,300
Maybe my singing isn't good and my guitar might be off-tune,

136
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:05,770
but I still want to dedicate this song to that person, the friend I've always admired.

137
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,730
I hope...

138
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,040
we will never have to say goodbye.

139
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,680
 Birthday? 

140
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,330
 Is she referring to me?

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,350

145
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,940
 This song is pretty good. 

146
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,400
 Right? 

147
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,920
 Cong listens to it every day. 

148
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,740
 You improved so much on this test. 
   

149
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,100
 Is it because Song Cong tutored you? 

150
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,080
 Then can I sit in on the lessons too? 

151
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,180
 Liao Xin Yan. 

152
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,600
 As the class president, you shouldn't be spreading rumors. 

153
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,050
 So, there is nothing between you two, right? 

154
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,370
 By the way, why do you care so much about him? 

155
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,480
 I'm not. 

156
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,590
 I want to thank you for helping me with studying. 

157
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,350
 Isn't this Song Cong's handwriting? 

158
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,460
 Really? 

159
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,450

163

 Looks like the story of a small-town girl and a top student 

164
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,490

Huan Er, the girl next door asked me to join her for a meal.

176
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,060
I'm leaving.

177
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,450
Wait up.

178
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,890
Then I'm leaving as well. Bye-bye.

179
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,367
Thank you for coming.

180
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,697
It's no big deal.

181
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:21,487
The song I just sang is your favorite, isn't it?

182
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:26,417
Well, I don't really like it that much.

183
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:29,017
I just think it sounds pretty good.

184
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:34,677
Qi Qi,

185
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:41,957
I can actually see that you missed the time back when we were freshmen.

186
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:46,367
If you have time, we can meet up more often.

187
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,177
We are still good friends.

188
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:53,587
Just like before.

189
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:03,767
But after going to another class,

190
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:10,957
I realized that time and distance can really change people.

191
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:21,007
That's why reminiscing about the past is quite a challenge for me.

192
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:09,047
Didn't you go with Xin Yan?

193
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:10,657
I did.

194
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:12,597
Liar.

195
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:21,917
What are you doing?

196
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,437
Isn't this prohibited?

197
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,767
Do you want to eat it or not?

198
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:39,917
Hold on.

199
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:42,777
You are suspiciously generous.

200
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,917
What do you want?

201
00:15:47,557 --> 00:15:49,407
Chen Huan Er,

202
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:55,797
actually, these things you've experienced, I've experienced them too.

203
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:02,007
Really?

204
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,247
It's okay.

205
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:09,957
It will all pass.

206
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:14,007
It's true. I think cases like this take time to solve.

207
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,077
Yes.

208
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:16,837
It's fine.

209
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:20,197
What the heck? I'm here to comfort you. Why are you comforting me instead?

210
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:21,477
Seriously.

211
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:24,717
You want to comfort me? What for?

212
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:30,887
Cong is a little insensible.

213
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:32,790
Right? Insensible.

214
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:38,677
But he is quite approachable.

215
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:40,887
For real?

216
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:44,317
Did you think that Cong and I—

217
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:45,537
Jing Xi Chi!

218
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,317
You've been around Xin Yan too long. What are you thinking?

219
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:53,557
Cong and I are pure revolutionary comrades.

220
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:56,487
We are both good students who study hard. All right?

221
00:16:57,287 --> 00:17:00,197
But why do you care about him so much?

222
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:04,167
He ate my food and got diarrhea. Shouldn't I be concerned?

223
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:08,247
- That's it? 
 - That's it.

224
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:16,100
- Really? 
 - Yes.

225
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,677
That damn Liao Xin Yan!

226
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:21,367
She's too misleading.

227
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,447
I think so too.

228
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:27,647
Stop eating then. You don't need it anyway.

229
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,920
- You have so much. Just give me a little. 
 - Leave some for Cong tonight.

230
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,360
You don't want to give it to me, do you?

231
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:39,077
Here you go, I'm just kidding.

232
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,247
What's on your mind?

233
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,637
Girl stuff.

234
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,317
What kind of girl stuff?

235
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,527
Don't guess a girl's mind.

236
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,367
I'll understand if you just tell me.

237
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:06,567
I don't want to tell you. Why should I?

238
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,360
I'll never know if you don't tell me. Just tell me.

239
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,997
Why should I tell you?

240
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:12,687
- Come on. 
 - I don't want to.

241
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,087
Then give it to me.

242
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,717
I can't take you seriously.

243
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:21,077
You're bullying me.

244
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:29,927
Hey, what are you doing?

245
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:33,887
It's almost lights out. Why are you still loitering?

246
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:34,887
I...

247
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:38,320
Get back to your dorm and sleep early, okay? I'll send you back.

248
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,334
Are you giving it to me or not? I won't eat it anymore.

249
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,167
Here, a candy for you.

250
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,627
Hey, you!

251
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,857
Cong. Cong.

252
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:54,617
Get up and have some snacks.

253
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,197
Wake up.

254
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:58,337
Cong.

255
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,927
Are you asleep?

256
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:20,677
 Cong, is learning agriculture tiring? 

257
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:22,447
 No. 

258
00:19:23,757 --> 00:19:26,060
 Li Tian. 

259
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,927
 Do you have any advice for the next batch of students on learning agriculture? 

260
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:34,517
 Be sure to bring some snacks yourself. 

261
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:38,407
 Never overestimate your schoolmates' cooking. 

262
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:40,517
 I suggest everyone study more. 

263
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:44,507
 Otherwise, once you're back and exams start right away, it's going to be a disaster. 

264
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:51,997
 I suggest finding someone to record the moments with their phone so you can keep these memories. 

265
00:19:51,997 --> 00:19:56,447
 Chen Huan Er, after studying agriculture this time, how do you feel? 

266
00:19:58,037 --> 00:20:03,277
 I feel like it's great to be together with everyone. 

267
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:06,200
 Are there any unforgettable moments? 

268
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,900
 Sweet potato root. 

269
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,677
 - Sweet potato root. 
 - Other than sweet potato roots? 

270
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,887
 There's also you giving half of your snacks to Song Cong. 

271
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,960
 - I didn't. 
 - Yes, you did. 

272
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,320
 Shouldn't good friends share the good stuff? 

273
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,902
 I thought you only gave it to— 

274
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:24,847
 - Why are you blushing? 
 - I'm not! 

275
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:29,527
 Okay. Is there anything you'd like to say to the next batch of students? 

276
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:36,997
 I hope everyone won't cut their hands when digging wild vegetables. 

277
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:38,787
 They won't dig wild vegetables. 

278
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:46,267
 I also hope that when everybody is cooking, you can tell the ingredients apart 

279
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:50,477
 and that you don't end up with food poisoning. 

280
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:54,617
 The most memorable thing was: never eat Chen Huan Er's cooking. 

281
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:56,607
 Can you not mention this? 

282
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:58,197
 Am I really that bad at cooking? 

283
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:01,757
 - You usually eat a lot of my dishes. 
 - Then why did he have diarrhea? 

284
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:05,847
 Who knows? Maybe his stomach was already sick. 

285
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,777
 Didn't I also give him the medicine? 

286
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:09,237
 That sweet potato root. 

287
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:11,137
 Yes. So you know that— 

288
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,787
 Sweet potato root isn't actually the root of a sweet potato? 

289
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,127
 Can you stay away from me, Chen Huan Er? 

290
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:19,467
 When you film me, you always aim right at my nostrils! 

291
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:20,367
 Stop filming like that. 

292
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,617
 - Don't crawl around. 
 - Chen Huan Er, I'm leaving. 

293
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:28,227
 But now, the thing I remember wasn't our thoughts that were flying around. 

294
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:30,567
 I remember the smell of the bonfire that night. 

295
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,567
 The warmth of the people around me. 

296
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:37,477
 They say we are still too young to say so, 

297
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:42,327
 but at that moment, that was the memory I wanted most. 

298
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:44,847
 There's nothing else for you to take off. 

299
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,760
 Do you want to have a tutor session sometime soon? 

300
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:13,037
 Although Jing Xi Chi said those words at the agricultural study as a joke, 

301
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:15,217
 after thinking it over, 

302
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:28,247
 I decided to follow my intuition and make a decision. 

303
00:22:41,437 --> 00:22:43,647
 I won't join you anytime soon. 

304
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:46,077
 I want to try studying by myself. 

305
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:00,860
   

306
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,927
 Although I don't know if Cong would feel suspicious about this, 

307
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:08,767
 as always, he said nothing. 

308
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:16,347
   

309
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:18,077
   

310
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:35,187
Class is over.

311
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,567
I have extra practice tonight. You two should walk home together.

312
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,287
I'm heading out now.

313
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:55,037
 Leaving together after school is a regular thing, 

314
00:23:55,037 --> 00:24:00,557
 but with just the two of us it feels pretty weird. 

315
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:11,197
Cong, I want to eat some taro cake.

316
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:13,717
Why don't you go ahead?

317
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:15,297
Sure.

318
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,280
 - Good evening, viewers. 
 - Good evening. 

319
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,097
 It's January 25, Sunday. It's the 30th day of the lunar calendar. 

320
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:39,147
 On this traditional Chinese holiday, the Chinese New Year... 

321
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:46,607
 Although I didn't receive Song Cong's tutoring, 

322
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:51,127
 I managed to keep my end-of-semester test results at the previous level. 

323
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:56,527
 But the first Chinese New Year at Tianhe was quite gloomy. 

324
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,407
Do you want some more?

325
00:25:01,407 --> 00:25:03,927
I'm full.

326
00:25:03,927 --> 00:25:06,127
You don't seem to eat much.

327
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:09,277
Is the New Year's Eve dinner I prepared not to your liking?

328
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:11,247
No.

329
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:14,997
It's my fault. I still have work tomorrow.

330
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:18,097
Otherwise, I would've taken you back to Sishui.

331
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:19,360
To Grandma and Grandpa's place.

332
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,447
The whole family would be there. It's more lively there.

333
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:25,345
It's all right, Mom.

334
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:33,247
It's your Dad. Pick it up.

335
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,400
Hey, Dad.

336
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,980
Happy New Year.

337
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,710
Mom and I just finished eating.

338
00:25:47,176 --> 00:25:49,686
Dad, where you are sounds very lively.

339
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:52,096
It sounds crowded.

340
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:54,280
Mom?

341
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,576
Hold on, Dad.

342
00:25:56,576 --> 00:26:00,086
Mom, Dad wants to say something to you.

343
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:03,296
Hey.

344
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:07,486
Are you celebrating with the squad?

345
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:09,266
That's nice.

346
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:12,566
We're having a good time, too.

347
00:26:15,246 --> 00:26:17,216
 Do you want to come out? 

348
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:24,936
I'm all right.

349
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:30,706
 No. I'm with my mom at home. 

350
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,800
 In the previous Chinese New Year, even if Dad wasn't home, 

351
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,686
 friends and family in Sishui came and went. 

352
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:42,816
 It was always lively. 

353
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:47,046
 This is the first time I've seen Mom so disappointed. 

354
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:51,966
 Other than being beside her, I don't know how to comfort her. 

355
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:55,176
- Who's that? Go get the door. 
 - I'll get the door.

356
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:02,136
- Happy New Year. 
 - Happy New Year!

357
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:04,360
- Come in. 
 - No, I don't want to change my shoes.

358
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,336
- It's fine. 
 - Song Cong's father

359
00:27:05,336 --> 00:27:08,046
was called for surgery early this morning. He has yet to come back.

360
00:27:08,046 --> 00:27:09,800
And Li Qiang will be working overtime.

361
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,906
So I thought, why don't we get together?

362
00:27:11,906 --> 00:27:13,798
Forget it, I don't want to disturb you on this festive day.

363
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,840
Not at all. Don't be a stranger.

364
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,708
- Anyway, why don't we play some mahjong? 
 - Did you come to see me just to play mahjong?

365
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,096
- Who said that? I'm here to see you sincerely. 
 - Okay, let's go.

366
00:27:24,096 --> 00:27:25,646
- Change your shoes. 
 - I'll go get my phone.

367
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,966
Okay. Don't bring anything unnecessary.

368
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:31,246
- Is this your key? I got it for you. 
 - Okay, take it.

369
00:27:31,246 --> 00:27:32,726
I forgot to bring you a red envelope.

370
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:34,006
It's okay, you're one of us.

371
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:35,206
I'll make it up later.

372
00:27:35,206 --> 00:27:36,446
- Don't... 
 - Let's go.

373
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,266
- I got the keys, Mom. 
 - Let's go.

374
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,646
Play mahjong during the Chinese New Year.

375
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:41,280
Is there a better time to play mahjong?

376
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,120
- Quick. 
 - Nice.

377
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,515
Li Qiang, make some tea quickly.

378
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:51,520
- Our guests are here. 
 - I'll go.

379
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,746
Okay, go.

380
00:27:52,746 --> 00:27:55,136
Here I come.

381
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:56,856
Look who I brought.

382
00:27:56,856 --> 00:27:58,834
- Yi Fan. 
 - Is everything ready?

383
00:27:58,834 --> 00:27:59,966
Greet your elder.

384
00:27:59,966 --> 00:28:01,656
- Happy New Year! 
 - Happy New Year!

385
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:03,136
It's ready.

386
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:04,176
Greet your elder.

387
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:06,416
- Happy New Year! 
 - Happy New Year!

388
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:08,576
Take a seat, quick.

389
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,726
- Sit. 
 - Quick.

390
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:12,006
- It's all ready. 
 - Go and play with Xi Chi.

391
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:14,626
- I was just behind you. 
 - Who's that?

392
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,560
- Dr. Song.
 - Dr. Song.

393
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,276
You're here. Happy New Year.

394
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:20,616
As soon as he heard about mahjong, he got home quickly.

395
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,016
- Faster than usual. 
 - Quick.

396
00:28:23,016 --> 00:28:25,286
Since you're here, you're all set.

397
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,856
I'll be on duty later.

398
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,416
Enjoy the game and the food.

399
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,616
- I'll take my leave. 
 - Okay.

400
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:32,280
Okay, look at him. Li Qiang is a model employee.

401
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,716
He's so busy even during Chinese New Year.

402
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:35,946
- Here we go. 
 - I'm not good at this game.

403
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:38,286
It's fine, I'm not that good either.

404
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,686
Where is Jing Xi Chi?

405
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:48,736
Went to the restroom.

406
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:09,016
Weren't you staying in?

407
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:13,326
My mom pulled me along.

408
00:29:22,686 --> 00:29:23,686
Here you are.

409
00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:26,146
Why did you reject Song Cong's offer?

410
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:29,126
You had to force me to use our parents' relationship, right?

411
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:31,936
No.

412
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,446
Okay, we're all here.

413
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:36,880
- Let's go. 
 - Where to?

414
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,666
Time to experience one of the New Year's traditions

415
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,966
of our residential compound.

416
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:44,592
Why are you still sitting there? Let's go.

417
00:29:44,592 --> 00:29:46,896
You, too. Go. Get up and walk around.

418
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:48,176
- Where? 
 - You'll know soon.

419
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:51,896
- Where are you guys going? 
 - You'll know when we get there.

420
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:53,896
Mom, we're going out.

421
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:56,336
- Be careful. 
 - Mom, I'm leaving, too.

422
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,656
Okay. Follow them and stay safe.

423
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,680
- Hope you win. 
 - Hold up.

424
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,486
- Five characters. 
 - Be careful on your way.

425
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:03,920
I take it back.

426
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,980
­I want to take it back!

427
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,726
- No take-backs! 
 - Go, quick.

428
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:08,486
- Look. 
 - Nine circles.

429
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:10,216
Come.

430
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,179
Nine circles.

431
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:25,846
Come on, I want it too. Come on, two bamboos.

432
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:32,916
Is this the traditional project you do every year?

433
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,756
Where is Cong? Come, log in.

434
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,236
Jing Xi Chi.

435
00:30:52,236 --> 00:30:54,816
What do I type in?

436
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:56,836
Cong, help her out.

437
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,820
Oh, I got it.

438
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:11,336
What about the password? What is the password?

439
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,896
Zero, zero, zero. Here.

440
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,566
Right.

441
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,560
 ­  

442
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,136
Cong, why are you playing more and more like a noob?

443
00:31:47,136 --> 00:31:48,886
I'm taking a break.

444
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:51,616
You should practice on your own. It's no fun playing against you.

445
00:31:51,616 --> 00:31:53,296
I'll play alone.

446
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:13,446
 I feel like you've been avoiding me recently. 

447
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:42,976
 What do you mean? 

448
00:32:48,336 --> 00:32:52,506
 Ever since the final exams, I haven't been able to find you all winter break. 

449
00:33:07,346 --> 00:33:10,256
 Tell me. What's going on? 

450
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:32,486
 Although Qi Qi and I still have some misunderstandings, she is still my best friend. 

451
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:35,606
 I don't know what to do either. 

452
00:33:59,726 --> 00:34:01,616
I'm too good.

453
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:05,416
I'm too good. I'm really too good.

454
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:07,100
No one can beat me.

455
00:34:07,616 --> 00:34:08,936
Jing Xi Chi.

456
00:34:08,936 --> 00:34:11,736
Can we do something else?

457
00:34:11,736 --> 00:34:14,646
I don't know how to play games.

458
00:34:14,646 --> 00:34:16,336
Let's set off some fireworks.

459
00:34:16,336 --> 00:34:18,016
Sure.

460
00:34:19,086 --> 00:34:20,486
Okay.

461
00:34:20,486 --> 00:34:23,936
But it's already so late. Where can we buy fireworks?

462
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:27,086
I have an idea.

463
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,350
 ­  

464
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,540
That guy must be in stealth mode.

465
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:49,006
Such a big box.

466
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,566
So much.

467
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,696
Consider my debt paid.

468
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:54,296
Where did you get it?

469
00:34:54,296 --> 00:34:55,816
From my dad's car.

470
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:57,596
Impressive.

471
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,166
Moreover, your family sets them off every year.

472
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,816
It's really noisy.

473
00:35:01,816 --> 00:35:05,126
Today, let's give the neighbors a break.

474
00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:07,336
Aren't you afraid of your dad...

475
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:09,566
At worst, I'll get scolded or beaten.

476
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,976
He only had these two tricks.

477
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:19,456
Leave quickly before I change my mind.

478
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:23,296
You've stolen it anyway. Join us.

479
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:24,816
Yes.

480
00:35:24,816 --> 00:35:26,646
Let's go together.

481
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:31,126
I won't go. It's too noisy.

482
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:34,344
Go quickly.

483
00:35:40,086 --> 00:35:42,086
Thank you, brother.

484
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:43,766
Thanks.

485
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:48,396
Let's go set off some fireworks.

486
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,276
Where can we set them off?

487
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:04,886
Over there.

488
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:07,936
Let me tell you, these are the real deal.

489
00:36:07,936 --> 00:36:10,416
Stand far away.

490
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:13,086
Xi Chi, do you know what this firework is called?

491
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:15,416
Blue Fantasy.

492
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,496
I will show you how fantastic it is.

493
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:31,396
How long are you guys going to avoid each other?

494
00:36:37,936 --> 00:36:39,966
Did he tell you?

495
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:42,936
Do you think he would tell me?

496
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:44,966
I figured it out myself.

497
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:48,896
He's not usually like this.

498
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:51,206
Acting like he doesn't care.

499
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:06,646
Chen Huan Er, I really know nothing about girl stuff.

500
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:11,606
But I do think that friendship should be simple.

501
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:13,896
Just like I treat you as my friend.

502
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:18,126
No matter what happens between us, I just want you to be happy

503
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:20,236
and keep getting better.

504
00:37:21,376 --> 00:37:24,840
And I think you have done nothing wrong.

505
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,276
Don't stop being yourself just because

506
00:37:27,276 --> 00:37:29,406
you're afraid someone won't like you.

507
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:33,996
Are you ready?

508
00:37:33,996 --> 00:37:35,126
Ready.

509
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:36,856
Here we go.

510
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:01,010
There is a bigger one over there.

511
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,726
♫  Can I just pretend nothing happened?  ♫

512
00:38:06,726 --> 00:38:10,466
♫  Where are your thoughts?  ♫

513
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:14,066
♫  Does he understand them too?  ♫

514
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:20,336
Chen Huan Er, we all share a pure revolutionary friendship,

515
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:23,456
so don't mess it up!

516
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,696
That's right.

517
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:30,713
Don't destroy the harmony in our organization!

518
00:38:30,713 --> 00:38:33,296
We're about to start our final year of high school!

519
00:38:33,296 --> 00:38:37,816
We need to study hard!

520
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:44,086
♫  That isn't the real me  ♫

521
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:48,486
I know!

522
00:38:48,486 --> 00:38:51,886
♫  Don't let tears speak  ♫

523
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:54,896
♫  An answer that will never come  ♫

524
00:38:54,896 --> 00:38:58,926
♫  Who truly heard it?  ♫

525
00:38:58,926 --> 00:39:00,886
♫  Speaking perfect lies  ♫

526
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:04,766
♫  Becoming the best silent understanding between us  ♫

527
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:08,486
♫  Keeping our friendship, even if it's fake  ♫

528
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:13,446
♫  As long as I can still be in your thoughts  ♫

529
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:18,366
♫  As long as I can still be in your thoughts  ♫

530
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:32,966
Where did you put the fireworks?

531
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:34,186
In the trunk?

532
00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:35,736
I've checked. It's not there.

533
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:37,766
Please help me find it.

534
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:41,506
How can they fail such a simple task?

535
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,040
Have you seen the fireworks in my trunk?

536
00:39:46,696 --> 00:39:48,046
I didn't see them.

537
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:51,566
Why didn't you check the trunk?

538
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:54,416
How would I see it? Are you serious?

539
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:57,416
The fireworks are in your trunk. I'm not in your trunk.

540
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,646
You can check it out yourself! Why ask me?

541
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:01,816
I was watching TV here peacefully.

542
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,166
Why are you watching TV?

543
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:07,936
You don't care about our son! Seriously, you're weird.

544
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,756
- Why are you upset? 
 - You talk too much.

545
00:40:09,756 --> 00:40:11,640
Why are you throwing a tantrum at me?

546
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,776
- Tone it down! 
 - You take care of him usually.

547
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:16,600
Oh, really? But you throw a tantrum right when you come home!

548
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,896
Tell me, is that right? Tell me.

549
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:20,336
Just help me look for it, okay?

550
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:24,896
Go look for it yourself. I'm not messing with you. How dare you ask me to look for it!

551
00:40:42,696 --> 00:40:44,256
Huan Er, little sis, come here!

552
00:40:44,256 --> 00:40:45,952
Anything you want to say to your future self?

553
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:47,126
Stop recording.

554
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:50,166
- Just say a few words, come on. 
 - Cong is here. Record him.

555
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,376
Song Cong.

556
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:53,376
Oh, you're still hooked on that?

557
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:55,896
This is an eight-megapixel camera, you know that?

558
00:40:55,896 --> 00:40:57,426
- Say something. 
 - Stop lying.

559
00:40:57,426 --> 00:40:58,696
I checked it out yesterday.

560
00:40:58,696 --> 00:41:01,226
It's just three megapixels.

561
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:05,766
Who cares? It works, doesn't it? I can say whatever I want.

562
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:11,280
Li Tian? Come, say something.

563
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,806
Anything you want to say to your future self?

564
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:16,166
Why are you running? Li Tian, hold up.

565
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:22,696
 It's useless to run. I will definitely catch you on camera. 

566
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:26,166
 No one can escape me. 

567
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:38,330


568
