Why is there no one

17
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,640
at your university's screening event?

18
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,300
Maybe it's because
we medical school students

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,380
usually don't pay much attention
to these things.

Not yet.

Besides studying,

24
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,580
what do you usually do?

25
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,110
Basically studying.

26
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,180
Are you not bored?

27
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,230
No.

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,790
It's quite fulfilling.

29
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,990

If it's 39 degrees,

33
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,270
you still need to go to the hospital

34
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,180
to get it checked.

35
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,140
It's just rhetoric to express emotions.

39
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,990
that my essay scores
used to be really low?

the teacher?

46
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,140
This essay didn't stick to the topic.

47
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,540
I need to rewrite it.

48
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,950
So what?

49
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,900
I trust my own judgment.

50
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,950
You know what?

51
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,580
You're the first person
who approve of my article.

52
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,140
At that moment,

53
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,510
I thought

54
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,230
it's enough

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,700
if there's one person

56
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,740
who approves

57
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,510
of what I write.

58
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,620
Maybe it's insignificant

59
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,950
to you.

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,070
But it was really important

61
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,620
to me back then.

62
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,260
I remember.

63
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,030
And I really felt

64
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,220
that you wrote very well.

65
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,380
I thought

66
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,740
your words

67
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,380
and the way you phrase them

68
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,380
gave me

69
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,470
a sense of freedom.

70
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,860
Thank you.

71
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,620
However,

72
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,420
I don't write things

73
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,150
like that anymore.

74
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,820
Why?

75
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,860
Actually,

76
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
I later felt

77
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,990
that unrealistic rhetoric

78
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,030
is very dangerous.

79
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,710
Beautiful sentences

80
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,300
can make people mistake them

81
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,150
for love.

82
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,150
But it's just being pretentious.

83
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,300
So now

84
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,300
I prefer to use

85
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,230
straightforward descriptions.

86
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,590
Just like

87
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,350
when you like someone.

88
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,860
You'll take

89
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,230
the direct approach.

90
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,350
Will I

91
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,150
be disturbing you from studying?

92
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,470
No, you won't.

93
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,710
I was just saying.

94
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,910
It's not like

95
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,230
I only study every day.

96
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,590
So you're saying

97
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,590
I can invite you

98
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,120
if there are more activities like this.

99
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,230
Yes.

100
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:38,990
Okay.

101
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,350
Hello.

102
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,860
Why is Lin Jingyi

103
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,620
not here yet?

104
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,620
I don't know.

105
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,940
School has started for days,

106
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,980
but I've never seen him.

107
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,160
I asked around for a long time

108
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,630
but couldn't find any news about him.

109
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,710
It's amazing.

110
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,030
(Song Cong.)

111
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,200

from when you were)

114
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,680
(what do you usually do?)

115
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,180
(Basically studying.)

116
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,470
(He's a top student.)

117
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,710
(He will become)

118
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,180
(an elite among the elites.)

119
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,940
(Do you know who owns)

120
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,910
(the bed opposite?)

121
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,740
(Lin Jingyi.)

122
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,030
(Our school's number one.)

123
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,380
(I really want to see)

124
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,710
(what kind of person)

125
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,620
(can score)

126
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,710
(such insanely high marks.)

00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:16,710
(Sports Department)

128
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,680
All of you have been selected
through interviews

129
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,820
to become the future backbone

130
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,560
of the Student Council's
Sports Department.

131
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,910
I'm glad to work with you all

132
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,030
in the coming year.

133
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,790
Okay.

134
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,420
There's another

135
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
important matter today.

136
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,710
After each club is stable,

137
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,470
Student Council

138
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,790
will hold a welcome party.

139
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,790
Sports Department

140
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,400
needs to come up with an activity too.

141
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,820
Does anyone want to sign up for it?

142
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,740
I think Sports Department

143
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,790
isn't suitable for me.

144
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,710
I got to go.

145
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,800
What about the rest?

146
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,710
Zhou Ye.

147
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,500
Lin, I...

148
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,380
I'm not good at anything else

149
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,710
except fitness.

150
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,230
Okay, we'll pass you.

151
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,230
Chen Huan'er.

152
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,300
It's written on the registration form

153
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,500
that you know martial arts.

154
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,470
Yes.

155
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,470
You're a heroic woman.

156
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,960
How about this?

157
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,740
You're the one.

158
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,540
Come up with a martial arts performance.

159
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,500
I...

160
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,820
Huan'er, it's a good idea.

161
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,500
It's good?

162
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,060
What do you think?

163
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,150
Yes.

164
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,710
Take a look.

165
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,230
Okay.

166
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,070
Huan'er.

167
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,350
You're in charge.

168
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,950
Our department will assign

169
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,620
Huan'er then.

170
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,070
Sure.

171
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,470
One last thing.

172
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,780
Our office needs someone on duty

173
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,880
from Monday to Friday.

174
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,230
Check your class schedule later
and arrange the shifts in pairs.

175
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,500
Ouch.

176
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,310
Okay, that's all.

177
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,300
Okay. Meeting adjourned.

178
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,620
Okay.

179
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,990
Ouch.

180
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,740
Which afternoon are you free?

181
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,300
See for yourself.

182
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,470
You can't quit.

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,520
If you quit, there will be
no one in our department.

184
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,860
Nothing on Wednesday and Thursday.

185
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,140
Got it.

186
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,990
I'll think about it.

187
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,620
Let's go.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,460
Hurry back to practice martial arts.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,190
I have never been on stage.

190
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,070
How can I practice?

191
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,540
Your dad is a martial arts coach.

192
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,470
Huan'er.

193
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,950
Good luck.

194
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,430
Good luck.

195
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,110
Jing Xichi.

196
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,110
I'm so tired.

197
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,620
Li.

198
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,740
Where are you going?

199
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,040
The lights will be turned off soon.

200
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,780
I'm not staying in the dorm today.

201
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,540
Why?

202
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,020
I'm afraid of heat.

203
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,780
I can't stand it
without air conditioning.

204
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,940
I'm going to stay in a hotel.

205
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,110
Why are you back so late?

206
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,470
Sports Department just finished

207
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,310
rehearsing.

208
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,430
Okay, hurry upstairs.

209
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,140
I got to go.

210
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,780
I'm back.

211
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,430
No, what's going on?

212
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,860
I don't know.

213
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,950
Open the door.

214
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,310
402, dorm inspection.

215
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,350
What do we do?

216
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,710
Hurry.

217
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,950
No.

218
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,500
What's wrong?

219
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,710
Teddy.

220
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,310
Here.

221
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,260
More. Hurry.

222
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,710
401, open the door.

223
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,540
Dorm inspection.

224
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,900
Madam, wait. I'll be here soon.

225
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,230
Madam.

226
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
Is everyone here?

227
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,710
All here.

228
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,310
Chen Huan'er.

229
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
Madam, I'm here.

230
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,950
Dong Huixin.

231
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:06,740
Huang Lu.

232
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,430
Here.

233
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,500
Qiu Li.

234
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,500
Qiu Li isn't feeling well
and has fallen asleep.

235
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,700
Yes, she isn't feeling well.

236
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,190
(The slippers are arranged so neatly.)

237
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,620
(Could it be...)

238
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,740
Madam.

239
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,430
Qiu Li's asleep.

240
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,700
She isn't feeling well...

241
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,710
Qiu Li?

242
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,710
That's a major demerit for you.

243
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,140
403, dorm inspection.

244
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,950
Don't cry.

245
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,460
Be sad for a while.

246
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,000
We have no classes in the afternoon.

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,960
Qiu Li said
she was skipping the morning class.

248
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,740
No.

249
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,710
She was already marked

250
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,590
for staying out

251
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,590
all night last night.

252
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,740
Will she get picked again

253
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,160
during roll call today, right?

254
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,590
Don't jinx it.

255
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,990
Okay.

256
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,470
Roll call is starting.

257
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,540
Chen Huan'er.

258
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,590
Here.

259
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,780
Huang Lu.

260
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:52,780
Here.

261
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,310
Qiu Li.

262
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,590
Qiu Li.

263
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,830
Qiu Li.

264
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,540
Here.

265
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,190
Dong Huixin.

266
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,830
Dong Huixin.

267
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,070
Dong Huixin.

268
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,780
Is she absent?

269
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,830
I'll record it as an absence.

270
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,780
Liu Xiaoting.

271
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,070
Here.

272
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,900
Li Ying.

273
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,740
Here.

274
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,470
Chen Jing.

275
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,470
Here.

276
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,540
Yesterday, Qiu Li

277
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,140
was marked for staying out all night

278
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,700
because I didn't stay in the dorm.

279
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,310
I don't want to owe her a favor.

280
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,380
I answered the roll call for her today

281
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,660
as a way of repaying her.

282
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,070
You don't have to worry about

283
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,100
turning on the air conditioner
in the dorm anymore.

284
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,280
I have asked the counselor
to give me another dorm.

285
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,740
Dong Huixin.

286
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,020
We can discuss

287
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,310
this matter further.

288
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,140
No need.

289
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,780
Discussion won't produce any results.

290
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,470
Besides, my time is precious.

291
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,900
I don't want to waste it

292
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
on unimportant things.

293
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,740
Please open your books.

294
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,540
Turn to page 45.

295
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,620
Today, let's talk about...

296
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,470
There are really

297
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,020
all kinds of weirdos in universities.

298
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,710
It's a form of active learning.

299
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,710
It requires...

300
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,710
Thank you.

301
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,140
I didn't order too much, did I?

302
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,350
It's okay.

303
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,700
It won't make much of a difference.

304
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,710
Yes.

305
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,950
- Li.
- Hi.

306
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,830
Babes.

307
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,540
Take a look.

308
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,900
We just ordered.

309
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,580
Is there anything you want to eat?

310
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,260
We can order it.

311
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,380
You can handle the ordering.

312
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,470
Okay.

313
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:32,470
Thank you.

314
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,110
Here you go.

315
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,580
There are one good news
and two bad news.

316
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,740
Which do you want to hear first?

317
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,070
Bad news then.

318
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,780
Dong Huixin is moving out of the dorm.

319
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,830
Isn't that a good thing?

320
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,590
What about the other bad news?

321
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,540
The teacher called your name

322
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,140
in today's general elective class.

323
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,860
I'm that unlucky?

324
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,500
What's the good news?

325
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,240
Dong Huixin answered
the roll call for you.

326
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,950
She said she caused you to be marked
for staying out all night

327
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,420
and didn't want to owe you a favor.

328
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,860
Li.

329
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,470
I think you two

330
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,860
don't have to be so awkward.

331
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:14,860
It's fate

332
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,180
that we're assigned together.

333
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,780
How about we find a time

334
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,990
to discuss with Dong Huixin?

335
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,860
If she hadn't just turned off
the air conditioner

336
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,950
before consulting us,

337
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,820
I wouldn't have
picked a fight like this.

338
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,140
Besides, she's stubborn

339
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,110
and unsociable.

340
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,590
No one can persuade her.

341
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,590
Besides attending classes and sleeping,

342
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,990
can you find her?

343
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,230
Top...

344
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,380
Top...

345
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,900
Top Student.

346
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,780
Top Student.

347
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,110
We'll do it ourselves.

348
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,140
It's okay.

349
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:11,900
Waitress.

350
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,380
Come here.

351
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,140
Go ahead.

352
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,110
We can do it ourselves.

353
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,020
Hello.

354
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,620
What's wrong with your squid?

355
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,990
When did you get it?

356
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,310
It's not fresh.

357
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,540
Cancel it.

358
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,710
We'll pay and leave.

359
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,020
Sorry, Sir.

360
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,070
We just received this squid
this morning.

361
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,020
It must be fresh.

362
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,070
And you've finished it all.

363
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,070
There's no way for us to cancel it.

364
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,160
I can only know
whether it's fresh after eating it.

365
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,060
Can you settle this?

366
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,350
Call your store manager over.

367
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,820
If not, get the person in charge.

368
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,430
Sorry.

369
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,710
Our manager isn't around today.

370
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,710
I'm really sorry.

371
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,830
But you've almost finished eating.

372
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,990
There's no way

373
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,740
we can cancel it.

374
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,230
We're sorry too.

375
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,580
If you don't cancel this,
we won't leave.

376
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:51,990
Sir.

377
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,740
Enough, why are you arguing?

378
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,310
How could a grown man
like you bully a girl?

379
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,880
How much is it? I'll pay for it.

380
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,900
Yeah.

381
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,440
If it doesn't taste good, why eat it?

382
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:01,990
Your squid

383
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,260
only has tentacles left, alright?

384
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,540
That guy's still eating.

385
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,230
Put it down.

386
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,100
What a lousy place.

387
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,630
Wait.

388
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,100
Forget it.

389
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,150
Sorry. Well...

390
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,780
I'll pay the bill.

391
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,740
This way.

392
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,340
Why are you still eating? Let's go.

393
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,190
Sorry, everyone.

394
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:23,820
Well...

395
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,990
He suffered heartbreak today.

396
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,340
It's much cooler this way.

397
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,990
Sit down.

398
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,150
Top Student.

399
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,500
How about you don't move out?

400
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,500
Yeah, don't move out.

401
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
My application

402
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,860
has been handed over
to the counselor.

403
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,910
And you're all afraid of heat.

404
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,020
I better get another dorm.

405
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,580
Actually, I'm not that afraid of heat.

406
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,190
I'm just upset

407
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,740
that someone won't let me turn it on.

408
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,020
Yeah.

409
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,820
We're not that afraid of heat.

410
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,470
Turning the fan on feels the same.

411
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,950
I know you mean well.

412
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,340
But there's no need to force yourselves

413
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,190
for me.

414
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,710
It won't be fair.

415
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,100
How about this?

416
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,100
You get up early.

417
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,870
Help us

418
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,710
find a few good seats in advance.

419
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,990
This way,

420
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,140
the air conditioning fee
and the seat reservation fee

421
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,060
have offset each other.

422
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,870
Isn't that fair?

423
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,870
What do you think?

424
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,230
I have no objection.

425
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,470
I fully agree.

426
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,540
That might not be a good idea.

427
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,430
Top Student.

428
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,300
Please don't move out.

429
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,470
What will happen to our studies
if you move out?

430
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,710
Please, Top Student.

431
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
Please.

432
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,950
Please.

433
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,540
We're counting on you.

434
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,430
Please.

435
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,150
Here.

436
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,340
Alright.

437
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,020
Thank you, Top Student.

438
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,950
Top Student.

439
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,230
Talk to us.

440
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,260
You're

441
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,780
always studying.

442
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,400
Have you ever been in a relationship?

443
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,190
How many times?

444
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,740
Why are you asking such questions?

445
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,150
We're roommates.

446
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,430
We even took showers together.

447
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,020
What's wrong with me gossiping?

448
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,020
I never took showers with you.

449
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,630
We'll take showers together soon.

450
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,230
Close the door!

451
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,540
Wait.

452
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,990
You...

453
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,710
Hurry up.

454
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:24,820
Make the call.

455
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,660
Are you going to call?

456
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,220
Call him.

457
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,780
Make the call.

458
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,580
It's too late today.

459
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,390
I'll call tomorrow.

460
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
You're not going to call?

461
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,060
Take it off!

462
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,630
I'm a good woman!

463
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,240
It's too late to say anything now.

464
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,190
I like good women.

465
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,390
Search for her phone!

466
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,470
(That night,)

467
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,630
(Dorm 401)

468
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,340
(is finally all here)

469
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,660
(during non-sleeping hours.)

470
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,540
(We rearranged the seniority)

471
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,910
(according to age.)

472
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,150
(Huixin)

473
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,300
(is the oldest.)

474
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,990
(Little Princess Qiu Li)

475
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,630
(claimed being the second oldest
with a look of disdain.)

476
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,920
(It's a ranking that combines)

477
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,430
(all kinds of weird imaginations.)

478
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,340
(Lu became)

479
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,100
(the plain third oldest Huang.)

480
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,430
(And I)

481
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
(became the youngest)

482
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,390
(who was always bullied)

483
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,020
(and had to admit their seniority.)

484
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,870
(Four years is a long time.)

485
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,390
(But I believe)

486
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,710
(tomorrow will be)

487
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,060
(a beautiful day.)

488
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,060
I brought breakfast for everyone.

489
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,340
Where's everyone?

490
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,500
My dears.

491
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,500
I brought you...

492
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
I bought breakfast too.

493
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,780
Coming.

494
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,100
Let's eat soup dumplings!

495
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
Eat...

496
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,740
You all bought food.

497
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,910
What should we do?

498
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,190
I'm trying to lose weight.

499
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,190
Don't eat then.

500
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,470
Eat.

501
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,470
Alright.

502
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,340
Give it to me.

503
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,460
Give me the deep-fried dough sticks.

504
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,820
Wontons.

505
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,150
Huan'er.

506
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,100
I know you've been tired from training,

507
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,630
but

508
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,260
isn't eating so much a bit...

509
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,820
Don't worry. They won't go to waste.

510
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,990
If I can't finish it,

511
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,520
I'll give it to Dahuang downstairs.

512
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,710
I got to go. Bye.

513
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,710
Dahuang?

514
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,870
Isn't feeding them to a dog

515
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,740
a bit wasteful?

516
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,990
It's definitely not for the dog.

517
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,190
It's complicated.

518
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,150
Let's eat.

519
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,340
You didn't poison the food, did you?

520
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:46,950
Yes, I did.

521
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,990
Don't eat it.

522
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,500
Why did you suddenly remember

523
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,760
to bring me breakfast?

524
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,420
You seem to be in a good mood today.

525
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,870
Because today

526
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,990
is the day of reconciliation.

527
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,340
Are you still thinking about us?

528
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,960
Bringing up the past

529
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,880
is not a good habit.

530
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,060
I'm not talking about you.

531
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,990
(Has Dahuang eaten?)

532
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,990
(Yes, he enjoyed it.)

533
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,190
Eat more.

534
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,280
I'll finish soon.

535
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,520
I'll practice with you later.

536
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,020
It's okay. You can eat first.

537
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,100
You're using your power
for personal gain.

538
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,500
If you're upset, come at me.

539
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,300
Lin, Du Wei.

540
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,740
Due to the limited duration
of the party,

541
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,540
the preparatory team
decided at the meeting...

542
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
What preparatory team?

543
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,120
Isn't it just your dictatorship
as the head of Arts Department?

544
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,320
Sports Department's performance
can't go on.

545
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,430
You've worked hard
to rehearse these days.

546
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,190
No.

547
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,340
What do you mean it can't go on?

548
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,740
The others have put in a lot of work.

549
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
Do you think just saying
"You've worked hard"

550
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,580
is enough?

551
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,720
It doesn't matter whether it can go on.

552
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,300
We need an explanation.

553
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,900
Your traditional martial arts
is a bit old-fashioned.

554
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,870
In terms of the party's entertainment,

555
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,580
students prefer
street dance performances

556
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,500
and skits.

557
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,780
From a spiritual perspective,

558
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,440
traditional Chinese
music performances

559
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,820
and poetry recitations will
allow the students to gain more.

560
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,910
Arts Department

561
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,480
lacks manpower for their performance.

562
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,190
Since Sports Department
isn't participating,

563
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,540
send us some helpers.

564
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,430
Jing Xichi.

565
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,500
Come with me.

566
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,580
No.

567
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,500
This party is a joint performance
of all departments

568
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,440
of Student Council.

569
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,880
Are you sure that no one
from Sports Department will be joining?

570
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,960
Do you want me
to report to the president?

571
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,060
Jing.

572
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,260
Go.

573
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,240
Just think of it as doing me a favor.

574
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,500
Why don't you go?

575
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,630
I don't have

576
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,950
anything to do now anyway.

577
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,390
Huan'er.

578
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,340
If there's a big opportunity,

579
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,020
will you take it?

580
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,500
I gave it more thought.

581
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,780
We must continue

582
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,480
our martial arts performance.

583
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,340
Didn't Du Wei say

584
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,800
that our performances are outdated,

585
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,390
impractical,

586
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,190
and unentertaining?

587
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,580
We'll put on

588
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,710
a good performance.

589
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,820
I've thought of the time and place.

590
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,320
We'll do it at the same time as hers

591
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,630
on the day of the party.

592
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,220
We've been canceled for three years.

593
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,710
Well...

594
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,430
Lin.

595
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,870
Do you have

596
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,340
any specific ideas?

597
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,460
What did you say?

598
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,190
Ideas.

599
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,760
I was planning to let you handle this.

600
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,060
Me?

601
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,540
Yes.

602
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,950
I can't do it.

603
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,580
You can do it.

604
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,150
I really can't.

605
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,910
You really can.

606
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,630
How about this?

607
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,950
I'll gather everyone together

608
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,990
to think of another way.

609
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,100
No.

610
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,910
Don't text yet.

611
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,910
Listen to me.

612
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,340
I think

613
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,260
you can do this alone.

614
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,740
You're different from others.

615
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,710
I have high hopes for you.

616
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,780
You have potential.

617
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,240
You're hardworking and perseverant.

618
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,260
Unlike those idiots
who only grow in size

619
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,260
but not in brains.

620
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,820
Just give me a clear answer.

621
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,880
Are you confident
in making Sports Department

622
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,320
bigger, stronger, and more successful?

623
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,900
Yes.

624
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:13,710
I guess?

625
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,150
Don't guess.

626
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,470
I will support you.

627
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,340
Lin, I...

628
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,340
It's settled then.

629
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,300
Huan'er.

630
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,630
Don't tell anyone else in the department

631
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,580
about this first.

632
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,710
(Is this the real reason)

633
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,710
(why Lin doesn't want)

634
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,260
(everyone to be involved?)

635
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,580
(Rehearsal Hall 1)

636
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,390
Let me show you this.

637
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,820
Due to the party,

638
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,470
everyone will book

639
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,430
rehearsal rooms often.

640
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,540
So I'll leave this to you.

641
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,580
Pay attention

642
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,580
to booking matters.

643
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,150
It's not allowed to smoke inside.

644
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,150
Keep it clean.

645
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,380
Enough, stop messing around.

646
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,710
You two.

647
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,870
Take a look at this together.

648
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,820
Okay, sure.

649
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:07,910
Yang.

650
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:08,870
Du Wei.

651
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,900
I'll take care of this.

652
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,500
Sure.

653
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,150
Jing.

654
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,180
The costumes department
is extremely busy.

655
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,100
They want me to help measure sizes.

656
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
You don't mind, do you?

657
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,190
Du Wei.

658
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,780
How about we

659
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,390
have a chat?

660
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,950
Go ahead.

661
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,820
Maybe

662
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,780
martial arts is traditional

663
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,100
and outdated to you.

664
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,020
But

665
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,780
you shouldn't easily deny

666
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,950
Chen Huan'er's efforts.

667
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,100
Chen Huan'er learned

668
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,400
her martial arts from her father.

669
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,540
Her father

670
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,870
led teams to compete

671
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,500
locally and abroad for years

672
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,470
for national honor.

673
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,390
To Chen Huan'er

674
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,390
and Uncle Chen,

675
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,150
martial arts is life

676
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,020
and honor.

677
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,340
Maybe it was

678
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,880
just a casual remark this morning.

679
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,990
But the harm you caused to others

680
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,300
is unforgettable.

681
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,300
How annoying!

682
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,100
How is martial arts outdated?

683
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
Why don't people like it?

684
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,920
I think martial arts is pretty good.

685
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,340
Is she drunk?

686
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,230
It's even scarier than being drunk.

687
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,990
Her show was canceled.

688
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,740
She lost her mind completely.

689
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,540
Huan'er.

690
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,060
Chen Huan'er.

691
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Don't be upset.

692
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,990
I asked around for you.

693
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,150
The cancellation

694
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,990
of your show

695
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,870
has nothing

696
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,060
to do with you.

697
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,100
It's purely a personal grudge

698
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,100
between Du Wei and Lin.

699
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,700
I can't believe
the head of your department.

700
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,520
He doesn't have the guts
to confront his ex

701
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,820
and push out a girl like you.

702
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,100
Ex?

703
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,190
Is this Jing of School
of Computer Science?

704
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,560
Du Wei's intention isn't pure
when she assigns him

705
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,440
to be the host.

706
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,740
Poor Lin.

707
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,950
He still hasn't gotten over
the heartbreak.

708
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Yeah.

709
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,540
Lin and Du Wei?

710
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,580
I don't know.

711
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,990
Lin was the male host

712
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,190
of the welcoming party
for Du Wei's batch.

713
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,500
Du Wei is known as a gentle dagger.

714
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:08,990
Then,

715
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,500
isn't the male partner

716
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,780
Du Wei chose today

717
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,230
Jing Xichi?

718
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,300
Your classmate is in danger.

719
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,150
Forget it.

720
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,190
I'd better think about myself first.

721
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,230
What kind of show

722
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,820
should I make?

723
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,060
What show?

724
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,540
I just checked the statistics.

725
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,390
Some women experience
unwanted sexual contact

726
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,950
or sexual contact in public places

727
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,820
before the age of 21.

728
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,860
It's what's commonly known
as sexual harassment.

729
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,950
Only one in eight women

730
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,020
who were harassed

731
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,190
dared to report the case.

732
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,580
In other words,

733
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,780
there are at least seven hidden cases

734
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,710
behind every sexual harassment case.

735
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,150
Most women
who encounter similar situations

736
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,080
tend to keep quiet
because of the victim blaming

737
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,420
and the huge physical difference

738
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,740
between men and women.

739
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,150
Just like

740
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:08,940
many waitresses

741
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,040
I met in the restaurant.

742
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,500
So Huan'er...

743
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,710
I think

744
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,230
you don't need to worry

745
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,940
about whether martial arts is outdated,

746
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,080
unentertaining, or pointless.

747
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,230
As long as someone needs it,

748
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,820
martial arts that represent justice

749
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,630
will always
have its audience and market.

750
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,430
I want to do a show

751
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,870
about women's self-defense.

752
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,150
This is a good idea.

753
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,230
Right?

754
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,500
Ms. Dong Huixin.

755
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,540
Are you willing to be

756
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,740
the first person to try out

757
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,470
my women's self-defense show?

758
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,260
Of course.

759
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,190
Let us wish Ms. Chen Huan'er

760
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,620
luck in expanding and strengthening

761
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,020
the women's self-defense event!

762
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,950
Achieve greater glory!

763
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,470
Okay.

764
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,430
Amazing.

765
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,300
Huan'er.

766
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,340
You're really

767
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,760
Sports Department's lucky charm.

768
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,780
Three years...

769
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,300
In the past three years,

770
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,710
Du Wei has been tyrannizing
unscrupulously treating,

771
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,150
ruthlessly destroying,

772
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,540
and irresponsibly abandoning

773
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,910
Sports Department.

774
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,300
Looks like

775
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,060
what Qiu Li said is true.

776
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,740
Lin...

777
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,150
Lin.

778
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,390
That monkey...

779
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,540
That monkey is mine.

780
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,990
Sorry.

781
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,150
I'll call the president

782
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,710
now.

783
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,540
Stop crying, Babe.

784
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,500
President.

785
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,990
It's me, Lin.

786
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,910
How did it go?

787
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,230
The president said

788
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,710
we would have full support

789
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,820
and asked us to do well.

790
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,710
The president
seems to have hung up on you.

791
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,180
The president definitely hung up on him.

792
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,500
What's going on with you two?

793
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,190
Huan'er.

794
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,700
You must believe in yourself.

795
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,100
Even if we don't have funds,

796
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,830
we can also

797
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,430
get this done.

798
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,920
No, we can't do it without the funds.

799
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,700
I don't even have a venue.

800
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,500
Isn't it just a venue?

801
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,440
It's a small issue.

802
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,260
I'll fix it.

803
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,140
What's wrong?

804
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,020
You don't trust me?

805
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,000
Just wait and see.

806
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:29,950
He...

807
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,540
We're here.

808
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,780
(Wuan University Wrestling Club)

809
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:40,580
Lin.

810
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,990
How did you find this place?

811
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,830
As the head of Sports Department,

812
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,990
I have some resources.

813
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,350
It feels like

814
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,760
there's no one in this building.

815
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,830
Isn't it a bit deserted?

816
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,180
Is it deserted?

817
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,060
I think it's okay.

818
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,910
It's mainly because the venue's good.

819
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,540
Check it out.

820
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,640
What do you think?

821
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,500
Come in and take a look.

822
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,990
This is Wrestling Club's

823
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,400
training ground.

824
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,520
It might not look like much now.

825
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,500
At least

826
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,750
the basics are good.

827
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,100
How come it's now a warehouse?

828
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
The Wrestling Club no longer needs it?

829
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,870
Wrestling Club?

830
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,700
Wrestling Club

831
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,870
was dissolved.

832
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,620
Could it be because

833
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,820
you have to walk two miles

834
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,880
for every training session?

835
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,700
Of course not.

836
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,700
Come to think of it, it's all my fault.

837
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,870
I didn't protect Wrestling Club well.

838
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,100
Since I became

839
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,340
the head of Sports Department,

840
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,100
Du Wei...

841
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,470
Sports Department's activities

842
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,580
keep getting suppressed.

843
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,990
That's why

844
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
Sports Department's

845
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,140
obscured past glory must be restored

846
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,700
by me and you.

847
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,220
Restored by us?

848
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,620
It must be restored by us.

849
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,140
Lin.

850
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,990
Why don't you clean the floor first?

851
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,870
Huan'er, here's the thing.

852
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,140
I have a meeting soon.

853
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,700
You can clean up first.

854
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,920
I'll help you when I'm free.

855
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,560
Lin.

856
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,470
Didn't you say you'll support me?

857
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,620
Emotional support

858
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,880
is also a kind of support.

859
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,820
Good luck. Work hard.

860
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,700
I believe in you.

861
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,430
No.

862
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,580
Women's self-defense.

863
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,200
If you're interested,
learn more about it.

864
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,100
(Club Recruitment)
Guys also need

865
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,310
to learn some self-defense.

866
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,180
Women's self-defense.

867
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,500
If you're interested,
learn more.

868
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,300
Here's the location.

869
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,160
If you have any questions,
you can call me.

870
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,860
Women's self-defense.

871
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,700
You must

872
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
come and check it out.

873
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,900
Women's self-defense.

874
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,640
(Club Recruitment)
Be your own bodyguard.

875
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,620
Tian Chi.

876
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,470
Women's Self-Defense Interest Group?

877
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,100
Yes.

878
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,580
Are you interested?

879
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,840
It's one of Sports Department's
activities.

880
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,870
Not bad.

881
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,320
It's just that your flyer's design is...

882
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,740
(Women's Self-Defense Interest Group)

883
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,500
What's wrong with the flyer?

884
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,830
It won't attract people.

885
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,220
Do you need help?

886
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,220
We don't have the funds to pay you.

887
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,280
I'll help you design it

888
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,910
for free.

889
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,790
We really need free stuff.

890
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,270
Tian Chi, you know how to design things?

891
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,720
I know a bit about it.

892
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,640
I'm in External Relations Department.

893
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,750
I can help you get some sponsorship.

894
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,600
Isn't it a bit inappropriate?

895
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,750
It's every bit appropriate.

896
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,500
It's inappropriate.

897
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,790
It's free labor.

898
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,580
Don't waste it.

899
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,500
Don't mention it.

900
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,040
I want to do my part too.

901
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,100
Can you

902
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,430
take me to your venue

903
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,500
for a tour?

904
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,990
Well...

905
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,310
Tian Chi.

906
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,620
Can you promise me something
before you go?

907
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,220
Whether it's poor

908
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,140
or shabby,

909
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,700
crowded

910
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,180
or simple...

911
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,310
You won't run away.

912
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,430
Okay?

913
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,700
Okay.

914
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:16,620
Sure.

915
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,750
Tian Chi, this way.

916
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,790
This way.

917
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,750
This way, Tian Chi.

918
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,540
Go.

919
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,270
This way.

920
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,020
Fall in October

921
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,980
is a season of sowing hope

922
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,430
and heralding harvest.

923
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,390
We're here to welcome

924
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,470
Wuan University's

925
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,180
2010 welcome party.

926
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,990
I've experienced
ignoring the outside world

927
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,750
and focusing on my studies...

928
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,350
Do we need to take all these?

929
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,700
Yes, I think so.

930
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,540
Here.

931
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,180
No. 5 Chen Huan'er comes on stage.

932
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,390
Really?

933
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,470
No.

934
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,140
Pure and innocent eyes...

935
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,180
Take my punch.

936
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,140
It's a unique beautiful part

937
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,910
of the student era...

938
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Tian Chi, hit me.

939
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,540
How dare you fight back?

940
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,350
You've all worked hard.

941
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,620
Du Wei bought everyone drinks.

942
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,620
Take a break.

943
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,350
(What are you doing later?)

944
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,060
How's your memorization
of the hosting script?

945
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,140
Shall we rehearse?

946
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:36,910
Sure.

947
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,700
Thank you.

948
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,560
The footsteps of youth
are like flowing clouds and water.

949
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,540
The years of youth

950
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,950
can't afford any waste.

951
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,470
Love hard

952
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,140
regardless of success or failure.

953
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,910
Love hard

954
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,180
regardless of success or failure.

955
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,270
Go.

956
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:57,750
Go.

957
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,310
Go.

958
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:05,870
Jing.

959
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,270
I went to watch your match

960
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,600
with Exchange Students Department

961
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,310
a few days ago.

962
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,750
Did you try to pursue

963
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,940
a professional path before?

964
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,430
It was a long time ago.

965
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:17,910
Were you injured?

966
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,950
Do you still have

967
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,100
any regrets?

968
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,500
No.

969
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,950
Computer science is pretty good.

970
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,700
People should always look forward.

971
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,950
We can't dwell on the past.

972
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,470
Can you

973
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,180
really let go of the past?

974
00:40:55,741 --> 00:40:56,620
(Wuan University)

975
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,180
Here. Put it here.

976
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,270
Here, let me.

977
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,620
Finally, we're almost done cleaning up.

978
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,020
You all worked hard today.

979
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,830
Thank you.

980
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,520
It's a small favor. Don't mention it.

981
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,060
I'm awesome.

982
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,500
Yeah.

983
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,950
What would I do without you?

984
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,750
My cutie.

985
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,700
My Lu.

986
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,540
Enough chatting.

987
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,540
I have a movie date.

988
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,220
I got to go.

989
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,060
Okay.

990
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,830
Go ahead.

991
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,700
Bye.

992
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,500
Thanks, bye.

993
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,390
Tian Chi.

994
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,100
Do you want to go have a meal too?

995
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,750
Shall we go to the cafeteria

996
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,580
to eat together?

997
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,100
I'm not going.

998
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,860
The round trip will take half an hour.

999
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,580
I can leave
as soon as I clean this place.

1000
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,140
Sure.

1001
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,270
Thank you.

1002
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,390
9527.

1003
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,940
Your family came to visit you.

1004
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,180
Would you
like to have some spicy chicken stew?

1005
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,100
How come you're here?

1006
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,910
I'm afraid that you'll starve
to death in this deserted place.

1007
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,200
I came here to bring you a meal.

1008
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,990
Don't you have to rehearse today?

1009
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,060
I found time to come and see

1010
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,680
how your event preparations are going.

1011
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,080
Why are you alone? What about
the rest of Sports Department?

1012
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,220
I was the only one to begin with.

1013
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,790
Is there anything else

1014
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,940
you need my help with?

1015
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:13,790
No.

1016
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,020
Tian Chi helped me

1017
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,580
with the sponsorships and posters.

1018
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,100
He also helped me

1019
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,180
put up the signpost.

1020
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,910
I just don't know

1021
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,390
how many people will come.

1022
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,310
Don't bother others

1023
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,860
with this kind of thing in the future.

1024
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,060
They're all favors.

1025
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,390
How are you going to repay them?

1026
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,310
I'll buy them a meal.

1027
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,310
What else?

1028
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,470
Are you planning

1029
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,100
to treat him to a meal alone?

1030
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,470
No.

1031
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,140
Huang Lu also helped me a lot.

1032
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,720
I'll treat them to a meal together.

1033
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,470
Alright.

1034
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:48,910
Alright.

1035
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,540
I think I grew up overnight

1036
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,220
after entering university.

1037
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,060
It's time to face my life

1038
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,020
independently.

1039
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,060
Independently?

1040
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,140
I promised your parents

1041
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,320
to take good care of you.

1042
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,270
What do you need?

1043
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,220
Tell me now.

1044
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,540
You're the host now.

1045
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,830
How can you take care of me?

1046
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,540
You're prioritizing women over friends.

1047
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:10,830
Didn't you

1048
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,700
ask me to do it?

1049
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:14,990
Yeah.

1050
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,140
Have you decided on the time

1051
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:21,870
for that event?

1052
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,620
Yes.

1053
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,910
It's the same day

1054
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,910
as your welcome party.

1055
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,800
We're starting
half an hour later than you.

1056
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,430
Half an hour later?

1057
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,430
Okay.

1058
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,350
Okay?

1059
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,220
I'll come over

1060
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,420
and be your punching bag.

1061
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,180
Don't you need to host?

1062
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,100
Don't worry about it.

1063
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,360
How can you make it in time?

1064
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:42,990
I can.

1065
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,870
Tian Chi.

1066
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,180
Didn't you go home?

1067
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,390
I'm afraid you'll stay
too late and skip a meal.

1068
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,220
I thought I'd buy you something to eat.

1069
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:02,990
I...

1070
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,220
Let me thank you

1071
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,220
for Huan'er.

1072
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,180
How thoughtful.

1073
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,700
But it's not a good idea

1074
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,350
to eat fried food at night.

1075
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,500
You'll gain weight easily.

1076
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,470
And it's unhealthy.

1077
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,990
I'll accept it for Huan'er.

1078
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,910
Thank you, Tian Chi.

1079
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,470
Is there

1080
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,620
anything else you need?

1081
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,370
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

1082
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,100
There's a stool.

1083
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,380
Move it here and eat with us.

1084
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:32,700
I have something to do. Bye.

1085
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,540
Sit down and eat something.

1086
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:35,540
Tian Chi.

1087
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,420
What's the hurry?

1088
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:42,500
No, well...

1089
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,870
Fried food is bad.

1090
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,180
It'll make you gain weight, get acne,

1091
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,380
and is bad for your health.
