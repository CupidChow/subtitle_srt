16
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,250
It's alright.

17
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,890
Song Cong is fine.

18
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,580
I would feel so guilty otherwise.

19
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,890
Alright, Miss customer.

20
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,900
Since you've come
to have your fortune told,

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,260
what do you intend to pay me?

22
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,609
Didn't you ask me to come here?

23
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,090
I didn't want my fortune told.

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,240
Since you are here,
just let me see your fortune.

25
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,490
I don't ask for much.

26
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,700
Just give me some information.

27
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,860
Okay, go ahead.

28
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,099
Other than Salinger, which authors

29
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,860
do Jing Xichi like?

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,650
Salinger?

31
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,260
Have you forgotten?

32
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,939
The book he bookcrossed was

33
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,539
The Catcher in the Rye.

34
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,090
That's Salinger's book.

35
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,889
That wasn't his book.

36
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,449
It was Song Cong's.

37
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,020
He just helped to pass it on.

38
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,979
Xinyan,

39
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,930
did you think it was Jing Xichi's book?

40
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,890
Never mind.

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,569
What else does Jing Xichi like

42
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,740
other than playing football?

43
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,860
Other than football?

44
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,460
He seems to only like football.

45
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,700
He likes Maradona.

46
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,330
He's also always hungry.

47
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,860
But he's quite a righteous person.

48
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,370
The more I hear about him,
the more he seems like a good guy.

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,569
Continue.

50
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,420
That's everything I know.

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,490
What's wrong, Xinyan?

52
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,169
Why are you so interested

53
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,490
in Jing Xichi?

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,330
No reason. Keep quiet.

55
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,540
Take a deep breath.

56
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,419
With your intuition,

57
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,980
choose a card.

58
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,300
Choose one.

59
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,300
This one.

60
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,490
This one.

61
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,540
Can I open my eyes yet?

62
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,460
Yes.

63
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,490
Hermit.

64
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,260
It means

65
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,699
he is an

66
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,580
extremely idealistic person.

67
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,859
Although

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,539
on the surface,

69
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,930
you two seem to be very different,

70
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,099
in fact,

71
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,420
your souls are deeply in sync.

72
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,490
Song Cong is your perfect match.

73
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,810
Song Cong?

74
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,280
Xinyan, why are you
having these weird thoughts?

75
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,650
OK, I'm weird.

76
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,419
But I am right, aren't I?

77
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,009
No.

78
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,219
Song Cong and I are friends.

79
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,979
Sure.

80
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,609
Of course, you are friends.

81
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:10,979
Yes.

82
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,819
This is the classic

83
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,939
"I have a friend" story.

84
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,810
Don't worry, I understand everything.

85
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,289
Okay, next.

86
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,220
Du Man.

87
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,370
Du Man.

88
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,049
No, thanks.

89
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,419
If you keep reading here,

90
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,219
you'll go blind.

91
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,049
Du Man.

92
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,130
Come here.

93
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,900
Come, let's go.

94
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,809
- No.
- Come on.

95
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,420
Come here.

96
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,040
I don't need it.

97
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,860
Let me tell you your fortune.
Your academics.

98
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,899
I don't need it, really.

99
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,010
Let's try it out together.

100
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,570
Here.

101
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,570
Follow your intuition.

102
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:40,689
From here...

103
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,979
Which room isn't asleep yet?

104
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,450
Why are you still making noise?

105
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,250
The lights.

106
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,249
Has she left?

107
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,129
She left.

108
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,780
I don't think she found out, did she?

109
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,690
Song.

110
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,489
Why are you

111
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,010
acting weird lately?

112
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,810
Why do you say so?

113
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,130
Are you

114
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,860
avoiding Chen Huan'er today?

115
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,220
No.

116
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,540
Jing Xichi.

117
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,129
Can you stop

118
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,859
being a loudspeaker

119
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,370
and broadcasting everything?

120
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,610
Go to bed quickly.

121
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,100
I think you have recovered. Seriously.

122
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,610
(Base Office)

123
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,340
Song Cong.

124
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,680
Do you want to give your parents

125
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,249
a phone call?

126
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,860
Do you want to ask them to come see you?

127
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,800
I'm fine, Mr. Xu.

128
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,180
I don't need to go home earlier.

129
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,249
Are you sure?

130
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,250
Yes.

131
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,130
That's great.

132
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,570
By the way, Song Cong,

133
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,539
in the next extracurricular activity,

134
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,219
you must pay attention to your diet.

135
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,489
Take care of your stomach.

136
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,300
Okay.

137
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,489
I'll excuse myself.

138
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,929
Okay, go.

139
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,810
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

140
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Song Cong.

141
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,340
I didn't see you earlier.

142
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,900
Are you feeling alright?

143
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,740
I'm okay.

144
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,100
You...

145
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,859
Are you, Huan'er, and Xichi,

146
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,169
alright lately?

147
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,540
I haven't been in contact
with you guys for a long time.

148
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,610
We're pretty good.

149
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,050
It's raining quite heavily.

150
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,979
Why don't I

151
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,370
walk with you for a bit?

152
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,490
Sure.

153
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,660
Let me do it.

154
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,060
(Agricultural Education Base)

155
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,690
Slow down.

156
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:24,980
Oh, right.

157
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,899
I just reported to the homeroom teacher

158
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,780
that our class
will hold a bonfire party.

159
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,540
I am going to do a performance.

160
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,540
If you have the time, come and see me.

161
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,930
If the rain stops, that is.

162
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,690
Sure.

163
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,419
(I wondered why Song)

164
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,420
(deliberately avoiding Chen Huan'er.)

165
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,370
(Hold on.)

166
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,690
(If then...)

167
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,050
(Isn't Huan'er...?)

168
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,129
You weren't invited.

169
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,979
Why are you here?

170
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,459
Didn't you also come uninvited?

171
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,360
Quick, it's starting.

172
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,050
It's starting.

173
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,540
Hello, everyone.

174
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,609
I'm going to sing a song.

175
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,579
This is a song

176
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,330
I heard by chance

177
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,380
on my birthday.

178
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,810
I only found out later

179
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,420
that a friend of mine
likes this song very much.

180
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,939
Maybe my singing isn't good,

181
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,299
and my guitar might be off-tune,

182
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,210
but I still want to dedicate this song

183
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,540
to that person,

184
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,260
the friend I've always admired.

185
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,930
I hope

186
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,140
we will never have to say goodbye.

187
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,050

188
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,330

193
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,780
This song is pretty good.

194
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,850
Right?

195
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,850
Song listens to it every day.

196

Your test scores have improved a lot.

197
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,180
Is it thanks to Song Cong?

198
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,500
Can I join your tutoring sessions?

199
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,020
Liao Xinyan.

200
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,979
As the monitor,

201
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,730
how can you
be the first to spread rumors?

202
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,489
So,

203
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,210
there is nothing between you two,

204
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,330
right?

205
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,970
Why do you care about him so much?

206
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,450
No, I don't.

207
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,210
Thank you for tutoring me.

208
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,930
Isn't this Song Cong's writing?

209
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,660

The girl next door asked me
to join her for a meal.

231
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,140
I'm leaving.

232
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,450
Wait up.

233
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,690
Then I'm leaving as well. Bye-bye.

234
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,930
Thank you for coming.

235
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,330
It's no big deal.

236
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,339
The song I just sang

237
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,769
is your favorite,

238
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,620
isn't it?

239
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,299
Well,

240
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,180
I don't really like it that much.

241
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,050
I just think it sounds pretty good.

242
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,810
Qi Qi,

243
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,450
I can actually see

244
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,369
that you missed the time

245
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,090
back when we were freshmen.

246
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,939
If you have the time,

247
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,500
we can meet up more often.

248
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,210
We are all still good friends.

249
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,620
Just like before.

250
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,180
But,

251
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,380
after going to another class,

252
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,900
I realized that time and distance

253
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,090
can really change people.

254
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,500
That's why, reminiscing the past

255
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,660
is quite a challenge

256
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,140
to me.

257
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,970
Didn't you go with Xinyan?

258
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,180
I did.

259
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,730
Liar.

260
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,050
What are you doing?

261
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,369
Isn't this prohibited?

262
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,900
Do you want to eat it or not?

263
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,050
Hold on.

264
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,210
You are suspiciously generous.

265
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,050
What do you want?

266
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,540
Chen Huan'er,

267
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,620
actually, these things
you've experienced,

268
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,930
I've experienced too.

269
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,140
Really?

270
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,690
It's okay.

271
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,380
It will all pass.

272
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,649
It's true.

273
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,649
I think cases like this

274
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,939
take time to solve.

275
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,620
Yes.

276
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,780
It's fine.

277
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,529
What the heck?

278
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,489
I'm here to comfort you.

279
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,020
Why are you comforting me instead?

280
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,140
Seriously.

281
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,339
You want to comfort me?

282
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,730
What for?

283
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,090
Song

284
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,970
is slightly

285
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,450
callous.

286
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,900
Right? Callous.

287
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,420
But

288
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,900
he is quite approachable.

289
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,020
For real?

290
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,450
Did you think that Song and I...?

291
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,369
Jing Xichi!

292
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,900
You have been around Xinyan
for too long. What are you thinking?

293
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,459
Song and I

294
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,660
are

295
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,050
pure revolutionary comrades.

296
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,620
We are both good students
who study hard. Alright?

297
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,020
But why do you care about him so much?

298
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,099
He ate my food

299
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,059
and got diarrhea.

300
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,600
Shouldn't I at least be concerned?

301
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,409
That's it?

302
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,380
That's it.

303
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,660
Really?

304
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,250
Yes.

305
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,010
Liao Xinyan!

306
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,180
She is too misleading.

307
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,580
I think so too.

308
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,579
Stop eating then.

309
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,579
You don't need it anyway.

310
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,209
You have so much. Just give me a little.

311
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,380
Leave some for Song tonight.

312
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,500
You don't want to give it to me, do you?

313
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,210
Here you go, I'm just kidding.

314
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,380
What's on your mind?

315
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,770
Girl stuff.

316
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,450
What kind of girl stuff?

317
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,409
Don't guess a girl's mind.

318
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,220
I'll understand it
if you'd just tell me.

319
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,369
I don't want to tell you.

320
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,420
Why?

321
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,499
Why should I tell you?

322
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,520
I'll never know if you don't tell me.
Just tell me.

323
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,860
Why should I tell you?

324
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,819
Come on.

325
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
I don't want to.

326
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,420
Then give it to me.

327
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,860
I can't take you seriously.

328
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,649
Seriously.

329
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,210
You're bullying me.

330
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,340
Hey, what are you doing?

331
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,019
It's almost lights out.

332
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,520
Why are you still loitering?

333
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,819
I...

334
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,740
Get back to your dorm
and sleep early, okay?

335
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,730
I'll send you back.

336
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,090
Are you giving it to me or not?

337
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,209
I won't eat it anymore.

338
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,450
Here, a candy for you.

339
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,860
Hey, you!

340
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,380
Song.

341
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,620
Song.

342
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,449
Get up, and have some snacks, Song.

343
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,490
Get up.

344
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,820
Song.

345
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,060
Are you asleep?

346
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,580
Song, is learning agriculture tiring?

347
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,580
No.

348
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,450
Li Tian.

349
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,290
To the next batch of underclassmen,

350
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,560
do you have any suggestions
on learning agriculture?

351
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,930
Be sure to bring some snacks yourself.

352
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,739
Never overestimate

353
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,620
your schoolmate's cooking.

354
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,449
I suggest you read more books.

355
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,420
Or you'll take the exam
right after you go back.

356
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,740
You will die miserably.

357
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,099
I suggest everyone

358
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,499
look for someone
to record this on the phone

359
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,620
and save this memory.

360
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,900
Chen Huan'er.

361
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,540
After studying agriculture this time,

362
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,580
how do you feel?

363
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,969
I feel like

364
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,820
it's great to be together
with everyone.

365
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,010
Are there any unforgettable moments?

366
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,210
Sweet potato root.

367
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,330
Sweet potato root.

368
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,690
Other than sweet potato roots?

369
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,819
There's also you giving half
of your snacks to Song Cong.

370
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,739
I didn't.

371
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,889
Yes, you did.

372
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,780
Shouldn't good friends
share the good stuff

373
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,730
among themselves?

374
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,380
I thought you only gave it to...

375
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,000
What are you embarrassed of?

376
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,100
I'm not!

377
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,209
Okay.

378
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,129
Do you have anything

379
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,660
to say to the next batch
of underclassmen?

380
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,490
I hope everyone

381
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,420
won't cut their hands
when digging wild vegetables.

382
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,420
They won't dig wild vegetables.

383
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,609
I also hope

384
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,779
when everybody is cooking,

385
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,299
they must differentiate
the type of vegetables.

386
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,859
I hope your cooking

387
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,620
won't give you diarrhea.

388
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,169
The thing that's most memorable to me

389
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,060
is don't eat Chen Huan'er's dishes.

390
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,539
Can you not mention this?

391
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,129
Isn't my cooking delicious?

392
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,680
You usually eat a lot of my dishes.

393
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,060
Then why did he have diarrhea?

394
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,739
Who knows?

395
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,490
Maybe his stomach
was sick to begin with.

396
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,609
Didn't I also give him the medicine?

397
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,770
That sweet potato root.

398
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:09,929
Yes.

399
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,169
So you know about it.

400
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,920
It's sweet potato,
not sweet potato root.

401
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,059
Can you stay away from me,
Chen Huan'er?

402
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,299
You keep filming my nostrils.

403
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,299
Stop filming like that.

404
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,240
Don't crawl around.

405
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,640
Chen Huan'er, I'm leaving.

406
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,299
(But now, the thing I remember)

407
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,140
(wasn't our thoughts
that were flying around.)

408
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,499
(I remember the smell
of the bonfire that night.)

409
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,140
(The warmth of the people around me.)

410
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,180
(They say we are still too young
for us to say so,)

411
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,499
(but at that moment,)

412
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,010
(that's the memory
that I want to keep the most.)

413
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,980
(There's nothing else
for you to take off.)

414
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,000
(Do you want to have a tutor session
anytime soon?)

415
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,499
(Although Jing Xichi)

416
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,660
(said those words
at the agricultural study as a joke,)

417
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,450
(after giving some thought,)

418
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,209
(I decided to follow my intuition)

419
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,580
(to make a decision.)

420
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,530
(I won't join you anytime soon.)

421
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,210
(I want to try studying myself.)

422
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,180
(I won't join you anytime soon.
I want to try studying by myself.)

423
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,580
(Although I don't know if Song
would feel suspicious about this,)

424
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,539
(as always,)

425
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,900
(he did not say anything.)

426
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,280
(Recipient: Huan'er)

427
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,210
(OK.)

428
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,420
Class is over.

429
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,300
Remember to practice at night.

430
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,530
You two should leave together.

431
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,420
I'm leaving first.

432
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,169
(Leaving together after school)

433
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,730
(is a regular thing.)

434
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,860
(But with just the two of us,)

435
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,690
(it feels pretty weird.)

436
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,450
Song.

437
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,129
I want to eat some taro cake.

438
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,420
Why don't you go ahead?

439
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,530
Sure.

440
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,539
(Good evening, viewers.)

441
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,339
(Good evening.)

442
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,689
(It's 25th January,)

443
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,369
(Sunday.)

444
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,129
(It's the 30th day of the lunar calendar.)

445
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,300
(It is a traditional festival
of the ethnic Chinese,)

446
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,180
(the Chinese New Year.)

447
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,539
(Although I didn't
receive Song Cong's tutoring,)

448
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,019
(I managed to keep)

449
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,450
(my end-of-semester test results
at the previous level.)

450
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,860
(But the first Chinese New Year at Tianhe)

451
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,660
(was quite gloomy.)

452
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,010
Do you want some more?

453
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,660
I'm full.

454
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,420
You don't seem to eat much.

455
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,420
Is the New Year's Eve dinner I prepared
not to your liking?

456
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,380
No.

457
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,340
It's my fault.
I still have work tomorrow.

458
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,620
Or else,

459
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,180
I would've taken you back to Sishui.

460
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,509
To Grandma and Grandpa's place.

461
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,420
The whole family would be there.
It's more lively there.

462
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,550
It's alright, Mom.

463
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,680
It's your Dad. Pick it up.

464
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,460
Hey, Dad.

465
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,220
Happy New Year.

466
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,030
Mom and I just finished eating.

467
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,810
Dad, where you are sounds very lively.

468
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,070
It sounds crowded.

469
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,350
Mom...

470
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,900
Hold on, Dad.

471
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,420
Mom, Dad wants to say something to you.

472
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,630
Hey.

473
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,140
Are you celebrating with the squad?

474
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,700
That's nice.

475
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,900
We're having a good time, too.

476
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,550
(Do you want to come out?)

477
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,270
I'm alright.

478
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,980
(No.)

479
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,940
(I'm with my mom at home.)

480
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,570
(In the previous Chinese New Year,)

481
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,790
(even if Dad isn't home,)

482
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,610
(friends and family in Sishui)

483
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,810
(come and go.)

484
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,390
(It's always lively.)

485
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,220
(This is my first time)

486
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,630
(seeing Mom so disappointed.)

487
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,870
(Other than being beside her,)

488
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,070
(I don't know how to comfort her.)

489
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,650
Who's that?

490
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,320
Go get the door.

491
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,310
I'll get the door.

492
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,850
Happy New Year.

493
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,260
Happy New Year, Huan'er.

494
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:02,850
Come in.

495
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,310
No. I don't want to
change my shoes.

496
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,720
It's fine.

497
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,460
Song Cong's father

498
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,020
was called for surgery early morning.

499
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,170
He has yet to come back.

500
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,020
And Liqiang will be working overtime.

501
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,780
So I thought

502
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,850
why don't we get together?

503
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,180
Forget it, I don't want to disturb you
on this festive day.

504
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,090
Not at all.

505
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,060
Don't be a stranger.

506
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,130
Anyway, why don't we play some Mahjong?

507
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,920
Did you come to see me
just to play Mahjong?

508
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,700
Who said that? I'm here
to see you sincerely.

509
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,220
Okay, let's go.

510
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,940
Change your shoes.

511
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,780
I'll go get my phone.

512
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,300
Okay.

513
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,090
Don't bring anything unnecessary.

514
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,460
Is this your key? I got it for you.

515
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,390
Okay, take it.

516
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,850
I forgot to bring you a red envelope.

517
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,130
It's okay, you are one of us.

518
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,330
I'll make it up later.

519
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,740
Don't...

520
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,570
Let's go.

521
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,370
I got the keys, Mom.

522
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,260
Let's go.

523
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,020
Play Mahjong
during the Chinese New Year.

524
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,700
Is there a better time to play Mahjong?

525
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,140
Quick.

526
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,460
Nice.

527
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,610
Liqiang.

528
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,790
Make some tea quickly.

529
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,220
Our guests are here.

530
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,540
I'll go.

531
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,540
Okay, go.

532
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,110
Here I come.

533
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,740
Look who I brought.

534
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,850
Yifan.

535
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,060
Is everything ready?

536
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,090
Greet your elder.

537
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,660
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

538
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,870
It's ready.

539
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,300
Greet your elder.

540
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,900
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

541
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,740
Take a seat, quick.

542
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,850
- Sit.
- Quick.

543
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,130
It's all ready.

544
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,130
Go and play with Xichi.

545
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,220
I was just behind you.

546
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,270
Who's that?

547
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,780
- Mr. Song.
- Mr. Song.

548
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,870
Mr. Song, you are here.

549
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,410
Happy New Year.

550
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,590
As soon he heard about Mahjong,

551
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,740
he got home so quickly.

552
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,700
Faster than usual.

553
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,500
Quick.

554
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,180
Since Mr. Song is here, you're all set.

555
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,980
I'll be on duty later.

556
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,540
Enjoy the game and the food.

557
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,300
I'll take my leave.

558
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,740
Okay.

559
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,700
Okay, look at him.

560
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,030
Liqiang is a model employee.

561
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,820
He's so busy even during
Chinese New Year.

562
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,980
Here we go.

563
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,080
I'm not good at this game.

564
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
It's fine, I'm not that good either.

565
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,310
Where is Jing Xichi?

566
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,070
He's at the toilet.

567
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,550
Weren't you staying in?

568
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,660
My mom pulled me along.

569
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,810
Here you are.

570
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,020
Why did you

571
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,170
reject Song Cong's offer?

572
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,170
You had to force me

573
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,760
to use our parents' relationship, right?

574
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,030
No.

575
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,110
Okay, we're all here.

576
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,350
Let's go.

577
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,590
Where to?

578
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,800
I'm taking you to experience

579
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Chinese New Year
traditional preservation projects

580
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,030
at our compound.

581
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,170
Let's go.

582
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,840
Why are you still sitting there?
Let's go.

583
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,660
You, too. Go.

584
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,020
Get up and walk around.

585
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,330
Where?

586
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,300
You'll know soon.

587
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,370
Where are you guys going?

588
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,700
You'll know when we get there.

589
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,980
Mom, we're going out to play.

590
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,650
Be careful.

591
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,460
Mom, I'm leaving, too.

592
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,170
Okay.

593
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,780
Follow them and stay safe.

594
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,900
- Hope you win.
- Hold up.

595
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,540
Five characters.

596
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,610
Be careful on your way.

597
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,110
I take it back.

598
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,020
No take-backs!

599
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,850
Go, quick.

600
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,460
- Look.
- Nine circles.

601
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,350
Come.

602
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,500
Nine circles.

603
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,890
Come on, I want it too.

604
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,180
Come on, two bamboos.

605
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,060
Is this the traditional project

606
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,420
you do every year?

607
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,980
Where is Song?

608
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,590
Come, log in.

609
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,790
Jing Xichi.

610
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,830
What do I type in?

611
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,070
Song, help her out.

612
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,110
Oh, I got it.

613
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,070
What about the password?
What is the password?

614
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,500
Zero, zero, zero. Here.

615
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,700
Right.

616
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,830
Song.

617
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,110
Why are you playing more and more
like a noob?

618
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,980
I'm taking a break.

619
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,330
You should practice on your own.

620
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,740
Playing with you is a bore.

621
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,630
I'll play alone.

622
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,980
(I feel like you've been
avoiding me recently.)

623
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,310
(What do you mean?)

624
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,850
(Since the final exams)

625
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,240
(until the end of the winter vacation,
I couldn't find you.)

626
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,270
(Tell me.)

627
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,790
(What happened?)

628
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,870
(Although Qi Qi and I
still have some misunderstandings,)

629
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,390
(she is still my best friend.)

630
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,940
(I don't know what to do either.)

631
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,070
I'm too good.

632
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,940
I'm too good.

633
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,270
I'm really too good.

634
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,590
No one can beat me.

635
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,940
Jing Xichi.

636
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,420
Can we

637
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,860
play something else?

638
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,390
I don't know how to play games.

639
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,980
Let's set off some fireworks.

640
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,350
Sure.

641
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,150
Okay.

642
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,860
But it's already so late.

643
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,270
Where can we buy fireworks?

644
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,420
I have an idea.

645
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,100
This kid must be hiding himself.

646
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,940
Such a big box.

647
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,270
So much.

648
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,100
Consider my debt paid.

649
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,350
Where did you get it?

650
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,390
From my dad's car.

651
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,620
Impressive.

652
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,420
Moreover,

653
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,150
your family sets them off every year.

654
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,870
It's really noisy.

655
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,100
Today, let's give the neighbors a break.

656
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,230
Aren't you afraid of your dad...

657
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,500
At worst, I'll get scolded

658
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,690
or beaten.

659
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,310
He only had these two tricks.

660
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,500
Leave quickly

661
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,790
before I change my mind.

662
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,460
You've stolen it anyway.

663
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,420
Join us.

664
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,190
Yes.

665
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,980
Let's go together.

666
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,460
I won't go. It's too noisy.

667
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,710
Go quickly.

668
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,670
Thank you, brother.

669
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,100
Thanks.

670
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,830
Let's go set off some fireworks.

671
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,420
Where can we set it off?

672
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,420
Over there.

673
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,730
Let me tell you,

674
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,060
these are the real deal.

675
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,460
Stand far away.

676
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,130
Xichi,

677
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,840
do you know
what this fireworks is called?

678
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,020
Blue Dream.

679
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,830
I will show you how dreamy it is.

680
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,150
How long are

681
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,830
you guys going to avoid each other?

682
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,750
Did he tell you?

683
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,230
Do you think he would tell me?

684
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,500
I could see it myself.

685
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,310
He's not usually like this.

686
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,540
Acting like he doesn't care.

687
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,580
Chen Huan'er,

688
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,980
I really know nothing

689
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,390
about girl stuff.

690
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,270
But I think

691
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,310
friends are definitely pure-hearted.

692
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,620
Just like I treat you as my friend.

693
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,270
No matter what happens between us,

694
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,020
I hope you are happy.

695
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,670
I hope you will prosper.

696
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,340
And I think

697
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,100
you have done nothing wrong.

698
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,100
Don't be afraid of others' annoyance.

699
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,940
Don't stop being yourself
because of that.

700
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,310
Are you ready?

701
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,150
Ready.

702
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,190
Here we go.

703
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,420

we all have a pure
revolutionary camaraderie.

709
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,790
You must not let us down.

710
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,670
That's right.

711
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,580
Don't destroy the harmony
in our organization!

712
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,420
We are becoming juniors.

713
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,150

In the trunk?

726
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,860
I've checked it. It's not there.

727
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,100
Please help me find it.

728
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,940
How can they fail such a simple task?

729
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,460
Have you seen

730
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,520
the fireworks in my trunk?

731
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,150
I didn't see it.

732
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,580
Why didn't you see if it's in the trunk?

733
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,210
How would I see it?

734
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,460
Are you serious?

735
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,250
The fireworks in your trunk.

736
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,540
I'm not in your trunk.

737
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,060
You can check it out yourself!

738
00:39:59,070 --> 00:39:59,770
Why ask me?

739
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,690
I was watching TV here

740
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,940
peacefully.

741
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,290
Why are you watching TV?

742
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,860
You don't care about our son!

743
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,060
Seriously, you are weird.

744
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,860
Why are you upset?

745
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,980
You talk too much.

746
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,860
Why are you throwing a tantrum at me?

747
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,690
Tone it down!

748
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,900
You take care of him usually.

749
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,850
Oh, really?

750
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,780
But you throw a tantrum
right when you come home!

751
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,060
Tell me, is that right?

752
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,020
Tell me.

753
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,460
Just help me to look for it, okay?

754
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,610
Go look for it yourself.

755
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,620
I'm not messing with you.

756
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,230
How dare you ask me to look for it!

757
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,380
Huan'er, over here.

758
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,180
Anything you want to say
to your future self?

759
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,250
Stop recording.

760
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,500
Just say a few words, come on.

761
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,230
Song is here. Record him.

762
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,100
Song.

763
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,420
Oh, you are still hooked on that?

764
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,170
This has eight megapixels.

765
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,020
You know?

766
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,580
Say something.

767
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,650
Stop lying.

768
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,820
I checked it out yesterday.

769
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,980
It's just three megapixels.

770
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,570
Who cares?

771
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,650
It works, doesn't it?

772
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,100
I can say whatever I want.

773
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,340
Li Tian.

774
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,120
Come, say something.

775
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,940
Anything you want to say
to your future self?

776
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,340
Why are you running? Li Tian.

777
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,500
Li Tian, hold up.

778
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,860
It's useless to run.

779
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,500
I will definitely catch you on camera.

780
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,500
No one can escape me.
