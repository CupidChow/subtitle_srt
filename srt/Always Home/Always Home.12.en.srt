Eat up.

00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,990
Come.

18
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,780
Chen Huan'er.

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,990
Thanks to your sharp sense of smell.

20
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,390
I was so scared.

21
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,020
It's the first time I've seen

22
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,230
Aunt Hao looking like this.

23
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,120
As someone
who has been through it before,

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,070
I can understand Aunt Hao's

25
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,110
current mood.

26
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,620
Aunt Hao

27
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,740
just needs some time to accept it.

28
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,550
Song Cong seems to be pretty blue, too.

29
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,300
He sent me a message saying

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,820
he bought an induction cooker

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,700
and even set up a small table
for his mother.

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,790
Won't your Aunt Hao
feel even worse that way?

33
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,230
Why so, Mom?

34
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,420
Think about it.

35
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,900
Your Aunt Hao was such a capable person.

36
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,740
Everything in the house depended on her.

37
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,830
Song Cong wants to be filial.

38
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,620
But by doing so, he reminded Aunt Hao

39
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,270
how she had become a burden to them.

40
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,230
What should we do then?

41
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,900
It's alright. Just eat up.

42
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,350
Don't worry about it.

43
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,460
Mom, this is the new induction cooker
I got you.

44
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,020
From now on, you should use this to cook

45
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,670
instead of the stove.

46
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,950
The stove is dangerous.

47
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,230
Mom.

48
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,420
If it doesn't work out,
let's get a helper

49
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,550
so that you don't have to cook anymore.

50
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,070
Song Cong,

51
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,260
Huan'er wants to eat Aunt Hao Mei's
pork knuckles.

52
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,620
She doesn't like my cooking.

53
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,990
Let me learn from you, too.

54
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,350
How do you make pork knuckles?

55
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,710
You must teach me

56
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,380
your Song family secret recipe.

57
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,550
My daughter's mouth is too picky.

58
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,860
I've given it some thought.

59
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,790
I'll come to your house more for meals.

60
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,500
I want to secretly steal your skills.

61
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,550
Song Cong,

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,710
buy a bouquet of flowers for Huan'er.

63
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,030
Thank her for the flowers
she bought me.

64
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,860
Sure.

65
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,590
Go.

66
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,380
Talking about these pork knuckles,

67
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,550
do I have to prepare
the fried sugar syrup first?

68
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,990
I don't know what I am doing...

69
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,790
Okay.

70
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,420
Okay.

71
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,180
Life goes on.

72
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,500
These are just hurdles to be overcome.

73
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,420
It's alright.

74
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,300
Stop crying.

75
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,670
Hurry up and teach me how to make
pork knuckles.

76
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,500
Does it have to be fried in sugar syrup?

77
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,910
Huan'er said that the one I made
tasted too gamey.

78
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,350
But I did boil it in water.

79
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,990
Stop being pretentious.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
I've been hungry for the whole day.

81
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,540
I've been waiting for these.

82
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,990
Hurry up. How should I make it?

83
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,280
It won't taste good if you make it
with an electric cooker.

84
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,470
Then let's use the stove.

85
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,150
We won't use the induction cooker.

86
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,350
Wash it first.

87
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,150
Wash it first.

88
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,790
Okay, wash it first.

89
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,670
Then what?

90
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,620
Come on.

91
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,500
Tell me quickly.

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,300
Do I need to add
onion, ginger, and garlic?

93
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,380
Should I marinate it?

94
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,470
Yes.

95
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,840
Well, I'm done washing it now...

96
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,220
Interested in some flowers, young lad?

97
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,470
What do you want?

98
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,300
(Why did you choose this flower?)

99
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,620
Because chamomile adapts well.

100
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,590
Even in a barren environment,

101
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,620
it can grow.

102
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,990
Its flower language is

103
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,790
'never bow to fate.'

104
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,590
No wonder.

105
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,910
It's very much like you.

106
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,590
Chamomile.

107
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,300
Okay.

108
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,040
How much is it?

109
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,740
15 yuan, please wait a moment.

110
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,150
Here are your flowers.

111
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,740
Thanks.

112
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,860
Run, I don't care!

113
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,820
You have promised to run with me.

114
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,180
I'm barely off my crutches.

115
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,470
Chen Huan'er, you're too much.

116
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,540
At least try it, won't you?

117
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,500
I tried. Didn't I run?

118
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,470
Start warming up now.

119
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,590
Come, warm up with me.

120
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,300
Song.

121
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,350
Did you buy chamomile again?

122
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,910
Is it for Aunt Hao?

123
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,380
Yes.

124
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,910
Did Aunt Lina go today?

125
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,550
Yes.

126
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,300
How was it?

127
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,260
My mom was quite happy.

128
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,550
That's great.

129
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,670
Huan'er.

130
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,990
Thank you.

131
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,230
Why are you thanking me?

132
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,620
I'm tired of

133
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,230
my Mom's dishes anyway.

134
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,440
She can learn to do more.

135
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,500
If you say so,

136
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
I have to get my mom to learn some too.

137
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,420
Aunt Hao will have something
to do every day.

138
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,310
Song Cong,

139
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,860
you should spend more time with Aunt Hao
this weekend.

140
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,070
Sure.

141
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,780
I'll go home first.

142
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,260
What are you doing?

143
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,520
Stand up.

144
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,740
- Quick.
- Let me take five.

145
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,420
- Get up and run with me.
- Just five minutes.

146
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,950
Hurry, you promised me!

147
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,620
Wait a minute.

148
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,150
Just five minutes. Let me take a break.

149
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,900
Let me sit down.

150
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,470
Get up and run.

151
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,190
Run.

152
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,520
It hurts. It's starting to hurt.

153
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,190
It's aching.

154
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,260
Let me take five.

155
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,430
Just five minutes.

156
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,830
The weather's nice.

157
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,830
Very nice.

158
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,070
At this time,

159
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,900
the flowers in the fields of Sishui
would be blooming.

160
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,180
It must be very beautiful.

161
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,710
Then Sishui must be a beautiful place.

162
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,830
Very beautiful.

163
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,380
Sishui and Tianhe are beautiful
in different ways.

164
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,260
Although Sishui is remote,

165
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,140
she has mountains and sea,

166
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,500
and her fruits are very delicious.

167
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,140
Wait...

168
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,860
Have you never been to Sishui?

169
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,830
I haven't been there.

170
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,840
Then how did you...?

171
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,100
Where is Sishui?
Is it outside the country?

172
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,380
Sishui is a county.

173
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,260
It's the westernmost county.

174
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,860
That happened?

175
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,590
Why didn't I know?

176
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,990
Then how did you know about Sishui?

177
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,430
My mother told me that
before you came here.

178
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,350
She said she had a junior in college

179
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,620
who was from Sishui.

180
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,580
Although they weren't in contact
for a long time,

181
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,900
she was getting transferred
to the family housing compound.

182
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,430
She told me about their past.

183
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,830
Things that happened back in school.

184
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,590
She also said that Aunt Hao

185
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,950
had always wanted to go to Sishui.

186
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,520
But she was too busy at the hospital.
She couldn't make time to go.

187
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,900
Did Aunt Hao want to go to Sishui?

188
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,660
We have time during the summer break.

189
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,710
I can be her guide.

190
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,190
She can relax over there.

191
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,580
Why don't all of us go on a trip?

192
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,110
Sure.

193
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,260
I'll go back, pack my bags,

194
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,360
and tell my Mom and Dad.

195
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,830
Calm down.

196
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,430
I haven't asked Song Cong and Aunt Hao.

197
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,590
Just tell him

198
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,350
this will help Aunt Hao to relax.

199
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,640
He will definitely find a way.

200
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,740
That's true.

201
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,190
But what about our parents?

202
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,540
Will they go?

203
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,540
Don't worry about it.

204
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,660
I'll handle it. Let's go.

205
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,800
First stop, your house.

206
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,260
My house? What for?

207
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,660
You have to do me a small favor first.

208
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,830
Then, I can guarantee

209
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,470
this exclusive Sishui trip
will be a success.

210
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,540
So you aren't tired anymore, right?

211
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,540
Running is tiring, but touring isn't.
Let's go.

212
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,660
Why don't we run on the way back?

213
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,540
You should run.

214
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:15,740
Run with me.

215
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,220
You run.

216
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,230
Run with me for a while.

217
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:17,990
I'm not running.

218
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,740
Just for a while.

219
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,110
I will become crippled again.

220
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,640
No way. You need to recover now.

221
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,080
Can we go to Sishui if I am crippled?

222
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,350
Come.

223
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,950
Am I right?

224
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,500
I'll carry you.

225
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,620
I'll give you a piggyback.

226
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,380
What are you trying to do?

227
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,380
Why are you suddenly looking
for old photos?

228
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,830
Just look for them.

229
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,310
Make sure you're looking
for my parents' photos.

230
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,620
Found it.

231
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,620
Let me see.

232
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,260
Is this you when you were a kid?

233
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,880
Why are these all pictures of you
when you were a kid?

234
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,460
What about your parents?

235
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,020
I've only seen this album in my house.

236
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,990
Forget it, I can't count on you.

237
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,990
I'll get Song.

238
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,500
(Speaking of this, my parents only liked
to take my photos.)

239
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,020
(They never took pictures
of each other.)

240
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,380
(I wonder if they never had the chance)

241
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,280
(or they just don't like
being photographed.)

242
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,710
(In short, their past)

243
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,260
(seems to only be found)

244
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,540
(in a story with me as the protagonist.)

245
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,260
Is there any?

246
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,710
No.

247
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,360
That's strange.

248
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Your dad was still looking at it
two days ago.

249
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,470
Is it this one?

250
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,590
Yes.

251
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,660
This is the one.

252
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,860
Why does Xichi want our photo album?

253
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,780
He didn't tell me, either.

254
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,780
Tell him

255
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,500
if he messes around
and pisses off his Mom,

256
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,960
there's no one to save him this time.

257
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,710
Don't worry, Mom.

258
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,190
He can't do that now.

259
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,230
By the way,

260
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,470
the work manual that Dad got

261
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,540
from Internal Affairs

262
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,900
has many

263
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,380
computer system operations.

264
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,620
I've made one for you.

265
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,740
Look.

266
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,500
(Internal Affairs work manual,
computer operations)

267
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,260
(Logout procedures, Login procedures)

268
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,620
I'm just old.

269
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,430
How will I learn
how to use the computer?

270
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,470
It's too much effort.

271
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,860
I wasn't always like this.

272
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,430
I used to learn fast.

273
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,540
Any new drugs or equipment,

274
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,860
I would master it in two days.

275
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,020
Mom, you can still master it.

276
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,140
Don't worry.

277
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,470
You still have some time

278
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,710
before getting back to work.

279
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,740
These two days,

280
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,780
why don't we go on a short trip.

281
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,190
Didn't you say
that you've wanted to go to Sishui?

282
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,380
Maybe next time.

283
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,780
Doesn't Xichi need it urgently?

284
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,830
Send it to him.

285
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,660
Mom,

286
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,230
actually,

287
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,900
I really want to go to Sishui.

288
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,900
Okay,

289
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,230
why don't you help me pack my luggage

290
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,310
when you're done with the album later.

291
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,780
Sure.

292
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,710
I'm leaving, Mom.

293
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,500
Okay.

294
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,340
(Logout procedures, Login procedures)

295
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,710
Chen Huan'er, you're too much.

296
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,590
You can at least try.

297
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,780
I tried. I did run.

298
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,110
Run! I don't care.

299
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,470
You promised me.

300
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,990
You have to run with me.

301
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,920
We have the same idea.

302
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,560
I wanted to ask you
about the final exam.

303
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,380
Then, I saw you here.

304
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,350
This...

305
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,860
Hold on.

306
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,780
You are asking me?

307
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,230
Yes. Why not?

308
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,300
Do you only teach Chen Huan'er
and her friends?

309
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,430
I want to ask you something first.

310
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,500
Ask me?

311
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,710
Go ahead.

312
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,900
Well,

313
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,260
I have a friend in my new school.

314
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,310
Did you get a new friend this quick?

315
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,710
Just answer the question.

316
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,430
Three variables: A, B, and C.

317
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,740
A likes B.

318
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,740
B

319
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,740
says they're just good friends with C.

320
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,540
But A discovered many

321
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,860
evidence of B liking C.

322
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,080
What do you think should be done?

323
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,310
Mathematical problems.

324
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:22,990
Firstly,

325
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,310
you said

326
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,900
B and C are just good friends,
according to B.

327
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,100
Is this a true proposition
or a false proposition?

328
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,430
Let's say it's true.

329
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,140
This would not constitute

330
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,660
any conflict between A liking B.

331
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,360
Something wrong
with the question itself.

332
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
How did transferring schools
make you stupid?

333
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:40,900
I think

334
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,740
A should think about it more.

335
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,470
What are you talking about?

336
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,400
Why haven't you come up?

337
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,430
You should talk to him first.

338
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,320
I'll see you later.

339
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,470
Good night, A, and you, C.

340
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,500
Bye-Bye.

341
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,860
What's this about A and C?

342
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,260
Is he sick or something?

343
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,660
I have no idea.

344
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,100
Did you find it?

345
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,340
Let me see.

346
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,300
You're the man.

347
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,660
Let's see. Is there anything good here?

348
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,230
This group photo is good.

349
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,300
(Study schedule)

350
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,740
What's this?

351
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,190
You are finally on vacation.

352
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,540
Shouldn't you be doing something else
other than studying?

353
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,820
Mom, I'm a junior in high school.

354
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,300
As a parent,

355
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,630
shouldn't you be holding a whip

356
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,470
and hitting me?

357
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,430
This is a great time.

358
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,780
It's sunny and bright out there.

359
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,100
How could you stay home alone

360
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,740
and study with a frown?

361
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,630
Look,

362
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,670
vacation is a break.

363
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,500
Otherwise, why is it called a vacation?

364
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,470
Mom,

365
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,300
you're an anti-studying ambassador.

366
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,340
Combining work and rest

367
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,820
will improve your learning.

368
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,630
On the day after tomorrow,
we will all go to Sishui.

369
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,780
It's all organized.

370
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,540
Do you want to pack your bags?

371
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,470
Get prepared?

372
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,940
Buy a mosquito repellent or something.

373
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,580
Are we really going to Sishui?

374
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,430
Jing Xichi really organized it.

375
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,540
We'll all go.

376
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,060
If you want to study at home,

377
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,710
you would be home alone.

378
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
No, Mom.

379
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,260
I'll study.

380
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,630
Even in Sishui,

381
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,100
I can still study hard.

382
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,950
Am I right, Mom?

383
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,780
I won't force you.

384
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,100
You don't have to go.

385
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,670
Just study hard alone at home.

386
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,910
No, Mom.

387
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,300
Learning is important.

388
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,470
But if I don't go,

389
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,230
won't our family seem unsociable?

390
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,060
Moreover,

391
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
this would be detrimental

392
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,980
to our neighborhood relations
in the compound.

393
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,740
Am I right, Mom?

394
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,580
No.

395
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,630
Your mom

396
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,910
alone can represent our family.

397
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,820
No, Mom.

398
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,470
I'm a part of the family, too.

399
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,540
I'm your little baby.

400
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,990
Bring me along.

401
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,540
Stop taking my picture.

402
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,190
In my state,

403
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,540
what's the point of taking a photo?

404
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,260
You're so good.

405
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,190
Liqiang, did you know that composition

406
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,960
is the most important thing
in photography?

407
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,100
For beginners like you,

408
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,060
knowing the three-point method
is good enough.

409
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,280
I can also do composition.

410
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,670
Look at Song Hang,

411
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,550
he hasn't made any progress
in all these years.

412
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,950
His equipment is quite new.

413
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,580
What's the use of more equipment?

414
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,990
He still doesn't have that talent.

415
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,470
Yifan, didn't you also
like to take pictures?

416
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,820
Why aren't you taking any now?

417
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,020
That was 20 years ago.

418
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,700
I have forgotten it long ago.

419
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,990
What are you doing?

420
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,300
This is a black-jack,
scientific name Bidens pilosa.

421
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,260
It's good for people
with the three highs.

422
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,240
Make a cup for Liqiang?

423
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,280
He won't drink it. He has a picky mouth.

424
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,200
Looking down
on traditional Chinese medicine?

425
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,840
No.

426
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,060
Smile.

427
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,760
We got up early in the morning
to join you.

428
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,490
It's all true love.

429
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,470
True love.

430
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,430
The mountains are really nice.

431
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,820
The air here is good too.

432
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,020
Song.

433
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,940
They're wearing the same scarves!

434
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,100
Yes.

435
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,230
This trip wasn't in vain.

436
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
If Du Man, Li Tian,
and the others are all here,

437
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,870
that would be awesome.

438
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,540
Chen Huan'er.

439
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,720
Are your legs healed?
You're running so quickly.

440
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,540
What?

441
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,100
Kumquat.

442
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,440
Try it. It's super sweet. Here.

443
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,150
Is it sweet?

444
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,020
Sweet, my foot.

445
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,740
Sweet, my foot.

446
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:53,910
Stop.

447
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,430
Be careful with his legs.

448
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,390
It's fine.

449
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,580
Xichi is a boy. Just let them play.

450
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,260
Look at her.

451
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,710
A girl

452
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,710
acting like a monkey.

453
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,900
Who did she get that from?

454
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,700
From you, of course.

455
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,340
Is it fine just like her dad?

456
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,520
She got her beauty from you.

457
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,470
It hurts.

458
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,100
You deserved it.

459
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,340
Dad, help me.

460
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,950
Huan'er,

461
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,470
eat this.

462
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,150
This is sweet.

463
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,870
Ignore him.

464
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,820
Dad, why are you
helping outsiders instead?

465
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,390
Dad.

466
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,300
It's too sour.

467
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:35,950
This is great.

468
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,950
Uncle, why are you also...?

469
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,300
Eat one.

470
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,950
No way.

471
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,150
Open your mouth.

472
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,870
Good boy, son.

473
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,710
Let me take a look.

474
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,910
Song Cong.

475
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,260
Song, give him a good one.

476
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,020
Okay, come take a photo.

477
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:00,870
Look here.

478
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,560
I need to get a camera
to learn from you.

479
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,300
How can I take a photo without a camera?

480
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,260
Am I right?

481
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,060
It feels like everything
is starting to get better.

482
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,150
Come, raise your glass again.

483
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,630
Welcome to Sishui.

484
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,580
Welcome to my hometown.

485
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,950
Welcome.

486
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,670
- This environment is nice.
- Right?

487
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,710
The food is fresh, too.

488
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,470
I will guarantee that it's delicious
and you will be full.

489
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,580
Here, Huan'er.

490
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,100
It's your favorite.

491
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,710
Eat more, Huan'er.

492
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,870
This is delicious, Mom.

493
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,150
I'll go to the toilet.

494
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,910
Eat up.

495
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,100
Hao Mei, just leave him alone.

496
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,500
That's his hobby.

497
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Just let him do it.

498
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,990
Do you know how he keeps his figure?

499
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,870
He doesn't eat.

500
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,580
He just wants to hold his camera.

501
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,260
He never eats, just like a ghost.

502
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,060
Mom.

503
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,710
Happy birthday!

504
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,100
Happy birthday.

505
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,540
Thank you.

506
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,740
Happy birthday, Yifan.

507
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,900
(The best mother in the world.)

508
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,190
Wait a minute, Mom.

509
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,630
Haven't made a wish yet.

510
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,300
That's right.

511
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,870
Right?

512
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,190
Yes.

513
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,780
Make a wish.

514
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,390
Okay.

515
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,780
I hope you three

516
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,670
have a smooth year as juniors.

517
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,420
I hope you are peaceful, safe,
and healthy.

518
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,390
Get good grades.

519
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,870
Is that it?

520
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,390
Besides the children's health,

521
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,680
adults need to be healthy too.

522
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,600
The health of the adults

523
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,150
is the blessing of the children.

524
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,740
Yes, you're right.

525
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,300
I have not thought of that.

526
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,500
Yes, we should be healthy.

527
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,600
Everyone should be healthy.

528
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,230
Great.

529
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,500
Mom.

530
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,890
We haven't sung the birthday song yet.

531
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,710
Huan'er, you start.

532
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,300
Happy birthday to you.

533
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,580
Happy birthday to you.

534
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,020
Happy birthday to you.

535
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,260
Happy birthday to you.

536
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,260
Wait a minute, Mom.

537
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,670
I have another surprise for you.

538
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,740
Look at my son.

539
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,150
How troublesome.

540
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,540
You don't know how blessed you are.

541
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,430
We envy you so much.

542
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,780
I wonder what he has up his sleeve.

543
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,820
Isn't that our

544
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,670
photos from before?

545
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,300
Yes, Mom. Isn't that you?

546
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,860
Yes.

547
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,000
- This was in
- You found the photos

548
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,470
- medical school.
- to surprise her.

549
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,100
It was photographed at that time.

550
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,260
Is that me?

551
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,710
Yes, that one.

552
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,780
That was us.

553
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,990
Wasn't Song Hang handsome?

554
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,320
Wearing a beige suit just like...

555
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,340
I said he looked like
a returning overseas Chinese.

556
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,540
No, Shanghai Bun.

557
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,260
He's like Xu Wenqiang
from Shanghai Bund.

558
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,990
Chow Yun-fat.

559
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,580
- At that time,
- Yes.

560
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,020
that was his only presentable outfit.

561
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,870
He wore it every day.

562
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,950
But didn't it attract you anyway?

563
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,150
Yes.

564
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,740
Xichi really put
a lot of effort into this.

565
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,060
It seems like he will celebrate
with you every year.

566
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,390
That's why I want to tell him

567
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,580
to look at my age.
I am not too old, but not young.

568
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,990
Why

569
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,100
treat me like a child

570
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,580
and celebrate my birthday every year?

571
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,990
Mom, you can't say that.

572
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,260
I know you've always tried your best,

573
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,940
thinking that taking good care
of our home

574
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,660
is your duty.

575
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,230
I made this video

576
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,060
to tell you that,

577
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:00,910
Mom,

578
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,780
your life has always been exciting.

579
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,190
You deserve a good birthday.

580
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,190
Correct.

581
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,820
Alright.

582
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,630
Stop it, I feel so embarrassed.

583
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,580
Liqiang,

584
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,480
hurry, get the knife.

585
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,470
I'll portion the cake.

586
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,320
I'll go get it now.

587
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,780
I envy you so much.

588
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,780
When do you think our two families will

589
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,390
have this kind of treatment?

590
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,990
By the way, Lina, your birthday

591
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,430
isn't far from Yifan's, right?

592
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,100
I...

593
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,300
Yes, your birthday is coming up soon.

594
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,870
Huan'er.

595
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,800
You should celebrate
your mother's birthday.

596
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,060
Just follow this standard.

597
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,630
What? I never celebrate my birthday.

598
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,470
Should we do it?

599
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,230
No.

600
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,740
Here, this big one is for Huan'er.

601
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,470
Take it.

602
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,060
This one is for Hao Mei's family.

603
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,000
Song, this is for you.

604
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,710
Yes, give it to me. He doesn't eat cake.

605
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,870
Try it.

606
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,740
This is for my husband.

607
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,910
Thank you for your hard work.

608
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,580
Not at all.

609
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,990
This is for my son.

610
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,820
Jing Xichi.

611
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,540
What are you doing on my rooftop
this early in the morning?

612
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,100
A typhoon is coming.

613
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,870
These old tiles

614
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,190
on your roof are breaking apart.

615
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,100
So I fixed it for you.

616
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,020
No need to thank me.

617
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,090
Why are you coming up?

618
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,390
I want to see the scenery.

619
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,710
You don't know.

620
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,620
When I was a kid,
I always climbed up to play.

621
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,020
Slow down.

622
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,430
Alright.

623
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,390
Chen Huan'er,

624
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,100
I know your secret now.

625
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,390
What secret?

626
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,950
How could anyone

627
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,950
wish to be as strong as a bull?

628
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,540
Give it back.

629
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,150
Why did you have such a wish?

630
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,150
Over here as well.

631
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,870
Don't look at it.

632
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,340
What's this?

633
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,380
I haven't seen this yet.

634
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,540
(I hope my parents
won't be unhappy because of me.)

635
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,580
I wrote this when I was a kid.

636
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,630
Then your wish

637
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
has come true, it seems.

638
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,260
My grandpa is right.

639
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,390
Just write down your wish

640
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,230
on the tiles, and they will be realized.

641
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:51,950
Hold on.

642
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,870
What do you want to do?

643
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,870
Slow down.

644
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,230
Be careful.

645
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,780
This ladder isn't very solid.

646
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,100
I've repaired this ladder, too.

647
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:00,990
Wait for me.

648
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,430
What are you going to do?

649
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,430
You'll see.

650
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,740
Why did you write so many wishes?

651
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,430
It's rude to look at other's wishes.

652
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,540
Didn't you write a lot, too?

653
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Writing wishes is free anyway.

654
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,090
Just write as many as possible.

655
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,480
Let me see what you wrote.

656
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,340
Nothing.

657
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,580
Okay.

658
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,040
Let's not look at each other's wishes.

659
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,430
Cheapskate.

660
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:51,870
By the way,

661
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,540
you didn't tell me

662
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,060
about Aunt Lin's birthday surprise.

663
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,230
Why so mysterious? Aren't we buddies?

664
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,470
What is a surprise?

665
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,420
What's the point in telling you ahead?

666
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,100
Let me tell you.

667
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,580
On the outside, my mom

668
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,780
looks gentle and mild-mannered.

669
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,540
She always says

670
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,910
it's too much trouble

671
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,710
to celebrate her birthday at this age.

672
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,990
But if you prepare

673
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,990
a surprise for her,

674
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,180
she will still be very happy.

675
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,630
True.

676
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:15,950
By the way,

677
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,950
do you celebrate your mom's birthday
every year?

678
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,920
The celebration this year
is considered low-key.

679
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,990
What about last year?

680
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,910
It was more high-profile last year.

681
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,950
How so?

682
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,060
Jing Xichi.

683
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,020
Happy birthday, Mom.

684
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,340
(Happy birthday, Dear Ms. Lin Yifan!)

685
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,380
What are you doing?

686
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,540
- Ms. Lin.
- Happy birthday.

687
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,190
Are there any cakes?

688
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,300
- Yes.
- Let me have some.

689
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,780
Ms. Lin, are there any cakes for us?

690
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,000
Anyway, she prohibited me

691
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,820
from going to the hospital
for over six months.

692
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,300
She must've been very angry.

693
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,780
She's just stubborn.

694
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,100
Anyway, it just has to be memorable.

695
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,190
I have to let my mom

696
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,430
know on her birthday

697
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,760
that she is the most important person
in my heart.

698
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,540
So,

699
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,470
what mothers say

700
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,990
is not necessarily true.

701
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,870
Didn't you say that we shouldn't
look at each other's wishes?

702
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,780
No.

703
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,340
Let me see.

704
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,060
You'll know later.

705
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,800
Don't be so stingy.

706
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,020
No, it won't work if you see it.

707
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,630
Just this once.

708
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,100
No, absolutely not.

709
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,440
It won't work after you see it.

710
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,780
Mom.

711
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,160
Why don't you want to
celebrate your birthday?

712
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,540
What birthday?

713
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,100
It's just another year passing away.

714
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,990
We will just have a meal.

715
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,340
Don't make a big fuss over it.

716
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,990
So,

717
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,340
what mothers

718
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,910
say sometimes

719
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,390
is not necessarily true.

720
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,230
Hey, girl.

721
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,780
Dad, are you busy?

722
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,470
Do you have the time

723
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,960
to take a vacation and come home?

724
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:49,740
What's wrong?

725
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,260
Isn't my mom's birthday coming soon?

726
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,670
I thinking of celebrating it

727
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,060
with you.

728
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,630
Oh, is that so?

729
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,580
We have been practicing
for the competition recently.

730
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,320
It's hard to say.

731
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,340
Okay, I understand.

732
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,390
I understand.

733
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,150
So you just don't want to help.

734
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,100
Didn't you say I am a one-trick pony
who only knows how to make videos?

735
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,500
Why ask me for help then?

736
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,910
That's enough.

737
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,430
Shut up.

738
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,990
I'm wrong and I'm sorry.

739
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,820
Big Brother.

740
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,580
Louder.

741
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,220
Big Brother.

742
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,350
What is it?

743
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,270
I just want to celebrate
my mom's birthday.

744
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
I don't have any pictures

745
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,790
of my mom in the album.

746
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,990
I want to ask you for your help.

747
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,470
Then I guess

748
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,750
I have no choice but to help you.

749
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,990
Thank you, Big Brother.

750
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,180
Anyway, I saw all the pictures.

751
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,500
I remember that there are
pictures of Aunt Lina.

752
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,180
Really?

753
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,620
Where?

754
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,840
It should be in Song's album.

755
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,990
I'll find it.

756
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,270
Where is it?

757
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,470
Isn't this the one?

758
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,470
So pretty.

759
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,180
When I saw it, I thought

760
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,790
Uncle Song and Aunt Lina

761
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,790
were quite close.

762
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,780
There are many photos
of them together.

763
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,470
Really?

764
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,910
Your dad must have taken this photo.

765
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,390
When I saw it,

766
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,990
I thought,

767
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,390
your dad and your mom's relationship

768
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,540
must be extraordinary.

769
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,910
Now when I see this photo,

770
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,750
I feel like...

771
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,020
I have discovered

772
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,100
something incredible.

773
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,910
Although it's hard to believe,

774
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,270
don't dismiss me first.

775
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,140
Let me analyze it for you.

776
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,700
Aunt Lina

777
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,660
was smiling so happily

778
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,220
and brilliantly.

779
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,390
The love in her eyes

780
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,790
is overflowing.

781
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,540
Fortunately, that year,

782
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,180
your dad and your mom weren't together.

783
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,180
Otherwise,

784
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,310
I'd lose two close friends.

785
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,540
I would be the only kid

786
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,960
in this family housing compound.

787
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,950
Jing Xichi.

788
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,180
Are you sick?

789
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,020
If you are sick, go see a doctor.

790
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,620
You two don't believe me?

791
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,700
There is concrete evidence.

792
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,580
Come here.

793
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,500
Take a closer look.

794
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,790
Have you finished shooting?

795
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,220
I'm done.

796
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,660
Does it look good?

797
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:33,700
Of course.

798
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,750
You are pretty.

799
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,520
You're photogenic
no matter how I take it.

800
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,430
Okay, I will get it from you later.

801
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,340
No need for that.

802
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,500
After I develop the photos,

803
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,040
I will send them to your department.

804
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,900
Thank you, Song Hang.

805
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,390
Yifan,

806
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,420
let me take some for you as well.

807
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,830
Look at this girl.

808
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,350
Doesn't she look like Huan'er?

809
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:21,950
Song Hang.

810
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,220
There's some resemblance.

811
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,910
I think if Huan'er

812
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,180
dresses up a little,

813
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,780
she wouldn't lose to these actresses.

814
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,120
Exactly. I think Huan'er
just needs to dress up a little.

815
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,420
Actually, her facial features

816
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,180
are pretty nice.

817
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,620
Exactly.

818
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,140
She's just like Lina.

819
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,350
Born with good looks, she'll be fine.

820
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,790
Lina is the prettier one, isn't she?

821
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,830
Do still you miss her?

822
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,950
What are you saying?

823
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,140
Our son is here.

824
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:55,950
What's wrong?

825
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,660
Nothing.

826
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:00,830
I'm fine.

827
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,470
Have a kumquat.

828
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,500
What's wrong?

829
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,540
It's sour.

830
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,390
Has it gone bad?

831
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,180
It's not sour.

832
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,430
Photo.

833
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,620
Photo?

834
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,660
You really enlarged it.

835
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,100
How did you do it?

836
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,790
The guys at the photo studio did it.

837
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,390
They must have their own ways.

838
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,220
Look.

839
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,350
Look at this picture of my mom.

840
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,790
She is so beautiful.

841
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,890
She was dressed colorfully.

842
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,860
Wearing a big earring.

843
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,790
When my mom told me,

844
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,760
I didn't believe her.

845
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,540
I saw a lot of photos
when I was going over them.

846
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,950
You haven't seen Aunt Hao yet.

847
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,350
When they were young,

848
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,660
they wore many matching outfits.

849
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,870
Really?

850
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,140
What a pity.

851
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,060
They don't dress up much now.

852
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,430
My mother always says

853
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,760
there is no need to dress up
after becoming a mother.

854
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,790
Everyone says time kills beauty.

855
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,500
I think

856
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,060
my parents' youth was stolen

857
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,270
by us

858
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,990
not the years.

859
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,220
When I was a kid,

860
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,910
I liked to browse our photo albums.

861
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,220
Then I thought

862
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,350
my parents in the photos

863
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,870
looked really energetic.

864
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,180
I just wanted to grow up quickly

865
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,950
and become the same as them.

866
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:58,870
Chen Huan'er,

867
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,350
when we become parents,

868
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,740
will this happen to us, too?

869
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,430
Us?

870
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,470
Becoming parents?

871
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,220
No.

872
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,620
I mean when we both...

873
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,180
Not really.

874
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,140
Have you ordered the cake?

875
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,790
When I ordered the cake two days ago,

876
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,270
they gave me a coupon.

877
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:31,980
Do you want it?

878
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,470
Why didn't you say it earlier?

879
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,540
I'll look for it.

880
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,470
Over here.

881
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:37,830
Right.

882
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,270
This one.

883
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,430
Thanks.

884
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,580
(Popular Recommendation)

885
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,020
This looks so good.

886
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,700
Must be delicious.

887
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,020
It does look good.

888
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,350
But it should be quite expensive.

889
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,580
Let's go in and take a look first.

890
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,660
(Popular Recommendation)

891
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,350
Hello there.

892
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,100
Hello.

893
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,910
I ordered a cake from here.

894
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,580
It was ordered by my dad.

895
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,750
I want to pay for it.

896
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,270
Hold on, let me check.

897
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,100
Did Uncle Chen order it?

898
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,950
I thought you ordered it.

899
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Last night, my dad

900
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,950
sent me a message.

901
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,470
I was quite surprised.

902
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,140
Maybe

903
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,500
he feels guilty for not coming.

904
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,310
Actually, it doesn't matter.

905
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,720
It doesn't matter who orders it.

906
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,620
Just checking with you.

907
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,540
(Fantasy Princess)
You have ordered the Fantasy Princess.

908
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,240
Am I right?

909
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,660
This one?

910
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:34,700
Yes.

911
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,390
It seems like in Uncle Chen's eyes

912
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,740
Aunt Lina is still a little princess.

913
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,140
Why do I think

914
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,830
it's kind of lame?

915
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,750
It's alright. Look.

916
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,800
It's all pink and tender.

917
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,940
Colorful.

918
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,870
Vibrant.

919
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,470
It is a little lame.

920
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:56,620
Right?

921
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,100
Sorry, can I switch to this one instead?

922
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,040
This one looks good.

923
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,740
Better than that.

924
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,780
I want to order this one.

925
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,340
Sure.

926
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,270
Just to be sure,

927
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,350
you'll collect it at 5 PM
on the day after tomorrow, right?

928
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,100
Yes.

929
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:12,830
Okay.

I have a coupon.

933

Can you give me a discount?

934
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,660
Sure.

Thanks.
