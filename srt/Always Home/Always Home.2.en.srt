(You Always Want What You Can't Get)

16
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,220
What's wrong with you today?

17
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,200
Why eat so little?

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,220
Does it taste bad
or do you have an upset stomach?

19
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,820
No.

20
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,990
I had some bread before evening study,

21
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,420
so I'm not too hungry.

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,940
If you don't want to eat, forget it.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,070
I'll put it away.

24
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,860
Mom, let me put it away.

25
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,020
Let me do it.

26
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,020
You're really sensible.

27
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,830
What are you doing?

28
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,680
You're walking so slowly.
Hurry up. Walk.

29
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,140
Mr. Song.

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Why did you
keep the lights off at night?

31
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,900
I just connected the lights
to electricity.

32
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,500
What are you standing there for,
Chen Huan'er?

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,100
Come here.

34
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,350
Let me introduce you.

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,220
This is the puppy
from our compound.

36
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,200
It's called Xiaodi.

37
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,340
But not that you're here,
you're the new Xiaodi.

38
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,900
Sit.

39
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,740
What are you waiting for?

40
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,550
Eat.

41
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,900
Let me tell you.

42
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,110
Aunt Hao

43
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,790
is the best cook in our compound.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,620
Since I was little, I've looked forward
to my mom working overtime

45
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,940
so that she can send me
to their house for a free meal.

46
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:44,900
I'm

47
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,950
really sorry.

48
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,140
I'm troubling...

49
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,550
Don't mention it.

50
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,460
Let me tell you.

51
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,420
Mr. Song gave me extra food
because he saw

52
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,860
how hard I trained.

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,040
Are you going to eat it?

54
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,110
I'll eat it if you don't.

55
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,700
What are you talking about?
Let her eat first.

56
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,990
Hurry.

57
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,140
Thank you.

58
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,990
It's good, right?

59
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,620
It's good.

60
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,350
I'll try it too.

61
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,420
I'm telling you.

62
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,670
We put a lot of effort
into this secret base.

63
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,710
None of the parents in this compound

64
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,710
expected us

65
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,710
to set up a blind spot

66
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,260
right along

67
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,670
their daily commute route.

68
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,740
Song Cong.

69
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,150
Song Cong?

70
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,710
Bring two more dishes to Huan'er.

71
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,820
Coming.

72
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,420
Mom.

73
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,030
Mom.

74
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,740
So is this where you saw me that day?

75
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,110
Yes.

76
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,710
But rest assured.

77
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,670
I

78
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,110
won't tell anyone about it.

79
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,990
I didn't cry that day.

80
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,740
I understand.

81
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,380
Girls

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,300
are self-conscious.

83
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,710
But don't worry.

84
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,300
Only heaven, earth, you, and I know

85
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
you cried

86
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,550
because of your exam.

87
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,150
No third person will know about it.

88
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,820
Enough.

89
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,550
Stop talking about Huan'er's crying.

90
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,150
No fourth person will know.

91
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,110
Rest assured.

92
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,820
Really.

93
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,350
I really didn't cry.

94
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,260
You didn't cry.

95
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,230
She said she didn't cry.

96
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:49,940
You don't believe?

97
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,500
I believe you.

98
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,180
You didn't cry.

99
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,620
Here, have a sip.

100
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,100
My mom's heavy-handed with seasoning.

101
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,700
Thank you.

102
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,470
There are so many dishes.

103
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,860
I can't finish it.

104
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,260
Don't mention it.

105
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,150
Everyone in this compound
knows each other.

106
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,860
Going to someone else's house for a meal

107
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,860
is like our parents
working shifts at work.

108
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,880
Since you're here
at the family housing compound,

109
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,180
follow the organization.

110
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,420
You should quickly adapt

111
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,180
and join us.

112
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,740
Next time when Aunt Lina is on duty,

113
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,150
come to my house for a meal.

114
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,230
If you refuse again,

115
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,500
my mom will be angry.

116
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,380
Fine.

117
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,420
I'll adapt

118
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,910
and try hard to keep up.

119
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,470
If you need us in the future,

120
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,150
text us "Secret Base".

121
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,180
And we'll know

122
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,820
you want to meet here in ten minutes.

123
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,590
Okay.

124
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,620
Great.

125
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,420
We're finally a trio again.

126
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,350
What do you mean you're a trio again?

127
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,710
Do you want to know?

128
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Lend me your homework for a week.

129
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,940
I'll tell you.

130
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,030
Don't keep me in suspense.

131
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,940
Just tell me.

132
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,300
It's Li Tian.

133
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,260
Li Tian?

134
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,180
Let's not talk about him.

135
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,820
Let's eat.

136
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,790
Go away.

137
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,420
Why didn't you bring it some food?

138
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,380
It eats a lot every day.

139
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,260
Here.

140
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,230
Call it your senior.

141
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,260
I'm not its junior.

142
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,470
I'm the boss. It's your senior.

143
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,230
Don't talk so much.

144
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,990
Here, look at her. She's your junior.

145
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,760
Your new junior.

146
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,420
Chen Huan'er

147
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,550
is your new junior.

148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,300
Does it need to be renamed?

149
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,700
You don't acknowledge it anymore?

150
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,040
What shall we name it then?

151
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,020
Call it Second Senior.

152
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,880
You're junior.

153
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,030
Song Cong, get up.

154
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,940
Huan'er.

155
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,150
I'm late.

156
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,120
I need to rush to work.

157
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,740
You hurry up.

158
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,380
Got it.

159
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,670
Morning.

160
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,040
You didn't have breakfast, right?

161
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,230
My mom made it.

162
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,180
Is it for me?

163
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,350
Thank you.

164
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,780
Cherish it.

165
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,460
It's my mom's turn tomorrow.

166
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,200
(Living in a family housing compound)

167
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,230
(finally showed an advantage.)

168
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,780
(You'll never go hungry.)

169
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,140
(I'm not afraid
of how busy Mom is at the hospital.)

170
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,710
(The families will help each other.)

171
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,430
(As for the cooking skills,)

172
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,380
(everyone is different.)

173
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,350
Are you really eating it?

174
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,620
I gave you and you really ate it!

175
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,360
What am I going to eat if you ate it?

176
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,780
Don't follow me.

177
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,070
(Our vegetable buns)

178
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,350
(still didn't receive
the family members' approval.)

179
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,740
When is Aunt Hao's day off?

180
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,660
If you don't like it, don't eat it.

181
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,060
(Tianhe No.1 Middle School)

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,190
I heard Song Cong
handed in his paper early that day

183
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,120
so that he could finish school
with Ms. Kao Sai.

184
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,860
Are they really...

185
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,830
Stop talking.

186
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,830
Huan'er.

187
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,070
Is there something going on
between you and Song Cong?

188
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,190
You believe it too?

189
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,620
But those who don't know
will believe it.

190
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,740
Nothing is going on.

191
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,700
(Exercise Book)

192
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,560
(Mathematics Questions)
Is it because of Song Cong's tutoring

193
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,520
that you made such great progress
in this exam?

194
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,230
Can I take his tutorials together?

195
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,230
Sure.

196
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,070
I'll talk to Song Cong.

197
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,500
Stand up.

198
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,070
Hello, Sir.

199
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,500
Hello, students.

200
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:59,860
(Honorary Credential,
Song Cong Won First Prize)

201
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,950
Mr. Song.

202
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,260
Are these leftover bottles
from infusions?

203
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,780
Empty saline bottles.

204
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,740
They're my dad's invention,

205
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,590
but I think

206
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,350
it's no different

207
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,590
than watering plants directly.

208
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,110
Mr. Song.

209
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,460
After we're done eating,

210
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,490
come to our house to play.

211
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,080
No.

212
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,860
I have to tutor Huan'er later.

213
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,620
Tutoring on weekends?

214
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,640
I asked you to play football last week,

215
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,600
but you needed to tutor.

216
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,180
I asked you to go to the base before,
but you were also tutoring.

217
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,140
You too.

218
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,040
You come here for tutoring every week.

219
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,120
You even freeload meals.
Don't you think it's far?

220
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,620
What's far?

221
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,920
We're all in the same compound.

222
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,260
Huan'er, eat it while it's hot.

223
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,190
Thank you.

224
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,470
As for you,

225
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,020
I've never seen you

226
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,080
so proactive when studying.

227
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,450
When it comes to mealtime,
you're more punctual than others.

228
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,540
Aunt Hao, I went to play football.

229
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,660
It's also a serious matter.

230
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,110
Your mother just told me today.

231
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,590
Even if you're a special student,

232
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,230
you can't fall behind in your studies.

233
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,470
I... Yes.

234
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,230
I'll stop talking.

235
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,540
I'll eat, alright?

236
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,350
Eat.

237
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,380
Aunt Hao, your cooking is delicious.

238
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,710
Much better than my mom's.

239
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,500
Really?

240
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,830
Eat more.

241
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,950
Chen Huan'er.

242
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,740
You're a bit unscrupulous now.

243
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,470
I'll tell your mom later.

244
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,590
How dare you?

245
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,310
Didn't you

246
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,400
flatter me before by saying

247
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,240
that my mom is the best cook
in the compound?

248
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,660
No. Why are you all

249
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,710
siding with her?

250
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,740
Chen Huan'er.

251
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,110
Let's do this one-on-one.

252
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,160
Don't seek outside help.

253
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,620
What one on one?

254
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,260
Tell me properly.

255
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,230
Can you make it more international?

256
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,110
Your English has improved.

257
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,310
Yes.

258
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,470
You're no longer Ms. Kao Sai?

259
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,190
Fine.

260
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,740
Let me drink some water to calm down.

261
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,430
That's my water.

262
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,830
I know it's yours.

263
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,380
Why did you drink it if you knew?

264
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,140
How delicate.

265
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,380
Everyone here shares their water.

266
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,440
What's wrong with drinking your water?

267
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,860
You have oil all over your hand.

268
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,620
Wash it.

269
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,110
I won't.

270
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,420
Wash it.

271
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,780
Whoever drank first should wash it.

272
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,560
Didn't you drink it?

273
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,320
I won't washing it.

274
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,430
Why did you break the rules?

275
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:58,780
Wash it.

276
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,460
What's wrong?

277
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,100
I'm not washing it.

278
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,110
I'm not washing it today!

279
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,620
Wash it.

280
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,080
Ouch.

281
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,680
Wash it or not?

282
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,190
Ouch.

283
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,140
My arm hurts.

284
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,860
Mr. Song!

285
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,540
Look at her hurting my elbow.

286
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,070
I'm in pain.

287
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,310
She hurt me like this.

288
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,230
I can't move. Look.

289
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,190
Enough.

290
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,110
Mr. Song, look.

291
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,590
I can't move, Mr. Song.

292
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,430
Be the judge here.

293
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,590
How can she do this?

294
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,110
She'll become the boss here soon.

295
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,950
Look.

296
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,470
Qi Qi should be here.

297
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,900
I'm going to pick up Qi Qi.

298
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,000
Mr. Song, I'll go downstairs first.

299
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,320
Open the door for me in a moment.

300
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,430
Qi Qi?

301
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,780
Is she coming for your tutorials?

302
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,660
Yeah.

303
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,950
Why didn't you say so earlier?

304
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,740
You didn't ask.

305
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,560
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

306
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,470
Studying, of course.

307
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,710
What are you looking at?

308
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,990
Even you made progress,

309
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,860
can't I get rid
of being the last in class?

310
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,660
You have a goal now.

311
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,260
Studying is a good thing.

312
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,740
It's good that everyone is together.

313
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,900
Qi Qi.

314
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,740
I bought some oranges.

315
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,310
I don't know if you like it.

316
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,350
Thank you, Aunt.

317
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,310
Don't mention it.

318
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,390
Song Cong. There's more.
Cut more if it's not enough.

319
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:40,620
Okay.

320
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,190
Don't exhaust yourselves from studying.

321
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,140
Take a break later.

322
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,900
I'm going to go.

323
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,990
Bye.

324
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,020
- Bye, Aunt Hao.
- Bye.

325
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,500
She's so nice.

326
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,660
Did she go out

327
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,900
because of me?

328
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,710
I'm so sorry

329
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,500
to bother you.

330
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,070
Don't overthink it.

331
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,740
My mom

332
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,190
is in a hurry to play mahjong.

333
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,470
Well, Aunt Hao,

334
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,540
my mom, her mom, and Li Tian's mom.

335
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,440
The four of them
are just enough to play.

336
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,500
Do all your parents know each other?

337
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,230
Of course.

338
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,470
Every parent in this compound
knows each other.

339
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,430
Li Tian from our class lives upstairs.

340
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,800
We've known each other
when we were wearing diapers.

341
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,900
In that case,

342
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,830
why don't you

343
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,990
ever go to school with Li Tian?

344
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,190
Because...

345
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,110
That's because

346
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,430
he's Dr. Li's son.

347
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,230
You even answered such a question wrong.

348
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,990
Did you even read it?

349
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,350
You didn't get full marks
because of this mistake.

350
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,900
You're not ashamed,

351
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,950
but I am.

352
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,620
Tian.

353
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,590
Although you're number one in class,

354
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,780
do you know

355
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,310
that Song Cong got full marks?

356
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,740
Tian.

357
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,430
You must work hard.

358
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,780
You know your father
has high expectations of you.

359
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,860
Here's a gossip.

360
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,540
Yesterday, Mrs. Li

361
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,990
scolded her son.

362
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,860
Did you know that?

363
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,260
I'm telling you.

364
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,950
Li Tian's mom scolded Li Tian again.

365
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,430
This kid is unfortunate.

366
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,230
I'm dying of laughter.

367
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,350
Your family housing compound
is really interesting.

368
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,900
Alright, enough.

369
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,620
Let's study.

370
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,430
- Sure.
- Okay.

371
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,240
Speaking of, Song Cong,

372
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,900
the problem you explained last time.

373
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,430
This one.

374
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,380
I haven't figured this out yet.

375
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,590
Can you explain it again?

376
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,000
I don't quite understand
this problem either.

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,580
Let me find it.

378
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,540
Let Song Cong explain.

379
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,340
He explains well.

380
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,140
Here.

381
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,540
You.

382
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,260
Come and listen together.

383
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,620
The problem goes like this.

384
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,340
We first need to look at the small ball.

385
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,380
When it's moving in the fourth quadrant,

386
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,990
t is equal to 0.25.

387
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,190
Write it down.

388
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,710
T is equal to 0.25.

389
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,670
When it's perpendicular
to the electric field e,

390
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,190
its direction of displacement is...

391
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,080
Your hair is annoying.

392
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,040
Can you put it there?

393
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,500
C is equal to 0.2m. Write it down.

394
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,580
0.2.

395
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,230
Direction of displacement.

396
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:24,870
Because...

397
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,780
Why are you so close to me?

398
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,390
I can't see over there.

399
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,340
I'm talking about this problem.

400
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,060
You already got here?

401
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,100
You're quite fast.

402
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,620
The ball is perpendicular
to the electric field e,

403
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,360
The direction of displacement is 0.2
when it's perpendicular to e.

404
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,100
Qi Qi.

405
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,780
You smell really good.

406
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,300
What shampoo do you use?

407
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,190
It's a British brand my mom bought me.

408
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,740
I'll bring you a bottle next time.

409
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,430
No thanks.

410
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,630
I'm just asking.

411
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,580
It's fine.

412
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,120
Do you want to study or not?

413
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,060
Yes.

414
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,580
Isn't 0.25t equal to...

415
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,950
T equals to 0.25.

416
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,820
Here, let me repeat it again.

417
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,910
Sure.

418
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,840
I didn't get it either.

419
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,990
Please repeat.

420
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,580
Look at the small ball first.

421
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,780
When the small ball
moves in the fourth quadrant,

422
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,900
"t" is equal to 0.25.

423
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,200
Song Cong is a good tutor.

424
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,960
(Tianhe No.3 Central Hospital Compound)
Yeah. I'll let you know once we

425
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,440
set a time for the next tutorial.

426
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,150
Be careful on your way home.

427
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,990
Message me when you get home.

428
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,870
Sure.

429
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,950
Huan'er.

430
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,300
I'll go now.

431
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,540
You don't need to see me off.

432
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,430
Bye.

433
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:52,990
Bye.

434
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,470
Bye.

435
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,390
I told you

436
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,700
not to stop at the entrance.

437
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,430
(Actually,)

438
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,950
(Qi Qi didn't walk to school.)

439
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,630
(She doesn't want attention.)

440
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,990
(She doesn't want people to think)

441
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,230
(she's more superior.)

442
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,630
Stop. Stop here.

443
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,820
She's just like me.

444
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,150
No.

445
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,060
She's even more eager to fit in
than I am.

446
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,300
(Red Bean and Taro Cake, ¥2.5)

447
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,430
Take it first.

448
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,990
Thank you.

449
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,130
There's also a red bean one.
You have to wait a while.

450
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,230
That many?

451
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,340
Why don't we share it?

452
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,950
I'll take this one.

453
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,100
Is it hot?

454
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,390
Can you give us a plastic bag?

455
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:47,950
Sure.

456
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,150
Here.

457
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,260
Thank you.

458
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,190
I'll help you.

459
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,390
Speaking of, Qi Qi,

460
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,950
is your car coming soon?

461
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Don't worry.

462
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,910
I won't

463
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,340
tell anyone about you.

464
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,740
It's okay. I told them

465
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,740
that the teacher's
ending the class late today.

466
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,150
Huan'er.

467
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,870
I envy your family housing compound.

468
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,470
You can go to and from school
with friends

469
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,500
and have a good relationship
with your parents.

470
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,820
Me?

471
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,870
You must be lonely then.

472
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,710
I went to private school
since I was a child.

473
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,910
The ones with boarding.

474
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,630
My parents often traveled around
back then,

475
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,390
so I kept transferring schools.

476
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,910
After a long time,

477
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,670
I gradually got used to being alone.

478
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,990
I get it.

479
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,780
My parents are often not at home too.

480
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,780
I'm always alone.

481
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,580
This taro cake

482
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,470
tastes better when shared.

483
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,390
That's not a problem.

484
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,990
We'll come here often.

485
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,190
Boss, remember the two of us.

486
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,500
Don't worry.

487
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,540
I'll remember you.

488
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,950
I got to go.

489
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,300
Boss.

490
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,820
Can you hurry up?

491
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,980
Her ride will be here soon.

492
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Alright, I'll hurry.

493
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,670
Thank you.

494
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,020
This is for you.

495
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,580
What's this?

496
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,760
Didn't you say last time
that my hair smelled good?

497
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,100
I can't take this.

498
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,870
It's fine. Take it.

499
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,860
I really can't take it.

500
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,080
Take it. I have a lot at home.

501
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,090
Qi Qi, it's too expensive.

502
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,640
Take it.

503
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,820
I'm leaving.

504
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,100
But...

505
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,900
(Zheng Lan Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic)

506
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,620
(He didn't go home after school.)

507
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,430
Mom.

508
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,020
My darling is back.

509
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,470
Mom.

510
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,300
Look.

511
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,000
Why are you behaving
like a little magpie?

512
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,340
Mom.

513
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,060
What's the matter?

514
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,560
Smell if this shampoo smells good.

515
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,390
It's good.

516
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,580
My deskmate gave it to me.

517
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:04,780
Really?

518
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,630
You made new friends so quickly.

519
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,430
My deskmate is called Qi Qi.

520
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,630
She's nice.

521
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,190
We have oranges.

522
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,540
She likes oranges too.

523
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,150
Mom.

524
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,870
Can I take some

525
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,950
for Qi Qi?

526
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,780
Sure, I'll buy more for you later.

527
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,150
By the way,

528
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,740
follow me to Li Tian's house
for a meal tomorrow.

529
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,580
Didn't Li Tian get first place
in the exam?

530
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,300
His mom is hosting a banquet.

531
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,230
She invited us.

532
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,910
I didn't do well in the exam.

533
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,150
Would it be awkward for me to go?

534
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,990
What's awkward about this?

535
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,200
When you do well in your exam,

536
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,190
I'll host a party too.

537
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,190
Besides,

538
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,300
you can have a chance to talk

539
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,910
to a top student if you go.

540
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,710
Right?

541
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,990
I have to talk to him?

542
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,340
Wouldn't that be more awkward?

543
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,910
We live in the same compound.

544
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,780
We can't avoid seeing each other.

545
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,710
Just go through it.

546
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,470
It's called socializing.

547
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,220
Did you wash your hands
before helping me with the vegetables?

548
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll wash them now.

549
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,100
You...

550
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,540
Here, food is served.

551
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,500
Taste it.

552
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,190
It's too much.

553
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,080
This dish is so good.

554
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,780
It's delicious.

555
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,430
Take these away later.

556
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,060
Dr. Li said

557
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,990
we need to give everyone some gifts.

558
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,140
That's what the head of the hospital
should do.

559
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,260
Thanks Dr. Li.

560
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,500
Without him,

561
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,780
I don't think
our family can move in here.

562
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,820
It's his duty.

563
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,860
Everything is good as long

564
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,640
as you don't mind
that your building is old.

565
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,800
I don't mind it.

566
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,020
Lina.

567
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,060
The building you live in is Phase 1.

568
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,870
It's older
than Dr. Li and Senior's buildings,

569
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,060
which are Phase 2.

570
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,230
But the people living in our compound
are all old hospital department heads.

571
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,870
So you don't need to go to the hospital

572
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,870
if you have a headache.

573
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,820
Knock on your neighbor's door,
and you'll get it treated.

574
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,820
Yeah.

575
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,950
But most importantly,

576
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,470
Phase 1 has good feng shui.

577
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,400
We all live
in the family housing compound,

578
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,950
but most of Phase 1's children

579
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,190
have good grades.

580
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,150
Really?

581
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,820
The kid who used to live in your unit

582
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,710
just got admitted
to Yenching University.

583
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,020
Really?

584
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,020
But there are also exceptions.

585
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,670
By the way, we've eaten for a long time,

586
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,190
why hasn't Dr. Li come back yet?

587
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
The fathers in our compound

588
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,670
are all the same.

589
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,390
They usually don't bother
with the children's studies.

590
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,470
They won't even come for a meal.

591
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,230
But Dr. Li is really busy.

592
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,540
He has to take care
of all the big and small matters

593
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,740
in the hospital.

594
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,260
Yeah.

595
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,500
I've said it before

596
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,670
that he could just be

597
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,950
the head of orthopedics department
like Mr. Song.

598
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,060
He'll be free.

599
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,470
How is he free?
He's having an operation right now.

600
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,540
Where are Song Cong and Xichi?

601
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,950
Xichi

602
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,950
will be late.

603
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,710
His class teacher is very responsible.

604
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,740
Even asking him
to take extra lessons on weekends.

605
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,390
That's good.

606
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,500
(Extra lessons?)

607
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,330
(He didn't go to extra classes.)

608
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,120
(Zheng Lan Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic)

609
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,910
I already said

610
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,630
that learning is the right way.

611
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,430
After all, sports training is hard.

612
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,580
Football, huh?

613
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,670
How many people succeed in the end?

614
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,870
Xichi almost entered a sports school.

615
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,870
He's also
the captain of the school team, right?

616
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,580
He's capable.

617
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,470
That's right.

618
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,910
What about Song Cong?

619
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,740
I wanted to ask him

620
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,230
to share his learning experience
with Tian.

621
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,300
He's taking TOEFL classes.

622
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,820
Starting this summer.

623
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,190
After all, we agreed beforehand

624
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,790
that he'd only apply to
the top five universities in the world.

625
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,870
Amazing.

626
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,820
I'm full, so I'll go back to my room.

627
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,910
Mom.

628
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,990
I'm full too.

629
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,740
I want to go home.

630
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,990
Share your learning experience

631
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,580
with Tian.

632
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,390
Go.

633
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,340
I shouldn't.

634
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,910
Go.

635
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,540
Go.

636
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,230
Go.

637
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,870
Go talk to him.

638
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,990
Mrs. Li, I'll go find Tian.

639
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,860
I didn't expect
your daughter to be so amazing.

640
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,430
I heard someone say

641
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,190
that she won some award.

642
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,020
Military boxing.

643
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,630
Isn't Chen a martial arts coach?

644
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,150
Mrs. Li, don't be scared.

645
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,470
Huan'er

646
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,990
never bullies the weak.

647
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,580
Really. She won't beat up Tian.

648
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,670
Eat some food.

649
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,300
Eat.

650
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,910
Do you read books entirely in English?

651
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,710
Amazing.

652
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,600
If you want to read,
take a book yourself.

653
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,230
If you have questions, find Song Cong.

654
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,360
If you want to make friends,
find Jing Xichi.

655
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,710
I know you don't like me.

656
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,630
You don't have to worry
about what my mom said.

657
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,740
Everyone will leave
after starting university.

658
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,580
There's no need to make friends

659
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,080
and go through this process.

Song Cong is also going abroad.

663
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,990
How come
you made up your mind in Senior One?

664
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
I made up my mind first.

665
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,820
Besides, students
who enter Tianhe Middle School

666
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,800
have decided
what they want to do in the future.

667
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,460
Do you think
they're all the same as you?

668
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,980
If you're curious, ask Song Cong.

669
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,260
Hello, Mrs. Li.

670
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,990
Song Cong's here.

671
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,060
I'm here to find Huan'er.

672
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,630

Song Cong.

Didn't we agree to have a tutorial
this afternoon?

675
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:44,900
Let's go.

676
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:46,710
Yes.

677
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,780
Well, let's talk again someday. Bye.

678
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,300
Well, I've eaten.

679
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,630
I'll go tutor her first.

680
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,540
We're leaving, Mrs. Li.

681
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,780
Sure.

(Certificate of Merit)

683
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,020
The problems you're looking at now are

684
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,880
some of the more basic problems
we've learned.

685
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,500
Just apply the formula and solve them.

686
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,280
But you have to memorize the formula.

687
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,670
If you really can't remember,

688
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,190
just look

689
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,260
at the formula notes I compiled for you.

690
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,540
Okay.

691
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,060
Try solving it first.

Why did you skip
your piano lesson today?

693
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,080
I went to my classmate's house.

694
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,150
I always reminded you

695
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,580
not to associate with bad students.

696
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,820
If you don't do well in this exam,

697
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,740
I will change your tutor

698
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,020
until you improve.

699
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,950
Well.

700
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,100
I won't be able
to come for tutoring anymore.

701
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,500
My mom is looking for a tutor for me.

702
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,820
Qi Qi,
this is just your second time here.

703
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,780
My...

704
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,020
My mom

705
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,300
is a little weird.

706
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,860
She previously wanted me
to go to an international class as well.

707
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,740
I asked her why.

708
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,990
She said it's because it's expensive.

709
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,060
Maybe she thinks

710
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,230
it's only good if you spend money.

711
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,630
It's normal for her

712
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
to have such ideas.

713
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,190
International class is good.

714
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,320
You'll get good teachers
and you can study abroad.

715
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,990
Why is everyone going abroad?

716
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,340
I saw Li Tian this morning.

717
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,580
He also wants to take TOEFL
and go abroad.

718
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,710
Li Tian's imitating Mr. Song.

719
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,790
He failed the admission test
for international class.

720
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,080
He's upset.

721
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,060
So you all already know

722
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,990
what you're going to do
after graduation?

723
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,870
I...

724
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,500
want to be a writer.

725
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,580
I want my children

726
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,990
to see that the entire passage

727
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,470
was written by their mom

728
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,600
when taking
a reading comprehension test.

729
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,910
That's

730
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,990
a really vicious idea.

731
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,580
What about Song Cong?

732
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,630
What do you want to do?

733
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,340
I haven't thought about it yet.

734
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,340
Maybe

735
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,780
I'll just do whatever I can.

736
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,500
Look, you're doing it again.

737
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,700
Why are you being humble?

738
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,910
Aunt Hao already planned it for him.

739
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:33,950
What plan?

740
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,120
He's going abroad.
Is there any need to say more?

741
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,200
From participating in competitions
and winning awards

742
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,740
to applying to prestigious schools.

743
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,780
He's different from us.

744
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,020
He's going to do great things.

745
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,630
It sounds so tiring.

746
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,630
Will such a planned life

747
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,340
make you happy?

748
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,260
No.

749
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,950
When I was young,

750
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,180
my grandpa took me
to the mountains to dig herbs.

751
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,120
He told me

752
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,740
the most amazing thing about plants
is that they have no heart.

753
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,470
Because
they have no feelings or emotions,

754
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,060
they can survive
only by natural instincts.

755
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,780
But humans are different.

756
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,670
Don't people live to be happy?

757
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,580
Don't say so much.

758
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,670
What is he unhappy about?

759
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,630
He's a top student.

760
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,190
Why are you so proud?

761
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,440
Aren't you envious?

762
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,420
Why should I be envious?

763
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,500
I'm not Li Tian.

764
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,470
Besides,
do you think I'm an ordinary guy?

765
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,260
If you want to see me in the future,

766
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,580
you have to make an appointment
with my club, Real Madrid

767
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,470
six months in advance.

768
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,630
Alright, hurry up.

769
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,200
Or we won't be able to finish this.

770
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,140
You don't believe me?

771
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,910
I believe you.

772
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,060
Really?

773
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,670
Really.

774
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,300
Then say you believe me.

775
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,910
I, Chen Huan'er, believe

776
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,780
Jing Xichi will become
a professional player

777
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,260
for Real Madrid in the future.

778
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,150
You believe me?

779
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:58,950
I do.

780
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,190
I have piano lessons, so I have to go.

781
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,470
Jing Xichi,
you don't need to see me off.

782
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,260
I'm not.

783
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,190
I'm going there too.

784
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,860
You want to learn
musical instruments too?

785
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,780
No.

786
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,180
I'm going to play football.
The football field is over there.

787
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,780
Sure.

788
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,430
Qi Qi.

789
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,710
What do you think

790
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,990
of what I just said?

791
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,340
What is it?

792
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,230
The one about me going to Real Madrid.

793
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,620
You don't believe me?

794
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,580
I happen to have a game next week.

795
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,160
Come and have a look if you have time.

796
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,500
I think I'll skip it.

797
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,190
I don't know much about these.

798
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,580
It's good that you have a hobby,

799
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,910
but our main duty is to study.

800
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,620
We still have to get good grades.

801
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,920
I'm leaving.
You don't have to see me off. Bye.

802
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,660
Come and have a look if you have time.

803
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,910
(Song Cong and Jing Xichi...)

804
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,140
(One can't tell others his dream.)

805
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,990
(The other one shared it)

806
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,270
(but was dismissed as a childish fantasy.)

807
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,140
(I don't know which is more frustrating.)

808
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,310
(But I still envy them.)

809
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,950
(At least they have goals.)

810
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,950
(I don't even know where to go.)

811
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,500
(I even used a small matter)

812
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,750
(like untied shoelaces)

813
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,180
(as an excuse to stay.)

814
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:43,990
Mom.

815
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,700
How come you're back so soon?

816
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,620
Why didn't you
chat with Li Tian's mom longer?

817
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,360
Isn't the position that my dad
is being evaluated for this time

818
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,100
quite important?

819
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,620
Let your dad worry about it himself.

820
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,060
If I stay any longer,

821
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,540
I'll flip the table.

822
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,350
You didn't see Li Tian's mom.

823
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,190
When I told her
you were taking TOEFL classes,

824
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,480
her face turned green with envy.

825
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,790
She's just jealous.

826
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,060
I think you're a little too sensitive.

827
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,470
Mom.

828
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,390
I'm sensitive?

829
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,270
Do you know

830
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,620
how many years they've been talking

831
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,830
about my low education level?

832
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,140
What happened in the end?

833
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,540
I still raised a child

834
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,220
who's a top student.

835
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,350
I also told them

836
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,390
my son

837
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,950
would only apply to
the top five universities in the world.

838
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,470
Here. Have some walnuts.

839
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,790
I have to thank you.

840
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,830
You really make our family proud.

841
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,500
Mom, these walnut were given to you.

842
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,870
Eat them yourself.

843
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,700
You usually think so hard at work.

844
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,870
I'm not eating. You can eat them.

845
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,870
You're my only child.

846
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,020
You're our family's only hope.

847
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,910
Eat more to supplement yourself.

848
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,060
I'll continue studying, Mom.

849
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,700
Take these.

850
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,870
Finish them. Here.

851
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,830
(Will such a planned life)

852
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,100
(make you happy?)

853
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,220
You're home.

854
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,790
Mom, I'm home.

855
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:49,910
Mom.

856
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,910
Did you get a promotion

857
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,020
or a pay raise?

858
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,180
You spent so much money.

859
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,910
That's why I said you're dumb.

860
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,430
You're so oblivious.

861
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,470
Look who's back.

862
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,950
Dad!

863
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,060
Dad!

864
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,750
My girl.

865
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,350
I missed you so much.

866
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,990
Dad, what's going on?

867
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,900
You betrayed me.
You didn't tell me in advance.

868
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,350
I wanted to surprise you.

869
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,500
Here, let me see
if you've grown stronger.

870
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,100
Good job. You kid...

871
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,020
Grappling hand?

872
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,920
How many times have I told you
not to hurt her?

873
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,870
You think I'll hurt her?

874
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,020
She'll hurt me.

875
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,900
Good job. I can tell
you've been practicing a lot lately.

876
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,620
But you guessed wrong.

877
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,340
I've been so busy with my studies lately

878
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,750
that I don't have time to practice.

879
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,100
How can you be so proficient
without any practice? Good job.

880
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,740
There are so many meat, Mom.

881
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,100
You've worked hard.

882
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,870
Dad, you don't you know.

883
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,960
Mom rarely cooks this for me
when you're not around.

884
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,100
How dare you

885
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,870
complain?

886
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,990
Look at this seafood.

887
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,720
This shrimp.
I didn't even have this meat.

888
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,870
Eat more.

889
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,620
Eat more.

890
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,100
I abused you.

891
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,390
No.

892
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,060
No.

893
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,540
Come on. Hurry.

894
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,700
The air today is really...

895
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:08,790
Dad.

896
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,270
Did you fart?

897
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,540
Mom, he farted.

898
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,990
This smells like your mom.

899
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,620
Cut it out.

900
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,060
You ate too much corn.

901
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,060
Dad.

902
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,580
Since you're also here,

903
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,750
what do you want me to do in the future?

904
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,870
Jing Xichi and Song Cong's families

905
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,270
already have plans for them.

906
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,100
I'm sure you have one for me too, right?

907
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:30,950
- No.
- No.

908
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,660
Huan'er.

909
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,900
Actually, you can do anything you want.

910
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,240
Yes.

911
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,640
It's fine if you don't do anything.

912
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,190
That's right.

913
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,950
How can that work?

914
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,620
Dad, Mom, let me tell you.

915
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,750
Our classmates

916
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,790
are all

917
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,140
ambitious and have goals.

918
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,220
Although we come from a small place,

919
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,350
we must also have ambitions.

920
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,310
Right?

921
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,580
Ambitions?

922
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,270
Huan'er.

923
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,500
Dad.

924
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,660
Actually,

925
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,500
you have plenty of time to think.

926
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:04,910
Yes.

927
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,270
There's no rush.

928
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,790
Take your time.

929
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,750
Take one step at a time.

930
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,320
That's right.

931
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,180
Got it, Mom.

932
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,870
Aren't you talking
about the tortoise and the hare?

933
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,310
I'm the tortoise.

934
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,310
I'll win in the end, right?

935
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,220
Girlie.

936
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,580
- Life is not a competition.
- Yes.

937
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,310
Why do you have to win or lose?

938
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,310
It's okay if we don't win, right?

939
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:23,660
Yes.

940
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,500
We just hope

941
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,270
you're healthy.

942
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,660
Yes.

943
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,700
Health and happiness
are the most important.

944
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,750
That's right.

945
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,100
Dad, Mom, actually...

946
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,140
Enough talking.

947
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,310
You don't get it.

948
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,140
Children nowadays are so tired.

949
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,060
Yeah.

950
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,180
Why must there

951
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,220
be a win or lose?

952
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,020
It's not like how it used to be for us.

953
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,700
You know, it used to be easy.

954
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,830
Dad, Mom, your child's right here.

955
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,910
If you can kick this bottle

956
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,100
with every kick,

957
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,120
you will be close
to being a professional.

958
00:39:59,620 --> 00:39:59,950
Come on.

959
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,750
You're not even close.

960
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,430
Again.

961
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,580
It's fine.

962
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,500
It's only my first kick.

963
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,880
If I kick it 10,000 times,

964
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,320
I'll definitely be able to kick it.

965
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,060
Again.

966
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,160
That's enough from you.

967
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,750
You're such a lousy player,
yet you want to play professionally.

968
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,910
Just treat it as a hobby.

969
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,430
No, Dad.

970
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,180
Let me try again.

971
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,260
I'll give it another try.

972
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,750
Listen.

973
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,420
Use your thigh to bring out your calf.

974
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,620
This is where you exert force.

975
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,180
Let me try.

for the competition by 20 minutes.

982
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,870
So it's to lay the groundwork.

983
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,700
There was a traffic jam that day.

984
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,870
And I won a place in the competition.

985
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,100
I just hope you can agree
to let me change classes.

986
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,020
Why do you have to change classes?

987
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,830
I've made up my mind.

988
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,580
