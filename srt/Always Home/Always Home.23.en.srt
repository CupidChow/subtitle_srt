Liu Yuan.

17
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,940
You told me the questions
were authentic.

18
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,960
Why didn't I get any question right?
Explain.

19
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,110
Pal.

20
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,390
You got it wrong.

21
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,340
How could I

22
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,270
get the real questions?

23
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,420
What I sold you are

24
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,220
the mock questions I compiled
from previous

25
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,990
years' advanced mathematics exams.

26
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,180
I spent 500 yuan
to buy your mock questions?

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,800
Which one of us is crazy?

28
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,620
Pal.

29
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,390
Speak with evidence.

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,950
Don't make unfounded accusations.

31
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,580
Even so,

32
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,460
if I sold the real questions,

33
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,950
it would be cheating.

34
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,700
You should report me
to the dean's office

35
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,580
instead of buying my exam questions.

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,460
Forget it.

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,270
You old fraud.

38
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,700
Come down!

39
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,390
Forget it.

40
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Don't argue with him.

41
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,760
Forget it. Let's go.

42
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,620
Come down!

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,110
Don't.

44
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,620
Calm down.

45
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,180
You old fraud!

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,620
Go.

47
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,620
Enough.

48
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,950
(Calm)

49
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,070
Why did you stop me just now?

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,790
I should have beaten him black and blue

51
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,900
and given him a lesson.

52
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,550
Just save your energy.

53
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,350
You should

54
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,830
take this as a lesson.

55
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,900
Just don't do it again.

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:50,900
No.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,080
I can't swallow this.

58
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,920
Come back.

59
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,700
Think about it.

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,660
If you beat him up,

61
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,180
not only you can't get your money back,

62
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,720
but you also pay
for his medical expenses.

63
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,540
People like him

64
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,620
will blackmail you.

65
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,700
You'll suffer.

66
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,350
Jeez.

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,620
Jing's right.

68
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,580
You

69
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,240
should endure it
and let things calm down.

70
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,230
I understand.

71
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,420
Endure it?

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,440
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

73
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,950
Anger will hurt your liver, young man.

74
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,620
No.

75
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,830
It's easy for you to say.

76
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,830
It's 500 yuan.

77
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,020
I can buy so many eggs.

78
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,140
No.

79
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I want to beat him!

80
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,860
Don't stop me!

81
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,420
I'm going to beat him!

82
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,900
- Calm down!
- Put me down!

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,110
(As for Huang Lu and Qiu Li...)

92
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,700
(One scored 56.)

93
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,140
(One scored 59.)

94
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,110
(Obviously,)

95
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,950
(Qiu Li who scored 59)

96
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,900
(is angrier than Huang Lu.)

97
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,440
How come you scored more than me?

98
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,740
Aren't I still one mark short?

99
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,550
Hello, Sir.

100
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,020
Could you help me check

101
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,420
and see if you miscalculated?

102
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,380
(As for me,)

103
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,990
(not that bad.)

104
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,500

a lot of room for improvement.)

(But what I didn't expect
is that Jing Xichi)

108
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,230
(is no longer
at the bottom of the class)

109
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,800
(like he did in senior middle school)

110
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,680
(and got full marks
in Advanced Mathematics.)

111
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,060
(But no matter how we did in the exam,)

112

preludes in the river of time.)

114
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,710

(Ultrasound Diagnostic Report)

117
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,150
Enough.

118
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,550
Stop looking at it.

119
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,940
We'll only know

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,080
if it's benign or malignant
after the biopsy.

121
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,350
What's a biopsy?

122
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,860
A biopsy means cutting it out

123
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,140
for an examination.

124
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,080
Hurry and do it then.

125
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,030
What are you doing here?

126
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,990
Do you think it's as easy
as cutting vegetables?

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,420
You'll make an appointment.

128
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,820
So have you made an appointment?

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,020
Yes.

130
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,380
Take it easy.

131
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,420
I'm a doctor.

132
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,590
I know what to do.

133
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,030
You make it sound so simple.

134
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,470
How could I not be nervous?

135
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,110
Swallow it.

136
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,060
Don't let Huan'er know.

137
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,500
She will be back soon.

138
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,740
Hurry and put it away.

139
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,940
We have a table of vegetables to pick.

140
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,110
Hurry!

141
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,550
Mom.

142
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,300
Put it away.

143
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,590
I'm back!

144
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,420
Coming!

145
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,230
My daughter is back.

146
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,060
Mom!

147
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,420
Darling, you're back.

148
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,670
Chubby bunny.

149
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,100
Let me see

150
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,260
- if you gained weight.
- Your dad had been waiting.

151
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,060
One, two, three.

152
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,350
She's like a piglet.

153
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:52,990
Put her down.

154
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,260
You're old now. Watch your waist!

155
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,670
Not bad.

156
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,500
You gained weight.

157
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,620
Did I gain weight?

158
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,110
No.

159
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,820
Hurry. Sit.

160
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,820
I almost forgot...

161
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,380
Dad, Mom.

162
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,990
I have a surprise for you.

163
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,030
You brought us gifts?

164
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,380
Yes.

165
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,470
Did you buy our gifts

166
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,590
with our money?

167
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,420
- Jeez.
- Here.

168
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,790
I prepared it myself.

169
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,550
Really?

170
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,670
Here, let me see.

171
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,740
Gosh.

172
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,670
Look at this.

173
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,080
Look who she took after.

174
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,300
Oh no.

175
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,620
No, Chen Huan'er.

176
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,710
What are you doing?

177
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,380
You have to tighten these bottles

178
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,110
before putting them in.

179
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,110
You just put

180
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,740
everything in.

181
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,820
Now I know.

182
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,060
It's my fault for not nurturing

183
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,300
your life skills well.

184
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,710
Enough.

185
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,860
What will you do without me?

186
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,980
I knitted the scarves myself.

187
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,790
Stop nagging.

188
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,110
Enough.

189
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,500
It's a token of her sincerity.

190
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,710
I knitted

191
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,860
this red one for you.

192
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,180
The blue one is for Dad.

193
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,860
Sure.

194
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,990
There are only a few more stitches left.

195
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,040
I'll hurry up these days.

196
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,620
It's fragrant.

197
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,140
How nice.

198
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,790
Do you like it, Mom?

199
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,260
This color

200
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:46,820
is not bad.

201
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,740
The stitching

202
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,040
is not bad either.

203
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,470
You're talented.

204
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,180
My classmate taught me.

205
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,590
Good.

206
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,350
Chen.

207
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,670
Hurry and wash it for me.

208
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,420
I don't need to buy a scarf this year.

209
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,420
Okay.

210
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,990
Wash it clean.

211
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,710
Do you like it?

212
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,350
Okay.

213
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,910
My daughter did a good job.

214
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,740
Come and sit down.

215
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
I have something for you.

216
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,030
How comfortable.

217
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,500
Mom.

218
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,860
I want beef with celery today.

219
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,940
Your favorite
stir-fried beef with celery.

220
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,710
Here.

221
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,740
Sign this.

222
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,140
(Insurance Contract)
Insurance?

223
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,230
Why did you suddenly buy insurance?

224
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,550
I thought it was suitable

225
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,670
and bought it for you.

226
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,790
You'll be insured
and won't suffer any loss.

227
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,230
Besides,

228
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,030
you're a grown-up girl.

229
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,470
Huan'er.

230
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,860
You've grown up.

231
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,800
You need to learn
to take care of yourself.

232
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,420
I can't

233
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,470
stay by your side forever.

234
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,110
No.

235
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,820
I want to be with you forever.

236
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,820
I don't care.

237
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,710
Enough.

238
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,440
Hurry and put those things away.

239
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,110
Later,

240
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,590
Song Cong, Jing and their families

241
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,660
will be here for a meal.

242
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,300
Look at you.

243
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,790
When will they be here?

244
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,030
Soon.

245
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,620
I don't care. Put it away yourself.

246
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,420
Mom, I'll put it in the toilet first.

247
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,590
How dare you come back?

248
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,440
Why did you change your major?

249
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,110
Many people try very hard to get into

250
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,480
the law program at University
of Political Science and Law.

251
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,830
Look at you!

252
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,990
You changed to some literature?

253
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,830
I'm just trying

254
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,840
to do what I want.

255
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,320
You're using your family's money

256
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,470
to do what you want.

257
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,190
What an easy life.

258
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,660
You don't have
to pressure me with money.

259
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,580
I know that parents have no obligation

260
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,960
to support their adult children.

261
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,820
I'll find a way to pay
for my future tuition.

262
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,880
You don't have to worry.

263
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,230
I'm an adult now.

264
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,540
You're no longer my guardian.

265
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,320
You've grown capable
since going to university.

266
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,590
Sure.

267
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,470
Since you're talking to me
about the law,

268
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,500
let me tell you

269
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,350
that adult children
have a lifetime obligation

270
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,540
to support their parents.

271
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,070
As long as I live,

272
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,070
you'll always be my daughter.

273
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,990
You can never repay

274
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,950
what you owe me.

275
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,350
Okay.

276
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,990
Go ahead and sue me, Ms. Qi.

277
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,430
I'll repay you whatever amount
the court sentences me.

278
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,110
By then,

279
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,190
we'll be completely even.

280
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,310
Be careful. Don't burn yourself.

281
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,830
Here.

282
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,620
Be careful.

283
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,500
Be careful, Mom.

284
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
It's hot, Mom.

285
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,590
Amazing. You cooked so much.

286
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,500
Here.

287
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,140
Here.

288
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,710
Here, you can start.

289
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,300
You can do it.

290
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,190
We three families

291
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,540
are having
a pre-new year's dinner tonight.

292
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,420
I'll propose a toast.

293
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,470
Congratulations to each of us

294
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,110
for spending another year safely.

295
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,230
Happy Chinese New Year.

296
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,440
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

297
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,860
Lina, you're awesome.

298
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,590
You made so much food.

299
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,020
Good job. Your cooking has improved.

300
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,740
Alright.

301
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,860
My and Chen's cooking

302
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,230
are far inferior to Hao Mei's.

303
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,540
Yes.

304
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,350
Kids.

305
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,540
Don't be picky.

306
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,660
Make do with the food.

307
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,740
Sure.

308
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,660
No, when is your husband coming?

309
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,880
Don't even mention it.

310
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,080
A call from the hospital this afternoon
called him away.

311
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,460
I told him we'd have dinner together

312
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,110
and come early.

313
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,460
Or he would have to wash the pots.

314
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,260
That's right.

315
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,190
Ask him to hurry up.

316
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,020
Speak of the devil.

317
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,780
He's here.

318
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,070
Not bad. He's fast.

319
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,990
Not bad. Look at him.

320
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,740
Yeah.

321
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,460
He made it in time.

322
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,880
He knows we have delicious food today.

323
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,520
That's right.

324
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,710
Qi Qi?

325
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,230
Why are you here?

326
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,110
Huan'er, I had a fight with my mom.

327
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,340
Can I stay at your house for a few days?

328
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,620
What happened?

329
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,470
I'll tell you later.

330
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,110
Hurry.

331
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,740
Hurry inside.

332
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,590
Mom.

333
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,620
Qi Qi came to visit us today.

334
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,830
Well...

335
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,430
Hello, everyone.
Sorry for bothering you.

336
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,060
Qi Qi's here.

337
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,190
Sit here.

338
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,470
Huan'er, get a pair of chopsticks.

339
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,950
Okay.

340
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,230
- Get a set of tableware.
- Okay.

341
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,140
Sorry for bothering you.

342
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,740
No.

343
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,380
It's fine.

344
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,140
Look.

345
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,140
All senior middle school students

346
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,470
are now university students.

347
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,140
Not bad, right?

348
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,020
Huan'er.

349
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,990
Have you grown taller?

350
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,840
Right?

351
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,560
- She did.
- She seems to have grown taller.

352
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,620
Did she? Why do I feel like

353
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,620
she's shorter than when I first met her?

354
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,800
Who's short? Get up.

355
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,460
Let's compare it.

356
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,280
Have I grown taller?

357
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,780
Enough.

358
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,500
- Have I grown taller?
- Who's taller?

359
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,260
I've grown taller!

360
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,900
Hurry up.

361
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,140
Come over and eat.

362
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,310
You two argue every day.

363
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,540
Troublemakers.

364
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,590
Lina.

365
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,780
I think Huan'er
is a good match for Xichi.

366
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,310
Yifan.

367
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,860
Be kind.

368
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,140
I have my eye on Chen Huan'er first.

369
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,230
She's my daughter-in-law.

370
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,400
You can't steal her from me.

371
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,350
Your son is handsome

372
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,190
and capable.

373
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,300
He'll find a girlfriend.

374
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,830
Yeah.

375
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,740
Xichi is incapable.

376
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,350
Look at that silly kid.

377
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,620
He's indeed handsome.

378
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,950
I won't argue with you on this.

379
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,470
But his personality and temper

380
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,720
are just like his dad's.

381
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,540
Too inarticulate.

382
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,190
He's unlike Xichi,

383
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,740
who's good-natured and clever.

384
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,860
My son is incapable.

385
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,460
That's why...

386
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:21,900
Okay.

387
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,070
That's not what you said.

388
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,540
How could you two

389
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,500
say that?

390
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,620
I can't stand it anymore. You know that?

391
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,110
Yeah.

392
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,540
Are you saying that Huan'er
can only pick what's left?

393
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,590
That's not what I meant.

394
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,900
Have you two decided

395
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,070
on Huan'er's marriage?

396
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,540
Yeah.

397
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,310
Whether my daughter's
looking for a boyfriend

398
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,020
has to ask her father
for permission first.

399
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,590
Right?

400
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,310
Chen.

401
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,140
Calm down.

402
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,860
These children

403
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,780
are in university now.

404
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,230
It's time to get into a relationship.

405
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,070
Yifan.

406
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:44,990
In this society...

407
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,350
Alright.

408
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,020
My dears.

409
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,620
Stop arguing.

410
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,470
Huan'er.

411
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,710
While everyone is here,

412
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,780
take your pick.

413
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,590
Will you pick Xichi

414
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,430
or Song Cong?

415
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:52,990
What?

416
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,590
We have to stick together, you know?

417
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,430
You can't do this.

418
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,020
Aunt.

419
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,310
Aunt.

420
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,190
Aunt.

421
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,430
Song Cong and I are dating.

422
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,140
It's...

423
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,430
We're dating.

424
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,620
I haven't had time to tell you yet, Mom.

425
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,470
Hao Mei.

426
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,380
Hao Mei, not bad.

427
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,350
Jeez.

428
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,680
Listen to the way you put it.

429
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,470
Not bad.

430
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,830
Not bad, Hao Mei.

431
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,070
Girlie.

432
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,950
Take my seat.

433
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,780
Here.

434
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,990
Why is this person like this?

435
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,880
I really didn't know.

436
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,070
Aunt Hao.

437
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
I was just joking.

438
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,430
It's alright, Aunt Hao.

439
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,300
I'm not picky. I can eat anything.

440
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:43,830
Mom.

441
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,540
Qi Qi's staying here today.

442
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,590
Sure.

443
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,900
Huan'er, accompany me

444
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,230
to buy some toiletries later.

445
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,590
Sure.

446
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,060
Jing Xichi.

447
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,830
Accompany me later.

448
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,950
Song, are you going?

449
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,190
No.

450
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
After dinner,

451
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,430
I'll help Aunt Lina

452
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,110
clean up.

453
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,020
No need.

454
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,990
I can also take my mom home later.

455
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,740
It's alright.

456
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,900
Go with Qi Qi.

457
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,900
It's fine.

458
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,120
Let Song Cong take care of you.

459
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,690
How sensible.

460
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,310
Look at her.

461
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,340
You should learn from her.

462
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,620
So...

463
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,590
I...

464
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm not your little girl anymore.

465
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,680
He's a doting father.

466
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,590
I think...

467
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,540
If you don't let him eat,
how can he pick?

468
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,380
Enough, Yifan.

469
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,900
Stop

470
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,380
playing matchmaker.

471
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,070
You speak as if it's true.

472
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,070
Xichi, learn from him.

473
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,660
Silly child.

474
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,780
Chen Huan'er.

475
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,590
Are you not tired of eating
the same thing every day?

476
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,800
None of your business.

477
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,540
Qi Qi.

478
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
Do you want to try it?

479
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,070
No.

480
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,500
I'm full.

481
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,190
What's wrong?

482
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,070
You don't seem alright.

483
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,220
Are you thinking about your family?

484
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,110
No.

485
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,900
I just regret

486
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,660
what I said at the dinner table.

487
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,110
Walk forward.

488
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,340
Don't listen to our chat.

489
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,620
I'm not listening to you.

490
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,960
I'm listening to music.

491
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,590
It's alright.

492
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,780
You were

493
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,950
just helping me out.

494
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,780
Besides,

495
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,740
Aunt Hao and Uncle Song are nice.

496
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,140
And they like you.

497
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,900
But I think

498
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,620
Song Cong is a little upset.

499
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,260
Is he?

500
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,350
Yes.

501
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,020
Do you think

502
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,900
Song Cong dislikes me?

503
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,190
No way.

504
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,590
If he dislikes you,

505
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,830
why would he confess to you?

506
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,070
If he dislikes you,

507
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,190
he won't acknowledge

508
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,620
your relationship.

509
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,110
He's not that unreliable.

510
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,540
Don't overthink it.

511
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,740
You're right.

512
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,740
Go to

513
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,620
Song's house later.

514
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,780
I don't want to eat anymore.

515
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,500
Really?

516
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,310
It's delicious.

517
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,590
I don't want to eat anymore.

518
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,740
It's all fried food.

519
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:12,830
Song.

520
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,190
Why do I feel like you're
acting a little weird today?

521
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,990
Isn't it good to talk things out?

522
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,500
Why are you still upset?

523
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,350
I'm not upset.

524
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,350
I just think

525
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,780
it's embarrassing

526
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,260
to say this in front of my parents.

527
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,980
What's embarrassing about that?

528
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,300
Are you not embarrassed?

529
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,590
Why didn't you admit

530
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,080
you liked Chen Huan'er during dinner?

531
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,860
We're talking about you.

532
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,070
Why are you involving me?

533
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,860
I think Qi Qi was quite upset

534
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,660
when we got back just now.

535
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,590
Uncle Song.

536
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,110
Dad.

537
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,020
Xichi is also here.

538
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,670
I heard from your mom

539
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,260
that you have a girlfriend.

540
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,190
It's a good thing.

541
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,580
Your mom asked me to talk to you.

542
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,580
I don't know what to talk about.

543
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,150
Many concepts

544
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,150
at my age are outdated.

545
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,190
They might not help you,

546
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,580
but there's one thing
I want to remind you.

547
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,470
Adults

548
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,540
must take responsibility
for their choices.

549
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,910
If you really like her,

550
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,340
just be bold and go after her.

551
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,260
If you got together,

552
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,740
cherish her.

553
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,430
Don't hesitate.

554
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,640
Otherwise,
the losses will outweigh the gains.

555
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,230
I hope you can learn

556
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,020
how to love others

557
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,430
and yourself

558
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,430
through dating.

559
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,100
Song Cong.

560
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,540
It's your life.

561
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,910
There are many things
you will only understand

562
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,760
if you experience them yourself.

563
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,390
I think your dad made a good point.

564
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
Think about it yourself.

565
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:30,508
You're leaving?

566
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:31,142
Yes.

567
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,670
(Do you)

568
00:18:57,742 --> 00:18:59,400
(want to go to the movies tomorrow?)

569
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,670
Mom, I'm back.

570
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:22,870
Mom.

571
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,230
Have you grown taller?

572
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:49,910
Yeah.

573
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:51,371
You're like an adult now.

574
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:55,085
I got to go.

575
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:19,950
Mom.

576
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,670
Mom?

577
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:23,375
What are you doing?

578
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,500
Well.

579
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,819
I'm taking out another set
of the bowls and chopsticks

580
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,100
that we usually use.

581
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,300
Your grandma is coming

582
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,275
to celebrate the Chinese New Year
with us this year.

583
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,725
My grandma is coming?

584
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,500
Great.

585
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,350
What's the matter?

586
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,250
Is Qi Qi asleep?

587
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,190
She got a message from Song Cong,

588
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,720
saying they're going on a date tomorrow.

589
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:44,050
She's taking her beauty sleep.

590
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,060
Did you ask

591
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,375
what did she argue with her mom about?

592
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,670
She wants to switch
to a literature major.

593
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:51,470
Her mom disagreed,

594
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:52,710
so they had an argument.

595
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,500
You must admit that Qi Qi

596
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,540
is pretty opinionated.

597
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,864
She confessed in front of everyone

598
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,990
that she was dating Song Cong.

599
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:03,320
She's quite brave.

600
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,470
She is indeed brave.

601
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,340
Mom.

602
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,540
If a girl

603
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,100
has someone she likes,

604
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,390
should she take the initiative?

605
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,540
Of course.

606
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,190
Huan'er, I'm telling you.

607
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,190
It's not easy

608
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,950
to meet the right person

609
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:23,910
in your life.

610
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,390
Once you meet one,

611
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,470
go after him.

612
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,060
Girls taking the initiative

613
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,670
isn't shameful.

614
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,100
Huan'er.

615
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,780
Young people nowadays

616
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
are more open-minded.

617
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:38,060
After you start a relationship,

618
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,020
you must remember

619
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,820
to protect yourself.

620
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,950
Take safety measures.

621
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,589
And all that stuff about a safe period

622
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,419
- is nonsense.
- Mom.

623
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,384
You can't believe it.

624
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:46,584
I don't have a boyfriend.

625
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:47,870
Why are you telling me this?

626
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,820
Well...

627
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,430
I have a lot

628
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,060
to tell you.

629
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,390
I'll tell you

630
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,340
as early as I can.

631
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,670
Or what if I don't have time?

632
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:56,664
You don't have time?

633
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,430
Nothing.

634
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,190
Go to bed.

635
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,020
Good night, Mom.

636
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,060
The fifth row.

637
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,780
This outfit

638
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,710
doesn't look like yours.

639
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,160
I'm wearing Huan'er's clothes.

640
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,100
You haven't made up with Aunt yet?

641
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,500
No.

642
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,260
I didn't expect you

643
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,200
to ask me out to watch a movie.

644
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,630
Qi Qi.

645
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,540
I will try my best

646
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,750
to be your boyfriend.

647
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,540
But this is my first time
being someone's boyfriend.

648
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,230
So if there's anything
I'm not doing well,

649
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,325
you have to tell me.

650
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,470
Sure.

651
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,190
But you need to think it through.

652
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,430
I have high requirements.

653
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,060
I'll try my best.

654
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,870
I'm just kidding.

655
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,340
Actually,

656
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,670
I'm content

657
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,825
as long as the two of us

658
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,190
can be together.

659
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,340
I had a chat

660
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,430
with my dad last night.

661
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,100
They're supportive

662
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,025
of our relationship.

663
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,670
Really?

664
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,710
You even told your dad?

665
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,190
Yes.

666
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:34,275
Here's a reward.

667
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,525
Have you told your mom?

668
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:43,780
I...

669
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,190
I haven't.

670
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,950
Let's watch the movie.

671
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,650
Song Cong,
time for Chinese New Year's Eve dinner.

672
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:34,540
Coming.

673
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,820
Food is coming.

674
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,100
Mom, stop busying yourself.

675
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
It's okay.

676
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,670
Give me.

677
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,230
Mom.

678
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,540
My cooking isn't as good as yours.

679
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,260
No.

680
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,230
Your cooking is much better than mine.

681
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,300
I wish Grandma, Dad, and Mom

682
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,910
good health, good luck,

683
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,670
peace, and harmony.

684
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:58,630
Happy Chinese New Year.

685
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:00,950
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- What a sweet talker.

686
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,100
Thank you, Huan'er.

687
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,340
Here.

688
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,630
New year, new beginnings.

689
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,910
Your dad and I have
no other hope for you.

690
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,340
We only wish you

691
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,190
good health and peace in the new year.

692
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,300
Here.

693
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:14,125
Happy Chinese New Year.

694
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,425
Happy Chinese New Year.

695
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,100
Try your dad's cooking.

696
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,225
Happy Chinese New Year.

697
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:41,675
Happy Chinese New Year, Mom.

698
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,350
I forgot to get the dumplings.

699
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,670
Mom, let me get them.

700
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,910
Huan'er has grown up.

701
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,175
You take care of your mom now.

702
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,740
No, there's still a long way off.

703
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,190
She's forgetful and careless.

704
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:26,425
(Dr. Qian, I heard about your situation.
It's best to get a biopsy done soon.)

705
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,525
(Dr. Qian.)

706
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,225
(I heard about your situation.)

707
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:45,650
(It's best to get a biopsy done
after Chinese New Year.)

708
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,775
(It's better to do it
sooner rather than later.)

709
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,390
Mom.

710
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,500
Mom.

711
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,020
Mom.

712
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,190
Why did you get up so early?

713
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,400
You didn't even wake me up.

714
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:01,975
Jeez.

715
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,990
I'm used to it.

716
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,950
Did Chen Lei make breakfast for you?

717
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,540
No, I made it.

718
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,390
Why didn't Chen Lei do it for you?

719
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,540
He went to the temple

720
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,470
to pray.

721
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,430
Okay.

722
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,390
I'll leave him alone then.

723
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,060
Are you watching TV?

724
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,260
It's mute.

725
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,100
I'm just watching for fun.

726
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,060
You're still asleep.
I was worried I'd disturb you.

727
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,780
It's okay.

728
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,950
Huan'er is still asleep.

729
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,950
Look at the time.

730
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,900
She's still lying in bed at this age.

731
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,740
It's time to wake up.

732
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,400
Why are you also acting like a child?

733
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,580
I never grow up.

734
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:36,825
You're arguing with her?

735
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,150
Mom.

736
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,910
Grandma.

737
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:46,619
Happy Chinese New Year.

738
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,650
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

739
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,340
Look.

740
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,150
Mom.

741
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:53,260
She's already in university,

742
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,900
yet you're still giving her
a red envelope.

743
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,775
- Thank you, Grandma.
- It's Chinese New Year.

744
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,190
Look what this is.

745
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,870
This is yours.

746
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,670
I don't want it.

747
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,100
Take it.

748
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,780
It's from me.

749
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,740
It's from me. Take it.

750
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,425
Happy Chinese New Year.

751
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,475
Happy Chinese New Year.

752
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,020
You're all my darlings.

753
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,340
Third Uncle's calling.

754
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,975
It must wish you
a happy Chinese New Year.

755
00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:13,825
Here. Answer it.

756
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,275
Okay.

757
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,580
Let me take the call.

758
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,390
Hello?

759
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,780
Hey.

760
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,710
Happy Chinese New Year.

761
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,780
Is everything okay at home?

762
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:24,990
I'm fine.

763
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,230
I'm in good health.

764
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,390
It's the new year.

765
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,390
I wish you

766
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,740
health and happiness.

767
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:38,625
What's the matter?

768
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,000
You took Grandma's red envelope

769
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,850
but not mine?

770
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,190
Mom.

771
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,100
Yesterday,

772
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,100
I saw your text message.

773
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,670
It's okay. It's just a minor surgery.

774
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,580
Don't worry.

775
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,060
It's Chinese New Year. Be happy.

776
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,020
Don't let Grandma know.

777
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,670
You hear me?

778
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,540
Don't overthink.

779
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,990
How did it go?

780
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,190
How is he?

781
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,150
He's okay.

782
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,710
All his family is well.

783
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,630
Great.

784
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,670
Huan'er.

785
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,375
Brush your teeth. It's time to eat.

786
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,075
Grandma made it.

787
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,990
Yes, eat breakfast.

788
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,540
Mom.

789
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:14,580
Here.

790
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,050
Hurry.

791
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,500
I

792
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,740
bought you a hat.

793
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,060
I saw your hat was old that day.

794
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,425
I want to take you shopping
this afternoon.

795
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,190
(That was the first time I realized)

796
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,740
(that learning to keep secrets)

797
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,870
(is an important lesson)

798
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,020
(in growing up.)

799
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:46,710
What's wrong?

800
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,950
It's Chinese New Year,
yet you look upset.

801
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:55,075
What's wrong?

802
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,580
My mom

803
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,020
was diagnosed with a tumor.

804
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,580
Is it benign or malignant?

805
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:26,975
I have no idea.

806
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,150
She needs an operation.

807
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,430
Do you think my mom

808
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:35,870
would...

809
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,950
It must be benign.

810
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:40,430
You don't have the results yet.

811
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,775
Don't scare yourself first.

812
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:43,575
Sure.

813
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,230
Yes.

814
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:00,670
Grandma.

815
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,910
It's late.

816
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,780
Why are you still awake?

817
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,190
I'm going through
your mom's photo album.

818
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,500
I heard your mom say

819
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,390
you made this for her.

820
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,245
During senior middle school.

821
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,340
Huan'er has grown up

822
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,710
and is sensible.

823
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,580
It'll be fine.

824
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,820
(At that moment,)

825
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,390
(I suddenly understood)

826
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,020
(that Grandma and I)

827
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,457
(are keeping the same secret)

828
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,540
(for each other.)

829
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,300
(She's a mother.)

830
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,870
(A mother who's willing)

831
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,740
(to pretend that she knows nothing.)

832
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,540
(Because she doesn't want)

833
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,710
(her daughter)

834
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,950
(to worry about her)

835
00:33:27,731 --> 00:33:29,148
(while suffering from illness.)

836
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:08,910
Mom.

837
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,680
This is the pork elbow
I braised for you.

838
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,140
Remember to put it in the refrigerator

839
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:12,954
after you're home.

840
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:13,857
Or it will go bad.

841
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,270
This is a new type of hypoglycemic drug.

842
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,180
I've written out

843
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,660
the instructions for you.

844
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,180
The frequency a day and the dosage.

845
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,430
Got it.

846
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,100
I'm not senile yet.

847
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,390
Mom.

848
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,620
I have to rush to work

849
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,790
and still need to clean up,

850
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,576
so I won't be sending you off.

851
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:32,952
Don't worry about me.

852
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,390
I have my son-in-law.

853
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,790
Yes, I'm here. Don't worry.

854
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,220
Bye.

855
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,470
Huan'er.

856
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,310
Grandma.

857
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,830
I will miss you.

858
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,700
I will call you.

859
00:34:45,736 --> 00:34:46,824
Take good care of yourself.

860
00:34:46,824 --> 00:34:47,180
Sure.

861
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:47,870
Don't worry.

862
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,500
Mom.

863
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,540
You must pay attention to your health.

864
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,390
And

865
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:54,870
if you're not feeling well,

866
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,620
let me know.

867
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,060
I'll go back to visit you
if I have time.

868
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,140
Sure.

869
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,224
Take good care of yourself too.

870
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,168
Don't worry.

871
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,310
Don't let me worry.

872
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,540
Bye.

873
00:35:08,536 --> 00:35:10,040
Huan'er, no need to see me off.

874
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,790
Dad, let me see you guys off.

875
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:12,350
Alright.

876
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,220
Your grandma said no,

877
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,152
so don't see us off.

878
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:15,910
Dad.

879
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,140
Be safe.

880
00:35:18,968 --> 00:35:19,768
Go back inside.

881
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:51,990
Mom.

882
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,140
Stop crying.

883
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:54,750
You're wasting water.

884
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,500
I'm not crying.

885
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:26,830
Well...

886
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,100
Don't be nervous
about the operation tomorrow.

887
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,990
The test results will be fine.

888
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,310
I'm not nervous.

889
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:35,112
You're the one who's nervous.

890
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,700
Why would I be nervous?

891
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,168
You're nervous.

892
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:38,790
Look.

893
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,270
Even my hands are sweating.

894
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,660
Look, it's all sweat.

895
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,390
Sweat...

896
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,350
Alright.

897
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,750
It's late.

898
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:48,990
Go home.

899
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,870
There's no rush.

900
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,792
People will see you.

901
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:54,456
Let me stay with you for a while longer.

902
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,790
Here.

903
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,390
You're here.

904
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:37,368
How did it go?

905
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,990
We don't know yet.

906
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,220
We'll only know the final result

907
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,140
after the biopsy

908
00:37:47,672 --> 00:37:48,990
following tomorrow's operation.

909
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,032
You must have starved the whole day.

910
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,792
Have some food.

911
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,390
Thank you.

912
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:22,408
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

913
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,950
It isn't your fault.

914
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,830
Aunt Lina will be fine.

915
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,780
(Family Members Are Not Allowed Inside)

916
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,460
(In Operation)

917
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,752
How did it go?

918
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,140
Yifan.

919
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,430
Why are you here?

920
00:39:58,456 --> 00:39:59,700
I should be here. We're family.

921
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:00,952
How long has she been in there?

922
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:01,500
(In Operation)

923
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,350
It's been a long time.

924
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,270
I don't know either.

925
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:03,830
It's over.

926
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:04,700
It's over, Dad.

927
00:40:05,784 --> 00:40:06,350
This door...

928
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:06,910
No rush.

929
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:07,750
It'll be over soon.

930
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,950
Doctor.

931
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:10,008
How did it go?

932
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,968
Everything went well.

933
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,660
Family members can wait in the ward.

934
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,660
Judging from the tumor removed,

935
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,912
there should be no problem.

936
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:17,890
But we still have to wait
for the biopsy results.

937
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:18,536
Alright.

938
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,700
Thank you.

939
00:40:19,736 --> 00:40:20,470
Thank you, Doctor.

940
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,390
Don't mention it. Go.

941
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,408
- Thank you.
- Okay.

942
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,950
Dad, she's fine.

943
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,660
Look, I told you

944
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,700
it's a minor operation.

945
00:40:28,744 --> 00:40:30,296
Yet you still came to accompany me.

946
00:40:30,312 --> 00:40:31,500
You make me very nervous.

947
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,270
Uncle.

948
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:32,660
I...

949
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,410
I'll buy you some drinks.

950
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,220
No need, Uncle. No.

951
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,088
No need. Stand here.

952
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:37,352
- It's okay.
- There's no need.

953
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,500
(Dad is still the same as before.)

954
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,990
(The more nervous he is,)

955
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:48,660
(the more he acts like he doesn't care.)

956
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,100
(I don't know if it's to comfort others)

957
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,750
(or himself.)

958
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,310
Slow down.

959
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,390
Mom, slow down.

960
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,620
It's okay.

961
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,350
Slow down.

962
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,100
It's okay.

963
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,060
Let Huan'er help you.

964
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,910
Let me do it myself.

965
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,750
I'm not a porcelain doll.

966
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:05,540
Jeez.

967
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,100
Chen.

968
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,320
Look.

969
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,580
Xichi is capable.

970
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:15,688
Doesn't he look like our son-in-law?

971
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,100
Son-in-law?

972
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,700
Stop playing matchmaker.

973
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,060
He's handsome

974
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,696
and has no shortage of girlfriends.

975
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,140
They're good buddies.

976
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,390
Son-in-law?

977
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,790
Xichi.

978
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,830
Sorry to have bothered you recently.

979
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,700
I can't take care of you all for now.

980
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,830
You two will be back in school
in two days.

981
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,750
Help me

982
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,950
take care of Huan'er.

983
00:41:39,224 --> 00:41:40,232
Aunt Lina, don't worry.

984
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,250
Leave Chen Huan'er to me.

985
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,060
Here, get up.

986
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,990
I'll do it myself.

987
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,870
Don't touch me.

988
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,540
Let me.

989
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,750
Okay, go.

990
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,180
Don't force yourself.

991
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,660
Don't touch me.

992
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,528
Let me do it myself.

993
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,904
I know. Let me help you.
