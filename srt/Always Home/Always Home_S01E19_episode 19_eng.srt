 â™«  Or a sunny day  â™«

 â™«  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  â™«

 â™«  Why not find a day to meet  â™«

â™«  Because of you, I have become a little braver  â™«

15
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,260
   

16
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,520
How come no one came to your departmentâ€™s film screening?

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
Maybe it's because we medical school students

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,280
usually don't pay much attention to these things.

20
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:12,740
   

21
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,110
Do you have any plans to join any clubs?

22
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,340
Not yet.

23
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,580
Besides studying, what do you usually do?

24
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,410
Mostly just study.

25
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,510
Are you not bored?

26
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,620
No.

27
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,420
It's quite fulfilling.

28
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,090
Sometimes there isn't even enough time.

29
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,600
Two degrees higher than normal body temperature is the temperature of love.

30
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,380
If it's 39 degrees, you still need to go to the hospital to get it checked.

31
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,340
It's just a metaphor for expressing emotions.

32
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,420
Sorry.

33
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,240
Occupational habit.

34
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,790
Do you remember that my essay scores used to be really low?

35
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,580
You...

36
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,740
It was in the Chinese teacher's office.

37
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,250
 Can I read the essay? 

38
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,620
   

39
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,600
 Didn't you hear the teacher? 

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,620
 It didn't match the prompt. 

41
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,270
 I must redo it. 

42
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,050
 So what? 

43
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,400
 I trust my own judgment. 

44
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,350
You know what?

45
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,480
You're the first person who approved of my writing.

46
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,080
At that moment, I thought

47
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,860
it was enough to have one person approve

48
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,610
my writing.

49
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,580
Maybe it's insignificant to you,

50
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,620
but it was really important to me back then.

51
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,760
I remember.

52
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,590
And I really felt that you wrote very well.

53
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:27,470
I thought your words and the way you phrased them gave me a sense of freedom.

54
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,860
Thank you.

55
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,250
However, I don't write things like that anymore.

56
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,610
Why?

57
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,910
Actually, I later felt that

58
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,530
unrealistic rhetoric is very dangerous.

59
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,820
Pretty sentences can make people mistake them for love

60
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,350
when they're really just pretentious.

61
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,130
So now I prefer to use straightforward descriptions.

62
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,250
Just like when you like someone.

63
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,430
You'll take the direct approach.

64
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,820
Am I distracting you from studying right now?

65
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,370
Not at all.

66
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,230
I'm just casually talking.

67
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,030
It's not like I only study all day, every day.

68
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,720
So you're saying I can invite you if there are more activities like this?

69
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,370
Yes.

70
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,990
Okay.

71
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,450
Hello.

72
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,060
Why is Lin Jing Yi not here yet?

73
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,880
I don't know. School started days ago, but I've never seen him.

74
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,860
I asked around for a long time but couldn't find any news about him.

75
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,610
Kind of mysterious.

76
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,880
 Song Cong, I think you're different from when you were in high school. 

77
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,640
 Besides studying, what do you usually do? 

78
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,280
 Mostly just study. 

79
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,470
 He's a top student. 

80
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,080
 He will become an elite among the elites. 

81
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,620
 Do you know whose bed is opposite? 

82
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,420
 Lin Jing Yi. Our school's top scorer. 

83
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,610
 I really want to see what kind of person can achieve such a crazy high score. 

84
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:16,710
   

85
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,480
All of you have been selected through interviews

86
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,380
to become the future backbone of the Student Council's Sports Department.

87
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,040
I'm glad to work with you all in the coming year.

88
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,150
Okay. There's another important matter today.

89
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,890
Once each club is stable, the Student Council will hold a welcome gala.

90
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,370
The Sports Department needs to come up with an activity too.

91
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,820
Does anyone want to sign up for it?

92
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,610
I think the Sports Department isn't for me. I gotta go.

93
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,050
What about the rest?

94
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,910
Zhou Ye.

95
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,810
Lin, I'm not good at anything else except fitness.

96
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,130
Okay, we'll pass you.

97
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,180
Chen Huan Er.

98
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,890
It's written on the registration form that you know martial arts.

99
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,470
Yes.

100
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,320
You're a heroic woman.

101
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,860
How about this? You're the one

102
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,710
to come up with a martial arts performance.

103
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,760
- I... 
 - Huan Er, it's a good idea.

104
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,380
It's good?

105
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,350
What do you think?

106
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,740
 - Yes.  
 - Take a look.

107
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,610
Okay. Huan Er, you're in charge.

108
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,590
- Our department will assign Huan Er then. 
 - Sure.

109
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,200
One last thing. Our office needs someone on duty from Monday to Friday.

110
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,260
Check your class schedule later and arrange the shifts in pairs.

111
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,360
- Ouch. 
 - Okay, that's all.

112
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,710
- Okay. Meeting adjourned. 
 - Okay.

113
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,190
Ouch.

114
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,740
Which afternoon are you free?

115
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,430
See for yourself.

116
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,480
You can't quit.

117
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,287
If you quit, there will be no one in our department.

118
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:00,640
Nothing on Wednesday and Thursday.

119
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,090
Got it. I'll think about it.

120
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,400
Let's go. Hurry back to practice martial arts.

121
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,140
I have never been on stage. How can I practice?

122
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,540
Your dad is a martial arts coach.

123
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,470
Huan Er.

124
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,050
Good luck.

125
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,140
Good luck.

126
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,210
Jing Xi Chi.

127
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,310
I'm so tired.

128
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,350
Li, where are you going? The lights will be turned off soon.

129
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,990
I'm not staying in the dorm tonight.

130
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,230
Why?

131
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,544
It's too hot. I can't stand it without air conditioning.

132
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:36,717
I'm going to stay in a hotel.

133
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:39,140
Why are you back so late?

134
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,470
The Sports Department just finished rehearsing.

135
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,040
Okay, hurry upstairs. I gotta go.

136
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm back. What's going on?

137
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,660
I don't know.

138
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,470
 Open the door. 402, dorm inspection. 

139
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,350
What do we do?

140
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,510
Hurry.

141
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,830
- No. 
 - What's wrong?

142
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,900
- Teddy. 
 - Here.

143
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,360
More. Hurry.

144
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,400
- 401, open the door. Dorm inspection. 
  - Madam, wait. I'll be here soon. 

145
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,230
Madam.

146
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,710
- Is everyone here? 
 - All here.

147
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,740
Chen Huan Er.

148
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,740
Madam, I'm here.

149
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,950
Dong Hui Xin.

150
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,830
- Huang Lu. 
 - Here.

151
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,720
Qiu Li.

152
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,500
Qiu Li isn't feeling well and has fallen asleep.

153
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,100
Yes, she isn't feeling well.

154
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,710
 The slippers are arranged so neatly. 

155
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,620
 Could it be... 

156
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,400
Madam, Qiu Li's asleep. She isn't feeling well...

157
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,510
Qiu Li?

158
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,610
That's a major demerit for you.

159
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,140
 403, dorm inspection. 

160
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,420
Don't cry.

161
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,260
Just be sad for a bit.

162
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,824
We have no classes in the afternoon.

163
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:22,960
Qiu Li said she'll be skipping the morning class.

164
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,710
But...

165
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,400
last night, she was already marked for staying out overnight.

166
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,960
Will she be picked again during roll call today?

167
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,790
Don't jinx it.

168
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,440
Okay. Roll call is starting.

169
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,640
Chen Huan Er.

170
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,490
Here.

171
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,180
Huang Lu.

172
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,780
Here.

173
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,410
Qiu Li.

174
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,890
Qiu Li.

175
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,950
Qiu Li.

176
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,640
Here.

177
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,190
Dong Hui Xin.

178
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,030
Dong Hui Xin.

179
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,270
Dong Hui Xin.

180
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,880
Is she absent?

181
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,130
I'll record it as an absence.

182
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,590
Liu Xiao Ting.

183
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,090
Here.

184
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,590
- Li Ying. 
 - Here.

185
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,680
- Chen Jing. 
 - Here.

186
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,120
Yesterday, Qiu Li was marked for staying out all night because I didn't stay in the dorm.

187
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,026
I don't want to owe her a favor.

188
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:42,040
I answered the roll call for her today as a way of repaying her.

189
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,021
You don't have to worry about turning on the air conditioner in the dorm anymore.

190
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:48,080
I asked the counselor for another dorm.

191
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,310
Dong Hui Xin.

192
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,440
We can discuss this matter further.

193
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,020
No need. A discussion won't produce any results.

194
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,160
Besides, my time is precious.

195
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,020
I don't want to waste it on unimportant things.

196
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,070
Please open your books.

197
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,640
Turn to page 45.

198
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,420
Today, let's talk about...

199
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,130
There are really all kinds of weirdos in universities.

200
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,950
It's a form of active learning. It requires...

201
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,610
Thank you.

202
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,780
I didn't order too much, did I?

203
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,610
It's okay. It won't make much of a difference.

204
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,330
Yes.

205
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,950
- Li. 
 - Hi, babes.

206
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,900
Take a look. We just ordered.

207
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,100
Is there anything you want to eat? We can order it.

208
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,920
You can handle the ordering.

209
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,970
Okay.

210
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,120
- Thank you. 
 - Here you go.

211
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,160
There is one piece of good news and two pieces of bad news. Which do you want to hear first?

212
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,170
Bad news then.

213
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,760
Dong Hui Xin is moving out of the dorm.

214
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
Isn't that a good thing?

215
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
What about the other bad news?

216
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,780
The teacher called your name in today's general elective class.

217
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,860
I'm that unlucky?

218
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,430
What's the good news?

219
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,040
Dong Hui Xin answered the roll call for you.

220
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,180
She said she caused you to be marked for staying out all night

221
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,240
and didn't want to owe you a favor.

222
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,610
Li.

223
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,070
I think you two don't have to be so awkward.

224
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,380
It's fate that we're assigned together.

225
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,090
How about we find a time to discuss with Dong Hui Xin?

226
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,020
If she hadn't turned off the air conditioner before consulting us,

227
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,190
I wouldn't have picked a fight like this.

228
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,310
Besides, she's stubborn and unsociable.

229
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,990
No one can persuade her.

230
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,990
Besides attending classes and sleeping, can you find her?

231
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,430
What?

232
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,540
Hui Xin...

233
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,880
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks.

234
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,430
We'll do it ourselves.

235
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,240
It's okay.

236
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,780
Waitress.

237
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,110
- Come here. 
 - Go ahead, we can do it ourselves.

238
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,140
Hello.

239
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,010
What's up with this squid?

240
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,780
When did you get it? It's not fresh.

241
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,140
Cancel it. We'll pay and leave.

242
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,380
Sorry, sir. We just received this squid this morning. It must be fresh.

243
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,480
And you've finished it all.

244
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,280
There's no way for us to cancel it.

245
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,469
I can only know whether it's fresh after eating it.

246
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:38,420
Are you going to take care of this or not?

247
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,760
- If not, get the person in charge. 
 - Sorry. Our manager isn't around today.

248
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,110
I'm really sorry.

249
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,070
But you've almost finished eating. There's no way we can cancel it.

250
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,960
We're sorry too.

251
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,090
If you don't cancel this, we won't leave.

252
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,130
Sir.

253
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,350
Enough, why are you arguing?

254
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,430
How could a grown man like you bully a girl?

255
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,260
How much is it? I'll pay for it.

256
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,400
Yeah. If it doesn't taste good, why eat it?

257
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,560
Your squid only has tentacles left, right?

258
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,710
That guy's still eating.

259
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,330
Put it down.

260
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,150
What a lousy place.

261
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,730
Wait.

262
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,630
Forget it.

263
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,960
Sorry. Well...

264
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,150
I'll pay the bill.

265
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,980
This way.

266
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,440
Why are you still eating? Let's go.

267
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,300
I apologize, everyone.

268
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,190
Well... he suffered a heartbreak today.

269
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,610
It's much cooler this way.

270
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,990
Sit down.

271
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,000
Hui Xin, how about you don't move out?

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,600
Yeah, don't move out.

273
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,910
My application has been handed over to the counselor,

274
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,510
and you all can't stand the heat.

275
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,020
I had better get another dorm.

276
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,100
Actually, I'm not that afraid of heat.

277
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm just upset that someone won't let me turn it on.

278
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,060
Yeah. We're not that afraid of heat.

279
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,480
Turning the fan on feels the same.

280
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,260
I know you mean well,

281
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,630
but there's no need to force yourselves for me.

282
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,710
It won't be fair.

283
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,190
How about this?

284
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,130
You get up early. Help us find a few good seats in advance.

285
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,960
This way, the air conditioning fee and the seat reservation fee offset each other.

286
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,630
Isn't that fair?

287
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,090
What do you think?

288
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,500
I have no objection.

289
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,470
I fully agree.

290
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,580
That might not be a good idea.

291
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,390
Come on. Please don't move out.

292
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,710
What will happen to our studies if you move out?

293
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,100
- Please, Hui Xin. 
 - Please.

294
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,340
Please.

295
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,040
We're counting on you.

296
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,330
Please.

297
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,150
Here.

298
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,220
- All right. 
  - Thank you. 

299
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,580
Hui Xin.

300
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,530
Talk to us.

301
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,960
You're always studying.

302
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,420
Have you ever been in a relationship?

303
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,580
How many times?

304
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,130
Why are you asking such questions?

305
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,570
We're roommates. We even took showers together.

306
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,630
What's wrong with us gossiping?

307
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,710
I never took showers with you.

308
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,630
We'll take showers together soon.

309
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,030
Close the door!

310
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,130
Wait.

311
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,280
- You... 
 - Hurry up.

312
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,460
Make the call. Are you going to call?

313
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,480
- Call him. Make the call. 
 - It's too late today.

314
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,980
- I'll call tomorrow. 
 - You're not going to call?

315
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,240
Take it off!

316
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,600
I'm a respectable lady!

317
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
It's too late to say anything now.

318
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,470
I love respectable ladies!

319
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,490
Search for her phone!

320
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,050
 That night, for the first time, everyone in Room 401 was together and awake. 

321
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:52,480
 We re-ranked ourselves by age. 

322
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,810
 Hui Xin was the oldest. 

323
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,640
 Little Princess Qiu Li claimed to be the second oldest with a look of disdain. 

324
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,100
 It was a ranking that combined all kinds of wild imaginations. 

325
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,720
 Lu became the plain third oldest. 

326
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,120
 And I became the youngest, always bullied and forced to acknowledge my seniority. 

327
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,260
 Four years is a long time, 

328
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:25,060
 but I believe tomorrow will be a beautiful day. 

329
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,060
I brought breakfast for everyone.

330
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,740
Where's everyone?

331
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,300
My dears, I brought you...

332
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,910
I also bought breakfast too.

333
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,100
 Come on, let's eat soup dumplings! 

334
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,000
Eat...

335
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,870
You all bought food.

336
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,300
What should we do? I'm trying to lose weight.

337
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,490
Don't eat then.

338
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,970
Eat.

339
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,980
All right. Give it to me.

340
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,190
Give me the deep-fried dough sticks.

341
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,920
Wontons.

342
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,330
Huan Er, I know you've been tired from training, but isn't eating so much a bit...

343
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,990
Don't worry. They won't go to waste.

344
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,740
If I can't finish it, I'll give it to Da Huang downstairs.

345
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,820
I gotta go. Bye.

346
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,500
Da Huang?

347
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,740
Isn't feeding them to a dog a bit wasteful?

348
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,090
It's definitely not for the dog.

349
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,190
It's complicated.

350
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,950
Let's eat.

351
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,240
You didn't poison the food, did you?

352
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,090
Yes, I did. Don't eat it.

353
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,092
Why did you suddenly remember to bring me breakfast?

354
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:02,220
You seem to be in a good mood today.

355
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,680
Because today is the day of reconciliation.

356
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,080
You're still hung up on us?

357
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,890
Bringing up the past is not a good habit.

358
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,160
I'm not talking about you.

359
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,090
 Has Da Huang eaten? 

360
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,590
 Yes, he enjoyed it. 

361
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,220
- Eat more. 
 - I'll finish soon.

362
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,640
I'll practice with you later.

363
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,640
It's okay. You can eat first.

364
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,000
 You're using your power for personal gain. 

365
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,600
 If you're upset, come at me. 

366
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,700
Lin, Du Wei.

367
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,440
Due to the limited duration of the gala, the preparatory team decided at the meeting...

368
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,580
What preparatory team?

369
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,620
Isn't it just your dictatorship as the head of the Arts Department?

370
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,430
The Sports Department's performance can't go on.

371
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,330
You've worked hard to rehearse these days.

372
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,444
No. What do you mean it can't go on?

373
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:13,020
The others have put in a lot of work.

374
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,580
Do you think just saying "You've worked hard" is enough?

375
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,910
It doesn't matter if it goes on.

376
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,820
We need an explanation.

377
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,260
Your traditional martial arts are a bit old-fashioned.

378
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,220
In terms of the gala's entertainment, students prefer street dance performances and skits.

379
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,010
From a spiritual perspective, traditional Chinese music performances

380
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,600
and poetry recitations allow students to gain more.

381
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,300
The Arts Department lacks the manpower for its performance.

382
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,640
Since the Sports Department isn't participating, send us some helpers.

383
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,900
Jing Xi Chi, come with me.

384
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,680
No.

385
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,440
This gala is a joint performance of all departments in the Student Council.

386
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,785
Are you sure that no one from the Sports Department will be joining?

387
00:24:58,785 --> 00:25:01,860
Do you want me to report to the president?

388
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,390
Jing.

389
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,500
Go.

390
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,940
Just think of it as doing me a favor.

391
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,900
Why don't you go?

392
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,850
I don't have anything to do now anyway.

393
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,480
Huan Er,

394
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,340
if there's a big opportunity, will you take it?

395
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,540
I gave it more thought.

396
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,420
We must continue our martial arts performance.

397
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,470
Didn't Du Wei say that our performances are outdated, impractical, and unentertaining?

398
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,940
We'll put on a good performance.

399
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,098
I've thought of the time and place.

400
00:26:19,098 --> 00:26:22,730
We'll do it at the same time as hers on the day of the gala.

401
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,000
We've been canceled for three years.

402
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,060
Well... Lin,

403
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,680
do you have any specific ideas?

404
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,290
- What do you mean? 
 - Ideas.

405
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,580
I was planning to let you handle this.

406
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,920
- Me? 
 - Yes.

407
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,480
- I can't do it. 
 - You can do it.

408
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
- I really can't. 
 - You really can.

409
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,030
How about this? I'll gather everyone together to think of another way.

410
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,230
No, don't text yet.

411
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,300
Listen to me. I think you can do this alone.

412
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,300
You're different from others.

413
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,950
I have high hopes for you.

414
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,540
You have potential. You're hardworking and perseverant,

415
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,710
unlike those idiots who only grow in size, not in brains.

416
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,240
Just give me a clear answer.

417
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,060
Are you confident in making the Sports Department bigger, stronger, and more successful?

418
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,150
Yes.

419
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,150
I guess?

420
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,920
Don't guess.

421
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,540
I will support you.

422
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,440
- Lin, Iâ€” 
 - It's settled then.

423
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,200
Huan Er.

424
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,580
Don't mention this to the others yet, okay?

425
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,420
 Is this the real reason why Lin doesn't want everyone to be involved? 

426
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,980
   

427
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,530
Let me show you this.

428
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,470
Due to the gala, everyone will book rehearsal rooms often,

429
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,540
so I'll leave this to you.

430
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,390
Pay attention to booking matters. It's not allowed to smoke inside.

431
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,240
Keep it clean. Enough. Stop messing around.

432
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,200
You two, take a look at this together.

433
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,720
Okay, sure.

434
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,170
Yang.

435
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,050
- Du Wei. 
 - I'll take care of this.

436
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,600
Sure.

437
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,510
I'm Jing Xi Chi from theâ€”

438
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,620
Jing.

439
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,080
The costumes department is extremely busy.

440
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,400
They want me to help measure sizes.

441
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
You don't mind, do you?

442
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,060
Du Wei...

443
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,390
can we talk for a moment?

444
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,950
Go ahead.

445
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:14,300
Maybe martial arts seem traditional and outdated to you,

446
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,950
but you shouldn't easily deny Chen Huan Er's efforts.

447
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,870
She learned martial arts from her father.

448
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:29,710
Her father led teams to compete locally and abroad for years for national honor.

449
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:36,390
To Chen Huan Er and Uncle Chen, martial arts is life and honor.

450
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,400
Maybe it was just a casual remark this morning,

451
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,300
but for someone else, it might've left a deep scar.

452
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,950
How annoying!

453
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,300
How is martial arts outdated?

454
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,620
Why don't people like it? I think martial arts are pretty good.

455
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,640
- Is she drunk? 
 - It's even scarier than being drunk.

456
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,230
Her show was canceled.

457
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,740
She lost her mind completely.

458
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,190
Huan Er.

459
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,160
Chen Huan Er!

460
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,990
Don't be upset.

461
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,230
I asked around for you.

462
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,230
The cancellation of your show has nothing to do with you.

463
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:34,260
It's purely a personal grudge between Du Wei and Lin.

464
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,520
I can't believe the head of your department.

465
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,150
He doesn't have the guts to confront his ex, so he pushed you out as a scapegoat.

466
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,200
Ex?

467
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,440
Is this Jing Xi Chi of the Computer Science Department?

468
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,580
Du Wei's intentions aren't pure when she assigns him to be the host.

469
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,000
Poor Lin. He still hasn't gotten over the heartbreak.

470
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,090
Yeah.

471
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,720
Lin and Du Wei?

472
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,200
You don't know?

473
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,790
Lin was the male host of the welcome gala for Du Wei's batch.

474
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,700
Du Wei is known as a gentle dagger.

475
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,500
So the guy Du Wei handpicked this year for hosting... is Jing Xi Chi?

476
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,300
Your high school classmate is in danger.

477
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,530
Forget it.

478
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,290
I should just focus on figuring out my own plan first.

479
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,060
What kind of show should I make?

480
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,870
- What show? 
 - I just checked the statistics.

481
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,770
Some women experience unwanted physical contact,

482
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,920
or physical contact in public places, before the age of 21.

483
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,200
It's what's commonly known as sexual harassment.

484
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,610
Only one in eight women who were harassed dared to report it.

485
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:00,000
In other words, there are at least seven hidden cases behind every sexual harassment case.

486
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,160
Most women who encounter similar situations tend to keep quiet

487
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,190
because of victim blaming and the significant physical differences between men and women,

488
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,540
just like many waitresses I met in the restaurant.

489
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:15,420
So, Huan Er, I think you don't need to worry about whether martial arts are outdated,

490
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,050
unentertaining, or pointless.

491
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,990
As long as someone needs it, martial arts that represent justice

492
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,430
will always have an audience and a market.

493
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,290
I want to do a show about women's self-defense.

494
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,230
- This is a good idea! 
 - Right?

495
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,710
Ms. Dong Hui Xin.

496
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:38,610
Are you willing to be the first person to try out my women's self-defense show?

497
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,320
- Of course. 
 - Let us wish Ms. Chen Huan Er

498
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,120
luck in expanding and strengthening the women's self-defense event!

499
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,750
 Achieve greater glory! 

500
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,170
Okay.

501
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,710
Amazing.

502
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,510
Huan Er, you're really the Sports Department's lucky charm.

503
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,230
Three years...

504
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,060
In the past three years, Du Wei has been running amok in our Sports Department.

505
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:13,410
Tyrannical, reckless, trampling talent, seducing, and abandoning.

506
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,060
Looks like what Qiu Li said is true.

507
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,470
Lin... Lin.

508
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,340
That monkey... that monkey is mine.

509
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,610
Sorry. I'll call the president now.

510
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,540
Stop crying, babe.

511
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,890
President. It's me, Lin.

512
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,810
How did it go?

513
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,610
The president said we would have full support and asked us to do well.

514
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,820
The president seems to have hung up on you.

515
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,100
The president definitely hung up on him.

516
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,260
What's going on with you two?

517
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,120
Huan Er,

518
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,870
you must believe in yourself.

519
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,020
Even if we don't have funds, we can also get this done.

520
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,270
No, we can't do it without the funds.

521
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,050
I don't even have a venue.

522
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,970
Isn't it just a venue? It's a small issue. I'll fix it.

523
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,600
What's wrong?

524
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,800
You don't trust me? Just wait and see.

525
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,150
He...

526
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,004
We're here.

527
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:39,790
   

528
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:43,540
Lin, how did you find this place?

529
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,900
As the head of the Sports Department, I have some resources.

530
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,200
It feels like there's no one in this building.

531
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,120
Isn't it a bit deserted?

532
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,790
Is it deserted?

533
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,470
I think it's okay.

534
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,700
It's mainly because the venue's good.

535
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,790
Check it out.

536
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,340
What do you think?

537
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,300
Come in and take a look.

538
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,200
This is the Wrestling Club's training ground.

539
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,810
It might not look like much now,

540
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,150
but at least the basics are good.

541
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,380
How come it's now a warehouse?

542
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,960
The Wrestling Club no longer needs it?

543
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,270
Wrestling Club?

544
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,870
The Wrestling Club was dissolved.

545
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,540
Could it be because you have to walk two miles for every training session?

546
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,690
Of course not.

547
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,300
Come to think of it, it's all my fault.

548
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,290
I didn't protect the Wrestling Club well.

549
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:45,460
Since I became the head of the Sports Department, Du Wei...

550
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,100
The Sports Department's activities keep getting suppressed.

551
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:54,460
That's why the Sports Department's obscured past glory

552
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,100
must be restored by you and me.

553
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,600
- Restored by us? 
 - It must be restored by us.

554
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,990
Lin, why don't you clean the floor first?

555
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,520
Huan Er, here's the thing: I have a meeting soon.

556
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,660
You can clean up first; I'll help you when I'm free.

557
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,000
Lin, didn't you say you'll support me?

558
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,880
Emotional support is also a kind of support.

559
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,500
Good luck. Work hard. I believe in you.

560
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,530
No.

561
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,100
Women's self-defense. If you're interested, learn more about it.

562
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,110
Guys also need to learn some self-defense. 
    

563
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,280
Women's self-defense. If you're interested, learn more.

564
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,162
Here's the location. If you have any questions, you can call me.

565
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:57,880
Women's self-defense. You must come and check it out.

566
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,910
Women's self-defense. Be your own bodyguard.

567
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,920
   

568
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,750
Tian Chi.

569
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,600
Women's Self-Defense Interest Group?

570
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,120
Yes. Are you interested?

571
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,140
It's one of the Sports Department's activities.

572
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,780
Not bad.

573
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,350
It's just that your flyer's design is...

574
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,000
   

575
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,700
What's wrong with the flyer?

576
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,830
It won't attract people.

577
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,120
Do you need help?

578
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,400
We don't have the funds to pay you.

579
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,247
I'll help you design it for free.

580
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,290
We really need free stuff.

581
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,580
Tian Chi, you know how to design things?

582
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,140
I know a bit about it.

583
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,870
I'm in the External Relations Department.

584
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,650
I can help you get some sponsorship.

585
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,470
Isn't it a bit inappropriate?

586
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,950
It's every bit appropriate.

587
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,790
- It's inappropriate. 
 - It's free labor. Don't waste it.

588
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,470
Don't mention it. I want to do my part too.

589
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,300
Can you take me to your venue for a tour?

590
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,400
Well...

591
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,520
Tian Chi, can you promise me something before you go?

592
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:10,810
Whether it's poor or shabby, cramped or simple...

593
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,620
you won't run away.

594
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,230
Okay?

595
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,180
Okay.

596
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,870
- Sure. Tian Chi, this way. 
 - This way.

597
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,580
- This way, Tian Chi. 
 - Come.

598
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,620
This way.

599
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:29,180
Fall in October is a season for planting hope and anticipating a harvest.

600
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:35,780
We're here to welcome Wuan University's 2010 Freshman Welcome Gala.

601
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,180
I've experienced ignoring the outside world and focusing on my studies...

602
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,370
Do we need to take all these?

603
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,990
Yes, I think so.

604
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,410
Here.

605
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,430
No. 5, Chen Huan Er, comes on stage.

606
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,790
Really?

607
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,270
- No. 
 - Pure and innocent eyes...

608
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,210
Take my punch.

609
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,600
It's a uniquely beautiful part of the student era...

610
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Tian Chi, hit me!

611
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,740
How dare you fight back?

612
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,800
You've all worked hard. Du Wei bought everyone drinks.

613
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,620
Take a break.

614
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,260
 What are you doing later? 

615
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,000
How's your memorization of the hosting script?

616
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,340
Shall we rehearse?

617
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,020
Sure.

618
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,160
Thank you.

619
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,580
Youth flows like water, and every moment is precious.

620
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,170
The years of youth can't afford any waste.

621
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:49,540
Love hard regardless of success or failure.

622
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,880
Love hard regardless of success or failure.

623
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,870
- Go. 
 - Go.

624
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,410
Let's go.

625
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,260
Jing.

626
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,790
A few days ago, I saw your match against the international student team.

627
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,060
Did you try to pursue a professional path before?

628
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,330
It was a long time ago.

629
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,910
Were you injured?

630
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,200
Do you still have any regrets?

631
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,580
No.

632
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,360
Computer science is pretty good.

633
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,810
People should always look forward.

634
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,950
We can't dwell on the past.

635
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,280
Can you really let go of the past?

636
00:40:55,741 --> 00:40:58,020
   

637
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,470
Here. Put it here.

638
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,270
Here, let me.

639
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,020
Finally, we're almost done cleaning up.

640
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,075
You all worked hard today. Thank you.

641
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:09,540
It's a small favor. Don't mention it.

642
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,540
I'm awesome.

643
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,580
Yeah. What would I do without you?

644
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,910
My cutie. My Lu.

645
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,700
Enough chatting. I have a movie date. I gotta go.

646
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,050
Okay. Go ahead.

647
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,500
- Bye. 
 - Thanks, bye.

648
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,640
Tian Chi, do you want to go have a meal, too?

649
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,310
Shall we go to the cafeteria to eat together?

650
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,760
I'm not going. The round trip will take half an hour.

651
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,334
I can leave as soon as I clean this place.

652
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:34,700
Sure.

653
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,270
Thank you.

654
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,740
9527.

655
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,220
Your family came to visit you.

656
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,180
Would you like to have some spicy chicken stew?

657
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,840
How come you're here?

658
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,950
I thought you might starve out here in the middle of nowhere,

659
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,761
so I brought you dinner.

660
00:41:57,761 --> 00:41:59,880
Don't you have to rehearse today?

661
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,390
I found time to come and see how your event preparations are going.

662
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,960
Why are you alone? What about the rest of the Sports Department?

663
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,180
I was the only one to begin with.

664
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,750
Is there anything else you need my help with?

665
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,790
No.

666
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:19,850
Tian Chi helped me with the sponsorships and posters.

667
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,870
He also helped me put up the signpost.

668
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:26,290
I just don't know how many people will come.

669
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,810
Don't bother others with this kind of thing in the future.

670
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,400
They're all favors. How are you going to repay them?

671
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,310
I'll buy them a meal. What else?

672
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,540
Are you planning to treat him to a meal alone?

673
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,790
No.

674
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,600
Huang Lu also helped me a lot. I'll treat them to a meal together.

675
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,350
All right.

676
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,910
All right.

677
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:57,120
I think I grew up overnight after entering university.

678
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,580
It's time to face my life independently.

679
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,100
Independently?

680
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,470
I promised your parents to take good care of you.

681
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,390
What do you need? Tell me now.

682
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,970
You're the host now. How can you take care of me?

683
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,730
You're prioritizing women over friends.

684
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,700
Didn't you ask me to do it?

685
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,990
Yeah.

686
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:23,140
Have you decided on the time for that event?

687
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,040
Yes. It's the same day as your welcome gala.

688
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,750
We're starting half an hour later than you.

689
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:32,030
Half an hour later?

690
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,120
Okay.

691
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,540
Okay?

692
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,140
I'll come over and be your punching bag.

693
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,360
- Don't you need to host? 
 - Don't worry about it.

694
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,090
- How can you make it in time? 
 - I can.

695
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,760
Tian Chi, didn't you go home?

696
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,532
I thought you'd be here late without eating,

697
00:43:58,532 --> 00:44:01,020
so I brought you something.

698
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,620
I...

699
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,310
Let me thank you, for Huan Er.

700
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,280
How thoughtful.

701
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,440
But it's not a good idea to eat fried food at night.

702
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,790
You'll gain weight easily, and it's unhealthy.

703
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,810
I'll accept it for Huan Er. Thank you, Tian Chi.

704
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:26,520
Is there anything else you need?

705
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,430
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

706
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,330
There's a stool. Move it here and eat with us.

707
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,500
I have something to do. Bye.

708
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,850
Sit down and eat something.

709
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:37,320
Tian Chi, what's the hurry?

710
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,670
No, well... fried food is bad.

711
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,880
It'll make you gain weight, get acne, and is bad for your health.

â™«  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  â™«

â™«  Imagining how special your world must be  â™«

â™«  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  â™«

719
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:49,061
â™«  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  â™«

720
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:55,741
â™«  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  â™«

721
00:45:55,741 --> 00:46:02,441
â™«  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  â™«

722
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:06,401
â™«  Your promise still echoes in my ears  â™«

â™«  Still free and passionate  â™«

725

â™«  If only this summer could last a little longer  â™«

726
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:25,071
â™«  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  â™« 
 â™«  The end of the story  â™«
