(Rewind)

16
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,500
We're here.

17
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,390
Go home first.

18
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:05,488
I'll watch you go upstairs.

19
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,470
I want to see you go upstairs first.

20
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,830
You go first. I'll watch you.

21
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,790
- You go upstairs first.
- You first.

22
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,790
Hurry up.

23
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,550
Hurry up.

24
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,550
Give me a hug then.

25
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,140
Hug me.

26
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,230
Let me hug you for a while.

27
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,350
Aunt Lin.

28
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:28,110
You've been training well.

29
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,620
Jing Xichi.

30
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,990
Compete with me some other day.

31
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,020
You're back.

32
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:35,740
Did you come back together?

33
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,510
Mom, why are you here?

34
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,550
I just went

35
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,740
to Aunt Hao's place.

36
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:47,270
Aunt Hao's place...

37
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,790
Aunt, I'll go back first.

38
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,790
Bye.

39
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,390
Bye.

40
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,755
Let's go, Mom.

41
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,070
Men

42
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,390
should be responsible.

43
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,911
I already figured it out.

44
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,700
During senior middle school,

45
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,270
you kept revolving

46
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,900
around Huan'er.

47
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,070
Did I?

48
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,830
You didn't?

49
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,950
I think

50
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,180
I did.

51
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,740
Since you're together now,

52
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,700
be good to Huan'er.

53
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,300
You know that?

54
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,620
You've really grown up.

55
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,555
I'm going to bed.

56
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,940
If I tell you

57
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,060
I don't like you transforming me

58
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,710
into someone I don't like,

59
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,110
will you still like

60
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,230
the real me?

61
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,590
Hello? Mom.

62
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:32,150
I've decided

63
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,150
to study abroad.

64
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,710
(We'll talk)

65
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,940
(after your exam.)

66
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,380
Why isn't your mom home today?

67
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,180
She had to go to the hospital.

68
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,910
Did your parents

69
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,466
ask you anything when you came out?

70
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,710
They went out too.

71
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,380
Speaking of,

72
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,620
I think they love each other

73
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,860
more than before after my mom got sick.

74
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,550
But why aren't they at home
when we came back

75
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,022
to see them during the holidays?

76
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:48,350
But I understand

77
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,470
your dad.

78
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,955
Aunt Lina just recovered
from a serious illness.

79
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,380
Your dad must be cherishing

80
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,620
his time with her.

81
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,180
Don't disturb

82
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,990
their alone time.

83
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,300
Got it.

84
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,790
I'm really old now.

85
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,550
I forgot to take my phone
when I went out.

86
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,710
Huan'er didn't close the window.

87
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,380
Well...

88
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,420
I wish we could be like them

89
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,350
when we're old.

90
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,180
Of course.

91
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,380
Well...

92
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,300
Will you remember

93
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,110
the first time we held hands,

94
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,590
the first kiss,

95
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,420
and the first time you confessed?

96
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,380
Not necessarily.

97
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,620
Jing Xichi, what do you mean?

98
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,710
If you don't remember now,

99
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,300
later...

100
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,500
Chen Huan'er, what are you doing?

101
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,710
Dad!

102
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,110
Explain.

103
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,790
When did this start?

104
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,740
A few days ago.

105
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,500
I didn't ask you.

106
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:55,620
I'm asking you.

107
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,820
When did this start?

108
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,420
Alright, you're scaring them.

109
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,350
Tell me.

110
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,820
Aunt Lina.

111
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,180
Uncle Chen.

112
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,860
Huan'er and I

113
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,860
started dating officially

114
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,820
two days ago.

115
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,110
Come on, Jing Xichi.

116
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,940
I asked you to take care of her.

117
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,400
You two... Is this
how you take care of her?

118
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:16,859
Calm down.

119
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,470
Dad.

120
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,230
Enough.

121
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,260
Sorry, Uncle Chen.

122
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,180
I didn't tell you before

123
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,910
because I haven't figured out

124
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,150
how to tell you.

125
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,940
I really like Huan'er.

126
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,790
I promise

127
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,070
to take good care of her.

128
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,590
Don't give me this crap.

129
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:34,830
I'm telling you.

130
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,070
I've gone through this before.

131
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:36,860
When you're young,

132
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,000
who doesn't say one thing
and do another while dating?

133
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,470
Why didn't you tell me in person?

134
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,860
Why didn't you tell me?

135
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,990
You're just a little liar.

136
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,710
You know that?

137
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,830
Uncle Chen, please listen...

138
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,690
Don't explain to me.

139
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,780
Why explain to me?
I don't want to hear it.

140
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,540
Go home first.

141
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,710
I'll talk to my dad.

142
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,020
Leave first.

143
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,710
It's okay. Go.

144
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,710
Uncle Chen.

145
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,740
I'll go home first.

146
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,310
I'll come and see you

147
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,140
when you calm down.

148
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,140
What? Don't see me.

149
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,470
I'll see your mom.

150
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:00,622
How dare you come to me?

151
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,350
Chen, what are you doing?

152
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,710
Xichi is a good kid.

153
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,933
Come on. What's good about him?

154
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:05,710
He's a little liar.

155
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,070
Enough.

156
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,900
Why are you so agitated?

157
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:09,900
Dad.

158
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,900
Why are you so angry?

159
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,710
I just have a boyfriend.

160
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,070
I didn't dare

161
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,333
to tell you because I was afraid
you'd behave like this.

162
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:18,140
What? Are you saying

163
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,110
that I'm wrong?

164
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:20,950
He stole you! How could I not be angry?

165
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,900
What did you mean?

166
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:23,466
What do you mean he didn't steal you?

167
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,230
How did he steal your daughter?

168
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,950
Xichi

169
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,066
is a good kid.

170
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,560
When I was hospitalized some time ago,

171
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,466
he's been helping out.
Didn't you see him?

172
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,710
It's all fake. I'm telling you.

173
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,590
How come it's fake?

174
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,260
You know what?

175
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,710
What?

176
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,420
This is what you call
inviting trouble in.

177
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:36,309
What are you saying?

178
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,710
It's The Farmer and the Snake!

179
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,260
Nonsense.

180
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,860
Dad!

181
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,470
What's wrong?

182
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,239
What are you saying?

183
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,990
You tell me!

184
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,900
I can't talk to you!

185
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:42,780
Who said you can go?

186
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,977
I haven't finished talking.

187
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:45,230
What are you doing?

188
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,830
Who said his daughter is grown up

189
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:53,590
and wants her to live her own life?

190
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,540
Have you forgotten?

191
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,710
I didn't forget,

192
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:01,222
but I won't allow her
to have a boyfriend.

193
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,860
Chen Lei.

194
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,310
My daughter

195
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,977
has been sensible and obedient

196
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,590
since she was little.

197
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,350
Has she ever made you worry?

198
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,140
She's just dating in university.

199
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,950
And you yelled at her and lectured her

200
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,830
in front of others.

201
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,710
Have you thought about her feelings?

202
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,900
How annoying!

203
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,470
It's my first time being a father.

204
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,950
Have you considered my feelings?

205
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:42,710
Dad.

206
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:00,950
Chen Lei.

207
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,620
Why are you here so early?

208
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,780
Is Xichi at home?

209
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,070
Well...

210
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,020
I heard about what happened yesterday.

211
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,110
I lectured him.

212
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,230
I can't believe him.

213
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,860
Why hide when you're in a relationship?

214
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:14,710
Well, Yifan.

215
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,830
I have something to talk to Xichi.

216
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,260
It's okay, Yifan.

217
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,260
Uncle Chen.

218
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,470
The way

219
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,590
I spoke to you

220
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,620
last night

221
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,590
was a little rude.

222
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,260
I apologize.

223
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:48,155
Sit down and talk.

224
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,830
Do you know

225
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,620
that Huan'er

226
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,310
was like a poor kitten

227
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,020
when she was born?

228
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,830
At that time,

229
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,230
I didn't know

230
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,590
how to hold her.

231
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,950
Later, Huan'er was in poor health.

232
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,780
Her mom and I were so worried.

233
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:18,590
We kept accompanying her.

234
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,470
At that time, we both thought

235
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,140
that as long as

236
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,500
Huan'er could live well,

237
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,860
nothing else mattered.

238
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,190
That's why

239
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:32,710
Huan'er

240
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,230
and Aunt Lina

241
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,740
are the two most important women

242
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,540
in my life.

243
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,470
But now?

244
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,350
Let me give you an analogy.

245
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,190
You're going to

246
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,110
take one of them

247
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,540
away from me.

248
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,740
I really

249
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,430
can't accept it.

250
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,780
You may not understand.

251
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,950
Maybe

252
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,540
you'll understand

253
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:07,933
when you become a father.

254
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,070
Uncle Chen.

255
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,710
I'm serious

256
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,070
about Huan'er.

257
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,900
I will never do her wrong.

258
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,710
It's not that I'm dissatisfied with you.

259
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,500
It's just that I have my own concerns

260
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,540
because I've been through this before.

261
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,780
Many promises

262
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,710
made by young people

263
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,350
may not necessarily be fulfilled.

264
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,350
And very few people

265
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,830
can end up marrying each other

266
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,310
after just one relationship.

267
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,260
Of course.

268
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,860
You two have come this far.

269
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,620
If I stop you,

270
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,230
I would be too selfish.

271
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,470
So I'm here today

272
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,260
to make a few things

273
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,140
clear to you.

274
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,740
Go ahead.

275
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,540
Firstly,

276
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,740
you have my blessing

277
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,540
if you two are doing well.

278
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,780
But remember

279
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,020
to be nice to Huan'er.

280
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,950
Don't bully her.

281
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,830
Secondly,

282
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,155
if you two aren't doing well,

283
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,070
I also hope that you two

284
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,310
can part ways in peace

285
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,070
and stay friends.

286
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,780
After all, you two

287
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,430
grew up together.

288
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,622
It's not easy to be friends
for so many years.

289
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,500
Her mom and I

290
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,070
can't be with her forever.

291
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,990
If one day we're no longer around

292
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:43,111
and Huan'er encounters difficulties,

293
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,310
I hope

294
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,020
she has a friend

295
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,110
who knows her well

296
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,950
to help her.

297
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,590
Can you do it?

298
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:01,780
Uncle Chen.

299
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,470
I also want to make
my position clear to you.

300
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,140
I will

301
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:11,466
take good care of Chen Huan'er.

302
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:15,088
She's not only
the most important person to you

303
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,110
but also to me.

304
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,830
Okay.

305
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:29,990
Well...

306
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,380
We have a deal.

307
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,430
Yifan.

308
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,070
Well...

309
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,190
Don't you want to sit for a while?

310
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,230
No, I'm leaving.

311
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:16,470
Dad...

312
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,470
You want to go abroad?

313
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,340
I do have this idea.

314
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:52,000
After all,
I want to study literary creation.

315
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,780
That's why I learn English early.

316
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,820
But it's uncertain yet.

317
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,020
Song Cong.

318
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,150
If I go abroad,

319
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,780
will you support me?

320
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,580
Studying abroad

321
00:18:06,622 --> 00:18:07,622
is definitely helpful

322
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,577
for literary creation.

323
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,800
Of course I support you.

324
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,990
Will you consider going abroad?

325
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,580
I have to study for eight years.

326
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,950
At least I have no such plans

327
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,300
at this stage.

328
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:22,710
What about eight years later?

329
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,740
Eight years later?

330
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,820
I haven't thought

331
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,444
about things so far into the future.

332
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,150
I think

333
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,990
I need to learn

334
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,200
what I can learn first.

335
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,470
Are you

336
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,540
willing to change

337
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,950
the trajectory of your life for me?

338
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,780
I...

339
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,020
I'm kidding.

340
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,710
Did you know

341
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:58,910
that my mom
made malicious assumptions about you,

342
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,377
saying you would stop me.

343
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,910
I won't stop you.

344
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,710
Don't worry.

345
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,990
I think

346
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,390
you must hold on

347
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,500
to your ideals.

348
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,430
To be honest,

349
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,190
I actually hope

350
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,060
you'll stop me.

351
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,190
Because it at least

352
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:29,400
proves that you want
to be part of my future.

353
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,466
Song Cong.

354
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,740
Why don't we

355
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,470
break up?

356
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,710
Actually,

357
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,630
I've known for a long time

358
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,580
that we're not

359
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,710
from the same world.

360
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,430
We love freedom,

361
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,630
but our freedom

362
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,300
is different.

363
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,150
All these years,

364
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,540
I changed a lot

365
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,150
for us to be together.

366
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,300
I even

367
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,910
became less and less like myself.

368
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,630
Qi Qi.

369
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,430
Actually,

370
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,020
you're already excellent.

371
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,950
You don't have

372
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,222
to change yourself for me.

373
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,020
No.

374
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:40,100
You don't understand.

375
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,540
When we were in senior middle school,

376
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,780
you were too dazzling.

377
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,190
It made me think

378
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,580
I'm not good enough for you.

379
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,710
I can only stand behind you

380
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,990
and look at your back.

381
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,710
All this time,

382
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,190
I've been chasing after you.

383
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,100
I'm tired.

384
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,230
I can understand

385
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,020
what you said

386
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,870
because

387
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:32,710
I'm also chasing after you

388
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,910
right now.

389
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,710
In your world,

390
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,150
I might just be

391
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,260
an ordinary university student.

392
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,780
Compared with your imaginative

393
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,060
and exciting life,

394
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,390
my life is mundane.

395
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,100
Perhaps

396
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,780
our lives

397
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,710
are two intersecting lines

398
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,870
that will

399
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,470
only meet at a fixed time.

400
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Let's hug.

401
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,340
(Mom.)

402
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,990
(All these years,)

403
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,430
(you've always used the name of love)

404
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,740
(to coerce me into doing what you want.)

405
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,340
(But I'm unhappy)

406
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,300
(and distressed.)

407
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,190
(Then, I met a boy.)

408
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,390
(I found out)

409
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,430
(I could only love him in the same way.)

410
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,630
(I now realize)

411
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,540
(I gradually became another you.)

412
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,390
(Mom.)

413
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,870
(Do you think
this is the result you want?)

414
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,020

(our third year at university.)

440
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,266
Are you planning
to apply for a postgraduate?

441
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,710
I need to prepare early.

442
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,580
Is it stressful?

443
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,870
It's definitely stressful.

444
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,300
But I'll just keep calm.

445
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,540
Even if I can't get it,

446
00:25:50,644 --> 00:25:51,822
I can still take the exam.

447
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,820
You'll be fine.

448
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,950
Huan'er.

449
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,990
I'm going
to Huandao Technology tomorrow.

450
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,630
I talked to them

451
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,910
about a new cooperation model.

452
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,150
Firstly,

453
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,870
the company will help me invest.

454
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,630
Secondly, I'll also join the company

455
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,820
and let them help me

456
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,820
expand the work team.

457
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,340
Isn't that good?

458
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,740
It's indeed good.

459
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,060
It's just that...

460
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:15,390
it's just me and Zhou Ye

461
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,060
doing it.

462
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,780
I'm afraid

463
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,710
if we get busy,

464
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,910
maybe

465
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,950
I won't have time for you.

466
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,740
No way.

467
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,630
Are you this clingy now?

468
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,150
I'm always clingy.

469
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,540
Really?

470
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,390
I'll get water.

471
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,260
Wait.

472
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,430
I'll go.

473
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:37,740
Sit.

474
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,230
Phone.

475
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,300
Why did you take your phone?

476
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:43,244
None of your business.

477
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:44,555
Are you hiding something from me?

478
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,260
Why isn't he here yet?

479
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,060
Xichi.

480
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,300
Thanks.

481
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,190
What's wrong?

482
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:05,022
Where's the money?

483
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:06,100
I don't have any money now.

484
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,370
I'll pay you back at the dorm.

485
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:07,955
No.

486
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:10,710
The price will go up when you get back.

487
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,430
How much?

488
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,470
200.

489
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:14,977
Zhou Ye, do you have any heart?

490
00:27:16,822 --> 00:27:19,060
Call me if you need me
for something like this again.

491
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:25,820
Here.

492
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,430
Water

493
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,710
and this.

494
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,022
You bought it for me?

495
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:32,950
Of course.

496
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,300
Why is it brown sugar ginger tea?

497
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:41,422
What do you think?

498
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,470
How do you know it's today?

499
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,710
How could I not know?

500
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,710
Aunt Lina

501
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,630
has always reminded you

502
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:50,780
not to drink cold drinks
during your period.

503
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,260
I remember, but you don't.

504
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,300
I wondered how my mom

505
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,190
knew my every move.

506
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,340
Turns out it's you.

507
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,990
You little spy.

508
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,580
As long as it's good for your health,

509
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,755
I can be a spy.

510
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:01,060
Drink it while it's hot.

511
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:01,990
No.

512
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,260
It tastes like ginger.

513
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,390
I don't want to drink it.
I don't like it.

514
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:06,740
Hurry.

515
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,630
You...

516
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,500
Done.

517
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,950
No.

518
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,060
Library.

519
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,710
Library.

520
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,020
Finish this.

521
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,190
I'm tired.

522
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,500
Chen Huan'er, don't be lazy.

523
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,990
I'm tired.

524
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,630
Lend me your shoulder.

525
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,511
You can only lean for five minutes.

526
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,900
(Mom)

527
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,470
Hello? Mom.

528
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,540
Cong.

529
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,820
I asked your dad

530
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,311
to transfer 500 yuan more
for this month's living expenses.

531
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,260
Don't just

532
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,150
stay in your dorm and study all weekend.

533
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,390
Take Qi Qi out

534
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,340
for a meal or something.

535
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,710
No need, Mom.

536
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:26,340
I don't spend that much.

537
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:28,777
You don't need to transfer
so much to me in the future.

538
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,950
It's not for you.

539
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,740
It's to let you spend on Qi Qi.

540
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,390
We've broken up

541
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,230
for a while.

542
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,340
What happened?

543
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,390
Why did you break up?

544
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,500
Mom, my roommate is back.

545
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,060
I'll talk to you later.

546
00:30:04,044 --> 00:30:06,000
How did your internship interview go?

547
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,820
I changed majors halfway.

548
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:10,300
It's not that easy to find a job.

549
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:13,555
Have you decided to switch
from clinical to pharmaceuticals?

550
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:15,500
I've thought it through.

551
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,630
Clinical medicine takes too much time.

552
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,470
In one year,

553
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,111
all the four-year students
will be able to work and earn money.

554
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,820
Yet we still have to go to class.

555
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,060
Even if

556
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,230
I can work in a good hospital,

557
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,500
the salary won't be high.

558
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:28,740
The effort is not proportional

559
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,740
to the reward.

560
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,630
Besides, I come from an average family.

561
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,430
I feel bad
for asking my family for money

562
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,710
in my twenties.

563
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,511
Could you please share the WeChat

564
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,330
of the group admin
for the part-time job group

565
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,377
you mentioned last time?

566
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,060
Sure.

567
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:53,580
I've sent it.

568
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,020
Okay.

569
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,100
Jing.

570
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,710
Mr. Jiang.

571
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,430
You're here.

572
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:06,260
Long time no see.

573
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,190
Welcome.

574
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,630
This is Zhou Ye from our team.

575
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:11,870
Hello.

576
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,710
Hello, Zhou Ye.

577
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:13,630
I'm Jiang Sen.

578
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,630
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

579
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:16,630
We can finally cooperate officially.

580
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,300
We also look forward

581
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:19,644
to cooperating with Huandao.

582
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,390
Me too.

583
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,780
Mr. Jiang.

584
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,020
You're here.

585
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,990
Fu Ying.

586
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,020
Fu Ying.

587
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,500
Do you work here?

588
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:28,870
We have Ms. Fu to thank

589
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,390
for introducing us.

590
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,430
Jing, your project is good.

591
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,288
And Mr. Jiang has a keen eye for talent.

592
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:35,300
I'm just giving a hand.

593
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,500
Thank you, Fu Ying.

594
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,390
Thank you.

595
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:39,630
Alright, don't mention it.

596
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,260
Fu Ying.

597
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:41,529
Show them around.

598
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,230
I have a meeting to attend.
I'll go to work.

599
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:43,580
Okay.

600
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,580
Okay, Mr. Jiang.

601
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,190
Thank you, Fu Ying.

602
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,780
Fu Ying, are you free someday?

603
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,820
We'll treat you to a meal.

604
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,540
I'll gladly accept it,

605
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:55,222
but I have a business trip tomorrow.

606
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:56,422
How about we do it tonight?

607
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,630
We can do it tonight.

608
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,444
But my girlfriend's coming to see me.

609
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:00,600
Do you mind if she joins us?

610
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:02,340
The more, the merrier. It's alright.

611
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,111
I'll go upstairs
and deliver a document first.

612
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:05,133
Sit here and wait for me.

613
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:05,622
Sure.

614
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,555
Jing Xichi, have you lost your mind?

615
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:11,333
What's wrong?

616
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,955
You're taking your rumored girlfriend

617
00:32:12,955 --> 00:32:14,430
to dinner with your current girlfriend.

618
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,400
Huan'er will be jealous!

619
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,311
What rumored girlfriend?

620
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,710
Huixin told me everything.

621
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,470
You and Fu Ying

622
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,710
were photographed in the library.

623
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,870
It has spread all over. I know!

624
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,060
What is this all about?

625
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,100
Ms. Fu and I have nothing going on.

626
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,020
We're innocent.

627
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,390
Besides,

628
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,470
Huan'er isn't like that.

629
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,300
She won't believe it.

630
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:29,377
It doesn't matter.

631
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,190
You should avoid suspicion
in such matters.

632
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:32,822
Rumors spread like wildfire.

633
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,688
Do you understand?

634
00:32:34,022 --> 00:32:35,730
You have too little experience
in dating.

635
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,150
Girls are very sensitive

636
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,422
about this kind of thing.

637
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,470
Is it that serious?

638
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:42,910
If you don't believe what I say,

639
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,377
you can witness it yourself tonight.

640
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:45,870
I...

641
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,780
I'm telling you.

642
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,840
I'm not joining this dinner.
I have something to do.

643
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:49,740
Are you my buddy?

644
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,688
Why are you not going?

645
00:32:50,711 --> 00:32:51,150
I...

646
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:52,820
Let's go. I'll show you around.

647
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,820
Okay.

648
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,777
Come on. This way.

649
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,230
Think it over.

650
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,580
What do you have to do?

651
00:32:58,688 --> 00:32:59,888
I'm not going no matter what.

652
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,540
Sorry.

653
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,580
Am I late?

654
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,340
Huan'er, right?

655
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,622
See what's there to eat.

656
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,540
I'm okay with anything.

657
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,340
I'll order then.

658
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:11,740
Okay.

659
00:33:12,644 --> 00:33:13,470
Are you tired?

660
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,910
A little.

661
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,910
Here. Drink some water.

662
00:33:16,022 --> 00:33:16,977
We'll order these first.

663
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,580
Thank you.

664
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,400
Drink some water.

665
00:33:21,311 --> 00:33:23,177
How was it? It's a long way here, right?

666
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:24,990
Indeed.

667
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,820
It takes one and a half hours by bus.

668
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,580
Yes.

669
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:28,430
Huandao Technology

670
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,910
is a bit far from our school.

671
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:32,466
Have you considered renting a place?

672
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,444
I've been looking for a place lately.

673
00:33:34,622 --> 00:33:35,580
How about you check out

674
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,540
my residential area?

675
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,022
It's very close to the company.

676
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,780
It's only a ten-minute walk.

677
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:41,644
The key
is that it's an old residential area.

678
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:42,733
The rent is affordable.

679
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,300
Isn't it a good idea?

680
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,100
Yes.

681
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,430
Fu Ying.

682
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,910
If it's convenient,

683
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,710
could you give me

684
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,340
the agent's contact information?

685
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,470
No problem.

686
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,950
Let's add each other on WeChat first.

687
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:55,688
Sure. Thank you.

688
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,190
Thank you.

689
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,500
Fu Ying.

690
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,390
I want to ask you a question.

691
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:09,830
Go ahead.

692
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,700
What's

693
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,620
your lipstick color?

694
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,910
I thought you wanted to ask me

695
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,430
why I became a programmer?

696
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,620
Why would I ask you

697
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,430
this question?

698
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,060
Girls can do

699
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,430
whatever job they want.

700
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,580
You're right, Huan'er.

701
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,700
I used to hate it

702
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,200
when people asked me this question.

703
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,088
You're the only one

704
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:30,355
who didn't ask me this question.

705
00:34:30,377 --> 00:34:32,270
Fu Ying. People always
ask me questions too.

706
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,540
They asked me

707
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,270
why I applied for Sports Department,

708
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,870
and why did I learn martial arts.

709
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:38,311
Why are there so many questions?

710
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,540
Learning martial arts is great.

711
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,729
I can carry two buckets with one hand
to the water room

712
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,444
and climb five floors
without even panting.

713
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:44,060
Amazing.

714
00:34:44,355 --> 00:34:45,470
After hearing you say that,

715
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,990
I think I need to train too.

716
00:34:47,022 --> 00:34:49,350
Or I'll get occupational diseases
by sitting all day long.

717
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:50,540
You can try out

718
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,350
Baduanjin.

719
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,220
Baduanjin?

720
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:52,990
Yes.

721
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,580
You can keep fit

722
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,310
by practicing

723
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,950
for a few minutes every day.

724
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,020
It's easy.

725
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,270
(How come it's different)

726
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,239
(from what Zhou Ye said?)

727
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,220
Didn't I ask you to train before?
Have you trained?

728
00:35:02,222 --> 00:35:02,700
I did.

729
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,620
It's good.

730
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,990
But I don't know

731
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,910
how to practice this.

732
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:06,950
Do you have any...

733
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,390
It's fine.

734
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,540
I can send you the video.

735
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,540
Okay.

736
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,020
Why are you smiling?

737
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,910
I'm laughing at Zhou Ye's nonsense.

738
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,350
What did he say?

739
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,870
He said you would

740
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,620
mind me

741
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,470
working with Fu Ying.

742
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,790
How do you know

743
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,790
I don't mind?

744
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,790
You want me to scowl

745
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,155
while having dinner with Fu Ying?

746
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
No.

747
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,430
Jing Xichi.

748
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,390
Are you happy to be able

749
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,000
to work with a beautiful senior?

750
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,140
How could I be happy?

751
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,830
I'm telling you.

752
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,060
Fu Ying is scary at work.

753
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,222
She often scolds people.

754
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,180
I don't think so.

755
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,460
Didn't she help you find a house?
She's also nice to you.

756
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,140
No, she's just

757
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,220
kind enough to help.

758
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,470
Kind?

759
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,350
Kind...

760
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,140
Don't do this.

761
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,390
I'm scared when you do this.

762
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,140
You're scared?

763
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,700
You're scared now?

764
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,390
Yes.

765
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,100
Be good

766
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,060
and do whatever I say.

767
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,310
Don't worry.

768
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,470
Heaven can bear witness.

769
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,500
I...

770
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,540
I swear to this street lamp

771
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:17,310
that I will do whatever you say.

772
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:21,350
You don't believe me?

773
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,060
Do you believe me now?

774
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,060
What are you doing?

775
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,540
What's wrong?

776
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,350
I...

777
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,350
What's wrong?

778
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,620
I believe.

779
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,355
Isn't it normal
for a young couple to kiss?

780
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:40,622
What's wrong with that?

781
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:51,830
I didn't expect it was really you.

782
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:56,910
I didn't expect it was you too.

783
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,244
I started working part-time

784
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,390
when I was a freshman.

785
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,830
But I kept getting scammed by agents.

786
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,700
In a rage,

787
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,990
I created this group myself,

788
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,790
thinking I could help students

789
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,060
find a reliable job.

790
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:09,500
You don't have to worry
about commissions.

791
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,270
My fees are paid by the clients.

792
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:13,390
I heard from my roommate

793
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,220
that your group is well-managed.

794
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,390
Thank you.

795
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,270
Can I ask

796
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,600
why you want to work part-time?

797
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,190
I just want to save some money

798
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,220
before graduation.

799
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,500
Got it.

800
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,350
I have a job

801
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,540
suitable for you.

802
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,622
The client's child
is in Senior One this year.

803
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,540
I'll send you

804
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,620
the details

805
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,310
when I get back.

806
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:35,750
Sure.

807
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,310
Thank you then.

808
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:41,790
It's late now.

809
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,620
I'm done now.

810
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,500
You can go back.

811
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:45,140
I usually stay until closing time.

812
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,390
Me too.

813
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,910
What are you doing?

814
00:37:59,044 --> 00:37:59,990
I'm looking for a seat.

815
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,910
Sit here.

816
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,870
There's no place now.

817
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,020
What about you?

818
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,060
I happen to start my shift.

819
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,620
Shift?

820
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:09,870
I found a part-time job.

821
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,310
3.5 days a week.

822
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,430
The academic pressure is so great now.

823
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,580
You have to spend 3.5 days every week?

824
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:17,755
University isn't like
senior middle school.

825
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:18,555
Don't just study.

826
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:20,622
I consider it an internship.

827
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:21,466
I'll get paid too.

828
00:38:21,488 --> 00:38:22,222
Bye.

829
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,990
You can read.

830
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,355
I'll stop bothering you.

831
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:56,620
Come in.

832
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,220
Hello.

833
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,470
I'm here to see Professor...

834
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,910
It's you.

835
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,180
Professor Qiu said a junior would
be here to deliver documents.

836
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:20,100
I didn't expect it to be you.

837
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,220
He went out for something.

838
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,580
Give me the documents.

839
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:25,266
I'll take them to his office for you.

840
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:25,733
Sure.

841
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,540
Thank you.

842
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,910
Do you also want to pursue
a graduate program under Professor Qiu?

843
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,390
Are you already Professor Qiu's

844
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,270
graduate student?

845
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,350
Yes.

846
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:39,500
I just got admitted

847
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,200
to Professor Qiu's graduate program.

848
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,390
I can see that you're busy.

849
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,390
I got to go.

850
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,060
Sure.

851
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:19,000
It looks much more comfortable now.

852
00:40:23,644 --> 00:40:24,750
The chores looked like a lot

853
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,222
but they're quite easy to manage.

854
00:40:26,266 --> 00:40:27,400
I finished at nine o'clock.

855
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,470
Really?

856
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,540
Why does it feel like

857
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,430
a century has passed?

858
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,620
You lack exercise.

859
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,350
Okay.

860
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:38,700
I'm so tired.

861
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,620
I'm going back.

862
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,140
Oh no.

863
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,470
It's...

864
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,220
It's already eleven o'clock.

865
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,500
Your clock is broken.

866
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,790
If I go back now,

867
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,390
the dorm is closed.

868
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,100
Did you

869
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,430
do it on purpose?

870
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,910
How could I do it on purpose?

871
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,540
I didn't know that the clock

872
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,270
had stopped.

873
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,066
There's no battery installed.

874
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,830
Well...

875
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,470
What do we do now?

876
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,910
What can we do?

877
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,220
If you can't go back,

878
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,700
stay here.

879
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,140
Is this bed not big enough

880
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
for you?

881
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:31,910
Well...

882
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,140
If I sleep on the bed,

883
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,540
where will you sleep?

884
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,910
I don't need to sleep.

885
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,620
You're not sleeping?

886
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,620
No.

887
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,790
I meant...

888
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,390
I had a program to write today.

889
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,422
That program is pretty...

890
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:52,910
Pretty urgent.

891
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,270
So I was planning

892
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,620
to stay up all night

893
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,060
to finish it.

894
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:58,950
So

895
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,470
it's not because you came

896
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,350
that I'm not sleeping.

897
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,500
The bed...

898
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:03,540
I...

899
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,620
I know that.

900
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,430
Okay.

901
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:11,950
Well...

902
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,350
Well...

903
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,470
Do you want

904
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,830
to wash up first?

905
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,830
Yes.

906
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,140
I'll go wash up first.

907
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,511
