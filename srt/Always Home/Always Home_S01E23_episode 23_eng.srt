1
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:20,990


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,550
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,380
   

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,740
Liu Yuan!

18
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,480
You said the exam was legit, but I didn't get a single question right. Explain yourself!

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,600
Buddy, you've got it wrong.

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,320
How could I get the real questions?

21
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,134
What I sold you were mock questions I compiled

22
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:08,380
from previous years' Advanced Mathematics exams.

23
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,460
I spent 500 yuan on your mock questions?

24
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,000
Who's crazy here?

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,580
Buddy, show me proof.

26
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,620
Don't make unfounded accusations.

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,141
Even so, if I sold the real questions, it would be cheating.

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,600
You should've reported me to the dean's office instead of buying exam questions from me.

29
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,260
- Forget it. 
 - You fraud. Come down!

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,680
Forget it!

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,860
Don't argue with him. Forget it. Let's go.

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,540
- Come down! 
 - Stop it. Calm down.

33
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,840
- You scammer! 
 - Go.

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,640
Enough.

35
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,780
   

36
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,090
Why did you stop me just now?

37
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,240
I should've beaten him black and blue and taught him a lesson.

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,610
Just save your energy.

39
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,280
You should take this as a lesson. Just don't do it again.

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,120
No. I can't swallow this.

41
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,680
Come back.

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,000
Think about it. If you beat him up, not only will you not get your money back,

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,260
you'll also have to pay his medical bills.

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,440
People like him will blackmail you. You'll suffer.

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,520
Jeez.

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,930
Jing is right.

47
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,400
You should endure it and let things calm down.

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,550
I understand.

49
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,650
Endure it? The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

50
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,000
Anger will hurt your liver, young man.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,490
No. It's easy for you to say.

52
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,720
You're not the one who lost 500 yuan.

53
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,240
You know how many eggs I could've bought?

54
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,480
No! I want to beat him!

55
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,090
Don't stop me!

56
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,890
I'm going to beat him!

57
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,820
- Calm down! 
 - Put me down!

58
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,720
 The first semester of freshman year ended just like that. 

59
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,120
 Our Top Student got first place again as she wished. 

60
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,000
   

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,340
 Zhou Ye spent 500 yuan and still failed the exam. 

62
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,240
 As for Huang Lu and Qiu Li... 
   

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,440
 One scored 56, the other scored 59. 

64
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,820
 Obviously, Qiu Li who scored 59 was angrier than Huang Lu. 

65
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,070
How come you scored more than me?

66
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,560
Aren't I still one mark short?

67
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,650
Hello, Sir.

68
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,440
Could you help me check and see if you miscalculated?

69
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,290
 As for me, I didn't do too badly. 

70
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,850
 My score is 76. 

71
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,010
 There's still a lot of room for improvement. 

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,460
 What I didn't expect was that Jing Xi Chi, 

73
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,680
 who was at the bottom of the class in high school, 

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,460
 got full marks in Advanced Mathematics. 

75
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,730
 But no matter how we did in the exam, 

76
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,640
 these are already preludes in the river of time. 

77
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,010
 As for those unfinished stories, let's wait until next semester. 

78
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,240
   

79
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,560
Enough.

80
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
Stop looking at it.

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,370
We'll only know if it's benign or malignant after the biopsy.

82
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,850
What's a biopsy?

83
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,080
A biopsy means cutting it out for an examination.

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,850
Then hurry up and do it. What are you waiting for?

85
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,940
Do you think it's as easy as cutting vegetables?

86
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,288
You have to make an appointment.

87
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:18,700
So have you made an appointment?

88
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,320
Yes.

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,440
Take it easy. I'm a doctor.

90
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,880
- I know what to do. 
 - You make it sound so simple.

91
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,610
How could I not be nervous?

92
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,130
You should swallow that fear right back down.

93
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't let Huan Er know.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,850
She will be back soon. Hurry and put it away.

95
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,200
So many dishes still to cook.

96
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,530
- Hurry! 
 - Mom.

97
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,560
- Put it away. 
 - I'm back!

98
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,240
Coming!

99
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,050
My daughter is back.

100
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,240
- Mom! 
 - Darling, you're back.

101
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,490
My little dumpling!

102
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,080
- Let me see if you've gained weight. 
 - Your dad has been waiting.

103
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,380
One, two, three.

104
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,810
- She's like a piglet. 
 - Put her down.

105
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,640
- You're old now. Watch your waist! 
 - Not bad. Looks like you've put on some weight.

106
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,930
- Did I gain weight? 
 - No.

107
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,930
Hurry. Sit.

108
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,530
I almost forgot... Dad, Mom, I have a surprise for you.

109
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,850
You brought us gifts?

110
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,410
- Yes. 
 - Did you buy our gifts with our money?

111
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,610
- Jeez. 
 - Here. I prepared it myself.

112
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,050
- Really? 
 - Let me see.

113
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,800
Gosh. Look at this. Look who she took after.

114
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,630
- Oh no. 
 - No, Chen Huan Er.

115
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,780
What are you doing?

116
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,050
You have to tighten these bottles before putting them in.

117
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,610
You just put everything in.

118
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,640
Now I know.

119
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,170
It's my fault for not teaching you basic life skills.

120
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,680
- Enough. 
 - What will you do without me?

121
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,710
- I knitted the scarves myself. 
 - Stop nagging.

122
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,510
Enough. It's a token of her sincerity.

123
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,590
I knitted this red one for you.

124
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,220
The blue one is for Dad.

125
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,300
Sure.

126
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,860
There are only a few stitches left. I'll finish them soon.

127
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,910
It's fragrant. How nice.

128
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,150
Do you like it, Mom?

129
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,910
This color is not bad.

130
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,300
The stitching is not bad either.

131
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,180
You're talented.

132
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,740
- My classmate taught me. 
 - Good.

133
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,860
Honey, hurry and wash it for me.

134
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,830
I don't need to buy a scarf this year.

135
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,810
- Okay. 
 - Wash it clean.

136
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,660
- Do you like it? 
 - Okay.

137
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,830
My daughter did a good job.

138
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,880
Come and sit down. I have something for you.

139
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,830
How comfortable.

140
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,950
Mom.

141
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,830
I want beef with celery today.

142
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,180
Your favorite stir-fried beef with celery.

143
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,780
Here.

144
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,000
Sign this.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,540
Insurance? 
    

146
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,390
Why did you suddenly buy insurance?

147
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,160
I thought it was suitable and bought it for you.

148
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,720
You'll be insured and won't suffer any loss.

149
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,660
Besides, you're a grown-up girl.

150
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,040
Huan Er, you've grown up.

151
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,510
You need to learn to take care of yourself.

152
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,470
I can't stay by your side forever.

153
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,950
No. I want to be with you forever. I don't care.

154
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,510
Enough. Hurry and put those things away.

155
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,620
Later, Song Cong, Xi Chi and their families will be here for a meal.

156
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,710
- Look at you. 
 - When will they be here?

157
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,180
Soon.

158
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,640
I don't care. Put it away yourself.

159
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,340
Mom, I'll put it in the bathroom first.

160
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,510
How dare you come back?

161
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,460
Why did you change your major?

162
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,340
Many people try very hard to get into

163
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,150
the law program at University of Political Science and Law.

164
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,680
Look at you!

165
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,990
You changed to some literature?

166
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,872
I'm just trying to do what I want.

167
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:52,390
You're using your family's money to do what you want.

168
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,210
What an easy life.

169
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,133
You don't have to use money to pressure me.

170
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:04,160
I know that parents have no obligation to support their adult children.

171
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,650
I'll find a way to pay for my future tuition. You don't have to worry.

172
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,750
I'm an adult now.

173
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,460
You're no longer my guardian.

174
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,180
You've grown capable since going to university.

175
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,090
Sure. Since you're talking to me about the law, let me tell you

176
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,260
that adult children have a lifetime obligation to support their parents.

177
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,150
As long as I live, you'll always be my daughter.

178
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,510
You can never repay what you owe me.

179
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,280
Okay.

180
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,246
Go ahead and sue me, Ms. Qi.

181
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:38,630
I'll repay you whatever amount the court sentences me.

182
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,210
By then, we'll be completely even.

183
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,130
 Be careful. Don't burn yourself. 

184
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,720
- Here. Be careful. 
 - Be careful, Mom.

185
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,820
It's hot, Mom.

186
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
Amazing. You cooked so much.

187
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,540
Here. Here.

188
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,320
- Here, you can start. 
 - You can do it.

189
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,280
Our three families are having a pre‑New Year's dinner tonight.

190
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,670
I'll propose a toast.

191
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,120
Congratulations to each of us, for spending another year safely.

192
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,170
Happy New Year!

193
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,160
- Happy New Year! 
 - Happy New Year!

194
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,990
Li Na, you're awesome.

195
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,180
You made so much food.

196
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,030
Good job. Your cooking has improved.

197
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,350
All right. Our cooking is far inferior to Hao Mei's.

198
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,660
- Yes. 
 - Kids. Don't be picky.

199
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,860
- Just enjoy. 
 - Sure.

200
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,940
But when is your husband coming?

201
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't even mention it. Got a call from the hospital this afternoon and rushed off again.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,930
I told him we'd have dinner together and come early.

203
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,180
- Or he would have to wash the pots. 
 - That's right.

204
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,910
Ask him to hurry up.

205
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,700
Speak of the devil. He's here.

206
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,990
Not bad. He's fast.

207
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,090
Not bad. Look at him.

208
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,480
 - Yeah. 
 - He made it in time. 

209
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,240
 - He knows we have delicious food today. 
 - That's right. 

210
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,170
Qi Qi?

211
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,380
Why are you here?

212
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,760
Huan Er, I had a fight with my mom.

213
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,720
Can I stay at your house for a few days?

214
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,640
What happened?

215
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,390
I'll tell you later.

216
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,990
Hurry. Hurry inside.

217
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,110
Mom, Qi Qi came to visit us today.

218
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,160
Well... Hello, everyone. Sorry for bothering you.

219
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,810
Qi Qi's here. Sit here.

220
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,870
- Huan Er, get a pair of chopsticks. 
 - Okay.

221
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,050
- Get a set of tableware. 
 - Okay.

222
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,300
- Sorry for bothering you. 
 - No. It's fine.

223
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,420
Look, all those high schoolers are now university students.

224
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,120
- Not bad, right? 
 - Huan Er, have you grown taller?

225
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,230
- Right? 
 - She did.

226
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,480
She seems to have grown taller.

227
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,720
Did she? Why do I feel like she's shorter than when I first met her?

228
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,280
Who's short? Get up. Let's compare.

229
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,800
- Have I grown taller? 
 - Enough.

230
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,420
- Have I grown taller? 
 - Who's taller?

231
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,080
- I've grown taller! 
 - Hurry up. Come over and eat.

232
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,530
You two argue every day.

233
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,030
Troublemakers.

234
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,110
Li Na.

235
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,870
I think Huan Er would be a good match for Xi Chi.

236
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,960
Yi Fan.

237
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,800
Show some decency.

238
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,180
I had my eye on Chen Huan Er first.

239
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,320
She's my daughter-in-law. You can't steal her from me.

240
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,276
Your son is handsome and capable.

241
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:05,400
He'll find a girlfriend.

242
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,820
- Yeah. 
 - Xi Chi is incapable.

243
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,250
Look at that silly kid.

244
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,870
He's indeed handsome. I won't argue with you on this.

245
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,680
But his personality and temper are just like his dad's.

246
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,820
Too inarticulate.

247
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,160
He's unlike Xi Chi, who's good-natured and clever.

248
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,640
My son is incapable. That's why...

249
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,630
That's not what you said.

250
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,520
How could you two say that?

251
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,840
Even I can't stand it anymore. Seriously.

252
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,154
- Yeah. 
 - Are you saying that Huan Er

253
00:12:29,154 --> 00:12:31,510
- can only pick what's left? 
 - That's not what I meant.

254
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,760
Have you two decided on Huan Er's marriage?

255
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,940
Whether my daughter wants a boyfriend, she has to ask her father for permission first.

256
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,060
- Right? 
 - Chen. Calm down.

257
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,030
They're in university now, so it's time they started dating.

258
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,780
- In this society... 
 - All right. My dears, stop arguing.

259
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,910
Huan Er, while everyone is here, take your pick.

260
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,050
Will you pick Xi Chi or Song Cong?

261
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,610
What? We have to stick together, you know?

262
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,290
- You can't do this. 
 - Aunt.

263
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,510
Aunt.

264
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,610
Aunt.

265
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,250
I'm actually dating Song Cong.

266
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,570
­What?

267
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,440
It's...

268
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,820
We're dating.

269
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,340
I haven't had time to tell you yet, Mom.

270
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,390
- Hao Mei. 
 - Hao Mei, not bad.

271
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,180
- Jeez. 
 - Listen to the way you put it.

272
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,270
- Not bad. 
 - Not bad, Hao Mei.

273
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,910
Girlie, take my seat. Here.

274
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,860
Why is this person like this?

275
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,180
I really didn't know.

276
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,320
Aunt Hao.

277
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,920
- I was just joking. 
 - It's all right, Aunt Hao.

278
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,260
I'm not picky. I can eat anything.

279
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,440
Mom, Qi Qi's staying here today.

280
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,670
Sure.

281
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,230
Huan Er, accompany me to buy some toiletries later.

282
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,400
Sure.

283
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,480
Jing Xi Chi, you're coming with me.

284
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,730
Cong, are you coming?

285
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,580
I think I'll pass.

286
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,050
After dinner, I'll help Aunt Li Na clean up.

287
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,580
No need.

288
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,870
- I can also take my mom home later. 
 - It's all right.

289
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,150
Go with Qi Qi.

290
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,080
It's fine. Let Song Cong take care of you.

291
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,030
How sensible. Look at her.

292
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,700
You should learn from her.

293
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,660
So... I... I'm not your little girl anymore.

294
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,023
- He's a doting father. 
 - I think...

295
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,760
If you don't let him eat, how can he pick?

296
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,260
Enough, Yi Fan. Stop playing matchmaker.

297
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,780
You speak as if it's true.

298
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,700
Xi Chi, learn from him.

299
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,780
Silly child.

300
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,780
Chen Huan Er, are you not tired of eating the same thing every day?

301
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,060
None of your business.

302
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,010
Qi Qi. Do you want to try it?

303
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,020
No. I'm full.

304
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,060
What's wrong?

305
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,660
You don't seem all right.

306
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,270
Are you thinking about your family?

307
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,130
No.

308
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,680
I just regret what I said at the dinner table.

309
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,200
You walk ahead. Don't eavesdrop on us.

310
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,680
I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to music.

311
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,180
It's all right.

312
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,130
You were just helping me out.

313
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,110
Besides, Aunt Hao and Uncle Song are nice.

314
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,360
And they like you.

315
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,480
But I think Song Cong is a little upset.

316
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,150
- Is he? 
 - Yes.

317
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,150
Do you think Song Cong doesn't like me that much?

318
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,460
No way!

319
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,890
If he dislikes you, why would he confess to you?

320
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,540
If he dislikes you, he won't acknowledge your relationship.

321
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,660
He's not that unreliable.

322
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,810
Don't overthink it.

323
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,760
You're right.

324
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,840
Go to Cong's house later.

325
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,340
Okay.

326
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,640
- I don't want to eat anymore. 
 - Really? It's delicious.

327
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,760
I don't want to eat anymore. It's all fried food.

328
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,320
Cong.

329
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,460
Why do I feel like you're acting a little weird today?

330
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,460
Isn't it good to talk things out?

331
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,520
Why are you still upset?

332
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,580
I'm not upset.

333
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,500
I just think it's embarrassing to say this in front of our parents.

334
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,120
What's embarrassing about that?

335
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,540
Are you not embarrassed?

336
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,900
Why didn't you admit you liked Chen Huan Er during dinner?

337
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,290
We're talking about you. Why are you involving me?

338
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,680
I think Qi Qi was quite upset when we got back just now.

339
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,830
- Uncle Song. 
 - Dad.

340
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,340
Xi Chi is also here.

341
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,980
I heard from your mom that you have a girlfriend.

342
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,920
It's a good thing.

343
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,277
Your mom asked me to talk to you.

344
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:15,900
I don't know what to talk about.

345
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,070
Many concepts at my age are outdated.

346
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:23,210
They might not help you,

347
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,390
but there's one thing I want to remind you.

348
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,860
Adults must take responsibility for their choices.

349
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,110
If you really like her, just be bold and go after her.

350
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,810
If you get together, cherish her.

351
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,760
Don't hesitate.

352
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,660
Otherwise, the losses will outweigh the gains.

353
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,970
I hope you can learn how to love others

354
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,450
and yourself through dating.

355
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,260
Song Cong.

356
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,070
It's your life.

357
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,480
There are many things you will only understand if you experience them yourself.

358
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,940
I think your dad made a good point.

359
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,800
Think about it yourself.

360
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,062
- You're leaving? 
 - Yes.

361
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,120
 Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow? 

362
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,690
Mom, I'm back.

363
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,890
Mom.

364
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,500
 You've grown taller. 

365
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,091
 - Really? 
 - You look like an adult now. 

366
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,028
 I'm off. 

367
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,150
Mom.

368
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,520
Mom?

369
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,380
What are you doing?

370
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,440
Well, I'm taking out another set of bowls and chopsticks that we usually use.

371
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,195
Your grandma is coming to celebrate the New Year with us this year.

372
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:33,640
Grandma is coming?

373
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,620
Great.

374
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
- What's the matter? 
 - Is Qi Qi asleep?

375
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,440
She got a message from Song Cong, saying they're going on a date tomorrow.

376
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,460
She's taking her beauty sleep.

377
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,940
Did you ask what did she argue with her mom about?

378
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,648
She is switching to a literature major.

379
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:53,830
Her mom disagreed, so they had an argument.

380
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,140
You must admit that Qi Qi is pretty opinionated.

381
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,352
She confessed in front of everyone that she was dating Song Cong.

382
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:03,420
She's quite brave.

383
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,790
She is indeed brave.

384
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,260
Mom.

385
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,700
If a girl has someone she likes, should she take the initiative?

386
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,630
Of course.

387
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,740
Huan Er, I'm telling you.

388
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,460
It's not easy to meet the right person in your life.

389
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,940
Once you meet one, go after him.

390
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,590
Girls taking the initiative isn't shameful.

391
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,752
Huan Er, young people nowadays are more open-minded.

392
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:40,910
After you start a relationship, you must remember to protect yourself.

393
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,510
Take safety measures. And those so-called "safe days"?

394
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,340
- They're not real. 
 - Mom.

395
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,684
- Don't believe that stuff. 
 - I don't have a boyfriend.

396
00:21:46,684 --> 00:21:48,290
Why are you telling me this?

397
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,390
Well... I have a lot to tell you.

398
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,160
I'll tell you as early as I can.

399
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,464
What if there's no time later?

400
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,584
No time for what?

401
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,700
Nothing.

402
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,180
Go to bed.

403
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,340
Good night, Mom.

404
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,790
The fifth row.

405
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,660
This outfit doesn’t look like something you’d wear.

406
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,150
I'm wearing Huan Er's clothes.

407
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,870
You haven't made up with Aunt yet?

408
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,520
No.

409
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,320
I didn't expect you to ask me out to watch a movie.

410
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,750
Qi Qi.

411
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,700
I'll try to do my best as your boyfriend.

412
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,740
But the truth is, this is my first relationship.

413
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,500
So if there's anything I'm not doing well, you have to tell me.

414
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,830
Sure.

415
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,740
But you need to think it through.

416
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,450
I have high requirements.

417
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,660
I'll try my best.

418
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm just kidding.

419
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:15,210
Actually, I'm content as long as the two of us can be together.

420
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,110
I had a chat with my dad last night.

421
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,980
They're supportive of our relationship.

422
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,310
Really?

423
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,700
You even told your dad?

424
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,310
Yes.

425
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:35,195
Here's a reward.

426
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,245
Have you told your mom?

427
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,830
I...

428
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,310
I haven't.

429
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,700
Let's watch the movie.

430
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,110
 Song Cong, time for New Year's Eve dinner. 

431
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,660
Coming!

432
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,940
Food is coming.

433
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,830
- Mom, stop busying yourself. 
 - It's okay.

434
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,360
Mom, my cooking isn't as good as yours.

435
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,070
No. Your cooking is much better than mine.

436
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,695
I wish Grandma, Dad, and Mom good health, good luck, peace, and harmony.

437
00:24:57,695 --> 00:24:58,745
Happy New Year!

438
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:01,040
- Happy New Year. 
 - What a sweet talker.

439
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,910
Thank you, Huan Er.

440
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,070
Here. New year, new beginnings.

441
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,220
Your dad and I have no other wishes for you.

442
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,910
We only wish you good health and peace in the new year.

443
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,010
Here. Happy New Year.

444
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,145
Happy New Year.

445
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,820
Try your dad's cooking.

446
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,295
Happy New Year.

447
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:42,495
Happy New Year, Mom.

448
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,987
I forgot to get the dumplings.

449
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,720
Mom, let me get them.

450
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,865
Huan Er has grown up.

451
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,110
You take care of your mom now.

452
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,660
No, there's still a long way off.

453
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,410
She's forgetful and careless.

454
00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:26,245
   

455
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,480
 Dr. Qian, I heard about your situation. 

456
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,790
 It's best to get a biopsy done after New Year. 

457
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,495
 It's better to do it sooner rather than later. 

458
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,020
 Mom! 

459
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,460
 Mom! 

460
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,080
Mom, why did you get up so early? You didn't even wake me up. Jeez.

461
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,350
I'm used to it.

462
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,280
Did Chen Lei make breakfast for you?

463
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,994
No, I made it.

464
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,420
Why didn't Chen Lei do it for you?

465
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,690
He went to the temple to pray.

466
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,420
Okay. I'll leave him alone then.

467
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Are you watching TV?

468
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,100
It's mute.

469
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,145
I'm just watching for fun.

470
00:27:23,145 --> 00:27:25,080
You were still asleep. I was worried I'd disturb you.

471
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,870
- It's okay. 
 - Huan Er is still asleep.

472
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,370
Look at the time.

473
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,460
 She's still lying in bed at this age. It's time to wake up. 

474
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,660
 Why are you also acting like a child? 

475
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,745
 - I never grow up. 
 - You're arguing with her? 

476
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,350
Mom.

477
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,396
Grandma.

478
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:46,440
Happy New Year.

479
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,700
- Happy New Year. 
 - Happy New Year.

480
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,630
Look.

481
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,200
Mom.

482
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,578
She's already in university, yet you're still giving her a red envelope.

483
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:57,020
- Thank you, Grandma. 
 - It's New Year.

484
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,660
Look what this is.

485
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,690
- This is yours. 
 - I don't want it.

486
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,790
Take it. It's from me.

487
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,270
It's from me. Take it.

488
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,470
Happy New Year.

489
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,770
Happy New Year.

490
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,940
You're all my darlings.

491
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,495
Uncle is calling. It must be to wish you a happy New Year.

492
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:14,590
- Here. Answer it. 
 - Okay.

493
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,870
Let me take the call.

494
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,630
Hello? Hey. Happy New Year!

495
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,000
 Is everything okay at home? 

496
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,350
 I'm fine. I'm in good health. 

497
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,500
It's the new year.

498
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,860
I wish you health and happiness.

499
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,707
What's the matter?

500
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:42,070
You took Grandma's red envelope but not mine?

501
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,710
Mom.

502
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:50,120
Yesterday, I saw your text message.

503
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,400
It's okay. It's just a minor surgery. Don't worry.

504
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,191
It's New Year. Be happy.

505
00:28:58,191 --> 00:28:59,840
Don't let Grandma know. You hear me?

506
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,260
Don't overthink.

507
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,310
How did it go? How is he?

508
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,840
He's okay. All his family is well.

509
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,020
Great.

510
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,080
Huan Er, brush your teeth. It's time to eat.

511
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,910
- Grandma made it. 
 - Yes, eat breakfast.

512
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,740
- Mom, here. 
 - Hurry.

513
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,260
I bought you a new hat.

514
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,720
I noticed the old one was worn.

515
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,180
I want to take you shopping this afternoon.

516
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,790
 That was the first time I realized 

517
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:34,040
 that learning to keep secrets is an important lesson in growing up. 

518
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,926
What's wrong?

519
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:49,670
It's New Year, yet you look upset.

520
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:55,815
What's wrong?

521
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,700
My mom...

522
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,140
was diagnosed with a tumor.

523
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,600
Is it benign or malignant?

524
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,910
We don't know yet.

525
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,470
She needs an operation.

526
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,870
- Do you think my mom would... 
 - It must be benign.

527
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,872
Don't scare yourself before you know anything.

528
00:30:42,872 --> 00:30:44,495
Sure.

529
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,250
Yes.

530
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,690
Grandma.

531
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,530
It's late.

532
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,700
Why are you still awake?

533
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,210
I'm going through your mom's photo album.

534
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,510
I heard your mom say you made this for her.

535
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,303
During high school.

536
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,830
Our Huan Er has grown up, and is sensible.

537
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,700
It'll be fine.

538
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,590
 At that moment, I suddenly understood 

539
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:13,560
 that Grandma and I are keeping the same secret for each other. 

540
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,620
 She's a mother. 

541
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,690
 A mother who's willing to pretend that she knows nothing. 

542
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:25,430
 Because she doesn't want her daughter to worry about her 

543
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:29,860
 while suffering from illness. 

544
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,611
Mom, this is braised pork knuckle I made for you.

545
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:12,680
Remember to put it in the refrigerator after you're home.

546
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,270
Or it will go bad.

547
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,980
This is a new type of diabetes medication.

548
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,910
I've written out the instructions for you.

549
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,200
How many times a day, how many pills each time.

550
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,670
Got it.

551
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,060
I'm not senile yet.

552
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:32,080
Mom, I have to rush to work and still need to clean up, so I won't be sending you off.

553
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,310
Don't worry about me. I have my son-in-law.

554
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,690
Yes, I'm here. Don't worry.

555
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,740
Bye.

556
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,830
- Huan Er. 
 - Grandma.

557
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,390
I will miss you.

558
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,744
I will call you. Take good care of yourself.

559
00:34:46,744 --> 00:34:49,060
Sure, don't worry.

560
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,270
Mom.

561
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,830
You must pay attention to your health.

562
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:56,190
And if you're not feeling well, let me know.

563
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,670
I'll go back to visit you if I have time.

564
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,750
Sure.

565
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,320
Take good care of yourself too.

566
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,830
- Don't worry. 
 - Don't let me worry.

567
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,360
Bye.

568
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:10,460
Huan Er, no need to see me off.

569
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,270
- Dad, let me see you guys off. 
 - All right.

570
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,290
Your grandma said no, so don't come out.

571
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,160
Dad, be safe.

572
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,597
Go back inside.

573
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,920
Mom, stop crying.

574
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,140
You're wasting water.

575
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,620
I'm not crying.

576
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,060
Well...

577
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,650
Don't be nervous about the operation tomorrow.

578
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,440
The test results will be fine.

579
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,540
I'm not nervous. You're the one who's nervous.

580
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,060
Why would I be nervous?

581
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,390
You're nervous.

582
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,840
Look. Even your hands are sweating. Look, it's all sweat.

583
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,510
Sweat...

584
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,650
All right.

585
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,320
It's late.

586
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,960
Go home.

587
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,190
There's no rush.

588
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,390
- People will see you. 
 - Let me stay with you for a while longer.

589
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,310
Here.

590
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,940
Gosh.

591
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,510
You're here.

592
00:37:36,544 --> 00:37:38,388
How did it go?

593
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,620
We don't know yet.

594
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:50,110
They'll need to do the tests after surgery to confirm the final result.

595
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,079
You must have starved the whole day.

596
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,691
Have some food.

597
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,610
Thank you.

598
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,140
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

599
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:26,124
It isn't your fault.

600
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,850
Aunt Li Na will be fine.

601
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,800
   

602
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,480
   

603
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,670
How did it go?

604
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,376
Yi Fan, why are you here?

605
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:01,280
I should be here. We're family. How long has she been in there?

606
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,060
It's been a long time. I don't know either. 
    

607
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,304
- It's over. 
 - It's over, Dad.

608
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:07,960
- This door... 
 - No rush. It'll be over soon.

609
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,197
- Doctor. 
 - Doctor.

610
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:10,980
- How did it go? 
 - Everything went well.

611
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,910
Family members can wait in the ward.

612
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,732
Judging from the tumor removed, there should be no problem.

613
00:40:15,732 --> 00:40:17,928
But we still have to wait for the biopsy results.

614
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:19,656
All right. Thank you.

615
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:21,350
- Thank you, Doctor. 
 - Don't mention it. Go.

616
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,128
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

617
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,760
Dad, she's fine.

618
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,867
Look, I told you it's a minor operation.

619
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:31,710
Yet you still came to accompany me. You make me very nervous.

620
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,330
- Uncle. 
 - I... I'll buy you some drinks.

621
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,808
- No need, Uncle. No. 
 - No need. Stand here.

622
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,072
- It's okay. 
 - There's no need.

623
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,000
 Dad is still the same as before. 

624
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,310
 The more nervous he is, the more he acts like he doesn't care. 

625
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:53,770
 I don't know if it's to comfort others or himself. 

626
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,740
- Slow down. 
 - Mom, slow down.

627
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,270
- It's okay. 
 - Slow down.

628
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,980
- It's okay. 
 - Let Huan Er help you.

629
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,870
Let me do it myself. I'm not a porcelain doll.

630
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,560
Jeez.

631
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,460
Hey, honey.

632
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,040
Xi Chi is capable.

633
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,700
Doesn't he look like our son-in-law?

634
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,100
Son-in-law? Stop playing matchmaker.

635
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,520
He's handsome and has no shortage of girlfriends.

636
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,420
They're just good friends.

637
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,610
What son-in-law?

638
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,316
Xi Chi.

639
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:33,320
Sorry to have bothered you recently.

640
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,200
I can't take care of you all for now.

641
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,820
You two will be back in school in two days.

642
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,331
Can I ask you to look after Huan'er on the road?

643
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:42,070
Aunt Li Na, don't worry. Leave Chen Huan Er to me.

644
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,610
Here, get up.

645
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,830
- I'll do it myself. Don't touch me. 
 - Let me.

646
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,100
Okay, go.

647
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,310
Don't force yourself.

648
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:55,824
- Don't touch me. Let me do it myself. 
 - I know. Let me help you.

649
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:07,580

 "Yesterday’s Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

651
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:19,470
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

652
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,240
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

653
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:32,670
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

654
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:39,060
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

655
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:46,670
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

656
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,600
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

657
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,280
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

658
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,980
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

659
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,840
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

660
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:16,060
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

661
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,780
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

662
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,240
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

663
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,510
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

664
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:34,500
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

665
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,300
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

666
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:43,340
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

667
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,930
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

668
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,570
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

669
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,980
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

670
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:01,260
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

671
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:06,860
♫  At the right time  ♫
