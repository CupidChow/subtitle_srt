00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,080
Song!

17
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,490
What's on your mind?

18
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,330
Huan'er is right.

19
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,640
This is not the life I want.

20
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm not exactly enjoying
the international program.

21
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,960
Song.

22
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,859
Why do you care so much about

23
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,680
what Chen Huan'er said?

24
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,139
Why?

25
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,730
Don't skip your physical training.

26
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,169
Dad.

27
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,050
When you shoot for the goal,

28
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,609
the ball is too slow.

29
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,419
Hello, Mr.Jing.

30
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,520
Hey there, Song Cong.

31
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,659
What brings you here?

32
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,889
Why wouldn't I be here?

33
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,450
You are barely at home.

34
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,449
Your shoes are always
covered in dirt and grass.

35
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,920
I'm not a fool.

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,099
Does Mom know too?

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,979
What?

38
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,240
She's your concern?

39
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,489
I'm standing right here.
Aren't you concerned?

40
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,770
You misunderstood.

41
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,889
All I want to say is that

42
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,169
your senses are so sharp that perhaps
you could help me out...

43
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,099
Fine.

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,040
Enough about that.

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,289
Why did you sneak out
to play football at night?

46
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,819
What's the matter?
Why not train with your school's team?

47
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,049
That's not it.

48
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,099
Their level is too low for me.

49
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,859
I'm aiming to go professional.

50
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,889
Training with them

51
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,520
is like playing with children.

52
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,840
When I was young,

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,330
I had the same ambition.

54
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,240
I had my idols.

55
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,169
Maradona and Baggio

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,640
were my idols.

57
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,400
But when it comes to football,

58
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,939
it depends on your talent

59
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,800
and fate.

60
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,609
I think you're doing great

61
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,489
for now.

62
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,840
It's a great hobby.

63
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,680
Dad!

64
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,210
You sound just like Mom!

65
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,379
You two went through the trouble
of finding me

66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,289
a coach.

67
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,450
You sent me to training every time.

68
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,379
Why are you

69
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,360
asking to treat it like a hobby?

70
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,290
You're unbelievable.

71
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,539
Song Cong.

72
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,680
Take a seat.

73
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,570
You, come with me.

74
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,379
If you hit this bottle

75
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,920
with every shot,

76
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,840
you might have a chance
to go professional.

77
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,210
Come on.

78
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,080
It didn't even graze it.

79
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,010
Again!

80
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,130
It's alright.

81
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,859
That was my first shot.

82
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,960
After ten thousand shots, I can surely hit it.

83
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,890
Why did you transfer to a different class?

84
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,960
For personal reasons.

85
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,480
Personal reasons?

86
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,779
How personal is that?

87
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,929
Is it so personal

88
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,400
that your parents don't know?

89
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,370
They know.

90
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,690
I have a question.

91
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,779
So many outstanding students

92
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,010
are trying to get a spot
in our class.

93
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,689
Some even cried and begged to get in.

94
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,330
But, I've never seen one
who wanted to leave.

95
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,520
Song Cong.

96
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,210
Why wouldn't you stay in this class?

97
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,840
I've made up my mind.

98
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,450
I need your blessing.

99
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,600
Thanks, sir.

100
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,080
Unbelievable.

101
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,720
Song Cong?

102
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,570
What's wrong?
Is it something exciting?

103
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,609
I see.

104
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,130
You won first place.

105
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,280
Congratulations.

106
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,450
It's not that.

107
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,289
Congratulations.

108
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,080
Your essay was selected
as the best.

109
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,640
I should get going.

110
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,280
Qi Qi.

111
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,480
In the exam, the essay isn't
a showcase of your writing style.

112
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,400
You need to score points.

113
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,640
I want you to redo the essay.

114
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,609
(The Power of A Family's Bond)

115
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,400
Can I read the essay?

116
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,160
Didn't you hear the teacher?

117
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,400
I didn't score the points.

118
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,770
I must redo it.

119
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,840
Does it matter?

120
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,930
I trust my own judgment.

121
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,520
(Song Cong's words)

122
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,689
(help me understand the joy)

123
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,570
(of being understood.)

124
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,960
(I believe)

125
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,450
(it's a force of attraction,
like magnets.)

126
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,929
(Someday,)

127
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,960
(I'll get the response I long for.)

128
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,539
Mom and Dad.

129
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,570
Welcome home.

130
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,520
Song Cong.

131
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,280
We must have a word.

132
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,130
Your homeroom teacher just called.

133
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,250
You asked for a class transfer.

134
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,640
Why didn't you tell me?

135
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,640
You're already busy with your work.

136
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,160
I didn't want to worry you.

137
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,210
Besides,

138
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,929
I think I can

139
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,280
handle the matter.

140
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,370
It's not that serious.

141
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,840
How is this not serious?

142
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,520
Tell me, what is serious?

143
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,450
Why the class transfer?

144
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,570
You even lied by saying
we knew about it.

145
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,729
Actually,

146
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,960
if that's his wish, so be it.

147
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,130
He doesn't have to study abroad.

148
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,570
Song Hang, don't make up
excuses for him.

149
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,609
The international class

150
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,899
and studying abroad

151
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,609
were all matters we discussed.

152
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,649
We planned it all.

153
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,650
Why did you change your mind?

154
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,720
You went as far as

155
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,930
getting a class transfer
behind our back!

156
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,600
Song Cong.

157
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,000
You were always so obedient as a kid.

158
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,699
Why have you...

159
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,410
I've grown up.

160
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,450
Mom.

161
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,810
I thought it through.

162
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,339
I don't want to be in the class

163
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,330
or go to an elite university.

164
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,579
We're not a rich family anyway.

165
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,609
You shouldn't live such a frugal life

166
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,480
only to send me overseas.

167
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,480
Besides,

168
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,699
the local universities

169
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,099
are just as great.

170
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,459
If I stay, I can definitely

171
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,129
get into the best universities.

172
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,840
I won't disappoint you.

173
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,570
Disappointment?

174
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,050
Do you take me for Li Tian's parents?

175
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,459
Did I put you in that class

176
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,489
and send you abroad

177
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,530
only to make me look good?

178
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,840
You think too lowly of your mom.

179
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,649
I'm not highly educated.

180
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,000
But I've been through hardships!

181
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,729
Ever since you were born,

182
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,339
I told myself

183
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,609
to never let you suffer

184
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,240
the same fate as me.

185
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,099
Even when you were little,

186
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,459
I inquired everyone I could

187
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,729
so you could be outstanding.

188
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,009
I know.

189
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,489
I know that, Mom.

190
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,080
I understand.

191
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,579
You've always

192
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,409
put me before everything.

193
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,650
I'm aware of that.

194
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,170
Even when you...

195
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,410
You love your walnuts,

196
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,650
but you save them as tonics for me.

197
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,330
My brain doesn't need
that much tonics, Mom.

198
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,699
I am aware of how much
you've sacrificed for me,

199
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,939
so I study so hard every day
of my life

200
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,360
and follow every step as you say.

201
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,099
But you never asked me

202
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,210
what life I want and my ambition.

203
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,080
Did I not ask you?

204
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,330
Did I not do that?

205
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,649
Every time I asked,

206
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,009
you were like your dad.

207
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,810
Your answer was always "whatever".

208
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,699
Fine, forget that I ever asked.

209
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,769
Tell me now.

210
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,819
What do you like?

211
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,819
What don't you like?

212
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,050
Tell me.

213
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,690
Say it!

214
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,570
I don't like walnuts.

215
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,050
I want to be like everyone else.

216
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,480
Sometimes, I really envy Xichi.

217
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,050
I envy him

218
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,960
when he cracks jokes with friends.

219
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,330
He can go home after school.

220
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,240
He can join extracurricular activities.

221
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,939
You and Dad may not

222
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,059
believe me,

223
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,050
but that is how I feel.

224
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,330
My son,

225
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,409
we...

226
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,650
- We never knew you felt that way.
- Please, Mom and Dad.

227
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,939
I didn't make this decision on a whim.

228
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,939
I've decided

229
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,480
which major I want to take.

230
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,120
What might that be?

231
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,059
Tell me.

232
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,360
What major is that?

233
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,129
I'm giving you a chance.

234
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,650
Why are you telling me?

235
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,000
Fine, Song Cong.

236
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,760
You are not being honest with us.

237
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,339
I didn't believe it

238
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,529
when they said raising a kid

239
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,649
brings suffering.

240
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,600
I never believed my son
would be the case.

241
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,210
But I know I'm wrong now.

242
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,600
You don't like walnuts?

243
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,480
Why didn't you tell me?

244
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,649
I did everything for you.

245
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,570
I did it all for your sake.

246
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,179
Have I not done everything for you?

247
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,170
Mom!

248
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,530
Mom, doing this

249
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,360
makes you the same as Li Tian's mother.

250
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,760
Song Cong.

251
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,249
You want to quit.

252
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,649
Hao Mei!

253
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,409
Fine.

254
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,179
Get rid of these.

255
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,529
Mom!

256
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,529
Save us some space.

257
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,570
You don't need these! What is that for?

258
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,219
Calm down.

259
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,819
Move aside!

260
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,819
Hao Mei!

261
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,240
Just calm down.

262
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,570
Hold on.

263
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,530
Did I hear it right?

264
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,360
Where are you going?

265
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,819
I said

266
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm joining the regular class.

267
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,720
I told them about it.

268
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,299
Wait, have you lost your mind?

269
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,880
Why would you want to be regular?

270
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,290
I wanted

271
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,170
to talk it out with them.

272
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,059
I wanted to go to the Medical School

273
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,600
of Yenching University.

274
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,650
But if I told them that...

275
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,240
It's best not to tell them now.

276
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,290
My goodness.

277
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,769
You have a bigger

278
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,650
and more devastating revelation.

279
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,330
Wait.

280
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,050
I think

281
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,530
you mustn't tell them
about the medical school.

282
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,059
Your Mom always says she doesn't

283
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,179
want you to have a tough life

284
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,769
like your Dad

285
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,960
who's barely at home.

286
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,299
And the class transfer.

287
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,489
Forget it.

288
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,240
We all know how thrilled your mom was

289
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,530
when you got the spot.

290
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,009
Not just her, even I am worried about you.

291
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,099
You asked me

292
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,810
how I can be happy.

293
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,530
The answer is to get transferred.

294
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,249
I never thought your words

295
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,840
could carry such weight.

296
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,930
Impressive.

297
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,530
Me?

298
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,810
Yeah, it's you.

299
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,450
But...

300
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,210
How about this?

301
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,810
Be my witness.

302
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,579
I tried talking him out of this.

303
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,330
Right?

304
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,000
Fine.

305
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,249
In that case,

306
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,769
I welcome you to the club

307
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,760
without any parental support
but staying true to their hearts.

308
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,480
We've waited for you

309
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,600
for too long.

310
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,450
Wait a second.

311
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,480
Song,

312
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,480
are you really going against
your own parents?

313
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,649
Yeah.

314
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,009
We're the masters of our lives.

315
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,210
We can't let our parents decide for us.

316
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,330
Xichi is right.

317
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,880
Huan'er.

318
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,960
You must have your own ambition.

319
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,330
Me?

320
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,410
I haven't even decided if I should
be in the art or science stream.

321
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,760
My dad asked me to have dinner
at the noodle shop.

322
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,840
We didn't get to eat anything just now.

323
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,059
Aunt Hao must be fuming.

324
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,880
She didn't make you dinner. Go on.

325
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,080
See you around.

326
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,120
A stalemate with parents

327
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,330
can't go on forever.

328
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,450
Indeed.

329
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,080
We need a plan.

330
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,410
But you said...

331
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,729
He was so upset.

332
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,889
I had to say things that would

333
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,050
please him.

334
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,960
You have a point.

335
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,219
If the stalemate gets worse,

336
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,720
he's never getting transferred.

337
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,249
We need a plan now.

338
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,600
We need to de-escalate the situation.

339
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,330
Since Aunt Hao

340
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,729
is impossible to convince,

341
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,290
we can take a detour.

342
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,859
I'll try my luck with Mr. Song.

343
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,339
Talk to Song when you have the time.

344
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,179
Me?

345
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,059
It won't work.

346
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,459
You must try.

347
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,819
You're the cause of this mess.

348
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,179
Me?

349
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,369
You heard him.

350
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,819
You somehow inspired him,

351
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,410
even if it may not be the intention.

352
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,360
Therefore,

353
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,720
Comrade Huan'er,

354
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,179
you must complete the mission

355
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,880
of assisting Comrade Song Cong.

356
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,170
Thank you.

357
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,290
The family

358
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,760
will fall apart without me.

359
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,650
What now?

360
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,249
(New TOEFL Vocabulary)

361
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,200
(Outpatient Department)

362
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,050
Come in.

363
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,249
Xichi?

364
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,009
Mr. Song.

365
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,889
Are you busy now?

366
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,840
No.

367
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,330
I came to have a little chat.

368
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,489
About your leg?

369
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,960
Not, not about that.

370
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,210
Here's the story, Mr. Song.

371
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,800
My teammate

372
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,760
injured his leg.

373
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,339
His mom told him

374
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,760
to stop playing football.

375
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,280
But his dad?

376
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,240
A different story.

377
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,169
His dad thinks

378
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,370
that kid's happiness

379
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,170
should come first.

380
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,480
Don't you agree

381
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,130
with that?

382
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,520
First, I need to know the specifics
of his injury.

383
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,779
Mr. Song!

384
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,240
That is not the point.

385
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,520
The point is that he had a fight
with his own parents.

386
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,720
I can't help

387
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,210
but feel pity.

388
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,819
My dad

389
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,850
has always supported my dream.

390
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,000
I thought to myself,

391
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,059
"If his family is just as difficult,

392
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,739
kids like us can bid our happiness

393
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,280
farewell."

394
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,410
You too,

395
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,280
Mr. Song.

396
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,259
You'd always upheld

397
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,889
your dream as a doctor

398
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,930
to have the accomplishments
you have today.

399
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,690
Right?

400
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,040
Speaking of that,

401
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,650
I have questions for you too.

402
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,930
Shoot.

403
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,610
Have you gone to

404
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,850
Mr. Zheng for acupuncture?

405
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,410
No.

406
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,449
Nope.

407
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,170
We were roommates back in university.

408
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,890
He told me everything about your situation.

409
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,929
Heed my advice.

410
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,520
Be more careful with your old injury

411
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,090
unless you want to suffer.

412
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,339
Come to me from now on.

413
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,889
You'd go somewhere else

414
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,059
instead of the hospital?

415
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,960
What now?

416
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,499
Do you want people to think
I'm not as skilled?

417
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,259
No.

418
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,209
It's not what I meant.

419
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,560
Since you're here,

420
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,410
get an X-ray.

421
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,409
Mr. Song.

422
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,690
My mom must never find out.

423
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,240
Just go.

424
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,650
Thanks, Mr. Song.

425
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,560
Coming.

426
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,339
Song.

427
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,170
Huan'er?

428
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,210
I brought you the books.

429
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,650
You had dinner?

430
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,850
I was going to ask you out
for dinner later.

431
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,280
Well,

432
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,720
join me.

433
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,890
Okay.

434
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,650
You're a food expert.

435
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,170
You even have a set of tools.

436
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,930
Practice makes perfect.

437
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,720
My mom does this for me.

438
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,000
Song,

439
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,609
Aunt Hao has

440
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,720
done so much for you.

441
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,210
I know

442
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,800
you care about Aunt Hao.

443
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,090
As your friend,

444
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,299
you have my full support in transferring

445
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,720
to a regular class.

446
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,170
But to truly resolve this situation,

447
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,850
you must communicate with your parents.

448
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,520
Right?

449
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,000
I understand the logic.

450
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,170
But my mom is...

451
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,850
Anyway,

452
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,520
I'll think about it.

453
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,450
At least wait

454
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,280
until she's calmed down.

455
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,610
Okay.

456
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,240
As long as you talk to her.

457
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,859
If you need any help,

458
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,059
feel free to ask.

459
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,449
Jing Xichi and I will come
to your rescue.

460
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,480
Nothing can stop the two of us.

461
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,090
Hello, Aunt Lin.

462
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,579
Yeah.

463
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,210
We were in the tuition class just now.

464
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,800
Xichi should be home soon.

465
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,850
Alright.

466
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:21,890
Sure.

467
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,210
Bye, Aunt Lin.

468
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,209
A genius indeed.

469
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,410
Even your lie is genius.

470
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,280
Is Jing Xichi playing football again?

471
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,170
Definitely.

472
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,410
He does extra training every weekend.

473
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,930
If his mom ever finds out,

474
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,320
he's in for some pain.

475
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,499
But why is Aunt Lin

476
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,450
against him going professional?

477
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,000
Because it's tough.

478
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,890
Everyone wants to get into
the top schools.

479
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,280
But the thing is,

480
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,369
going professional

481
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,170
is so many times harder.

482
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,760
Not to mention

483
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,760
he was injured before.

484
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,930
In his own words,

485
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,280
"If you love something,

486
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,560
you'll allow it to hurt you

487
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,000
and never regret it."

488
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,000
It's hard to believe

489
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,170
he'd actually say that.

490
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,890
He is not as worthless as you think.

491
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,170
Sometimes, I think his mind
is more brilliant than mine.

492
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,170
I only do things I know I can manage.

493
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,209
However,

494
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,019
when I saw how Xichi told his dad

495
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,890
he wanted to go professional...

496
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,409
Come on, give me another chance.

497
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,169
Just one more time.

498
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,890
Let me show you.

499
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,340
- (He inspired me.)
- Just let me show you.

500
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,090
It was because of him.

501
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,720
Curse you, Jing Xichi.
You tricked me again.

502
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,930
What was that?

503
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,210
It's nothing.

504
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,690
I just think that you are

505
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,760
both so unusual.

506
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,169
You grew up knowing

507
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,930
what you like.

508
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,889
You know what you want.

509
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,450
Everything goes smoothly.

510
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,170
But not me.

511
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,520
I am always studying without a goal.

512
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,170
I'm so silly.

513
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,960
Sign up for some talent courses.

514
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,800
It's not too late to start.

515
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,760
Talent courses?

516
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,090
Yeah.

517
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,779
If you're afraid of strangers,

518
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,320
I can go with you.

519
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,019
Never mind.

520
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,410
My problem is nothing compared to yours.

521
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,539
I can handle it.

522
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,280
Thanks.

523
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,720
Talent courses?

524
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,410
I do envy you sometimes.

525
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,099
Did you just say...

526
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,480
Nothing.

527
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,170
Have some crabs.

528
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,690
You too.

529
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,969
Alright.

530
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,800
Calm down.

531
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,579
Song Cong must be starving.

532
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,299
You can't

533
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,520
starve your own kid.

534
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,520
I don't care.

535
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,170
You should listen to
what he said that night.

536
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,850
After everything I did for him,

537
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,040
he thinks I am wrong.

538
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,520
Do you remember

539
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,739
when he was born?

540
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,649
His dad left to study in Germany.

541
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,409
I had to raise the kid alone.

542
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,099
Did I leave my job
at the provincial hospital for nothing?

543
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,090
Alright.

544
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,299
I left the job

545
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,000
to look after Song Cong.

546
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,130
At the time,

547
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,209
I knew his career

548
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,259
was starting to take off.

549
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,449
I said, "It's alright,
I can make the sacrifice."

550
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,690
"I can give this family everything."

551
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,320
Guess what?

552
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,539
The old man

553
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,779
spent every day in the hospital

554
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,130
and barely came home.

555
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,170
Seriously?

556
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,609
As a man,

557
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,609
he always avoids getting involved
in any problems.

558
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,889
When things get serious,

559
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,320
he never

560
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,280
takes a firm stance.

561
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,040
Yes,

562
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,800
I can totally relate to that.

563
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,779
Over the years,
you've been the one taking care

564
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,280
of the family.

565
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,650
You made the most sacrifices.

566
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,259
You know,

567
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,609
may I interject?

568
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,369
Can we

569
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,890
not talk about sacrifices?

570
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,969
We did it for the kids

571
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,499
because we chose it.

572
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,539
We did it because we wanted to.

573
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,930
That is not sacrifice.

574
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,170
You're here for a free meal.

575
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,929
You talk too much. Just eat your food.

576
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,779
Fine. Chen Lei,

577
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,609
long time no see.

578
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,539
Take a mantou.

579
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,409
Shut your trap.

580
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,969
Whose side are you on?

581
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,579
Yeah.

582
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,649
Calm down.

583
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,690
Let's not talk about sacrifices.

584
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,090
Anyway,

585
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,339
Hao Mei, listen to me.

586
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,739
Since the father and his son
won't appreciate your efforts,

587
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,609
we might as well

588
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,609
cut the losses.

589
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,889
Is that okay?

590
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,209
Just like me. I'm not sacrificing anything.

591
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,449
I want to live my own life
and realize my worth.

592
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,410
Yeah.

593
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,889
Everything you say here

594
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,099
is pointless.

595
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,299
If you ask me, you've expected
too much from Song Cong.

596
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,449
He can't take it anymore.

597
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,779
You should pay more attention.

598
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,850
Quiet down.

599
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,579
It may sound harsh,

600
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,560
but it's for your own good.

601
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,969
Honestly,

602
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,409
you want Song Cong to be
in the international class.

603
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,520
Is that it?

604
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,410
The class?

605
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,369
Who told you that?

606
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,560
I never said that.

607
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,129
Unless some parents I know,

608
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,210
I fully respect my son's decision.

609
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,539
There's nothing wrong with Song Cong.

610
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,819
His only outstanding trait
is being too smart.

611
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,449
He can be in any class he wants.

612
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,889
He is free to be in the regular class.

613
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,040
As long as he wants it,

614
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,480
I don't mind.

615
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,370
See you.

616
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,090
International class?

617
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,890
Come now.

618
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:02,889
Eat up.

619
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,090
Busybody.

620
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:22,930
Dad.

621
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,449
Why are you making dinner?

622
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,240
Where is Mom?

623
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,480
When you go to school tomorrow,

624
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,280
finish the transfer paperwork.

625
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,930
I called your homeroom teacher.

626
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,000
What's wrong?

627
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,690
I'm your parent too.

628
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,650
I have the authority too.

629
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,499
Are you saying you're willing

630
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,720
to go against Mom

631
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,090
for my sake?

632
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,560
No way.

633
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,210
Actually,

634
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,000
you should thank Li Tian's mother.

635
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,610
Move aside.

636
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,650
Are you cooking or operating?

637
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,019
Stop it if you don't want to cook.

638
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,450
Go and do your stitches instead.

639
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,000
Well...

640
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,520
Mom.

641
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,720
I brought the books back.

642
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,000
And...

643
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,859
Dad says...

644
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,930
Yes.

645
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,259
Your dad

646
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,129
is finally acting like a good father.

647
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,339
He made the decision.

648
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,450
I didn't.

649
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,720
I wouldn't dare.

650
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,040
I don't get it.

651
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,649
If you want to get transferred,

652
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,739
why did you win first place

653
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,859
in the contest?

654
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,610
You wasted a spot.

655
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:42,779
Well...

656
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,779
Mr. Fu challenged me.

657
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,520
I had to clap back at him.

658
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,609
Besides,

659
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,019
the questions of the contest

660
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,890
were more interesting
than my usual exercises.

661
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,210
I can totally relate to that.

662
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,689
Solving questions is sometimes

663
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:56,859
about the thrill.

664
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,969
It's hard to hold the thrill back.

665
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,560
You just might get a perfect score.

666
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,059
Sometimes, when I am

667
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,739
giving my patients stitches,

668
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,339
I wonder

669
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,059
how I manage to do it so neatly

670
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,209
and so firmly.

671
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,210
I'd love to give them more...

672
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,369
Your mom is mad.

673
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,889
This is going to take a while.

674
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,370
Go to the regular class tomorrow.

675
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,520
But Dad...

676
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,850
Let's listen to Mom on this.

677
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,610
You fool.

678
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,929
Would I make this decision

679
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,409
without her permission,

680
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,450
given how serious this is?

681
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,610
Actually,

682
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,800
I was a brave young man.

683
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,000
But now...

684
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,169
This is why I support your decision.

685
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,610
Cherish your single life

686
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,210
and the freedom you have now.

687
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,169
Up ahead!

688
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,819
Come, center!

689
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,369
Intercept!

690
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,560
Keep an eye on them!

691
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,560
Pass it here!

692
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,890
Over here!

693
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,410
Jing Xichi!

694
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,720
Come here.

695
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,560
Watch them.

696
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,890
Pass it to me.

697
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,280
Why are you here?

698
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,859
Why isn't your dear Song with you?

699
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,760
He is not my dear Song.

700
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,259
He wanted to get transferred

701
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,040
because of what you said.

702
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,969
Drop the act.

703
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,890
I came to tell you

704
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,929
he didn't make the decision
because of me.

705
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,650
He made up his mind after
seeing the effort you put into football.

706
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,800
No wonder.

707
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,259
After all,

708
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,520
I am destined to be a spiritual leader.

709
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,449
You can become determined

710
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,859
over something I said.

711
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,650
I can guarantee your success.

712
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,850
What guarantee?

713
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,320
Is Song Cong really transferring?

714
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,259
Aunt Hao has a soft heart after all.

715
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,210
Dad.

716
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,449
When I went to
Song Cong's house for dinner,

717
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,689
I was worried about him.

718
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,689
I thought he was

719
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,370
going to starve forever.

720
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,410
My precious girl has been
going through a lot of advertisements.

721
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,129
I'll leave in a few days.

722
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,739
Who knows

723
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,579
when I'll be back?

724
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,739
Don't you want to

725
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,280
see me more often?

726
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,690
Yeah. I'm seeing you
with my eyes wide open.

727
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,610
Fine.

728
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,339
Not yet.

729
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,539
Okay, you can stop now.

730
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,539
You're scaring me.

731
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:55,969
Cut it out.

732
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:56,369
More!

733
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,539
Read your advertisements.

734
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,720
Nope.

735
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,800
I'll seal away this evil spirit!

736
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,539
We ran out of oranges.

737
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,609
I'll go and get some.

738
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,560
Okay.

739
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,499
What is this?

740
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,610
Wilderness survival?

741
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,960
Haven't decided on anything yet?

742
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,240
Nope.

743
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,019
Your grandpa didn't even take this long

744
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,690
to pick a son-in-law.

745
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,369
I want to try something new.

746
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,579
I have to pick the right one.

747
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,130
I'll take my time.

748
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,130
Give me a break.

749
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,610
Are you trying to catch up to Song Cong

750
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,339
after seeing

751
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,650
how ambitious he was?

752
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,370
I bet you won't get it.

753
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,560
Jing Xichi is quite ambitious too.

754
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,650
(He's not as worthless as you think.)

755
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,260
Chen Huan'er, hurry up!

756
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,800
- I have a match to watch tonight!
- Coming.

757
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,819
- At this rate, I'll miss the match!
- Wait for me.

758
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,890
Hurry up.

759
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,280
What is taking you so long?

760
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,529
Come on. It's taking forever
to tie your shoelaces.

761
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,080
- It's done. Let's go.
- I'm going to miss the match. Hurry up!

00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,139
Let's watch the match!

768
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,690

Song Cong?

We're in the same class again.

799
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,010
And you're still the class monitor.

800
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,009
By the way,

801
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,400
I need to ask.

802
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,409
Did you get transferred

803
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,240
to see our small-town girl?

804
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,130
Liao Xinyan.

805
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,139
As the class monitor,

806
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,010
you shouldn't be spreading rumors.

807
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,339
I think

808
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,529
Song came to our class

809
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,739
for his buddy, me.

810
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,440
Right? Come with me.

811
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,610
That's what they do in dramas!

812
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,800
Take the seat inside.

813
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,050
Wait.

814
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,880
Why are you sitting here?

815
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,259
I discussed it with Song.

816
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,760
He sits next to me from now on.

817
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,320
Sports representative,

818
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,889
We must register for the sports day.

819
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,779
The deadline is near.

820
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,360
Ask me if you need help.

821
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,929
This is nothing.

822
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,259
I can handle it in no time.

823
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,720
Alright, good luck.

824
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,650
Signing up?

825
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,889
What is it?

826
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,569
Sports day.

827
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,259
Not joining.

828
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,130
Come on.

829
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,619
Ladies.

830
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,139
My goddesses.

831
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,369
Just sign up for one or two

832
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,889
of the races.

833
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:17,969
Otherwise, we are

834
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,339
as good as forfeiting.

835
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,569
We'd love to help,

836
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,969
but this is beyond us.

837
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:22,619
Jing.

838
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,569
Find someone else. I'll sign up next time.

839
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,489
Could you reconsider?

840
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,089
Look.

841
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,049
I'll do it.

842
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,529
Great.

843
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,650
I'll sign up for the hammer throw.

844
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,859
That is only five points.

845
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,929
A race gets you ten points.

846
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,760
Please reconsider!

847
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,699
First place.

848
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,970
Ten points.

849
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,179
Stop wasting your time.

850
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,889
Your class isn't

851
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,490
going to win anything.

852
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,529
Look who we have here. It's Qin Liang.

853
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,320
Are you itching to get destroyed

854
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,650
after so long?

855
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,049
There goes your bad habit.
Can you even join the sports day?

856
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,970
What?

857
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,219
- Do you want a match?
- I don't pick on the disadvantaged.

858
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,840
The match would be pointless.

859
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,400
Let's make it class versus class.

860
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,139
Think it through.

861
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,800
Don't cry when you lose.

862
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,570
Jing Xichi, spare me the bluff.

863
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,969
Your class of nerds

864
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,569
will be crushed

865
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,089
by the sports class.

866
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,800
Fine.

867
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,090
Let's make a deal.

868
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,929
When you get crushed by our class,

869
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,819
you must call me

870
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,920
Big Boss Chi.

871
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,400
Fine.

872
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,690
Watch the ball.

873
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,840
No one for the 1,500-meter sprint.

874
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,610
Chen Huan'er.

875
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,659
Would you like to join

876
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,690
the 1,500-meter sprint?

877
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,650
No.

878
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,139
I only jog at night

879
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,489
as exercise.

880
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,529
I can't handle

881
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,570
the sprint race.

882
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,610
Chen Huan'er!

883
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,179
Chen Huan'er, give it a shot!

884
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,049
You won't know

885
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,840
until you try.

886
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,690
Forget it.

887
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,490
Why does it have to be her?

888
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,880
It's the athletes from Class 6.

889
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,320
They are short-sprinters
and high jumpers.

890
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,529
We are no match for them

891
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,089
in terms of raw power.

892
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,369
We can only focus on sports

893
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,569
that rely on stamina

894
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,050
and no one cares about.

895
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,010
I asked everyone.

896
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,179
No one could do

897
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,360
the 1,500-meter sprint.

898
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,130
But it gives a lot of points.

899
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,650
We can't lose.

900
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,320
You mean you can't lose.

901
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,320
Miss Huan'er.

902
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,840
Please sign up.

903
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,569
No, thanks.

904
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,139
Come on.

905
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,889
Miss Huan'er!

906
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,009
I asked Aunt Hao to...

907
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:41,819
No!

908
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,889
I'm not eating it!

909
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:43,489
Try it out!

910
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,089
If you like it,

911
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,009
sign up for the race!

912
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,530
You say it stinks!

913
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,800

916
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:12,219
Please.

917
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,760
Jing Xichi!

918
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,050
Can you solve this?

919
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,320
No.

920
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,570
Miss Huan'er!

921
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,009
Join the race.

922
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,969
Join the race!

923
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,320
Don't be a creep!

924
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,210
Jing.

925
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,610
It's me.

926
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,170
Cursed brat.

927
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,090
I was surprised.

928
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,800
You're scared of Mom too?

929
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,610
She has no power over me.

930
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,699
Who is the family head?

931
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,240
Yeah.

932
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,819
You are taking great risks

933
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,400
coming here.

934
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,819
Mr. Song

935
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,920
came to our place.

936
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,299
The check-up results

937
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,280
are here.

938
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,489
Your Mom

939
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,360
doesn't want you
to play football again.

940
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,819
But me?

941
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,050
I saved your neck.

942
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,929
Mr. Song!

943
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,170
He betrayed me!

944
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,369
Son,

945
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,570
be honest.

946
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,610
Is your leg not feeling well lately?

947
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,720
No.

948
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,529
I swear, Dad.

949
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,090
I mean it. See? It's fine.

950
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,010
Don't believe me?

951
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,259
In that case, let do

952
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,360
a half-field game.

953
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,299
Cursed brat.

954
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,800
I'm not afraid of you!

955
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:46,570
Come on, Mr. Jing!

956
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,259
(Image and Data)

957
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,490
From Mr. Song.

958
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,050
Look at this boy.

959
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,259
Aunt Hao.

960
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,240
Aunt Lin.

961
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,650
Finished your study?

962
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,840
As you know,

963
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,699
Xichi suffered

964
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,299
a knee injury in the past.

965
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,929
The doctor asked him to take a break.

966
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,840
He wouldn't listen.

967
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,299
When he's in pain,

968
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,049
he secretly gets acupuncture.

969
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,969
Song found out.

970
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,489
So, he sent me the files.

971
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,489
This is not good.

972
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,659
Song told me

973
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,259
he needed to take a break.

974
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,440
Otherwise, there could be
lingering ailments.

975
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,280
I've always thought

976
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,840
going professional

977
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,800
isn't going to be easy.

978
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:34,819
He should

979
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,969
just study like the others.
Wouldn't that be great?

980
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:37,889
You know,

981
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,720
his father went through the same thing.

982
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,929
When he was young,

983
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,889
he was one of the best
in the city's football team.

984
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:43,779
In the end,

985
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,970
he was never chosen
by a professional team.

986
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,299
I thought he'd give up

987
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,659
because he couldn't get into

988
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,009
a sports school.

989
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,880
But guess what?

990
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,969
The boy was too stubborn to give up.

991
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,739
I'm always worried

992
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,800
he might get injured again.

993
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,610
Huan'er.

994
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,010
Isn't the school's sports day
around the corner?

995
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,400
Yeah, it is.

996
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,690
Huan'er.

997
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,179
Listen up.

998
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,929
Don't be a busybody and sign up.

999
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,089
I want you to sit there

1000
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,489
in the audience.

1001
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,490
Is that clear?

1002
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,570
Yes.

1003
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,929
I have studying to do.

1004
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,530
Go on.

1005
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,440
How is her health?

1006
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,320
Not bad.

1007
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,570
It's nice to have a daughter.
