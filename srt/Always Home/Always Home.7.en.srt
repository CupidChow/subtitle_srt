=Episode 7=
(Young Friends Are Collectors of Youth)

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,480
Have you heard?

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,439
I just heard

18
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,309
that Chen Huan'er,
Jing Xichi, and Song Cong

19
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,480
were robbed yesterday.

20
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,189
Who told you that?

21
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,359
Liao Xinyan told me.

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,109
The police was here

23
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,550
to collect evidence or something.

24
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,519
Speaking of, Qi Qi,

25
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,389
last night

26
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,639
I ran into Chen Huan'er

27
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,510
looking for you at the taro cake shop.

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,189
Fortunately, you three are safe.

29
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,230
Otherwise, I'll be in big trouble.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,309
Mr. Xu.

31
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,189
With me here,

32
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,279
what can go wrong?

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,509
Enough.

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,119
Among the three of you,

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,069
you're the one

36
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,200
that worries me the most.

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,920
Last night,

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,060
if Song Cong and Chen Huan'er
hadn't followed you,

39
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,110
you punk...

40
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,509
Mr. Xu.

41
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,349
It's a bit hurtful

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,589
when you say that.

43
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,719
After all, I'm also...

44
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,469
Enough.

45
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,320
Stop bluffing.

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,119
The robber grabbed you by the neck,

47
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,620
yet you still have the nerve to brag.

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,070
How did you know, Mr. Xu?

49
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,719
You don't need to be so detailed.

50
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,439
Can't you just say what happened?

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,390
Enough.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,070
From today on,

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,679
the three of you aren't allowed

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,069
to stay on campus after school.

55
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,600
Go home and do your homework.

56
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,510
Being able to provide the police
with clues to solve a case

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,069
is considered a merit.

58
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,230
Leave. Go to class.

59
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,280
Speaking of,

60
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,909
stay safe

61
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,230
until the robber is caught.

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,630
- Okay, Sir.
- Go.

63
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,789
Could you not say that?

64
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,480
I don't have much to brag.

65
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,830
Do you consider me your buddy?

66
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,159
You've revealed everything.

67
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,230
Are you okay?

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,560
- We're all okay.
- We're okay.

69
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,399
To be honest,

70
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,789
I'm still a little scared.

71
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,600
We won't really
be retaliated against, right?

72
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,830
What are you scared of?

73
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,629
I'm here.

74
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,040
I'll protect you.

75
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,200
Cut it out.

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,480
It's so scary.

77
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,349
Let's go.

78
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,349
Song Cong.

79
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,399
Do you want to get beaten by me again?

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,560
It's starting again.

81
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,390
Can I ask you a question?

82
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,470
If

83
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,239
you have

84
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,030
a good friend,

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,200
will you become distant

86
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,760
because of a short distance?

87
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,320
You'd better not ask me
this kind of question.

88
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,309
I want to get into Yenching University,

89
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,630
not to make friends.

90
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,360
Du Man.

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,590
I heard you were on the aerobics team.

92
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
Right?

93
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,780
Sun Xiaoting went to the hospital
due to gastroenteritis,

94
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
but the performance is in the afternoon.

95
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,480
Can you take her place

96
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,880
and join us in the talent show?

97
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,540
I haven't practiced for a long time.

98
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,300
I can't help you.

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,140
Please.

100
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,100
Saving the situation
is like putting out a fire.

101
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,180
I hate performing in public.

102
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,880
Sorry.

103
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,439
Help us.

104
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,879
Please. I can't find anyone else
in our class except you.

105
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,709
Can you get lose?

106
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,149
Plea...

107
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,360
You're blocking my way.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,269
No, why are you like this?

109
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,239
I already begged you.

110
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,679
Did I ask you for myself?

111
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,710
It's for our class's honor.

112
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,400
Do you know that?

113
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,270
Xinyan.

114
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,239
Why did you forget yourself?

115
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,030
You can do it yourself.

116
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,949
I can't. I have no dancing background.

117
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,749
How can I do it?

118
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,980
You don't require much expertise
for this performance.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,560
Besides,

120
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,870
with your long arms and legs,

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,220
you'll look graceful when you jump.

122
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,440
It'll be pleasing to the eyes.

123
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,680
At least you can represent our class.

124
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,389
How can I represent our class?

125
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,760
Of course you can, Xinyan.

126
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,919
You're just so dedicated.

127
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,629
You can't always

128
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,039
be our class's unsung hero.

129
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,880
Right?

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,309
I thought

131
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,709
our class might win a prize

132
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,470
if Du Man could participate.

133
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,269
Xinyan.

134
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,240
You're really underestimating yourself.

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,880
If Du Man learns the performance now,

136
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,389
she may not be able to memorize it.

137
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,679
Unlike you.
You participated in the rehearsal

138
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,239
and made up the moves yourself.

139
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,389
You can do it.

140
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,359
I trust you.

141
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,920
Okay, I'll try my best.

142
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,830
I got to go.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,950
Good luck.

144
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,920
True friends won't grow apart just
because they're in different classes.

145
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,510
There must be a reason you don't know.

146
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,389
(Tianhe No.1 Middle School
Welcomes You!)

147
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,389
Sorry.

148
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,359
I made a mistake

149
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,390
and dragged everyone down.

150
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,950
It's fine.

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,069
It's alright.

152
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,749
It's all about participation anyway.

153
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,630
Yeah.

154
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,230
And there's nothing good about winning.

155
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,180
Look at what the school gave.

156
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,600
One correction book per person.

157
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,760
What's that supposed to mean?

158
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,540
How about this?

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
I'll buy everyone a milk tea.

160
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,790
Winning second place is also a reward.

161
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,119
Xinyan is generous.

162
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
- Let's go.
- Thank you, Xinyan.

163
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,509
I saw you greet Qi Qi

164
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,840
during the competition just now,

165
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,680
but she ignored you.

166
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,760
What happened to you two?

167
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,820
Has your friendship faded?

168
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,070
Don't talk nonsense.

169
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,200
Maybe there were too many people
and she didn't see me.

170
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,239
Come on.

171
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,120
- Let's get milk tea. Come on.
- Come on.

172
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,830
(Qi Qi.)

173
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,709
(We're going)

174
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,960
(to the milk tea shop
at the back entrance for drinks.)

175
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,080
(Do you want to join us?)

176
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,270
Wait for me!

177
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,470
Have some fruit and take a break.

178
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,880
Don't you think this orange

179
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,200
doesn't fit in with the other fruits?

180
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,360
I won't put it like this anymore then.

181
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,950
I'm not blaming you.

182
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,390
I just...

183
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,000
I like oranges.

184
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,680
It doesn't need to look good

185
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,870
or be expensive.

186
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,750
Just buy it
from the most ordinary fruit store,

187
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,990
cut it,

188
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,640
and share it with everyone.

189
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
What's so difficult about this?

190
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,029
You never told me,

191
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,070
so I didn't know.

192
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,520
I'll do it for you next time.

193
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,110
Come on, change your shoes.

194
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,990
The slippers are here.

195
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,269
Hello? Qi Qi.

196
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,429
I texted you.

197
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,040
Why didn't you reply to me?

198
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,160
I was talking to other students
just now

199
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,749
and didn't pay attention.

200
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,029
Later, I forgot all about it.

201
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,160
Sorry.

202
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,200
It's fine.

203
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,200
Chen Huan'er.

204
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,830
You don't have slippers at home.

205
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,830
Look in that cabinet.

206
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,680
Haven't you guys finished yet?

207
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,920
Yeah.

208
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,740
After finishing our milk tea,

209
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,389
we came to my home for tutoring.

210
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,509
We have no choice.

211
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,669
Jing Xichi did poorly
in his exams this time.

212
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,119
We all need to tutor him.

213
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,389
Who did you say did poorly?

214
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,509
Jing Xichi, you...

215
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm perfectly fine.

216
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,950
Huan'er, who is it?

217
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,029
Qi Qi.

218
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,909
Let's start with the theory
of evolution.

219
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,040
Qi Qi, go on talking.

220
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,870
Jing Xichi.

221
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,560
Did Liao Xinyan go as well?

222
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,640
Yeah.

223
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,160
Speaking of,

224
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,870
when are you coming?

225
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,710
Sorry.

226
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,870
Well.

227
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,599
My tutoring teacher told me

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,800
that there's a class later.

229
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,710
I'll join next time.

230
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,040
(She really has tutoring classes)

231
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,470
(and really needs to go.)

232
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,830
(Mixing the truth with lies)

233
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,190
(and avoiding the main point
while focusing on the trivial)

234
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,950
(are the essence of telling a good lie.)

235
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,280
(In terms of lying skills,)

236
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,950
(she's the best among them.)

237
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,269
(She doesn't)

238
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,200
(even need to lay a plan)

239
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,640
(like when writing her essay.)

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,359
(As long as her desire to escape)

241
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,710
(is strong enough,)

242
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,990
(she'll find a way to lie.)

243
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,470
Let's have popsicles.

244
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,950
It's so hot. Here.

245
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,110
Have you solved your problem?

246
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,400
Not yet.

247
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,870
Help me analyze it.

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,680
It's hard for me to analyze it for you.

249
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,400
Because I don't have any friends.

250
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,319
But theoretically speaking,

251
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,029
if a friendship

252
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,239
requires so much effort

253
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,520
to maintain,

254
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,820
you have a wrong perception
of the friendship

255
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,230
with the wrong person.

256
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,400
What does that mean?

257
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,549
In other words,

258
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,959
if you're always unhappy

259
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,909
with someone

260
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,389
and need to use various methods

261
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,110
to maintain your relationship,

262
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,160
it is doomed to fail.

263
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,680
You just aren't suitable.

264
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,070
Friendship and love are the same thing.

265
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,040
But I still think

266
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,750
whether it's friendship or love,

267
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,549
we shouldn't give up

268
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,920
when we encounter difficulties.

269
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,269
I still need to know

270
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,990
the reason for us growing apart.

271
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,719
Qi Qi.

272
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,560
Qi Qi.

273
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,070
You want to see me?

274
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,350
I have something to tell you.

275
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,509
You can eat first.

276
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,560
I'll find you later.

277
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,520
Come on.

278
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,110
Qi Qi.

279
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,920
Qi Qi.

280
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,990
Let's talk here.

281
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,400
Sure.

282
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,950
Qi Qi.

283
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,389
I think you've been

284
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,320
a little distant from me lately.

285
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,029
Did something happen to you?

286
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,320
Tell me about it.

287
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,920
Maybe I've been too busy recently.

288
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,909
I promised my mom

289
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,680
that I would be
in the top ten in my grade.

290
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,549
I rarely play with my phone anymore.

291
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,479
So

292
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,920
don't call me out

293
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,230
to play anymore.

294
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,070
What do you mean?

295
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,200
Do you mean
we can't play together anymore?

296
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,320
Did I do something wrong?

297
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,599
I got it.

298
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,599
It's because

299
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,300
I didn't eat taro cakes
with you that day.

300
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,950
Right?

301
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,680
You and I

302
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,040
are never from the same world.

303
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,870
You can have many friends,

304
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,280
yet I

305
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,800
can only have one friend.

306
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,470
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

307
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,950
You have Song Cong,

308
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,520
Jing Xichi,

309
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,440
Liao Xinyan, and Du Man.

310
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,400
How will it influence you

311
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,200
whether you lack me?

312
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,590
But you're my best friend.

313
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,870
Even though we're in different classes,

314
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,840
I'm still trying hard

315
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,200
to maintain our friendship.

316
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,110
Trying hard to maintain?

317
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,999
If a friendship

318
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,199
requires so much effort

319
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,549
to maintain,

320
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,340
you have a wrong perception
of the friendship

321
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,830
with the wrong person.

322
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,359
Looks like

323
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,549
you took

324
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,870
Du Man's advice.

325
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,870
How can you guarantee

326
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,950
that I will always be your best friend?

327
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,029
Qi Qi.

328
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,040
Chen Huan'er.

329
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,590
I'm possessive of my friendship.

330
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,400
I thought

331
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,280
we'd be each other's only friend.

332
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,440
Only?

333
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,680
Do you mean

334
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,470
I can only have you as my friend

335
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,830
and no one else can be my friend?

336
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,040
Yes.

337
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,029
You made a lot of new friends

338
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,070
after we were divided
into different classes.

339
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,920
To me, they're just classmates.

340
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,040
Don't come looking for me
after class from now on.

341
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,920
What do you mean?

342
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,560
If we can't be each other's only friend,

343
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,640
I would rather we just be deskmates

344
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,710
and classmates for a period of time.

345
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,990
I'll go back now.

346
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,079
You don't want

347
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,920
to be friends with me anymore?

348
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,640
Class begins.

349
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,520
Get up.

350
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,709
Hello, Sir.

351
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,640
Hello, students. Please take a seat.

352
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,989
Let's continue with our last class.

353
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,160
We'll continue

354
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,149
with the equation of a straight line.

355
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,359
Please turn to page 70

356
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,310
of your textbook.

357
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,640
Please look at the first question.

358
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:59,749
(Prosperity and Safety)

359
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,230
(Those Who Take Away Cultural
and Creative Products Are Immortals)

360
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,310
(Qi Qi's words)

361
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,990
(are like a riddle.)

362
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,880
(I couldn't figure out)

363
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,909
(why our friendship)

364
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,550
(ended so abruptly.)

365
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,310
(I also wondered)

366
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,640
(if I)

367
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,550
(did something wrong.)

368
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,430
(Those Who Drink Coffee Here
Are Immortals)

369
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,319
Don't look so sad on the weekend.

370
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,039
Alright?

371
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,710
People would think you're lovelorn.

372
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,799
It's all your fault. You jinxed it.

373
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,709
You keep saying
that my friendship with Qi Qi

374
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,880
has faded.

375
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,230
Now,

376
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,990
she's really ignoring now.

377
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,669
Why do you always

378
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,440
put all the blame on me?

379
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,189
I'm observant.

380
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,319
I've long seen

381
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,920
a rift between you two.

382
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,360
It's actually quite normal.

383
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,230
I always thought

384
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,149
the limited number of schools in Tianhe

385
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,480
makes everyone attend the same school
from primary to high school,

386
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,860
so the difference isn't obvious.

387
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,940
But think about it.

388
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,359
The world outside is big.

389
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,750
The days ahead are long.

390
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,189
We'll definitely get out

391
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,470
and know more people.

392
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,550
By then,

393
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,079
maybe friends only last for a period.

394
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,989
Stop.

395
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,710
What stage?

396
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,510
Friends will last for a lifetime.

397
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,400
Don't listen to his nonsense.

398
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,550
I think

399
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,270
Qi Qi is probably jealous.

400
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,840
Let her calm down for a couple of days.

401
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,060
She'll figure it out herself.

402
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,989
Instead of talking
about the meaning of friendship,

403
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,550
why not talk about something practical?

404
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,230
Something practical?

405
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,600
I did poorly in my exam

406
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,550
again.

407
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,550
My mom must be worried again.

408
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,640
Isn't it normal
for you to do poorly in exams?

409
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,519
It's not that I don't work hard.

410
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,510
It was because this rehearsal

411
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,189
was too distracting.

412
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,079
Really?

413
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,879
Why did Song

414
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,119
always get first place?

415
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,440
How can I compare with him?

416
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,950
Why don't you look at your grades?

417
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,880
What's wrong with mine?

418
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,200
You're not any better than me.

419
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,750
Alright.

420
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,060
At most, I'll add another lesson

421
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,900
for you two when we go back later.
Alright?

422
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,660
Look. How many times
have I lent Song to you

423
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,669
as a private tutor?

424
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,400
You have to study hard.

425
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,119
You're ungrateful.

426
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,950
Chen Huan'er.

427
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,360
Didn't I lend Song to you first?

428
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,990
Jeez.

429
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,079
Stop eating. You've eaten it all.

430
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,840
Here, Song. Eat more.

431
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,149
Did you take nitroglycerin?

432
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,300
You hit so hard every time.

433
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,550
I'll give you sodium hydride.

434
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,040
How about giving me hydrogen peroxide?

435
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,940
Good job.

436
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,380
You remember the chemical equations.

437
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,480
You underestimate me.

438
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Our family has doctors.

439
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,460
I remember

440
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,720
all my mom's prescriptions.

441
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,680
Song.

442
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,429
Tonight,

443
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,510
what delicious food is Aunt Hao
going to make for me?

444
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,320
Are you going for the tutoring

445
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,550
or to replenish your body?

446
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,620
Of course
he wants to replenish his body.

447
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,279
Let's go.

448
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,909
Replenish the body first.

449
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,790
Only when you're healthy
can you study well.

450
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,070
(Drinking Coffee
in the Bustling World Gives You Peace)

451
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,300
You didn't tell me in advance

452
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,420
that Aunt Hao isn't home.

453
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,310
I was expecting her

454
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,200
to cook for me.

455
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,270
I didn't know
she was working overtime today.

456
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,519
How about going to my house for a meal?

457
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,920
I have some leftovers at home.

458
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,310
That works too.

459
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,230
How about I cook for you?

460
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,189
Forget it.

461
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,300
With your cooking skills...

462
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,820
I'll make scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

463
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,760
You'll make
scrambled eggshells with tomatoes.

464
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,120
You make a fuss
after doing poorly in your exam?

465
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,510
I wonder

466
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,669
how I, Li Jianjun,
gave birth to a son like you.

467
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,519
Enough.

468
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,540
Keep your voice down.

469
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,390
Are you not afraid
of our neighbors hearing you?

470
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,680
Apologize to your father now.

471
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,079
All you do is criticize me.

472
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,709
Why don't you reflect on yourselves?

473
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,440
What did you say?

474
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,360
Say it again.

475
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,280
It's your fault
for not giving me a good brain.

476
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,520
That's why I lost to Song Cong.

477
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,160
Go away.

478
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,799
Why are you hitting him?

479
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,030
Go away.

480
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,319
Why are you hitting him?

481
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,120
Go away.

482
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,230
Mr. Li.

483
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,310
- Mrs. Li.
- Mrs. Li, you're all here.

484
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,150
Li Tian, are you free?

485
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,470
If you're free, come to our house
to check the exam answers.

486
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,640
Yeah, I have a question
that I want to ask you.

487
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,149
Hurry up.

488
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,189
Go to Xichi and the rest.

489
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,189
Hurry up.

490
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,020
Mr. Li,
you seem to be in good health lately.

491
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,950
Mrs. Li, we'll go study first.

492
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,550
- Sure.
- Bye, Mrs. Li.

493
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,030
Hurry, Li Tian. Let's go.

494
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,510
Go.

495
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,319
You owe me

496
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,510
a life-saving favor.

497
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,940
My parents will be back

498
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,360
very late tonight.

499
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,230
You

500
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,920
can stay here.

501
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,230
Song Cong, are you not eating?

502
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,389
You guys go ahead.

503
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,400
I'll eat later.

504
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,519
What are you up to?

505
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,079
Did you all see everything

506
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,790
and are going to make fun of me with it?

507
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
Take this and apply it to your face.

508
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
Or your face will be swollen soon.

509
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,669
My dad

510
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,949
is big and strong

511
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,120
and has never beaten me up.

512
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,980
Dr. Li usually looks

513
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,310
gentle and polite,

514
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,990
but he's quite cruel.

515
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,519
Thank you for today.

516
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,550
I got to go.

517
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,510
Where are you going?

518
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,310
You panicked. Are you panicked?

519
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,840
You panicked after I said a few words.

520
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,920
Are you panicked?

521
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,279
Won't you get beaten if you go back now?

522
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,990
Isn't it good
to eat and drink at my place?

523
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,229
Your relationship

524
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,920
doesn't seem that bad.

525
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,759
We grew up together.

526
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,920
How bad can it be?

527
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,640
This kid on the other hand.

528
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,310
Since his father
became the hospital director,

529
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,550
he left our organization.

530
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,750
You distanced yourself from me, okay?

531
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,629
Sure.

532
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,950
We distance ourselves from you.

533
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,149
You attend classes all day long.

534
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,620
Would you have come when I asked you?

535
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,270
Besides,

536
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,079
if you didn't have
to compare with Song,

537
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,400
would this have happened to you?

538
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,760
The examination system is destined
to involve comparison.

539
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,880
How is it my fault?

540
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,310
Jing Xichi.

541
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,119
In your eyes,

542
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,440
am I a joke?

543
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
I'm just a slow bird
trying to fly early.

544
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,660
I tried so hard
but still can't compare to Song.

545
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,360
Right?

546
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,660
You know you're a slow bird too?

547
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,560
You're the slow bird!

548
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,270
You said it first.

549
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,030
Enough.

550
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,680
Hurry and eat.

551
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,680
I understand how you feel.

552
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,149
How about this?

553
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,990
Can you join our tutoring sessions?

554
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,949
You two top students
and us two underachievers

555
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,900
make a perfect match.

556
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,950
Right? Song Cong.

557
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,920
Tian.

558
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,950
You can come anytime you want.

559
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,510
I can also ask you English questions.

560
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,550
Haven't you always been good at English?

561
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,710
My English isn't as good as yours.

562
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,750
Besides,

563
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,279
my parents

564
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,119
would be anxious

565
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,359
if they knew

566
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,640
I asked you questions again.

567
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,669
Mama's boy.

568
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,160
What's wrong with being a mama's boy?

569
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,909
Honestly.

570
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,629
To be honest,

571
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,950
you have one thing

572
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,510
that ranks first in our compound.

573
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,389
What is it?

574
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,920
You are number one
when it comes to being obedient.

575
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,759
Have you never thought about resisting?

576
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,030
Just talking back doesn't count.

577
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,949
Just talking back got me to this point.

578
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,710
Do you think
I'm not dying slowly enough?

579
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,709
Besides, who am I to resist?

580
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,989
I won't resist.

581
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,240
My mom arranged an elite route for me.

582
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,100
It's something others can only wish for.

583
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,950
Are you envious of me?

584
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,189
Only a fool like you

585
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,840
would rebel.

586
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,310
Who are you calling a fool?

587
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,949
You're a fool.

588
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,180
If I hadn't brought you here,

589
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,060
you'd be doomed!

590
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,400
I didn't ask you to bring me here.

591
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:45,990
Get lost.

592
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,310
Go home for your beatings.

593
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,669
Get lost.

594
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,229
Come on.

595
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,060
Reluctant to leave?

596
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,940
Is your butt heavy?

597
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,799
I'll go!

598
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,429
I'll go.

599
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,120
Go.

600
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,120
Don't come again!

601
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,230
Fool!

602
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,640
Li Tian!

603
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,400
Have they always been like this?

604
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,400
They've always been like this.

605
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,680
Quiet.

606
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,640
Quiet!

607
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,030
Quiet.

608
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,860
(Agricultural Activity Launch Ceremony)
Finally, a reminder.

609
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,950
Students.

610
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,709
You must take

611
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,270
this agricultural activity seriously.

612
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,389
Because this activity

613
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,680
is an important opportunity
for practical training.

614
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,909
You're not going for a field trip.

615
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,880
We're going for a field trip!

616
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,079
(Agricultural Activity Launch Ceremony)

617
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,920
Do you think

618
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,900
this trip is a little similar to the one
we went on during summer vacation?

619
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,070
A little.

620
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,120
But agricultural activity...

621
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,240
Could you please stop taking photos?

622
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,900
Didn't you
take a lot of photos just now?

623
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,799
Mr. Xu specifically told me

624
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,989
to record more for all of you.

625
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,600
Shouldn't I take more photos?

626
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,669
Besides,

627
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,839
I used my new phone

628
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,270
to film you guys.

629
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,400
Do you know how many pixels it has?

630
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,640
Eight million pixels.

631
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,119
Better than a camera.

632
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,360
Here, smile.

633
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,599
How cute.

634
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,550
Students, let's go.

635
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,640
Go.

636
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,790
Song.

637
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,360
Song.

638
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,640
What do you look forward to most
about agriculture study?

639
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,710
Song Cong, come here.

640
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,030
The homeroom teacher
asked for me. Film others first.

641
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,790
Du Man, what about you?

642
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,750
Li Tian.

643
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,519
It's already noon.

644
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,840
What's there to look forward to?

645
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,680
Jing Xichi.
Are you going to brush me off?

646
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,680
What about you?

647
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,949
Speaking of this,

648
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,900
I'm most looking forward
to us cooking together.

649
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,909
I heard

650
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,920
we can cook with vegetables
we picked ourselves.

651
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,279
That should be quite fulfilling.

652
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,230
Chen Huan'er.

653
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,360
What do you think
about this agriculture study?

654
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,949
Hold it farther away.

655
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,469
Why do you keep filming?

656
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,360
Hurry and tell me.

657
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,949
I look forward
to the agriculture study.

658
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,389
I want to do farm work.

659
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,750
I want to cook a meal for everyone.

660
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,750
I never cooked before.

661
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,879
I never cooked.

662
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,429
Is there anything delicious?

663
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,400
What would you like to eat?
I'll cook for you.

664
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,180
Sure, this time...

665
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,990
You can order.

666
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,200
I want authentic
Sishui vegetable dumplings.

667
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,420
Are the dumplings I make not authentic?

668
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,519
Did you make them?

669
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,080
Aunt Lina made them.

670
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,039
Did you make them?

671
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,319
Did you make them?

672
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,880
The ones I make
are much better than my mom's.

673
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,389
I can try it.

674
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,709
It's our school's first time
going out together.

675
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,559
So overall

676
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,759
I look forward to it.

677
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,510
Yes.

678
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,909
After all, it's our school's

679
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,389
last group activity.

680
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,840
It will be interesting

681
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,839
and unforgettable.

682
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,469
Alright.

683
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,559
What do you think

684
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,200
about this agriculture study?

685
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,839
I hope

686
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,559
everyone can be together,

687
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,119
and pick vegetables together.

688
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,550
And then...

689
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,319
(Like Song Cong said,)

690
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,400
(maybe friends only last for a period.)

691
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,279
(The answer I can't figure out)

692
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,600
(is also simple.)

693
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,119
(It's really)

694
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
(just that we each have new friends.)

695
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,989
(But I will still think Qi Qi)

696
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,680
(is important.)

697
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,550
(Even though
everyone spent more time together)

698
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,750
(and my small team
has also gained new members.)

699
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,560
Does she have to go that far?

700
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,780
She's still memorizing words
while cutting vegetables.

701
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,470
It's normal.

702
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,469
Look at her.

703
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,119
There must be difficulties at home.

704
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,350
Maybe she's depending
on her studies to change her fate.

705
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,230
This agriculture study is no joke.

706
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,950
I thought we were
just going to do some labor work.

707
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,389
We have a craft class

708
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,440
this afternoon.

709
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,990
I was tricked by TV shows.

710
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,590
Their high school students
are performing in plays, dancing duets,

711
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,640
and going to the beach.

712
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,079
As for us,

713
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,120
we're tilling the soil,

714
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,400
digging wild vegetables,

715
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,640
and carrying farming tools.

716
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,510
Xinyan.

717
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,759
I told you

718
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,920
to stop watching that stuff.

719
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,750
You're so obsessed

720
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,360
that I don't know how to help you.

721
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,790
Xinyan.

722
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,270
You can't do it like this.

723
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,510
Look.

724
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,389
For leafy vegetables like this,

725
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,550
collecting one-third of it
is usually enough.

726
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,119
Just cut it like this,

727
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
and you're done.

728
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,510
What the teacher teaches is standard.

729
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,080
But what we usually do

730
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,469
is find the stem first.

731
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,270
Look.

732
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,750
Its one-third position.

733
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,710
Cut it.

734
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,750
You can then cut it neatly.

735
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,120
Huan'er, how do you know this?

736
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,990
I've been doing this since I was a kid.

737
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,550
You forgot I'm from Sishui.

738
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,030
I also came from a farming village.

739
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,079
That place
seems to be quite close to here.

740
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,990
Chen Huan'er.

741
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,310
Did you often do this kind of work
when you were a child?

742
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,790
Yes, I used to work when I was a kid.

743
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,460
You've never done this, have you?

744
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,160
Never.

745
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,310
Huan'er.

746
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,319
You must have been happy
living in Sishui

747
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,669
when you were a kid.

748
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,640
What did you say?

749
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,470
You said you were happy?

750
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,470
I'm happy.

751
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,759
(When everyone is complaining)

752
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,270
(about the hardship and boredom
of agriculture studies,)

753
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,319
(only Jing Xichi)

754
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,310
(noticed something was unusual
with Song Cong.)

755
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,030
(Growing up,)

756
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,400
(I've done a lot of farm work.)

757
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,880
(Only this time with my classmates)

758
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,790
(left a deep impression on me.)

759
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,030
(Youth)

760
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,510
(really has an incredibly
magical filter.)

761
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,790
(Every time I think back,)

762
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,989
(I still think)

763
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,920
(it was the best time of my life.)

764
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,230
Jing Xichi.

765
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,149
Sir.

766
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,279
Don't just play around.

767
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,270
Help with the work.

768
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,839
Wash the vegetables clean.

769
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,920
Don't worry, Sir.

770
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,990
You're still studying?

771
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,429
L-O-W.

772
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,360
Low.

773
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,550
L-O-W.

774
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,990
Good job, Song.

775
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,909
When did you learn to do this?

776
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,080
Hasn't he always
wanted to study medicine?

777
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,750
He's eager to perform surgery on people,

778
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,440
so he practiced on chickens first.
Right?

779
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,119
What do you all think?

780
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,790
Shall we have it steamed or braised?

781
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
It's up to you.

782
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,429
Listen to me. Braise it.

783
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,600
I love braised food the most.

784
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,360
No one asked you.

785
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,230
No one asked me, so I can't choose?

786
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,989
They worked,

787
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,629
so they had time to choose.

788
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,079
You didn't do any work.

789
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,359
How about you do some work then?

790
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,230
I'll work.

791
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,160
Let's braise it then.

792
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,710
Sure, I'll let you all taste my cooking.

793
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,669
I want to stew the chicken first.

794
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,790
Don't touch this.

795
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,840
Let me do it.

796
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,300
I'll prepare the vegetables then.

797
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,750
Sure.

798
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,189
Let's go.

799
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,950
Okay.

800
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,790
L-O-V-E.

801
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,640
Love.

802
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,030
We need to record this for them.

803
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,920
The more I see, the more I think...

804
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,039
What?

805
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,400
Something's going on.

806
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,759
Looks like

807
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,660
the story
of a small-town girl and a top student

808
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,080
wasn't just a rumor after all.

809
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,960
I think you are the ones
with something going on.

810
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,700
You think about romance all day long.

811
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,800
Your phone will be confiscated
by the teacher soon.

812
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,500
Stay out of this.

813
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:27,900
What?

814
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,400
Sir, someone's playing with his phone!

815
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,469
Keep your voice down.

816
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,840
You four-eyed boy.

817
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,920
Coming.

818
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,079
Students.

819
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,319
Let's play some poker after dinner.

820
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,559
I'm not playing.

821
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,599
I'm not playing.

822
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,840
We should take a nap and rest

823
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,420
after eating.

824
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,709
I'm not asking you to play poker.

825
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,279
We're playing truth or dare.

826
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,879
No.

827
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,629
Just draw one.

828
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,100
Whoever got the smallest card loses.

829
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Let's play.

830
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,140
After-meal entertainment.

831
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,120
Let's play for a while.

832
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:04,949
Have some fun.

833
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,629
Let's play.

834
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,440
Hurry.

835
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,949
Sorry, everyone.

836
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,040
I need to go to the toilet.

837
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,790
Go.

838
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,430
Come on.

839
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,390
Yours is the smallest.

840
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,000
Whose card is the smallest?

841
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,080
Your card is the smallest.

842
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,029
Ask away.

843
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,390
If you

844
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,200
can choose your own deskmate,

845
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,120
who in our class
would you like to sit with?

846
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,080
Song, of course.

847
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,469
Tell the truth or I'll punish you.

848
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,759
I'm telling the truth.

849
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,239
Can't you see that we're close?

850
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,949
You...

851
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,000
Let me ask again.

852
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,879
If you had to choose a girl
to be your deskmate,

853
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,760
who would you choose?

854
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,880
That's your second question.

855
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,390
I haven't lost yet. Hurry. Put it down.

856
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,029
Sure. Don't play dirty.

857
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,350
He played dirty.

858
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,460
Your card is still the smallest.

859
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,750
You again.

860
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:56,910
You...

861
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,920
Accept defeat.

862
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,040
Is there something wrong?

863
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,840
Don't play dirty.

864
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,420
I didn't.

865
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,469
Don't play dirty.

866
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,029
Accept defeat.

867
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,200
Why are you causing a ruckus?

868
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,750
- Speak.
- Hurry.

869
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,429
I really

870
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,949
don't have anyone
I particularly want to sit next to.

871
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,710
You must choose one.

872
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,480
You then.

873
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,429
Xinyan.

874
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:16,879
Alright.

875
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,160
Next round.

876
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,430
Here.

877
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,040
Here. Play your cards.

878
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,160
Here, three, two, one. Who is it?

879
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,710
Chen Huan'er.

880
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,639
If it's Huan'er,

881
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,109
I'll ask something simple.

882
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,759
Why?

883
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,720
- Wait.
- You ask her.

884
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,310
I'll ask.

885
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,350
Chen Huan'er.

886
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,600
Who do you

887
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,430
admire most in our class?

888
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,520
I pick Song Cong.

889
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,180
What are you talking about?
Why are you so excited?

890
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,500
Chen Huan'er said...

891
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,600
Nothing.

892
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,230
Song Cong.

893
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,799
We haven't seen your card.

894
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,460
- Take it out and show us.
- Yes.

895
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,429
Your card is the smallest.

896
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,989
I...

897
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,429
I have to ask you a question.

898
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,949
Who do you admire most in our class?

899
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,239
Don't ask the same questions.

900
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,909
How boring?

901
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,679
This question is fun.

902
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,780
Didn't you just finish?

903
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,940
Why are you doing it again?

904
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,239
Sorry, everyone.

905
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,710
My stomach is really upset today.

906
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,600
I don't have tissue.

907
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,109
Do any of you have tissue?

908
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,390
I didn't bring any tissue either.

909
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,830
I'll go get it for you.

910
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,040
Sure.

911
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,230
What's wrong with you?

912
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,389
I don't know.

913
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,589
Song, why don't you go first?

914
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,540
We'll ask Jing Xichi
to deliver it to you later.

915
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,549
Thank you.

916
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,310
Go.

917
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,279
Song said his stomach hurt

918
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,060
and went back
to the dorm to lie down first.

919
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,480
You didn't really poison him, did you?

920
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,100
What are you talking about?

921
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,040
How come we're fine?

922
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,160
Don't scare Huan'er.

923
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,199
I'll go to the fields to see

924
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,660
if there is any sweet potato root.

925
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,540
It can stop diarrhea
when soaked in hot water.

926
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,960
Sweet potato root?

927
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,279
Will that work?

928
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,589
It better not make it worse.

929
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,359
It'll work. My grandpa
was a traditional medicine practitioner.

930
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,549
When I had stomachache,

931
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,680
he soaked it with hot water
and let me drink.

932
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,549
If there are also
copperleaf herb and Ailanthus root,

933
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,380
these three ingredients together
will work.

934
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,080
Let's go.

935
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,160
Chen Huan'er.

936
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,600
Did you find it?

937
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,159
No.

938
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,710
You haven't found it yet?

939
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,270
You're so dumb.

940
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,160
Are these enough?

941
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,600
What are these?

942
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,390
Sweet potato root.
That place is full of them.

943
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,390
Aren't these sweet potatoes?

944
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,270
Yeah, sweet potato roots.

945
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,679
This is the root.

946
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,460
Sweet potato root.

947
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,870
Sweet potato root
isn't the root of a sweet potato.

948
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,830
Sweet potato root
isn't the root of a sweet potato?

949
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,710
Chen Huan'er.

950
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,389
Why don't you listen to yourself?

951
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,640
Sweet potato root
isn't the root of a sweet potato.

952
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,080
Did you hear that?

953
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,319
Sweet potato root isn't...

954
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,060
Sweet potato root.

955
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,980
Wait.
Sweet potato root isn't the root...

956
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,910
Sweet potato root is the name of a herb.

957
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,120
Xichi.

958
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,230
Sweet potato is already a root tuber.

959
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,830
A root tuber?

960
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,799
Let's roast this and eat it tonight.

961
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,040
It should be tasty.

962
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,310
Sweet potato root
isn't the root of a sweet potato.

963
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,310
Sweet potato root
isn't the root of a sweet potato.

964
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,480
Jing Xichi.

965
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,790
Chen Huan'er is so anxious
to find medicine for Song Cong.

966
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,160
Are they that close?

967
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,980
What nonsense are you talking about?

968
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,870
We've sworn brothers.

969
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,909
If you have time to gossip about others,

970
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,549
why don't you help me
find the sweet potato root?

971
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,600
Sure, I'll help you.

972
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,390
But isn't this
the plot of a Chinese fantasy drama?

973
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,429
The little pharmacist
would dig three feet

974
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,710
to find the herb
to save the celestial being.

975
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,160
In the end,
he still has to rely on me to save him.

976
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,790
Chen Huan'er.

977
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,040
Sweet potato root!

978
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,680
Are you sure it's sweet potato root?

979
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,000
Sweet potato root.

980
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,480
The sweet potato root! The herb!

981
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,580
Are you sure it's sweet potato root?

982
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,069
It's sweet potato root.

983
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,679
You mean it's that herb?

984
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,509
Look at the root.

985
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,389
This root.

986
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,480
It's true.

987
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,870
Amazing.

988
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,350
Song said
he wants a hot water bottle.

989
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,230
Does anyone have one?

990
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,359
Ask someone to get it from my dorm.

991
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,359
It's on the bed.

992
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,469
You really have everything.

993
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,359
I'll go then.

994
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,120
Bye.

995
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,589
Is the food

996
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,600
I cooked really poisonous?

997
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,790
Look at how worried
you are about Song Cong.

998
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,600
Come to my dorm to chat in the evening.

999
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,640
I'll give you some advice.

1000
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,160
How's Song Cong?

1001
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,159
It's nothing serious.

1002
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,679
Song Cong just has a stomachache.

1003
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,580
Huan'er is about
to prepare medicine for him.

1004
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,719
Let's hurry.

1005
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,910
The kitchen is closing.

1006
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,159
What's wrong, my little princess?

1007
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,790
Here, here's the hot water bottle.

1008
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,560
How much is it?

1009
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,020
It's free. It belongs to Xinyan.

1010
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,879
Did you tell them?

1011
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,589
Of course.

1012
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,790
Where else can I get you
this hot water bottle?

1013
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,000
We just came back
from digging a herb for you.

1014
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,790
Actually,

1015
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,790
Chen Huan'er is really good.

1016
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,109
She knows a lot

1017
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,480
about Chinese herbs and the like.

1018
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,490
It's just that this herb
is too difficult to find.

1019
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,160
Do you know

1020
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,880
that sweet potato root isn't actually
the root of a sweet potato?

1021
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,630
Do you get it?

1022
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,509
What's the use of her knowing so much?

1023
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,639
I found it in the end.

1024
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,830
Don't let her come.

1025
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,750
No.

1026
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,080
She's preparing the medicine for you.

1027
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,549
If you don't let her come...

1028
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,830
Go get it for me.

1029
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,430
Don't let her come.

1030
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,960
