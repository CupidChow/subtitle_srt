(Time, Time, Please Slow Down)

16
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,270
The best mom.

17
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
I love you.

18
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,990
I'll use this one.

19
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,390
Mom, aren't you on the night shift?

20
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,750
Why are you back so early?

21
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,860
Are you sure it's your mom?

22
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,140
Dad!

23
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,190
Dad!

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,620
Weren't you not coming back?

25
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,900
Why did you suddenly come back?

26
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,990
It's your mom's birthday.

27
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,890
I wanted to surprise her.
How could I not come?

28
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,020
Dad! Listen.

29
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,300
I've got everything ready.

30
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,460
That's great!

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,580
Hurry, give it to me!

32
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,650
Let me wash my hands first.

33
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,550
You have no idea

34
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,460
how hard it is

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,350
for me to take a leave.

36
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,460
What happened, Dad?

37
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,670
Huan'er.

38
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,300
Uh...

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,790
Why are my mouth-rinsing cup,
toothbrush, and towel

40
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,860
gone from the washroom?

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,880
Where did they go?

42
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,860
Mom said it was too occupied there,

43
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,990
so she put them away.

44
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,070
Let me call and ask her.

45
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,860
Don't!

46
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,740
Don't call her.

47
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,540
If you call her,
the surprise will be ruined.

48
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,390
Yeah, you're right!

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,020
You see, I hardly come home,

50
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,120
and now I feel like
this isn't even my house.

51
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,420
Dad,

52
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,110
I'll go and buy you a new set.

53
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,670
Don't!

54
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,510
It's just downstairs.

55
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,110
Forget it.

56
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,560
It's late now. It's not safe.

57
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,140
I come up with a solution.

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,020
What is it?

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,830
I'll just rub
my hands together, that'll do.

60
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,510
Dad, don't be

61
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,550
disgusting.

62
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,670
Your mom is so unreasonable

63
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,950
to put all my stuff away.

64
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,390
Luckily, this was not discovered.

65
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,830
Oh my god.

66
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,790
Huan'er, is there any milk left?

67
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,230
This milk expired days ago.

68
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,510
Dad, try to search for it again.

69
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,350
Doesn't your mom cook for you?

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,950
I've just found five or six

71
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,180
bottles of expired stuff here.

72
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,350
And also, this spatula

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,260
is not even cleaned properly
after being used.

74
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,860
Is your mom normally

75
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,840
abusing you at home?

76
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,580
How am I abusing her?

77
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,020
Get lost!

78
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,110
You mean I abuse her?

79
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,640
If you're not at ease,
take her away!

80
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,020
Look, this is expired.

81
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,420
I'm playing both mom and dad roles.

82
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,230
It's not easy for me.

83
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,510
Do you think it's easy for me?

84
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,510
Please come back to the topic.

85
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,390
This milk is expired.

86
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,300
So what? I'll use it as fertilizer
for the plants!

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,700
I didn't give it to her to drink!

88
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,270
Are you just arguing for the sake of it?

89
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,070
You disappeared all year round.

90
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,540
And you have
the nerve to lecture me?

91
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,040
What do you mean? Why am I never home?

92
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,830
I work hard all year.

93
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,830
I raise the kid and take care of her.

94
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,500
I live like a widow. It's easy for me?

95
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
You've gone overboard.

96
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,670
A widow? Then, who am I here?

97
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,550
I'm just like a widow.

98
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,740
Am I out there making money?

99
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,860
Making money? Give it to me.

100
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,680
- I gave you all the money!
- That little bit?

101
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,710
I gave you money and
you bought such a thing?

102
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,820
- What can't I buy this?
- This could poison someone.

103
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,910
What's wrong with you?

104
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,470
You keep buying expired stuff.

105
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,140
How was I supposed
to know it was expired?

106
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,740
I don't want to argue with you anymore.

107
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,060
I just got off my night shift.

108
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,820
I'll sleep first,
then only battle with you.

109
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,300
Stay or leave, it's up to you.

110
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,260
You scared me!

111
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,670
Morning. You wake up so early.

112
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,590
Morning.

113
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,060
Why are you up so early?

114
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,620
What else?

115
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,180
Taking out the rubbish.

116
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,590
Oh yeah.

117
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,080
You have to take out the rubbish.

118
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,740
It's still early in the morning.

119
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,940
Why are you in your pajamas

120
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,140
and standing in front of my house?

121
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,350
I...

122
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,550
I woke up early too.

123
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,590
Go on.

124
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,790
Keep making things up.

125
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,380
Hold on, Chen Huan'er.

126
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,470
Your look right now...

127
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,160
You really see me
as just a brother, huh?

128
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,470
I...

129
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,820
I just...

130
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,590
Wanted to ask you for tutoring.

131
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,260
You...

132
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,230
Want me

133
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,420
to tutor you?

134
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,380
You're talking nonsense
in the morning.

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,470
Are you sleepwalking?

136
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:50,860
Are you...

137
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,230
Ouch!

138
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,820
It's painful.

139
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,550
My parents are quarreling.

140
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,590
I want to stay away
from it at your place.

141
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,790
Is that okay?

142
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,380
(Song.)

143
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,180
(Come to my house!)

144
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,200
(Chen Huan'er needs you.)

145
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,260
Wait,

146
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,350
should I change

147
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,060
my outfits too?

148
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,470
Otherwise, I look completely

149
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,560
out of place with you two.

150
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,990
Are you okay?

151
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,500
I'm fine now.

152
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,420
What's so funny?

153
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,420
Nothing, go on.

154
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,790
Sorry

155
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,380
for waking you both up so early.

156
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,150
I just don't understand

157
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,350
why my parents

158
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,360
suddenly started fighting.

159
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,790
They used to argue,

160
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,110
but never this bad.

161
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,790
Why are they fighting?

162
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,940
I don't know.

163
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,180
When I woke up and started washing up,

164
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,400
my dad was making breakfast

165
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,040
and my mom returned
from her night shift.

166
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,560
Then, suddenly they started fighting.

167
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,470
It feels like

168
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,420
they argue because of me.

169
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,820
Didn't you ask them

170
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,590
why

171
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,740
they were fighting?

172
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,180
How am I supposed to ask?

173
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,550
Yeah.

174
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,910
What about your parents?

175
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,110
What do they usually fight about?

176
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,230
My parents?

177
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,670
My parents...

178
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,790
Anything from international wars

179
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,940
to the most trivial things.

180
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,670
As long as they breathe the same air,

181
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,060
they'll find a reason to argue.

182
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,940
But usually, within a minute,

183
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,860
my dad will find some way

184
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,470
to coax my mom.

185
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,620
And soon after he calms her down,

186
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,500
within another minute,

187
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,700
they'll start fighting again.

188
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,260
Sometimes, it gets really dramatic.

189
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,920
There's never a fight
happened at my house.

190
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,860
Never?

191
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,230
Never.

192
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,060
Every day, it's just my dad

193
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,180
who gets scolded.

194
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,710
Now when you guys mention it,

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,760
I think my family
isn't so bad after all.

196
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,430
But seriously, it's weird.

197
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,470
See,

198
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,430
since

199
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,140
they look down on each other so much,

200
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,540
why did they choose to be together
when they were young?

201
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,500
Haven't you heard the saying?

202
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,660
Many people say

203
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,190
that before having kids,

204
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,590
parents have a good relationship.

205
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,900
Who told you this nonsense?

206
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,260
So, according to you,

207
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,900
why did our parents have us?

208
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,780
To suffer?

209
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,500
Who knows?

210
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,470
All beings endure suffering.

211
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,190
Oh, right.

212
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,860
Let me show you two

213
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,590
something I found last night.

214
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,470
- Where is it?
- What is it?

215
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,710
This and this.

216
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,380
Do you get it?

217
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,540
So basically,

218
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,380
your dad

219
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,990
and your mom are actually fine.

220
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,260
Wait, does that mean...

221
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,990
Your dad

222
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,070
and your mom?

223
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,860
Are you crazy?

224
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,780
My mom?

225
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,260
My mom?

226
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,780
My mom?

227
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,070
How could that possibly be my mom?

228
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,860
Alright.

229
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,260
Move a little this way.

230
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,860
This way?

231
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,260
Yeah.

232
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,620
This.

233
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,350
This background.

234
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,830
Yes.

235
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,740
Alright.

236
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,260
One, two.

237
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,430
No more film.

238
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,590
Sorry about that.

239
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,990
Let me check if I have a spare roll.

240
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,780
Hold on.

241
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,740
No rush.

242
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,430
Take your time.

243
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,380
Yifan,

244
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,830
why do I feel that he has

245
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,780
other intentions

246
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,710
towards you?

247
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,740
Xichi.

248
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,500
Good morning, Mom.

249
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,190
Morning, Aunt Lin.

250
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,940
Morning, Aunt Lin.

251
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,590
You three

252
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,780
slept in this room last night?

253
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,780
Mom, what are you thinking?

254
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,740
How could it be possible

255
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,960
to fit three of us on my bed?

256
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,900
They just got here.

257
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,260
Just got here?

258
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,190
Then, you probably haven't
had breakfast yet.

259
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,160
What do you want to eat?

260
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,990
I'll make it for you.

261
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,500
Mom.

262
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,590
What's wrong?

263
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,020
Can I ask you a question?

264
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,020
Did Uncle Song

265
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,660
like you

266
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,230
when

267
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,260
he was young?

268
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,190
What?

269
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,140
You're back for B and C again?

270
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,540
What a special style you have!

271
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,020
Why are you here?

272
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,620
Delivering photos to Jing Xichi.

273
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,310
I have something for you.

274
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,230
Regarding the last math problem,

275
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,310
I thought about it.

276
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,950
I think that not everything

277
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,860
needs an answer.

278
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,990
What if the answer

279
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,860
isn't what you want?

280
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,430
Study it carefully.

281
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,140
This is all I can do to help.

282
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,140
Jing Xichi.

283
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,070
I'm here.

284
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,860
Open the door.

285
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,334
(Sense and Sensibility)

286
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,260
Dad,

287
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,900
Mom doesn't like surprises the most.

288
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,830
If you do this,

289
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,540
will she take it seriously?

290
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,020
You don't get it.

291
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,590
All these years, your mom has seen

292
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,560
all kinds of big storms
working in the hospital.

293
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,830
Ordinary surprises don't work on her.

294
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,190
I tell you,

295
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,230
you must follow my order later.

296
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,020
As soon as your mom comes home

297
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,660
in a sorrowful mood,

298
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,470
we rush up

299
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,740
and give her a big hug.

300
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,230
That's what we call a surprise.

301
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,100
What do you think?

302
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,380
Alright.

303
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,140
Let's do it.

304
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,590
Let's go.

305
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,400
(You've done enough all these years.)

306
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:18,100
(I'll take Huan'er.
No worries. -Chen Lei)

307
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,190
Didn't you say

308
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,230
she went to the hospital
for just a while?

309
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,440
We've been waiting for so long.
Why isn't she back yet?

310
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,780
I don't know.

311
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,900
My back hurts. Keep an eye out for me.
I need a break.

312
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,020
Alright. Go ahead, Dad.

313
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,780
Dad! She's here!

314
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,340
She's here!

315
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,660
Hurry!

316
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,740
Move!

317
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,070
Hide! Hide! Hide!

318
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,980
(You've done enough all these years.)

319
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,020
(I'll take Huan'er.
No worries. -Chen Lei)

320
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,950
Chen Lei!

321
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,070
Give me back my daughter!

322
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,990
What's happening?

323
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,620
Oh no, we messed up.

324
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,740
Oh my goodness.

325
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,070
Mom! Mom!

326
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,260
Lina! Lina! Lina!

327
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,070
Chen Lei!

328
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,860
Huan'er!

329
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,190
Lina!

330
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,430
Lina!

331
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,430
- Mom! Mom!
- Lina!

332
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,500
Mom!

333
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,590
Why did you come back?

334
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,070
Why did you even come back?

335
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,310
Get your filthy hands off me!

336
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:51,950
I tell you...

337
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,860
Take this!

338
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,740
You two are too much!

339
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,990
You two scared me a lot.

340
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,830
What is this?

341
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,470
Look!

342
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,830
Why don't you give me a banner?

343
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,640
Oh, right, Dad!

344
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,600
We forget the banner.
I'll get a banner next time!

345
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,590
- Hurry up!
- Sit down!

346
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,950
You two bully me.

347
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,740
Mom, don't be angry.

348
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,570
We were just joking.

349
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,140
Huan'er,

350
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,720
help your mom to wear this on. Take it.

351
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,590
I don't want!

352
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,540
Come on, wear it on.

353
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,620
So pretty!

354
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
How beautiful!

355
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,350
Look here. Ready?

356
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,350
I don't want!

357
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,110
Just take a look.

358
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,070
Just take a look.

359
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,900
One, two, three.

360
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,740
Sister,

361
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,020
after thinking about it,

362
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,350
I wish to change back
to the previous cake,

363
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,590
can I?

364
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,350
Sure!

365
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,110
Lina,

366
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,350
happy birthday!

367
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,740
This was specially chosen by my dad.

368
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,380
This looks pretty nice.

369
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,070
Look.

370
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,680
Come on, let's celebrate the birthday.

371
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,780
Look at you, how
could you take it seriously?

372
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,500
Wasn't it just a joke?

373
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,070
What joke?

374
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,380
That was a scare, okay?

375
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:20,950
Fine, a scare.

376
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,780
Sorry, sorry.

377
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,190
Light the candles.

378
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,780
Happy birthday to you.

379
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,950
Happy birthday to me.

380
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,990
Happy birthday to me.

381
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,040
Make a wish, make a wish.

382
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,380
Make a wish. Mom, make a wish.

383
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,710
Blow out the candles.

384
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,230
Alright.

385
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,260
Mom.

386
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,190
Look how nice it is.

387
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,070
I prepared you

388
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,310
a birthday present.

389
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,070
Look.

390
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,120
This is the one I prepared.

391
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,260
There's even a birthday gift!

392
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,430
Mom,

393
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,470
open it and see.

394
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,260
Inside this,

395
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,150
you're the star in all of these.

396
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,940
You learned this from Jing Xichi, right?

397
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,740
No creativity.

398
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,630
Yeah.

399
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,100
I went through our family photos,

400
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,870
and I didn't see
any of you two together.

401
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,060
You were always busy
taking pictures of me.

402
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,230
From now on, I'll take
more pictures of you both.

403
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,740
Oh, you're mistaken.

404
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,180
Your mom used to have more
than a dozen photo albums.

405
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,710
They were all lost when we moved.

406
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,500
It left only...

407
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,500
Happy birthday.

408
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,500
Mom, do you like it?

409
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,160
- Does it look nice?
- How about this one?

410
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,990
Isn't it nice?

411
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,740
Come on, let's eat cake.

412
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,710
Don't just eat cake.

413
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,990
I'll cook some noodles.

414
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,470
Let me do it.

415
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,500
You don't have to do it.

416
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,910
You just stay and cut the cake.

417
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,190
Let me do it. I'll do it.

418
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,990
(Just as I expected,)

419
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,430
(my parents' argument this time)

420
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,300
(ended without any danger.)

421
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,390
(Now, I finally understand)

422
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,950
(only when the love is deep enough)

423
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,740
(can one argue)

424
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,060
(with such confidence.)

425
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,260
(That's their)

426
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,910
(unique kind of romance.)

427
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,060
Why did you call me here?

428
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,540
You'll know when you see it.

429
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,580
I'm full. I don't feel like moving.

430
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,060
Hurry up.

431
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,780
I feel bloated.

432
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,580
Go up there!

433
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,430
Sit there.

434
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,540
Here.

435
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,300
Sit here.

436
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,870
What are you doing?

437
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,100
Close your eyes.

438
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,580
Close your eyes.

439
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,460
You already closed?

440
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,580
Don't open your eyes
unless I let you open.

441
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,430
Don't open your eyes.

442
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,480
You must not open your eyes.

443
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,260
Are you cheating?

444
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,780
No.

445
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,060
No peeking! Close your eyes.

446
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,820
I got it.

447
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,540
No peeking.

448
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,670
Chen Huan'er!

449
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,100
No peeking!

450
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,340
I'm watching you. Don't try to peek.

451
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,230
I'm watching you.

452
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,280
Don't open your eyes yet.

453
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
I'm still watching you.

454
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,500
What exactly are you up to?

455
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,870
You'll find out soon.

456
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,580
Stop talking.

457
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,100
Don't open your eyes.

458
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,460
Stretch out your hand.

459
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,540
Stretch out your hand.

460
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
No peeking.
You still can't open your eyes yet.

461
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,990
Wait a while.

462
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,870
I didn't peek.

463
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,740
Don't open your eyes.

464
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,100
What's that sound?

465
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,870
Open your eyes.

466
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:35,820
This...

467
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,470
Didn't they say they
don't sell this cake in slices?

468
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,260
This is just a small problem
that couldn't defeat me.

469
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,060
Look at you.

470
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,630
You wanted to eat it, didn't you?

471
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,150
Since you want to eat it,

472
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,580
of course, you should have it.

473
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,390
How did you settle this?

474
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,670
Hi.

475
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,220
Could you get me the cake
on the display rack?

476
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,520
And cut it into three portions.

477
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,460
Okay, wait a moment.

478
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,470
What's the big deal?

479
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,540
Why did you call me over?

480
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,380
What are you doing?

481
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,780
That time at Sishui,

482
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,630
didn't Aunt Hao

483
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,390
like eating cake?

484
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,150
Take this cake back for her.

485
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,990
She'd be so happy.

486
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,500
You guys didn't even invite me.

487
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Why did you call me over?

488
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,100
I'm not accepting your bribe.

489
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,340
Buddy,

490
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,990
I'm not bribing you.

491
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,710
I was just thinking for you.

492
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,540
Look, Dr. Li

493
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,190
worries about you every day.

494
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,460
Shouldn't you do something
to show your filial piety?

495
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,390
Am I right?

496
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,260
It's done packing.

497
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:37,990
Thank you.

498
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,230
You two, remember to pay.

499
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,910
158 yuan.

500
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,710
Do you have...

501
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,910
How much do you have?

502
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,150
38 yuan.

503
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,100
Not enough.

504
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,710
Still 20 yuan short.

505
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,260
Just 20 yuan more.

506
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,580
I have no more left.

507
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,300
We'll just take one.

508
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,260
Can we pay next time?

509
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,150
Why do you ask so many questions?

510
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,230
Just eat it.

511
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,300
There's even a candle.

512
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,190
It's not my birthday today.

513
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,950
Who cares if it's your birthday or not?

514
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,640
I say it's your birthday, then it is.

515
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,500
Happy birthday.

516
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,230
Don't cry.

517
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,910
Close your eyes.

518
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,190
Make a wish.

519
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,060
Make a wish.

520
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,960
Blow out the candle after making a wish.

521
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,780
Thank you.

522
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,580
It must be very delicious.

523
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,430
Eat it.

524
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,630
Why is there only one spoon?

525
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,100
I bought this for you.

526
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,160
I'm not eating. You eat it.

527
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,920
Here, hold it.

528
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,230
Eat it.

529
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,020
How is it?

530
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,950
This is delicious, right?

531
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,870
It's so good.

532
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,500
You try a bite too.

533
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,470
I don't want.

534
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,500
Just try one.

535
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,260
I find you gross.

536
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,020
I don't even mind you,

537
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,820
and you mind me?

538
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,150
Try it, it's really good.

539
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:47,780
Is it good?

540
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,820
It's really delicious!

541
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,640
It's really yummy.

542
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,150
No wonder it's so expensive.

543
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,020
Is this pricey?

544
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,340
Not really.

545
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,990
I got it covered. Eat up.

546
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,300
Then, take another bite.

547
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,430
Mom,

548
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,190
I got you a cake. Try it.

549
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,780
Son,

550
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,190
you finally know
how to care for your mom.

551
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,260
Alright, I'll go and cut it.

552
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,260
We'll eat it together.

553
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,390
You're back.

554
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:31,780
Mom.

555
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,300
What did you buy?

556
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,520
The cake shop had a discount,
so I bought some for you.

557
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,430
We just ate.

558
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,740
Isn't this a waste of money?

559
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,820
Look.

560
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,430
Look.

561
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,540
Song Hang.

562
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,740
This is nice.

563
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,920
Dad, come and have some.

564
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,710
Are you done taking photos?

565
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,870
Yeah, it's done.

566
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,340
Your camera is nice.
It's made in German, right?

567
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,230
Let's go dancing.

568
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,740
Hurry.

569
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,470
This is nice.

570
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,430
Let's go.

571
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,670
Just loosen up later.

572
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,540
There it is.

573
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,300
You came so early, huh?

574
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,540
I came a bit earlier

575
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,710
to save a seat for you.

576
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,190
You're here, Yifan.

577
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,150
He's calling you Yifan now?

578
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,990
Don't just stand there.

579
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:26,910
Let's go dance.

580
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,740
Come on!

581
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,150
Come on!

582
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,670
I'll go and buy something to drink.

583
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,060
Song Hang, what do you want?

584
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,470
I'll go with you.

585
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,100
Alright.

586
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,910
You usually dress
like a little gangster.

587
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,150
Why are you dressed so properly today?

588
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,470
Didn't you say that day

589
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,230
that running around playing soccer

590
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,910
isn't much of a future?

591
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,740
So, I decided to apply
to the fire department.

592
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,580
I was joking.

593
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,020
Why did you take it seriously?

594
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,540
I wasn't joking.

595
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,990
Yifan,

596
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,390
if I get into the fire department,

597
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,950
will you seriously consider me?

598
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,470
The photos from last time are done.

599
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,390
I brought the ones with you here.

600
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,100
You even carry them along with you?

601
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,710
That day when I

602
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,780
went to your workplace

603
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,580
to drop off photos for the juniors,

604
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,230
I actually brought along yours too.

605
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,540
But, it looked like

606
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
you had swapped shifts.

607
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,540
You weren't there.

608
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,230
So...

609
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,390
The pictures are so nice.

610
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,580
You university students
take photos differently.

611
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,470
Not really.

612
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,060

Dad!

653
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,430
You're back.

654
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,600
Did you get wet in the rain?

655
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,460
Not really.

656
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,820
Really? Your clothes are soaked.

657
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,630
Go home and change.

658
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,100
Uncle Chen.

659
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,060
Hello. Go home and get changed.

660
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,780
Bye, Uncle Chen.

661
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,660
Don't catch a cold.

662
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,500
All tidied up?

663
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,460
The rain stopped.

664
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,430
Didn't I tell you to change?

665
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,240
Aren't you cold?

666
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,680
It's fine, Dad. I didn't get too wet.

667
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,670
Huan'er,

668
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,540
I want to ask you something.

669
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,230
It's so late already.

670
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,670
What were you doing
with that boy from the Jing family?

671
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,150
He brought me something to eat.

672
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,300
Dad, I tell you I have eaten so much.

673
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,020
I feel like my stomach
is going to explode.

674
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,740
I can't take it, Dad.

675
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,150
I need to go to the washroom.

676
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,060
Mom, are you done yet?

677
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,300
Mom, faster!

678
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,670
My stomach hurts.

679
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,430
I can't hold it, Mom.

680
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,780
Liqiang,

681
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,820
bring a bed sheet.

682
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,470
I washed one for you. It just dried.

683
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,720
There's definitely one over there.
No need to bring that.

684
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,780
Just listen to me.

685
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,300
The bed sheets there

686
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,660
are always worn out,
and not as good as the ones at home.

687
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,150
What if you have an allergic reaction?

688
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:36,710
Dad,

689
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,710
where are you going?

690
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,780
Going on an outstation.

691
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,910
Nonsense.

692
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,740
Your dad has been transferred.

693
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,540
How bad your department is.

694
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,910
Just transferring

695
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,740
without prior notice. So sudden!

696
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,230
I don't even know what to pack now.

697
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,670
You got transferred, Dad?

698
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,740
To Tonglin.

699
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,910
Uncle Yang who
is the deputy section chief

700
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,820
has been promoted.

701
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,390
They are sending me there.

702
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,160
If I do well, I might get promoted
to be the deputy section chief too.

703
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,190
I heard the sports university
in Tonglin is quite good.

704
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,100
I'm near to the place.

705
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,640
Let me check it out for you first.

706
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,020
Got it.

707
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:13,580
Liqiang,

708
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,950
I told you to bring more sweaters,

709
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,870
but you wouldn't.

710
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,780
It's just a temporary report-in.

711
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,190
No need to bring so much!

712
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,990
You're always so stubborn with me.

713
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,870
How stubborn you are.

714
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,100
Take care of your mom for me.

715
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:28,950
Don't worry.

716
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,580
I'm getting older now.

717
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,200
I won't be going out
to the field as much anymore.

718
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,390
Once you enter university,

719
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,260
I'll transfer back.

720
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,440
Then, I can spend more time
with you and your mom.

721
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,150
Oh,

722
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,670
about your soccer...

723
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,670
I know.

724
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,940
Keep doing it until the end.

725
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,580
I get to go now.

726
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,420
(Tianhe No.3 Central Hospital
Family Housing Compound)

727
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,820
You've grown taller.

728
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:57,780
Really?

729
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,220
You look like an adult now.

730
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,580
I'm off.

731
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,060
Bye.

732
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,430
Where is Uncle Jing going?

733
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,430
My dad got temporarily
assigned out of town.

734
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,100
When will he be back?

735
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,500
Don't know.

736
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,190
Where did you go?

737
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,580
Bought a set of practice questions.

738
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,390
Let's go.

739
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,990
(I used to think)

740
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,390
(I was the only one
who was afraid to ask)

741
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,820
(when Dad would come back.)

742
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,430
(I guess)

743
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,340
(it's not just fear of an answer
that feels too far away.)

744
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,100
I'm home!

745
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,540
Huan'er, you're back.

746
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,100
Dad.

747
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,340
Oh, right.

748
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,500
Don't touch the kitchen door just yet.

749
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,190
I just fixed it and put some oil on it.

750
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,740
Why do you fix the door suddenly?

751
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,020
Whenever

752
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,740
you push this door, it creaks.

753
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,180
If your mom

754
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,060
comes home from a night shift for a nap,

755
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,950
the creak sound
will definitely wake her up.

756
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,310
(It's also the fear that my dad
who cares for us a lot)

757
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:16,830
(might get upset)

758
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,700
(after hearing it.)

759
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,540
I'm leaving tomorrow.

760
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,100
So, I better get this done quickly.

761
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:25,950
Oh yeah,

762
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,140
I bought you some oranges.

763
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,580
They're really sweet. Try it now.

764
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,180
I'll try it.

765
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,620
It's so sweet.

766
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,140
Really?

767
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,960
Try one. Try one.

768
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,500
I'll have one.

769
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,140
Sweet or not?

770
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:38,700
Sweet.

771
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,540
It's sweeter than me.

772
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,580
Nothing's sweeter than my big girl.

773
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,700
Dad, you're sweating so much.

774
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,430
It's fine.

775
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,920
Let me wipe it off for you.

776
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,910
I'm getting VIP treatment.

777
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,470
I got a little helper while working.

778
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,270
All done.

779
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,660
Look, this is too loose.

780
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,350
I already told Mom,

781
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,350
next time we won't
pack up your things anymore.

782
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,020
It's okay, whatever is
convenient for you two.

783
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,430
Dad.

784
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,470
Let's take a photo together.

785
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,990
Why the sudden idea to take a picture?

786
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,830
Well, I'm an adult now.

787
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,020
I just want to keep a memory.

788
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:17,990
Can we?

789
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,310
Sure, we'll take one later.

790
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,750
Wait a moment.

791
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,830
Your neck is covered in sweat.

792
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:36,950
(I think)

793
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,270
(I'll never ask that question again.)

794
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,500
(Parents choosing their dream careers,)

795
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,430
(living the lives they want,)

796
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,790
(it's their freedom.)

797
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,750
(I can't choose my parents,)

798
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,270
(but I can choose
what kind of child to be.)

799
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,910
(I choose)

800
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,390
(to let them feel at ease.)

801
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:17,580
(Gaokao Countdown 275 days)

802
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,180
(My impression
of High School Year 3 is simple,)

803
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,660
(which is silent.)

804
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,620
(A sudden, overwhelming silence.)

805
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,350
(No more noise during breaks.)

806
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,350
(No more whispering
during self-study sessions.)

807
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,660
(Everyone is working hard
towards their future.)

808
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,830
No one wants to attend PE class.

809
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,270
I'll go by myself then.

810
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,181
(Fight for Gaokao)

811
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:04,140
(No Regrets in Youth,
Fight for Your Dreams!)

812
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:22,870
Xichi.

813
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,910
I passed my physical test.

814
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,870
Congratulations!

815
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,660
Your future is promising now.

816
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,140
Honestly,

817
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,790
if I hadn't been competing
with you all this time,

818
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,870
I might not be able to go through it.

819
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,270
Let's have another battle someday.

820
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,470
After all, there aren't

821
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,940
many opponents I actually respect.

822
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,020
Look at you bragging.

823
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:07,350
Alright.

824
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,020
I got it.

825
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,390
Don't give up.

826
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,620
I'm leaving.

827
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,980
I've been looking for you two
for a long time.

828
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,480
It turns out that you are sitting here.

829
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,390
Come on.

830
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,830
Recently,

831
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,400
I let someone bring me
some supplements from New Zealand.

832
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,350
Kids are under
a lot of academic stress lately.

833
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,540
These are good for the brain.

834
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,060
Each of you take one.

835
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,660
Mrs. Li,

836
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,750
you do know that supplements

837
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,060
shouldn't be taken carelessly.

838
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,870
Medicine is also poisonous.

839
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,430
For kids,

840
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,390
just give them

841
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,100
some basic vitamins will do.

842
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:10,870
Understand?

843
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,020
Am I right, Yifan?

844
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,580
What's wrong with you?

845
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,560
Something on your mind?

846
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,060
It's nothing.

847
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,500
I'm just

848
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,350
hesitating whether

849
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,660
I should

850
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,540
ask you about

851
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,390
a good tutoring school recommendation.

852
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,660
Of course, I have.

853
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,350
Any level, any price range, you name it.

854
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,240
Feel free to ask me.

855
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,020
What happens?

856
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,270
Are you thinking
of getting Xichi a tutor?

857
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,830
It's just...

858
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,270
A while ago,

859
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,430
I went to ask
Sport University professors.

860
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,140
With Xichi's

861
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,540
current level,

862
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,660
if he doesn't pass

863
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,470
the Sport University assessment,

864
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,870
his only options would be schools

865
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,910
for sports management
or some other related fields.

866
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,870
If like that,

867
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,950
it would limit his career choices.

868
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
So, I've been thinking
it might be better

869
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,700
for him to aim
for a comprehensive university.

870
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,720
What do you all think?

871
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,350
That's true.

872
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,060
It makes sense.

873
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,990
Gaokao is a big deal in life.

874
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,470
As parents, we should

875
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,500
plan for our kids.

876
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:04,950
Exactly.

877
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,080
I'll help you ask around.

878
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,910
Thanks so much.

879
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,870
I see

880
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,100
you should take two more boxes.

881
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,790
Give them to your kid

882
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,020
to boost their brain power.

883
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,060
He needs more.

884
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,180
Since your kids
are not that intelligent,

885
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,390
they should eat more of this.

886
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:24,910
You...

887
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,790
You just take one box first.

888
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,220
I'm saving this last one for my kid.

889
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:28,950
You have yours.

890
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,790
I get to go first.

891
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,140
I'll save it for Dr. Li then.
