Huan'er,

17
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,340
what are you searching for?

18
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,990
I'm searching for a book

19
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,270
called Medical Herbology.

20
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,470
Medical Herbology.

21
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,510
Medical Herbology...

24
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,740
Thank you.

25
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,510
Sorry,

26
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,340
I think I have
another book to search for.

27

(Medical School of Yenching University

28
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,230
You can't be worse off than me, right?

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,950
If you're already making that face,

30
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,390
then I might as well hit a wall.

31
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:10,460
(Medical School of Yenching University
Entrance Exam Results, Rank: 27/31)

32
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,660
Have you ever been
in such a low ranking?

33
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,990
Yenching University

34
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,780
is the top university in the country.

35
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,620
If you could still casually
get first place like before,

36
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,640
then it has no difference from Tianhe.

37
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,720
The food in the cafeteria
was pretty good today.

38
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,830
Yeah, I think they must

39
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,680
have changed the chef.

40
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,790
Um...

41
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,700
You are?

42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,230
Let me introduce myself.

43
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,180
I'm Lin Jingyi.

44
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,580
From now on, we're roommates.

45
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,580
You don't look like

46
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,830
you're the same age as us.

47
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,620
How old are you?

48
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,620
I'm fifteen.

49
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,620
By age,

50
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,440
I should be calling you guys "brother".

51
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,060
Since the semester started,
you haven't been here.

52
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,860
I came a few times,

53
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,700
but I applied for an off-campus hostel.

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,760
And these past few months,

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,940
I've been abroad with my supervisor
for academic exchange.

56
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,590
Your supervisor?

57
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:26,910
By the way,

58
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,260
who's Song Cong?

59
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:29,990
Him.

60
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,820
That's me.

61
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,380
Your note was on the desk

62
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,760
and I just flipped through it.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,710
Your Compensatory Value Formula

64
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,380
has an error

65
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,380
in the calculation.

66
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,000
The arterial blood range for the patient

67
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,940
should be between 31.8 and 37.8 mmol/L.

68
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,590
Let me see.

69
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,350
You're right.

70
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,180
Add me on QQ.

71
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:53,710
Here.

72
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,910
Boomerang Nebula?

73
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,470
The coldest nebula

74
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,710
in the known universe.

75
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,740
You know about it?

76
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,790
Just a little.

77
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,030
Hello, Mom.

78
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,180
You've arrived?

79
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,470
Alright, I'll be right down.

80
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,900
I have to go down for a bit.
I'll be back soon.

81
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,940
Fifteen years old.

82
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,260
The world

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,230
has gone insane.

84
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,110
This is my previous lecture notes.

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,580
They might be helpful for you.

86
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,260
Thank you.

87
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:05,990
No problem.

88
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,180
But...

89
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,500
Can you read them tomorrow?

90
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,860
I want to sleep now.

91
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,740
Sorry.

92
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,990
I'll read it outside.

93
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,900
It's time to sleep.

94
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,990
Good night, everyone.

95
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,670
Good night.

96
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,910
Good night.

97
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,470
What's wrong with you?

98
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,990
You seem down these past few days.

99
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,740
Is that because of Jing Xichi?

100
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,620
I wonder

101
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,180
what it feels like

102
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,180
to like someone.

103
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,720
It's like wanting to be attached
to him like conjoined twins.

104
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,240
You'd want to see him all the time.

105
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,910
I just want to be
an ace student with him.

106
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,380
Dong Huixin,

107
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,230
you liked someone before!

108
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,670
Why so surprised?

109
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,500
It's human nature.

110
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,620
I'm human too, okay?

111
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,620
Top Student,

112
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,110
please tell me,

113
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,030
if you like someone

114
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,420
and they touch you,

115
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,590
even just

116
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,110
accidentally,

117
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,910
would you feel uncomfortable?

118
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,380
Of course not.

119
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,060
Yeah.

120
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,420
Even if it's not accidentally,

121
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,110
but touch you deliberately,

122
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,740
you still won't feel uncomfortable.

123
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,470
When you like someone,

124
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,620
you'll just want

125
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,420
to hug and hold him

126
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,820
all the time.

127
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,590
Otherwise, why are there
idioms describing their intimacy,

128
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,060
their lingering affection,

129
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,380
or their night of ecstasy?

130
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,420
Huang Lu,

131
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,060
you use all your knowledge of idioms

132
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,590
in erotic fiction.

133
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,180
A gangster isn't scary.

134
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,940
What's scary is a literate gangster.

135
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,940
What gangster?

136
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,230
What erotic fiction?

137
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,110
This is a lesson by Master Huang Lu.

138
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,040
Master Huang has never
been in a relationship,

139
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,260
yet she's giving lectures, huh?

140
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,060
How ungrateful!

141
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,230
You better jot down the points.

142
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,740
(Medical Herbology)

143
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,470
(Forget it.)

144
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,350
(It's pointless to ask more.)

145
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,780
Ye.

146
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,500
I saw you

147
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,470
in the library yesterday.

148
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,780
It's so rare!

149
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,500
Don't be so mean.

150
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,640
Can't I just want to study?

151
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,710
Don't pretend.

152
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,830
Did a pretty girl

153
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,880
catch your attention?

154
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,020
Oh yeah, you're right.

155
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,830
Wow, why didn't you bring me along?

156
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,660
You know her.

157
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,110
But, stop dreaming.

158
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,190
She's already taken.

159
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,020
Who?

160
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,590
Chen Huan'er.

161
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,190
Since when has she been taken?

162
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,900
Tian Chi.

163
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,310
I saw them at the library yesterday.

164
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,380
It seemed like they were on a date.

165
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,340
From the way they were getting along,

166
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,470
they seemed to be together.

167
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,860
I see.

168
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,070
It's late now. Let's sleep.

169
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,660
(Piggy Jing, what are your plans today?)

170
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,020
(What are your plans today?)

171
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,780
(Do you want to eat together?)

172
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,690
(There's a soccer match
on the campus today.)

173
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,980
(I can't go with you.)

174
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:29,780
(Tian Chi)

175
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,830
(Are you free today?)

176
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,110
(Do you want to eat together?)

177
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,620
Why are you

178
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,680
calling me on a weekend?

179
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,260
Just checking in on you.

180
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,350
Oh, since when you are so sweet?

181
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,600
It's Uncle Jing's birthday today, right?

182
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,020
You still remember?

183
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,500
Jing Xichi,

184
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,110
carrying everything alone

185
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,190
is exhausting.

186
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,020
You guys told me this before.

187
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,860
But, why can't you

188
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,740
understand this now?

189
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,710
I've been wanting to tell you,

190
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,660
don't hold it on alone.

191
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,500
We are friends.

192
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,780
Friends exist

193
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,710
to support each other.

194
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,500
Do you understand?

195
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,950
It's not that serious.

196
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,500
Don't sound so stern, okay?

197
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,470
Did something happen to you?

198
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,200
It hasn't even been that long.

199
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,700
What makes your personality change?

200
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,230
You went from a quiet top student

201
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,620
to a talkative top student.

202
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,950
I just wanted to make some changes

203
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,740
in a new environment.

204
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,200
How are things going
between you and Huan'er?

205
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,990
Anything else to say?

206
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,980
If not, I'm hanging up.

207
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,990
What a chatterbox!

208
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,230
Isn't it that you're
the one who called me?

209
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,380
(My friend organizes
a photography exhibition.)

210
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,830
(Shall we go together tonight?)

211
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,380
(Alright, let's go after class.)

212
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,230
One salad,

213
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,140
and a medium sirloin steak.

214
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:47,780
Alright.

215
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,310
(There's a soccer match today.)

216
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,040
(But, he didn't even
invite me to watch.)

217
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,190
(Is he lying to me?)

218
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,710
Huan'er,

219
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,470
I'm fine with anything.

220
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,950
A medium-well sirloin steak, please.

221
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,070
Alright.

222
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,500
Thank you.

223
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,500
Thank you.

224
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,190
The bar we're going to tonight

225
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,350
has live performances.

226
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,660
It should be fun.

227
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,900
Really? Then...

228
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,190
Who else will be there?

229
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,660
Some local bands.

230
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,660
But, the vibe there is nice.

231
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,900
You're quite sheepish.

232
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,260
Over here, we have some...

233
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,830
Your setup is very interesting.

234
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,140
Over there, we have...

235
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,260
Qi Qi!

236
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,660
You can go explore first.

237
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,660
My friend just arrived.

238
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,710
Hello, Xixi.

239
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,950
You're finally here.
I've been waiting for so long!

240
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,350
This is...

241
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:55,900
Song Cong.

242
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,860
He's my friend.

243
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,470
Hi.

244
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,110
She is Xixi,

245
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,590
from the School of Arts.

246
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,540
And,

247
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,310
most of the artworks here are hers.

248
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,780
Yours are here too.

249
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,780
Why not mention that?

250
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,190
Your artwork is also on display?

251
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,590
What do you think of this exhibition?

252
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,780
It's very interesting.

253
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,710
It's quite different
from what I imagined

254
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,220
a photography exhibition to be.

255
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,460
That's glad to hear it.

256
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,000
Qi Qi. Lulu and the others are here.

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,080
Let's go and say hi to them.

258
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,990
Sure.

259
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,380
Wait for me a while.

260
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,070
Alright.

261
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
Hello.

262
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,660
Long time no see.

263
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,020
It's been a while!

264
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,660
I go over there first.

265
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,540
Do you like Venus?

266
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,380
I was just looking

267
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,990
at the muscle structure in the photo.

268
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,500
You're here at the exhibition,

269
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,660
but you're still thinking
about the other things?

270
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,530
Do you want to go outside
for some fresh air?

271
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,350
Sure.

272
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,950
Your classmates' photography exhibition

273
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,660
is being held in such a nice place.

274
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,260
This place belongs to Xixi's family.

275
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,190
Song Cong,

276
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,900
I can tell

277
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,710
you're different from before.

278
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,710
I...

279
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,260
Are you struggling

280
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,380
with your studies?

281
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,540
You could tell?

282
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,860
Before this,

283
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,070
Li Tian once asked me a question.

284
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,470
He asked

285
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,070
if I ever experienced

286
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,260
that feeling of not being able

287
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,660
to absorb knowledge.

288
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,470
I didn't answer him.

289
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,020
I was afraid of hurting his pride.

290
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,000
Because, honestly, I had
never experienced that way.

291
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,990
But

292
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,340
now...

293
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,740
I finally understand it.

294
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,950
So,

295
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,020
now you've gone
from a highly capable top student

296
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,300
to a less capable top student,

297
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,230
and you can't accept it?

298
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,260
Not exactly.

299
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,500
It's not that I can't accept

300
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,780
being less capable than others.

301
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,630
It's just that...

302
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,710
I feel like I could be better.

303
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,820
You know,

304
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,580
sculptures

305
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,670
like Venus

306
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,780
weren't unique in ancient Greece.

307
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,190
But only this one

308
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,300
that lost its arms

309
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,910
became an unsurpassable masterpiece

310
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,190
in art history.

311
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,340
Because of its imperfections

312
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,990
that spark

313
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,260
people's imagination even more?

314
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,670
Maybe.

315
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,540
But,

316
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,390
I prefer another interpretation.

317
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,020
There is no such thing

318
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,870
as perfection in this world.

319
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,100
To be human

320
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,740
is to be flawed.

321
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,950
It's not just you.

322
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,340
Everyone is the same.

323
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,150
Oh, by the way,

324
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,780
I have something to tell you.

325
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,390
I'm transferring
to the Literature department.

326
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,540
Although I don't know

327
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,870
whether the path of literature

328
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,260
will be bright in the future,

329
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,950
I believe

330
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,260
that as long as I'm firm in my choice,

331
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,780
no matter what
difficulties I encounter,

332
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,230
nothing will stop me

333
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,060
from moving forward.

334
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,740
So, Song Cong,

335
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,950
stop overthinking.

336
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,390
Close your eyes

337
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,620
and keep moving forward,

338
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,020
you will make it through.

339
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,100
Alright.

340
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:23,910
(Piggy Jing)

341
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,280
(What time does the match start?)

342
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,580
(Have you finished playing?)

343
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,710
(Did you win?)

344
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,150
(Why haven't you replied yet?)

345
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,470
(Zhou Ye)
(Did the soccer match)

346
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,390
(end already?)

347
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,580
Is the food not to your taste?

348
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,100
No.

349
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,580
It's quite good.

350
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,060
Then, what about...

351
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,260
(Zhou Ye)

352
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,100
(There is no soccer match
on the campus today.)

353
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,460
(We're at an internet café.)

354
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,390
(Song Cong)
(Today is Uncle Jing's birthday.)

355
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,580
(Jing seems a bit down.)

356
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,800
(Do you want to go
and keep him company?)

357
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,870
What about ordering some dessert?

358
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,870
I'm sorry, Tian Chi.

359
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,340
I have something to do now.

360
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,720
I need to head back to school.

361
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:27,780
Alright.

362
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,780
I'll take you back then.

363
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,340
It's fine.

364
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,580
I can go back on my own.

365
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,300
Waiter, I want to pay the bill, please.

366
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,080
I'll pay for this.

367
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,540
Don't you have something urgent to do?

368
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,340
You should go first.

369
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:35,880
Well...

370
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,390
Next time...

371
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,520
It's my treat next time.

372
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,500
Thank you, Tian Chi.

373
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,630
Huan'er,

374
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,470
the bar stays open late.

375
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,260
If you're done with your plans,

376
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,780
come and find me.

377
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,390
Alright.

378
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,630
I'm sorry, Tian Chi.

379
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,060
I'll contact you later.

380
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,630
Alright.

381
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,300
Jing Xichi.

382
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,470
Wait there.

383
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,580
I've been calling you all day,
and you're not answering!

384
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,430
What kind of big business
do you have now?

385
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,300
I was playing soccer

386
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,390
and didn't bring my phone.

387
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,340
You don't look like
you have just played soccer.

388
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,540
Well, maybe it's just because

389
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,860
I was born naturally good-looking.

390
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:39,780
Don't pretend.

391
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,150
I can smell your shampoo.

392
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,140
What's wrong with you?

393
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,260
Are you going through a breakup?

394
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,060
A breakup?

395
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,870
Do you think I'll go through a breakup?

396
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,980
Oh yeah, now you're a star
in Computer Science Department.

397
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,260
It's different from before.

398
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,870
I'm in high demand now.

399
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,670
Exactly.

400
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,950
I even heard about

401
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,100
that pink rose incident.

402
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,580
Did someone confess to you?

403
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,390
I turned her down.

404
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,260
Why?

405
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,580
Don't you think she looks a lot

406
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,260
like our high school English teacher?

407
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,260
Does she?

408
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,710
Du Wei is quite pretty, though.

409
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm not talking about her look.

410
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,740
It's just

411
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,580
her charm.

412
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,190
She always seems all smiley,

413
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,910
but deep down, she's super serious.

414
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,390
I'm scared I'd dream

415
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,190
about her forcing me

416
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,780
to finish up an English practice set.

417
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,820
You're nuts.

418
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,870
Speaking of that,

419
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,740
why did you go for Tian Chi?

420
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,580
He seems like

421
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,540
such a boring guy.

422
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,150
I'm just trying it out.

423
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,870
You never know

424
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,150
what you like until you try.

425
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,500
If you wanted to try,

426
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,950
did it have to be him?

427
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,620
If you wanted to try
dating a top student,

428
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,760
you could've picked Song.

429
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,950
Are you out of your mind?

430
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,780
Oh, you're mad.

431
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,670
No, I'm not.

432
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,340
You're mad.

433
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm not!

434
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,430
You must be mad.

435
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,820
I brought you a lot of snacks.

436
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,230
Come on, I'm an adult now.

437
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,430
I don't eat these.

438
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,710
I got you a ton of chips!

439
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,540
Why there is no
Little Raccoon's crunchy noodles?

440
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,340
The school convenience store

441
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,430
doesn't sell them anymore.

442
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,540
The favorite restaurants close down.

443
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,540
The favorite snacks disappear.

444
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,190
Why does this happen?

445
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,150
You can try new snacks.

446
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,430
This one's really good.

447
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,390
How is it?

448
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,230
Is it good?

449
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:49,950
It's good.

450
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,390
It tastes good.

451
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,020
But, some things

452
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,230
just can't be replaced.

453
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,910
Right?

454
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,910
Yeah.

455
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,710
If you like it,

456
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,220
I'll buy you another pack next time.

457
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,230
Just one pack?

458
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,990
One pack isn't enough?

459
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,430
You're so stingy.

460
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,580
You say me stingy?

461
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,100
Remember back in high school
when we got robbed?

462
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,580
You bought only one can of Jianlibao

463
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,780
and shared it with Song Cong,

464
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,960
but you didn't let me drink.

465
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,020
Do you remember this tiny thing?

466
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,950
Of course, I do.

467
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,630
I hold grudges.

468
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,150
Do you remember the agriculture study,

469
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,150
I gave you everything I had?

470
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,060
Lies!

471
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,230
You had half of it

472
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,540
but shared it with Song Cong.

473
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,470
You forgot?

474
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:38,990
Did it?

475
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,140
You really don't remember?

476
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,870
I don't think so.

477
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,360
It did! Don't try to weasel out of it.

478
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,740
No way.

479
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,160
I swear I gave it all to you.

480
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,780
Hold this for me.

481
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,500
Oh no!

482
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,060
(Tian Chi)

483
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,430
Hello, Huan'er.

484
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,990
Sorry, are you still there?

485
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,540
Did you already come?

486
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,060
I'm sorry.

487
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,300
How about we go there another day?

488
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,300
Alright.

489
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,710
Sorry.

490
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,500
Rest early.

491
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:14,950
Alright.

492
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,390
Bye.

493
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,340
(Utopia Bar)

494
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,340
Uh...

495
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,910
I'm heading back.

496
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,540
They are about to rest now.

497
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,200
What about you?

498
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,020
I'll just stay here for a bit.

499
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,580
Bye.

500
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,190
Jing Xichi,

501
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,670
what are you doing?

502
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,060
Tian Chi,

503
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,910
why are you here?

504
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,300
Huan'er,

505
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,260
actually, today I do

506
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
have something

507
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,820
I wanted to tell you.

508
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,340
I...

509
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,780
I also have something to tell you.

510
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,870
Let me finish first.

511
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,760
I'm afraid that if I don't say it now,

512
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,230
I won't get another chance.

513
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,150
I am

514
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,020
not good with words,

515
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,990
but for some reason,

516
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,870
every time I see you,

517
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,780
I become nervous

518
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,980
which makes me unable to deliver

519
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,020
what I want to say.

520
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,100
Even when I do,

521
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,540
they never come out right.

522
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,950
So,

523
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,100
whenever we part,

524
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,230
I regret it,

525
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,870
thinking I didn't do enough.

526
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,870
I always believed

527
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,260
that feelings

528
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,470
should

529
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,710
happen naturally.

530
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,740
I think there's a long way to go.

531
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
And, as time goes,

532
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,300
the two people

533
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,640
will eventually become closer.

534
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,340
But, I realized I was wrong.

535
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,260
I know

536
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,100
there is someone very important

537
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,910
in your heart.

538
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,870
But unfortunately,

539
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,190
the person isn't me.

540
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,780
I'm sorry,

541
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,470
Tian Chi.

542
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,260
Maybe you're right.

543
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,540
Right now,

544
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,470
I really

545
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,580
can't like anyone else.

546
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:25,870
I should return

547
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
this book to you.

548
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,580
Things that don't belong to me

549
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,390
shouldn't be kept.

550
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,020
I also hope

551
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,630
you find

552
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,540
your own happiness.

553
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,470
I wish you happiness too.

554
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,710
Sincerely.

555
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,190
Then...

556
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,870
I get to go now.

557
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,150
You seem in a good mood.

558
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,260
What happened?

559
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,020
Tian Chi confessed to you?

560
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,100
Yeah.

561
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,470
You're not single anymore...

562
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,430
I turned him down.

563
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,540
I knew it.

564
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,630
Why?

565
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,020
He's such a great guy.
Why don't you like him?

566
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,340
Li said,

567
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,300
don't ever ask why you love,

568
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,950
and also why you don't.

569
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,580
Good girl.

570
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,500
What does that mean?

571
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,990
I know this one!

572
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,470
In White Horse Neighs
in the Western Wind,

573
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,670
Li Wenxiu mentions

574
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,430
they are all wonderful people.

575
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,060
But, I just

576
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,630
don't like them.

577
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,430
But, some things

578
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,100
just can't be replaced.

579
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,670
Right?

580
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,150
Yeah.

581
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,340
Come on.

582
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,340
Try this cake.

583
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,340
I specifically bought

584
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,150
two flavors.

585
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,500
Both are your favorites. Try it.

586
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,300
I tell you,

587
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,190
I knew you would

588
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,300
reject Tian Chi.

589
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,020
Why are you so sure

590
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,950
that I'd turn him down?

591
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
Think about this,

592
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,670
Song is such an outstanding guy,

593
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,540
and you already rejected him.

594
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,260
Compared to Song, Tian Chi

595
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,260
is still far away.

596
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,520
Even if you want
to fall in love so much,

597
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,020
you can't just settle for it, right?

598
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,300
Can you stop bringing up Song?

599
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,710
You're so petty.

600
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,950
I'm not petty.

601
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,470
I'm just curious.

602
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,390
You've turned down

603
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,430
two guys already.

604
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,190
So, what kind of person
do you actually like?

605
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,190
Do you have a specific description

606
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,390
of him

607
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,060
in your mind?

608
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,540
Like his hair length,

609
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,500
his personality,

610
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,230
or his...

611
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,670
Why do you even

612
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,950
want to know that?

613
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,820
I just see you single all the time,

614
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,240
and it shouldn't be like that.

615
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,390
I don't have an ideal type.

616
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,470
But, don't girls usually

617
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,910
love fantasizing about this?

618
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,230
I'm not an ordinary girl.

619
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,870
(Huan'er,)

620
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,470
(Song Cong and I are coming over )

621
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,160
(during the break
to have a trip with you.)

622
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,100
What's going on?

623
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,100
Qi Qi just told me,

624
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,950
Song Cong and her

625
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,430
are coming to visit us in a few days.

626
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,230
The two of them?

627
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,340
Yeah.

628
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,430
Coming to visit us?

629
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,000
Do you want to eat this cake?

630
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,880
If not, I'll have it.

631
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,910
You aren't curious at all.

632
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,540
Yeah.

633
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,540
The two of them...

634
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,430
Yeah, so?

635
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,990
Stop eating!

636
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,990
They've known each other
since high school.

637
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,190
And now, they're finally...

638
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,300
Aren't you curious about its flavor?

639
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,060
Not really.

640
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,280
I'll try this one instead.

641
00:32:59,430 --> 00:32:59,990
You guys

642
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,060
don't like desserts.

643
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,300
Well, I'm not an ordinary guy.

644
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,580
These are for me, aren't they?

645
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,340
Drink your coffee.

646
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,340
I'll carry it.

647
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,700
It's fine. I can carry it.

648
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,020
Song,

649
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,580
what a lame place you found!

650
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,910
It's so foggy.

651
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,820
That's just how it is in the mountain.

652
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,390
Once the sun comes up, it'll clear.

653
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,780
Later, in front of Song Cong,

654
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,020
don't mention anything
about grades or rankings.

655
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,740
From what I knew about him,

656
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,470
he's just used to being at the top.

657
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,580
He just can't bear

658
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,660
a sudden drop in grades.

659
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,150
Since love can cure everything,

660
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,300
why not we match them up to be a couple?

661
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,760
So, it takes his mind off things.

662
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,740
Wow, your little brain

663
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,820
is so smart, huh?

664
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,820
Yeah.

665
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,820
Hello, I've reserved two rooms.

666
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,880
Please wait a moment.

667
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,700
Alright. Thank you.

668
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,190
Wow, he's so handsome.

669
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,240
He's your cup of tea.

670
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,300
You too, don't you?

671
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,830
What's your relationship with him now?

672
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,620
What do you mean?

673
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,020
I saw him

674
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,580
carrying your luggage

675
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,540
so naturally.

676
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,660
I thought you two were already...

677
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,220
It's the same as before.

678
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,580
I help him, he helps me.

679
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,220
But...

680
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,020
I saw Song

681
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,220
carrying your luggage too.

682
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,660
How's that going between you two?

683
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,950
Didn't you notice?

684
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,430
He only did that
because Jing Xichi helped you first.

685
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,470
Forget about that.

686
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,940
Let's talk about something pleasant.

687
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,180
I switched my majors!
From Law to Chinese.

688
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,140
Really?

689
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,750
That's great.

690
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,060
I'm really happy now.

691
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,220
I feel like my world

692
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,540
suddenly opened up.

693
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
Maybe because

694
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,950
I opened up too.

695
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,310
So now,

696
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,950
I also want to help Song Cong

697
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,790
get out of his rut as well.

698
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,500
Really?

699
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,180
I don't think it's that simple.

700
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,430
Am I?

701
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,790
Aren't you?

702
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,750
How is everything

703
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,910
going between you and Qi Qi?

704
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,430
What do you mean?

705
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,180
Don't play fool.

706
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,350
You know what I mean.

707
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,350
I think Qi Qi

708
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,220
is different now.

709
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,020
I'm not sure about that.

710
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,990
What about you?

711
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,840
How's everything
between you and Chen Huan'er?

712
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,180
What do you mean?

713
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,500
Come on, don't pretend.

714
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,870
When are you going to confess?

715
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,820
I've known for a long time
that you like her.

716
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,160
How did you figure that out?

717
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,100
My instinct.

718
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,350
Do you mind

719
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,800
that I used to like Chen Huan'er?

720
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,180
When I first found out,

721
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,350
of course, I did.

722
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,900
But, I don't care anymore

723
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,240
because it's been so long already.

724
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,790
Do you still like her?

725
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:14,790
Are you crazy?

726
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,700
If you like her,

727
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
why don't you confess?

728
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,990
I'm afraid that if I fail,

729
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,640
we won't even be friends anymore.

730
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,440
See, didn't the two
of you just like that?

731
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,290
And, you two seldom
keep in touch after that.

732
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,540
I didn't think that far ahead back then.

733
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,660
So, you care about

734
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,720
your relationship with Chen Huan'er
more than I did.

735
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,590
Hello, your check-in is complete.

736
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,440
Thank you.

737
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,270
It's done?

738
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,180
Let's go. It's done.

739
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,430
Where's your suitcase?

740
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,790
It's there.

741
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,220
Jing Xichi.

742
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,870
Anything?

743
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:01,260
You've just done your business?

744
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,760
Go straight to the point.

745
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,910
We need to figure out a way

746
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,990
to get them to leave first.

747
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,680
So, they could spend time
with each other.

748
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,910
How is this possible?

749
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,020
Let's figure out some good ideas.

750
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,700
I've got it!

751
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,020
What are you doing?

752
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,500
I don't have time for this right now.

753
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,430
I figured out a way!

754
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,270
What way?

755
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,310
Are you crazy, Chen Huan'er?

756
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,950
Help!

757
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,660
Help!

758
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,390
Shout with me!

759
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,350
Scream!

760
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,870
You can do it on your own.

761
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,870
Shout with me!

762
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,830
Hurry!

763
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,500
What's wrong with this?

764
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,910
Why is the water so strong?

765
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,870
It's spraying everywhere!

766
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,990
- My clothes are soaked!
- Help!

767
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,910
Why is the water so strong?

768
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,580
Let me check it.

769
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,990
They're coming.

770
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,470
Faster!

771
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:04,660
Come.

772
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,580
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

773
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,750
Why are you all soaked?

774
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,950
The showerhead broke,

775
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,100
and we got sprayed all over.

776
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,620
Yeah.

777
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,950
Should we switch rooms?

778
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:17,620
No, no need.

779
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,680
Just go change your clothes.

780
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,990
I checked it out and fixed it.

781
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,310
You two can leave first.

782
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,060
We need to clean up a bit.

783
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:25,750
Yeah.

784
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,390
Um...

785
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,580
We need to change clothes
and take a shower.

786
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,310
You have fun first.

787
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:29,870
See you later.

788
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,430
Yeah, go ahead.

789
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,900
- Let me know when you're done.
- Sure.

790
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,500
See you later.

791
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,140
Let's go.

792
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,740
You go first.

793
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,400
Go ahead. Bye.

794
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,000
Go ahead.

795
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,060
Well,

796
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,470
then we leave first.

797
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,870
Yeah, let's go.

798
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,180
Chen Huan'er,

799
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,750
I just came up with a genius idea.

800
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,270
What is it?

801
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,540
Think about this,

802
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,700
when they come back later,

803
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,990
we'll find a way

804
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,180
to put them

805
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,350
in the same room.

806
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,140
Then, they'll be alone

807
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,020
together in the room.

808
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,700
The romantic atmosphere

809
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,700
is the perfect breeding ground for love.

810
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,480
What do you think?

811
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,830
Who says being

812
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,500
alone together

813
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,740
automatically leads to love?

814
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,180
Why wouldn't it?

815
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,990
Think about this,

816
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,350
people are sensitive.

817
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,180
Right?

818
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,100
The smaller the space,

819
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,060
the more they'll feel

820
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,910
each other's presence.

821
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:21,700
Am I right?

822
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,350
The best moment is...

823
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,500
when they're physically close.

824
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,430
And then, a ray of sunlight...

825
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:27,990
Don't laugh.

826
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,620
I'm serious.

827
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,220
Stop laughing.

828
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:29,830
Listen to me.

829
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,270
And then, a ray of sunlight
falls on the floor.

830
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,180
At this moment,

831
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,350
the room will

832
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,790
become very silent.

833
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,220
Neither of them

834
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,100
says a word,

835
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,060
but they are...

836
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,870
Stop laughing.

837
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,100
Be serious.

838
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,270
But, they...

839
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,700
But, they pay attention
to each other's movement.

840
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:48,830
Movement...

841
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,580
Even if there's

842
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,870
little flow in the air,

843
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,790
they'll sense it instantly.

844
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,640
And just like that,

845
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,910
the love arrives.

846
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,240
The love arrives just like that?

847
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,280
Yeah, just like that.

848
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,430
Well...

849
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,790
Since we're already here,

850
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,060
should we go out for a bit?

851
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,270
Sure.

852
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,620
I was thinking the same thing.

853
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,960
I'll go down first and wait for you.

854
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,310
I...

855
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,750
I...

856
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,870
I get to go first.

857
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,140
