Mrs. Chen.

18
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,360
- Mrs. Chen.
- Are you waiting for Huan'er?

19
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,690
Are you doing grocery shopping?

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,419
Yes.

Look at the time now.

25
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,809
What took you so long today?

26
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,730
I burned the midnight oil
to study last night.

27
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,570

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,450
Neuropsychology?

30
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,939
I think you are quite neurotic.

31
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,049
You don't know.

32
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,169
This book is earth-shattering.

33
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,050
Those who get it are fortunate.

34
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,009
What do you mean?

35
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,640
Do you know what's
the Einstellung effect?

36
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,210
Can you read something more cultured?

38
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,979
The Einstellung effect.

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,769
It's a mechanized state of mind

40
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,290
that will affect
how you act in the future.

41
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,729
Amazing.

42
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,769
You even know that.

43
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,800
As expected from the top student.

44
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,360
So what does it mean?

45
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,330
Let me show it to you.

46
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,099
Fine.

47
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,640
But do you know how to do that?

48
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,220
What are you doing?

49
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,080
Don't move.

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,240
That's painful, Chen Huan'er.

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,730
What are you doing?

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,859
What are you doing? Chen Huan'er!

53
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,490
This is the Einstellung effect.

54
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,099
In layman's terms,

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,330
it's called the predisposition.

56
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,160
You could've just told me.

57
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,120
Why did you attack me?

58
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,290
I was afraid
that you couldn't understand.

59
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,659
Young man,

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,009
you should study more.

61
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,800
Let's go.

62
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,449
Song.

63
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,770
What book did you choose?

64
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,490
The Catcher in the Rye.

65
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,450
What kind of book is that?

66
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,419
No. Chen Huan'er.

67
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,840
You just wanted to attack me, right?

68
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,539
Lin Shuang, this is for you.

69
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,080
I hope that you'll like it.

70
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,729
What can you achieve

71
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,890
with romance?

72
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,169
Don't simply spray it.

73
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,289
First, you need to find out

74
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,560
what scent the person you want

75
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,800
to give the book to like.

76
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,290
You have to get it right.

77
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,659
You should cut it out.

78
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,539
The air inside here is so polluted

79
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,689
that it's giving me rhinitis.

80
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,169
I made this scent myself.

81
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,579
I just sprayed it.

82
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,640
The after-note smells amazing.

83
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,129
You have no taste at all.

84
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,980
I don't want to have
the same taste as you.

85
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,010
You are so annoying.

86
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,010
Why are you so different from Song Cong?

87
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,019
Song Cong.

88
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,489
Do you want to decorate your book?

89
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,130
I'm just going to hand it in as it is.

90
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,129
Jing Xichi.

91
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,249
Do you have any newspaper?

92
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,840
I want to decorate my book too.

93
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,570
Thank you.

94
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,080
Does anyone need a book wrapper?

95
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,160
Give me one.

96

Is there a book you want to find?

107

Let me help you with it.

108
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,100
It's okay.

109
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,840
I just don't know which book to choose.

110
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,640
Have you made up your mind?

111
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,080
Not yet.

112
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,890
I still want to look around.

113
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,609
Are you sure that Song Cong

114
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,129
chose The Catcher in the Rye?

115
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,540
You already asked me so many times.

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
I'm sure.

117
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,779
He told me about it himself.

118
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,930
So, I'm sure.

119
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,400
By the way,

120
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,210
why do you care so much about him?

121
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,250
I'm not.

I'll choose this one. This book is huge.

You are too obsessed with studying.

137

I won't read this book.

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,859

141
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,579
You have quite a good taste.

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,369
It's perfume.

188
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,300
You don't understand.

189
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,060
You don't understand
the beauty of perfume.

190
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,680
I thought you disliked perfume.

191
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,290
Yes.

192
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,000
I just don't like the type of perfume

193
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,410
that is too overwhelming.

194
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,760
This one is different.

195
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,600
This is the smell of knowledge.

196
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,530
After smelling it, it can purify my soul

197
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,960
and resonate with my soul.

198
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,120
I'll get going now.

199
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,410
Write something
in front of the book for me.

200
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,120
Make it look sincere

201
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,409
and more cultured.

202
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,760
Make sure your writing is nice too.

203
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,480
You can write it now.

204
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,480
How attentive.

205
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,330
What should I write?

206
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,050
Let me see.

207
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,450
Find a good quote.

208
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,080
What about this?

209
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,819
This one?

210
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,120
I don't think it's good enough.

211
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,240
Then let's choose another one.

212
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,409
This one.

213
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,290
This one.

214
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,529
What do you think?

215
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,330
I think this will do.

216
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,760
Where's my Neuropsychology?

217
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,050
Where's my Neuropsychology?

218
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,939
Isn't that in your mind?

219
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,330
No.

220
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,690
I'm talking about
that amazing book of mine.

221
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,760
Maybe someone hasn't returned it.

222
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,880
Where's my Neuropsychology?

223
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,120
Isn't this Song Cong's book?

224
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,099
I don't know who took it.

225
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,530
I haven't read it.

226
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,480
You can read it now.

227
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,000
It's shameful to spy
on others' privacy...

228
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,129
(The Catcher in the Rye)

229
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,889
Make sure you marry someone

230
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,810
who laughs at the same things

231
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,120
you do...

232
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,210
Qi Qi.

233
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,760
Qi Qi.

234
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,120
What's wrong?

235
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,930
Nothing.

236
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,450
Have you found your book?

237
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,080
No.

238
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,059
It must be because
my book is too interesting.

239
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,780
So, that person
doesn't want to return it.

240
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,219
By the way,

241
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,840
what book did you choose?

242
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,530
Can I read it?

243
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,410
Go ahead.

244
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,699
(Don't give this world
to someone you despise.)

245
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,059
Thank you for showing me

246
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,129
how to be true to myself.

247
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,299
I hope that I can

248
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,330
forever be

249
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,290
on your timeline too.

250
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,249
This comment is good.

251
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,050
And the handwriting is...

252
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,570
Isn't this Song Cong's handwriting?

253
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,760
Really?

254
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,009
Yes.

255
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,699
This handwriting

256
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,040
looks exactly like the handwriting
in Song Cong's notes.

257
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,050
Show me.

258
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,290
(That time, I didn't understand)

259
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,690
(why Qi Qi would be so happy)

260
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,960
(over a short paragraph.)

261
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,819
Well.

262
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,249
After my training later,

263
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,649
I'll go to Song's house to study.

264
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,650
Bye, Huan'er.

265
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,930
Qi Qi.

266
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,360
Are you reading?

267
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,240
Bye.

268
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,009
Huan'er.

269
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,600
Are you going to study together later?

270
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,650
Can I join?

271
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,290
The tuition class that my mom
signed up for me is no good.

272
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,690
Sure. This is great.

273
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,720
Let's go.

274
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,650
Let's go.

275
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,760
Song Cong.

276
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,099
Can you lend me

277
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,680
The Catcher in the Rye that you offered

278
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,040
in the Bookcrossing Event?

279
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,280
Sure.

280
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,480
I love this book too.

281
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,099
I think

282
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,409
you can resonate very well

283
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,040
with the protagonist
of this book, right?

284
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,320
I'm coming.

285
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,369
You are here quite early today.

286
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,690
Where were you?

287
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,689
I went to buy a handbook.

288
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,850
You bought a handbook?

289
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,130
Mind your own business.

290
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,299
What did you buy? Show me.

291
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,339
- Wait.
- Show me.

292
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,169
Wait.

293
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,209
I bought this to improve my grade.

294
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,240
I can't show it to you.

295
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,200
You can buy it yourself.

296
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,250
You are so petty.

297
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,819
Fine. I won't read it.

298
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,760
- It's not that precious.
- Then don't look.

299
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,500
Qi Qi.

300
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,190
You must be tired
after all that studying.

301
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,650
I bought these chicken wings for you.

302
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,520
Eat some.

303
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,370
Continue to study hard
after eating them.

304
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,320
Thank you.

305
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,800
But

306
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,320
I think I don't need it this time.

307
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,969
I got quite a good grade this time.

308
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,060
It means that those
chicken wings actually worked.

309
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,499
If I can improve
after eating these chicken wings,

310
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,579
I want to try them too.

311
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,339
Wait.

312
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,099
What are you doing?

313
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,019
They may work on Qi Qi.

314
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,450
But they may not work on you.

315
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,689
Qi Qi.

316
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,720
Can you give me one?

317
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,850
Let's share them.

318
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,129
See?

319
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,500
Qi Qi has agreed to give me one.

320
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:45,880
Eat it.

321
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,610
Eat.

322
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,210
Qi Qi.

323
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,480
How many people

324
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,169
did you surpass this time?

325
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,480
Didn't you check?

326
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,690
Around 10 people.

327
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,090
That's good.

328
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,690
That's good.

329
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,480
What about you?

330
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,480
I failed again this time.

331
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,610
I got last place.

332
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,369
Pray for yourself.

333
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,400
There'll be
a parent-teacher conference this time.

334
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,090
A parent-teacher conference?

335
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,409
Says who?

336
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,560
Mr. Xu.

337
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,890
All of you know about that?

338
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,930
I'm doomed.

339
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,170
Here goes my new phone.

340
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,129
This is delicious.

341
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,450
Of course.

342
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,130
It costs five yuan.

343
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,370
Eat more.

344
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,370
Mom.

345
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,890
You won't attend
the parent-teacher conference, right?

346
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,040
I have a business trip tomorrow.

347
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,650
I'll inform
your homeroom teacher about it.

348
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,792
(Tianhe No.1 Middle School)

349
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:27,240
(Ranking, Name:
1: Song Cong, 291: Qi Qi)

350
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,929
My fellow parents.

351
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,969
(The Power of Youth and Progress)
Have you read the transcript?

352
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,449
We can objectively

353
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,259
check on your children's

354
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,339
(Welcome, Parents)
current learning progress.

355
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,649
Song Cong in our class

356
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,889
always

357
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,059
has good grades.

358
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,280
His performance is consistent.

359
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,689
There are also some students

360
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,800
like

361
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,969
our new student
who has just transferred here,

362
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,099
Chen Huan'er.

363
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,969
Although

364
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,819
her foundation is not as good,

365
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,320
she has been catching up lately

366
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,579
and has improved tremendously.

367
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,760
However,

368
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,240
there are a few students in our class

369
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,240
who are not doing well.

370
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,779
Their grades fluctuate

371
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,720
just like our blood pressure.

372
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,490
Based on their transcripts, you can tell

373
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,649
how naughty they are usually.

374
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,019
Don't think that sending your children

375
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,449
to school will solve everything.

376
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,969
Don't just count on

377
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,960
the teachers to educate them.

378
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,409
You have to supervise them

379
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,090
at home too.

380
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,370
Jing Xichi's mom.

381
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,240
What do you think?

382
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,720
Mr. Xu.

383
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,099
I think it's quite normal

384
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,499
that their examination results

385
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,000
fluctuate from time to time.

386
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,859
Although Li Tian

387
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,040
doesn't have that issue.

388
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,969
He has done quite well this time.

389
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,800
How about I share with everyone

390
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,579
how we did it?

391
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,210
Okay. Please go ahead.

392
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,339
Actually,

393
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,369
I think

394
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,019
when it comes to educating our children,

395
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,040
we have to be
supportive and encouraging.

396
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,369
It's very important to pay attention

397
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,640
to their mental well-being.

398
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,930
We cannot break their confidence.

399
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,929
Li Tian has always been proactive

400
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,099
when it comes to his studies.

401
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,090
I'm really thankful to you today.

402
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,170
Just now, my mind was blank.

403
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,889
I would be the same too if I were you.

404
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,739
I can't believe their homeroom teacher.

405
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,259
How could he be so callous?

406
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,129
Moreover,

407
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,819
this kind of ranking is problematic too.

408
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,889
In my opinion,

409
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,019
they should do this in private.

410
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,779
By exposing
everyone's results like this,

411
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,650
it's like a public trial.

412
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,370
Actually, the teachers
are doing it for the students.

413
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,300
There's a reason
that they have this ranking.

414
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,120
I can only blame

415
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,250
my son for being too bad at his studies.

416
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,169
I'll teach him a lesson when I go back.

417
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,240
I feel so embarrassed today.

418
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,610
You can't be like this.

419
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,819
No matter what, he is your son.

420
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,339
Your child will never look down on you.

421
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,299
So, you shouldn't look down on him too.

422
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,579
Li Tian only got

423
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,819
second place this time.

424
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,170
But what can I say?

425
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,040
Is getting second place
not good enough?

426
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,520
Oh, yes.

427
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,019
Dr. Li comes from a family of doctors.

428
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,320
So, it's expected of him.

429
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,610
Yes.

430
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,369
Getting second place

431
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,859
is like failing
the imperial examination.

432
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,969
Dr. Li wants me

433
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,609
to organize a family meeting

434
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,130
to come up with a solution.

435
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,099
If it wasn't

436
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,889
for Dr. Li's reputation,

437
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,019
I wouldn't ask him

438
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,320
to study so hard.

439
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,560
Yes.

440
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,480
It's not easy for you too.

441
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,610
Let's go.

442
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,720
I'll get going now. Bye.

443
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,560
What are you doing?

444
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,499
You bought me milk tea

445
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,960
and strolled around with me.

446
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,560
Huan'er.

447
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,320
I treat you fairly well.

448
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,650
Right?

449
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,090
Are you sure?

450
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,779
I bought

451
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,370
chicken wings for you yesterday, right?

452
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,059
Did you buy them for me?

453
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,020
Did you eat it or not?

454
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,090
I just ate

455
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,969
a wingtip.

456
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,980
What about the milk tea?

457
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,099
I treated you

458
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,129
twice.

459
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,610
Shouldn't you

460
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,040
do me a favor?

461
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,280
What do you need?

462
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,240
You don't have to do anything.

463
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,760
You just have to come with me

464
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,210
and leave everything to me.

465
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,099
Anyway, my life

466
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,560
is in your hands now.

467
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,040
No.

468
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,259
Chen Huan'er.

469
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,339
Just give me a hand.

470
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,929
I want to go home.

471
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,689
Your home is just nearby.

472
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,779
Let's go.

473
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,859
Huan'er, help me.

474
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,019
I really need your help.

475
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,099
What are you doing?

476
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,579
Hurry up.

477
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,259
I will

478
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,129
send you home later.

479
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:13,779
Mom.

480
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,300
Don't worry.

481
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,450
Mom.

482
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,090
Let's go.

483
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,360
(Transcript)

484
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,819
Jing Xichi.

485
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,890
How dare you come back.

486
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,960
You...

487
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,090
You are here too, Huan'er.

488
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,130
Aunt Lin.

489
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,499
I don't understand.

490
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,099
How could you score so badly?

491
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,739
Studying is easy.

492
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,889
You just have to study.

493
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,369
You...

494
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,720
How did you get this result?

495
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,330
Tell me.

496
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,520
I'm sorry, Mom.

497
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm an unfilial child.

498
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,410
I've embarrassed you.

499
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,609
But look.

500
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,819
I brought Huan'er over

501
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,299
to help me with my studies.

502
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,240
I want to study hard too.

503
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,969
We'll get back to studying now.

504
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,930
We have to study now.

505
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,980
- I...
- Let's go and start studying.

506
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,800
What are we studying?

507
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,800
We'll study now.

508
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,240
Have a seat.

509
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,760
Why did you bring me to your house?

510
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,609
Isn't it obvious?

511
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,720
To help me with my studies.

512
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,579
I didn't do well in the exam this time.

513
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,000
But I need to placate my mom.

514
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,129
If I ask Song,

515
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,930
he'll be very serious about it.

516
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,339
But I don't expect you
to teach me anything.

517
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,000
You can just do your homework here.

518
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,339
Are you looking down on me?

519
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,040
I'm more than
capable enough to tutor you.

520
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,450
What is this?

521
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:16,059
You left this political history
question blank.

522
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,320
I'll take it that you were lazy

523
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,490
and didn't memorize it.

524
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,059
But what about the physical chemistry

525
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,690
comprehensive questions?

526
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,209
They were asking the same thing.

527
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,880
You could answer
the objective questions.

528
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,790
But you couldn't answer
the subjective questions?

529
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,920
I don't believe that you'd be so foolish
not to realize that they were the same.

530
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,370
I am foolish.

531
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,969
Why did you get bad grades on purpose?

532
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,929
Chen Huan'er.

533
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,129
Tutor me if you can.

534
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,220
But don't blame me
for your failure in tutoring me.

535
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,320
Aunt Lin.

536
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,579
Aunt Lin.

537
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,930
Chen Huan'er.

538
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,010
Hurry up and come back.

539
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,779
What are you doing?

540
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,240
Why are you so nervous?

541
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,850
Why are you so nervous?

542
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,720
Actually, it was like this.

543
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,800
I just randomly picked the answers
for the objective questions.

544
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,850
I was just lucky
to get the answers right.

545
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,260
Are you not going to tell me the truth?

546
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,259
Aunt Lin.

547
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,370
Chen Huan'er.

548
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,170
I

549
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,210
don't want

550
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,170
to get better grades than Qi Qi.

551
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,370
Don't tell Qi Qi about it.

552
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,800
Don't tell anyone about it.

553
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,090
Promise me.

554
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,320
That's more like it.

555
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,560
Do your homework.

556
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,739
(Although Jing Xichi)

557
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,930
(has told me his secret,)

558
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,240
(I don't know)

559
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,000
(why my heart feels heavy.)

560
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,409
(It seems like)

561
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,890
(everyone's relationship
has become complicated.)

562
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,690
(Sometimes,)

563
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,210

Neuropsychology.

566
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,210
Huan'er.

567
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,520
Are you looking for a book?

568
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,209
I still can't find the book

569
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,739
I offered in the Bookcrossing Event.

570
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,299
By the way,

571
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,059
the name of my book is Neuropsychology.

572
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,819
Have you seen it?

573
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,499
I looked around

574
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,090
to see what everyone took.

575
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,369
But I didn't see yours.

576
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,410
Did someone from another class take it?

577
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,890
Is that so?

578
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,209
(The Catcher in the Rye)

579
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,090
The Catcher in the Rye.

580
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,099
Did you offer this book too?

581
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,040
Yes.

582
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,299
I saw

583
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,019
someone offered the same book.

584
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,450
So, I chose that person's book too.

585
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,520
I wonder

586
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,410
if he chose mine too.

587
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,609
But you already have this book.

588
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,090
Why did you choose the same book?

589
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,610
The content of the book
is not important.

590
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,210
What matters is choosing the same book

591
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,409
or having that person

592
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,170
choose your book.

593
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,689
How do I explain it?

594
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,369
Although talking about fate is tacky,

595
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,930
don't you think it's precious

596
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,040
when the probability is so low?

597
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,650
(I only understood vaguely)

598
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,850
(what Xinyan said.)

599
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,450
(I only understand those words)

600
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,539
(after many years.)

601
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,420
(Remember what you should.)

602
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,930
(Maybe the encounter on that very page)

603
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,890

that we can be with each other.)

612
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,170
Which book did you offer
in the Bookcrossing Event?

613
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,499
I didn't offer any books.

614
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,649
With how poor I am,

615
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,850
what book can I offer?

616
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,539
Then why did you go to the library?

617
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,930
I was just helping Song out.

Qi Qi.

619
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,609
What book did you offer?

620
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,860
It's called The Fountainhead.

621
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,240
It's my favorite novel.

622
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,640
I purposely bought this secret handbook
to improve my grade.

623
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,780
I can't just show it to you.

624
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
(You can buy it yourself.)

625
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,770
(You are so petty.)

626
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,650
(Fine. I won't read it.)

627
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,720
Xinyan, come forward.

628
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,920
Distribute these
science or art stream application forms

629
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,780
to your classmates.

630
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,440
Okay.

631
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,330
Students.

632
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,259
After you get

633
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,019
your science
or art stream application form,

634
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,369
go back and discuss it

635
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,499
with your parents.

636
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,889
It will affect

637
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,450
your selection of majors
in the college entrance examination

638
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,930
and also your future career.

639
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,209
If there's anything
you don't understand,

640
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,000
you can come to me.

641
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,560

642
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,499
Song Cong.

643
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,600
You and Xichi
will choose the science stream, right?

644
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,080
We will both choose the science stream.

645
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,520
Huan'er.

646
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,040
What stream do you want to choose?

647
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,390
It's obvious that I'll do better
in the science stream.

648
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,880
So, I'll choose the science stream.

649
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,520
I will choose the science stream too.

650
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,090
My grades for the science subjects
this time are not bad.

651
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:50,779
That way,

652
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,450
we won't be separated.

653
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,720
Don't you have to discuss it
with your mom?

654
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,210
It's fine.

655
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,579
I can imitate my mom's signature

656
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,650
very well.

657
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,409
Are you sure?

658
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,440
Imitating her signature
is not the safest option.

659
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,720
The safest option is to sign it yourself
right from the beginning.

660
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,610
That's enough.

661
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,819
How dare you say something

662
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,170
so treacherous.

663
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,219
Don't influence

664
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,920
my kind and pure Huan'er.

665
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,720

I was studying just now.

678
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,880
I know your class will be split into
art stream and science stream soon.

679
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,880
I've already signed it
with your homeroom teacher.

680
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,090
You'll go into the art stream.

681
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,970
Mom.

682
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,489
There are more science majors
in the universities.

683
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,020
And I can go to a better university

684
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,650
if I enter the science stream.

685
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,610
It doesn't make sense.

686
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,299
If you can't do well,

687
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,010
you can't enter a good university
no matter what stream you are in.

688
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,610
Objectively speaking,
the science stream is not for you.

689
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,489
Besides, you like writing

690
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,840
and want to be an author, right?

691
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,299
Are you asking me to take the art stream

692
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,280
so that I can be an author?

693
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,219
You just want me to be a lawyer

694
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,360
like you.

695
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,859
All of your friends

696
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,280
chose the science stream, right?

697
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,720
Let me tell you.

698
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,139
This is not about loyalty.

699
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,170
You are not taking
your future seriously.

700
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,449
Your friends
are just passers-by in your life.

701
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,650
They are not responsible for your life.

702
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,049
Changing your life direction for them

703
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,480
is just your own wishful thinking.

704
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,529
I can be responsible
for my own wishful thinking.

705
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,530
How are you going to do that?

706
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,650
I...

707
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,049
You are my daughter.

708
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,970
That's why I'm saying these to you.

709
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,360
Back then, you said that private schools
were not good.

710
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,700
So, I sent you to a public school.

711
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,460
You said the experimental
high school was bad,

712
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,400
so I sent you to Tianhe.

713
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,660
I will not tolerate you anymore.

714
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,420
If you want to throw
a tantrum like a child

715
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,800
because of this steam selection,

716
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,400
I'll send you to study abroad at once.

717
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,529
You can go abroad.

718
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,000
You can attend their high school.

719
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,920
Then you won't choose
the art or science stream.

720
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,840
Fine.

721
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,720
Can I

722
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,259
invite my classmates

723
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,240
to our house for my birthday?

724
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,280
Just for a meal.

725
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,440
It won't affect my studies.

726
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,440
You can celebrate it this Sunday.

727
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,339
You have a tuition class on Friday

728
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,840
and a piano class on Saturday.

729
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,369
But my birthday is on Friday.

730
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,449
As long as you get to celebrate it.

731
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,760
You don't have
to celebrate it on the day itself.

732
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,170
You have more time on Sunday.

733
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,009
That's it.

734
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:23,529
Drink it.

735
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,440
It's getting cold.

736
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,009
Mom.

737
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,570
I'll choose the science stream.

(Science or Art Stream Application Form:

743
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,960
It's better for us who chose
the art stream to get ready in advance.

744
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,880
Is it based on the result
of our year-end exam

745
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,200
or will there be another exam?

746
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,619
Will there be only one row

747
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,800
of art stream students?

748
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,440
Are you choosing the art stream?

749
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,569
For those who chose the art stream,

750
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,240
you better think twice.

751
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,489
If you take the art stream,

752
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,170
there will be fewer options for you.

753
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,619
It may sound harsh,

754
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,929
but people choose the art stream

755
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,179
because the science stream
is too hard for them.

756
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,490
Little Four-Eye.

757
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,320
People can choose whatever they want.

758
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,050
Who are you to judge?

759
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,129
Should we record it again?

760
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,520
I think I smiled too widely just now.

761
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,040
It's fine.

762
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,090
Everyone looks awkward
in front of the camera.

763
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,619
Qi Qi.

764
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,779
It's your birthday this week.

765
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,300
How are you going to celebrate it?

766
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,460
I have a tuition class
on the day of my birthday.

767
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,460
So, I won't celebrate it.

768
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,569
Enough.

769
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,659
Stop talking.

770
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,800
Selecting the art stream
or the science stream is just

771
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,720
to give you a clearer direction
for your future.

772
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,779
You'll still be in the same school

773
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,680
where you can see each other every day.

774
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,920
Now,

775
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,360
take out your textbook.

776
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,280
Turn to page 75.

777
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,520
(Science or Art Stream Application Form:
Qi Qi: Science Stream)

778
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,800
(Although the teacher is right,)

779
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,219
(when it comes to selecting
the art or science stream,)

780
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,970
(the choice is not as important)

781
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,650
(when all we can think about)

782
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,970
(is separation.)

783
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,570
(The separation comes so quickly)

784
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,690
(that I can't even process it)

785
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,760
(because it has happened too fast.)

786
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,570
(It feels unreal to me.)

787
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,400
My fellow students.

788
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,650
That's it for this term.

789
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,360
Go back and get ready for
your year-end examination.

790
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,369
Xinyan.

791
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,280
Stay back to arrange
the examination room later.

792
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,619
Please give me a moment.

793
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,090
Stop packing.

794
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,360
The school has asked us to play a video.

795
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,210
Qi Qi.

796
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,760
We haven't really talked
to each other much.

797
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,320
But it's not because you are aloof.

798
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,699
It's because we don't know much

799
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,210
about the books you read

800
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,280
or the authors you mention.

801
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,880
But whenever I read your essays,

802
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,880
I think they are so well-written.

803
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,009
I hope you can become an author soon

804
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,210
to make your dream come true.

805
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,690
Qi Qi.

806
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,819
Happy birthday.

807
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,920
All the best.

808
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,559
Should we record it again?

809
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,980
I think I smiled too widely just now.

810
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,610
It's fine.

811
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,889
Actually, I always think

812
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,610
that you are the belle of our class.

813
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,760
What are you talking about?

814
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,200
This is a video for her birthday.

815
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,620
It's not for you to confess to her.

816
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,400
Qi Qi.

817
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,299
I wish you...

818
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,840
A happy birthday!

819
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,840
Qi Qi.

820
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,889
Do you still remember

821
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,690
that you spoke up

822
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,409
during sports day?

823
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,400
You gave everyone a shock.

824
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,650
We never thought

825
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,690
that you would say something like that.

826
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,570
Qi Qi.

827
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,779
Actually, you are a warm person.

828
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,650
You just need someone
to approach you first.

829
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,699
You are not as aloof or arrogant

830
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,929
as you look.

831
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,089
I hope

832
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,969
that Qi Qi and Huan'er

833
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,800
can be friends forever.

834
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:50,440
Qi Qi,

835
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,619
may you overcome all obstacles

836
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,760
and become the person you dream to be.

837
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,400
All the best.

838
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,400
Happy birthday.

839
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,739
This may be the last time

840
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,280
you see us art students on camera.

841
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,400
Yes.

842
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,130
So, don't be angry, Qi Qi.

843
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,339
Although

844
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,009
we haven't talked much,

845
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,440
we'll always be classmates.

846
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,619
Okay. Say happy birthday now.

847
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,260
The main thing here is her birthday.

848
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,250
Happy birthday, Qi Qi!

849
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,090
Happy birthday!

850
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,049
Hello, Qi Qi.

851
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,139
Happy birthday.

852
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,049
May you have
a joyous birthday every year.

853
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,049
Happy birthday, Qi Qi.

854
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,049
Happy birthday, Qi Qi.

855
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,090
Happy birthday.

856
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,130
Happy birthday.

857
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,080
Happy birthday.

858
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,760
Happy birthday.

859
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,160
Happy birthday.

860
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,530
Happy birthday. We love you.

861
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:47,920
Three.

862
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:48,690
Two.

863
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:49,610
One.

864
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,720
Happy birthday!

865
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,210
Thank you, everyone.

866
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,619
This is the most meaningful birthday

867
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,920
that I've ever had.

868
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,610
For those who will go to the art stream,

869
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,320
we won't get to meet each other
as often after this.

870
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,210
But I still want to say this to you.

871
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,530
Come back and visit us often.

872
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,089
The door of Class 5
will always welcome you.

873
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,920
Class 5 will always be here!

874
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,570
Class 5.

875
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,720
What are you doing?

876
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,440
Turn off the projector now.

877
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,610
