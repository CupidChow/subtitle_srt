1
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:20,040


2
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,750
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,180
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,850
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,200
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,170
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,260
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,660
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,450
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver.  ♫

15
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,160
   

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,080
   
   

17
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,990
Cong!

18
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,290
What's on your mind?

19
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,860
Huan Er is right.

20
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,140
This is not the life I want.

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,090
I'm not exactly enjoying the international program.

22
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,432
Cong.

23
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:35,840
Why do you care so much about what Chen Huan Er said?

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,430
- Why? 
 - Don't skip your physical training.

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,299
- Dad. 
 - When you shoot for the goal,

26
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,710
the ball is too slow.

27
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,370
- Hello, Uncle Jing. 
 - Hey there, Song Cong.

28
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,957
- What brings you here? 
 - Why wouldn't I be here?

29
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:50,557
You're barely at home.

30
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:52,517
Your shoes are always covered in dirt and grass.

31
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:54,787
I'm not a fool.

32
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:58,167
Does Mom know too?

33
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,557
What? Is she your concern?

34
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:02,557
I'm standing right here. Aren't you concerned?

35
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,047
You misunderstood.

36
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:09,237
All I want to say is that your senses are so sharp that maybe you could help me out...

37
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:11,560
Fine. Enough about that.

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,557
Why did you sneak out to play football at night?

39
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:15,987
What's the matter? Why not train with your school's team?

40
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,167
That's not it. Their level is too low for me.

41
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,927
I'm aiming to go professional.

42
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:24,287
Training with them is like playing with children.

43
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:28,887
When I was young, I had the same ambition.

44
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:30,357
I had my idols.

45
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:33,837
Maradona and Baggio were my idols.

46
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:39,207
But when it comes to football, it depends on your talent and fate.

47
00:03:39,207 --> 00:03:41,557
I think you're doing great for now.

48
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,007
It's a great hobby.

49
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:44,397
Dad!

50
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:46,397
You sound just like Mom!

51
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:49,357
You two went through the trouble of finding me a coach.

52
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:51,897
You sent me to training every time.

53
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:54,900
Why are you treating it like a hobby?

54
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,837
You're unbelievable.

55
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,207
Song Cong, take a seat.

56
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:01,537
You, come with me.

57
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:12,707
If you can hit this bottle with every kick, you'll be close to being a professional.

58
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,077
Come on.

59
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:26,197
You're not even close. Again.

60
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:27,407
It's fine.

61
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:28,927
It's only my first kick.

62
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:31,827
If I kick a thousand times, I'll definitely hit it.

63
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:37,857
 Why did you transfer to a different class? 

64
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,237
For personal reasons.

65
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,967
Personal reasons?

66
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,847
How personal are we talking?

67
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:48,317
Is it so personal that your parents don't even know?

68
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:50,337
They know.

69
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:54,187
Then let me ask you something.

70
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:58,119
So many outstanding students are trying to get a spot in our class.

71
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:00,757
Some even cried and begged to get in.

72
00:05:00,757 --> 00:05:03,336
But I've never seen one who wanted to leave.

73
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:07,877
Song Cong, why wouldn't you stay in this class?

74
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:11,407
I've made up my mind.

75
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:13,317
I hope you'll approve my request.

76
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:17,467
Thanks, sir.

77
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,660
Unbelievable...

78
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,487
Song Cong?

79
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:37,967
What's wrong? Is it something exciting?

80
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,407
I see. You won first place.

81
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,287
Congratulations.

82
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:44,167
It's not that.

83
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:47,847
Congratulations. Your essay was selected as the best.

84
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,507
I should get going.

85
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,437
 Qi Qi. 

86
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:16,557
 In the exam, the essay isn't a showcase of your writing style. 

87
00:06:16,557 --> 00:06:18,527
You need to score points.

88
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:21,507
I want you to redo the essay.

89
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:27,677
   

90
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:30,267
Can I read the essay?

91
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,827
Didn't you hear the teacher?

92
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:40,777
It didn't match the prompt.

93
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,537
I must redo it.

94
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:45,707
So what?

95
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:48,597
I trust my own judgment.

96
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:58,797
 Song Cong's words helped me understand the joy of being understood. 

97
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:02,527
 I believe it's like a force of attraction. Like magnets. 

98
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:06,527
 Someday, I'll get the response I long for. 

99
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:23,537
- Mom and Dad. 
 - Welcome home.

100
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:32,287
Song Cong.

101
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:34,147
We need to talk.

102
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:46,777
Your homeroom teacher just called.

103
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:48,967
He said you're transferring classes.

104
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:51,407
Why didn't you tell me?

105
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:58,147
You're both already so busy.

106
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:00,487
I didn't want to worry you.

107
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:03,847
Besides, I think I can handle it.

108
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:05,557
It's not that serious.

109
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,927
How is this not serious?

110
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,387
Then what counts as serious?

111
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,317
Why the class transfer?

112
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:18,647
You even lied by saying we knew about it.

113
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:22,117
Actually, if that's his wish, so be it.

114
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,847
He doesn't have to study abroad.

115
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:27,920
Song Hang, stop trying to smooth things over.

116
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,677
The international class and studying abroad were all matters we discussed.

117
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,197
We planned it all. Why are you changing your mind?

118
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:40,747
You went as far as getting a class transfer behind our back!

119
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:44,127
Song Cong, you were always so obedient as a kid.

120
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:46,717
- Why have you— 
 - I've grown up.

121
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,417
Mom...

122
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,077
I thought it through.

123
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:55,477
I don't want to be in the class or go to an elite university.

124
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:57,647
We're not a rich family anyway.

125
00:08:57,647 --> 00:09:01,697
You shouldn't live so frugally only to send me overseas.

126
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:05,167
Besides, the local universities are just as great.

127
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:08,197
If I stay, I can definitely get into the best schools.

128
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:10,607
I won't embarrass you.

129
00:09:11,657 --> 00:09:13,437
Embarrass me?

130
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:18,247
Do you take me for Li Tian's parents?

131
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:23,497
Am I pushing you to study abroad just to show off?

132
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:27,707
You underestimate your mother.

133
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:33,377
I'm not highly educated, but I've been through hardships!

134
00:09:33,377 --> 00:09:39,167
Ever since you were born, I vowed never to let you suffer the same fate as me.

135
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:43,597
Since you were little, I did all the research. I just wanted you to be

136
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:48,927
- better than everyone else. 
 - I know. I know that, Mom. I understand.

137
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:53,127
You've always put me first. I'm aware of that.

138
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,037
Even when you...

139
00:09:55,797 --> 00:10:00,007
Walnuts are your favorite snack, but you gave them all to me, saying they were good for my brain.

140
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:02,997
Do I look like I need more brainpower, Mom?

141
00:10:04,057 --> 00:10:06,767
I know how much you've sacrificed for me,

142
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:11,897
so I study so hard every day and follow every step you say.

143
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:15,717
But you never asked me what life I want or what my ambition is.

144
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:17,507
Did I not ask you?

145
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:19,927
Did I not?

146
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:22,077
Every time I asked, you were like Dad.

147
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:25,087
Your answer was always "whatever."

148
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:27,837
Fine, forget that I ever asked. Tell me now.

149
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:31,917
What do you like? What don't you like? Tell me.

150
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,837
Say it!

151
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:37,237
I don't like walnuts.

152
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:50,367
I want to be like everyone else.

153
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:53,147
Sometimes, I really envy Xi Chi.

154
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:58,597
I envy him when he jokes around with his friends.

155
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:00,657
He can go home after school.

156
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:03,057
He can join extracurricular activities.

157
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:08,007
You and Dad may not believe me, but that's how I feel.

158
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:11,577
My son, we...

159
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:14,927
- We never knew you felt that way— 
 - Please, Mom and Dad.

160
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:20,310
I didn't make this decision on a whim. I've already figured out what I want to study.

161
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:23,297
What might that be?

162
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:26,227
Tell me. What major is that?

163
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:33,417
I'm giving you a chance. Why aren't you telling me?

164
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:38,887
Fine, Song Cong.

165
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:41,627
You are not being honest with us.

166
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:46,717
I didn't believe it when they said raising a kid brings suffering.

167
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:50,297
I never believed my son would be like that.

168
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:52,877
But I know I'm wrong now.

169
00:11:55,897 --> 00:11:58,407
You don't like walnuts?

170
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:01,147
Why didn't you tell me?

171
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:04,817
I did everything for you.

172
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:07,797
I did it all for your sake.

173
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:11,037
- Have I not done everything for you? 
 - Mom!

174
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:18,127
If you keep acting like this, how are you any different from Li Tian's mom?

175
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:21,827
Song Cong!

176
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:35,317
You want to quit?

177
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:36,477
- Hao Mei! 
 - Fine.

178
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:38,680
- Get rid of these. Save us some space. 
 - Mom!

179
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,837
- You don't need these! 
 - What is that for?

180
00:12:40,837 --> 00:12:41,987
- Calm down. 
 - Move aside!

181
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:45,307
Hao Mei! Just calm down.

182
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,537
Hold on.

183
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:07,440
Did I hear that right?

184
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,840
Where are you going?

185
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,267
I said I'm joining the regular class.

186
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,587
I told them about it.

187
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,297
Wait, have you lost your mind? Why would you want to be regular?

188
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:24,527
I wanted to talk it out with them.

189
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:28,287
I wanted to go to the Medical School at Yenching University.

190
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:31,617
But if I told them that...

191
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:36,124
It's best not to say it now.

192
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:40,057
My goodness...

193
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,470
So you're basically sitting on another bombshell?

194
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,107
Wait.

195
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:54,647
I think you must not tell them about the medical school.

196
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:57,737
Your Mom always says she doesn't want you to have a tough life like your Dad,

197
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,287
who's barely at home.

198
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:01,467
And the class transfer.

199
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,657
Forget it.

200
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:05,677
We all know how thrilled your mom was when you got the spot.

201
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:08,177
Not just her, even I am worried about you.

202
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:10,927
You asked me how I can be happy.

203
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,497
The answer is to get transferred.

204
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:19,287
I never thought your words could carry such weight.

205
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:20,597
Impressive.

206
00:14:20,597 --> 00:14:21,747
Me?

207
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:22,887
Who else?

208
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:24,417
But...

209
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:28,897
How about this?

210
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:30,247
Be my witness.

211
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:33,317
I tried talking him out of this, right?

212
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:36,937
Fine. In that case, I welcome you to the

213
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:40,200
"Not Supported by Parents but Still Staying True to Ourselves" Support Group.

214
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,197
We've waited for you for too long.

215
00:14:43,197 --> 00:14:44,677
Wait a second.

216
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:48,657
Cong, are you really going against your own parents?

217
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:49,717
Yeah.

218
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:51,177
We're the masters of our lives.

219
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:53,977
We can't let our parents decide for us.

220
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:57,227
Xi Chi is right.

221
00:14:57,227 --> 00:15:00,827
Huan Er, you must have your own ambition.

222
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:03,677
Me?

223
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:08,177
I haven't even decided if I should be in the art or science stream.

224
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:18,127
My dad asked me to have dinner at the noodle shop.

225
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,807
We didn't get to eat anything just now.

226
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,227
Aunt Hao must be fuming.

227
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:25,347
She didn't make you dinner. Go on.

228
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:26,947
See you around.

229
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:36,407
A stalemate with parents can't go on forever.

230
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:37,927
Indeed.

231
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,027
We need a plan.

232
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:41,767
But you said—

233
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:46,017
He was so upset. I had to say things that would please him.

234
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:48,647
You have a point.

235
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:52,467
If the stalemate worsens, he'll never get transferred.

236
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:56,467
We need to find a way to smooth things over.

237
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:05,127
Since Aunt Hao is impossible to convince, we can take a detour.

238
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:06,927
I'll try my luck with Uncle Song.

239
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:08,507
Talk to Cong when you have time.

240
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:10,127
Me? It won't work.

241
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,887
You must try. You're the cause of this mess.

242
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,247
Me?

243
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,437
You heard him.

244
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:19,277
You somehow inspired him. A random comment ended up changing everything.

245
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:22,887
Therefore, Comrade Huan Er,

246
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:26,527
you must complete the mission of assisting Comrade Song Cong.

247
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,137
Thank you.

248
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:33,627
The family will fall apart without me.

249
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:37,797
What do I do...

250
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,280
   

251
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,030
   

252
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:52,717
Come in.

253
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,077
- Xi Chi? 
 - Uncle Song.

254
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:55,957
- Are you busy now? 
 - No.

255
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,597
I came to have a little chat.

256
00:16:57,597 --> 00:17:00,927
- About your leg? 
 - No, not about that.

257
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:04,607
Here's the story, Uncle Song.

258
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,997
I have a teammate who recently injured his leg.

259
00:17:07,997 --> 00:17:10,927
His mom told him to stop playing football.

260
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,167
But his dad?

261
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,887
A different story.

262
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:20,327
His dad thinks that kid's happiness should come first.

263
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:23,897
Don't you agree with that?

264
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,154
First, I need to know the specifics of his injury.

265
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:29,847
Uncle Song!

266
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,437
That is not the point.

267
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:36,287
The point is that he had a fight with his own parents.

268
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:41,477
I can't help but feel pity.

269
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,647
My dad has always supported my dream.

270
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,427
I thought to myself,

271
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:53,667
if my teammate's family were the same, there'd be nothing to argue about, right?

272
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,667
You too, Uncle Song.

273
00:17:55,667 --> 00:18:01,897
You always upheld your dream of becoming a doctor and achieved great things.

274
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:04,987
Right?

275
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:07,887
Speaking of that, I have questions for you too.

276
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,127
Go ahead.

277
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:14,817
Have you gone to Dr. Zheng for acupuncture lately?

278
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:16,997
No.

279
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:20,647
- Nope. 
 - We were roommates back in university.

280
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:23,857
He told me everything about your situation.

281
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:25,997
I'm warning you.

282
00:18:25,997 --> 00:18:31,467
If you don't take care of that old injury, you're going to suffer later.

283
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,507
Come to me from now on.

284
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:36,127
You'd go somewhere else instead of the hospital?

285
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:39,567
What, trying to make me look like a bad doctor?

286
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,277
No. It's not what I meant.

287
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:45,277
Since you're here, get an X-ray.

288
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,957
Uncle Song, my mom must never find out.

289
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:57,617
Just go.

290
00:18:57,617 --> 00:18:59,517
Thanks, Uncle Song.

291
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:27,427
 Coming. 

292
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:33,037
- Cong. 
 - Huan Er?

293
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:36,277
I brought you the books.

294
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:42,227
Are you having dinner?

295
00:19:42,227 --> 00:19:45,717
I was going to ask you to dinner later.

296
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,957
Well, join me.

297
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:50,657
Okay.

298
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,757
You're a food expert.

299
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:58,607
You even have your own set of tools.

300
00:19:58,607 --> 00:20:00,477
Practice makes perfect.

301
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:02,687
My mom makes it for me all the time.

302
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:11,127
Cong, Aunt Hao has done so much for you.

303
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:15,567
I know you care about Aunt Hao.

304
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:23,677
As your friend, you have my full support in transferring to a regular class.

305
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:29,927
But to truly resolve this situation, you must communicate with your parents.

306
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:31,387
Right?

307
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:34,757
I understand the logic.

308
00:20:34,757 --> 00:20:37,037
But my mom is...

309
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:44,567
Anyway, I'll think about it.

310
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:48,707
At least wait until she calms down.

311
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,057
Okay.

312
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:52,340
As long as you talk to her.

313
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,127
If you need any help, feel free to ask.

314
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:57,517
Jing Xi Chi and I will come to your rescue.

315
00:20:57,517 --> 00:21:00,347
Nothing can stop the two of us.

316
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:08,857
Hello, Aunt Lin.

317
00:21:12,057 --> 00:21:14,757
Yeah, we were just studying together.

318
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:18,097
Xi Chi should be home soon.

319
00:21:18,097 --> 00:21:19,717
All right.

320
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:24,077
Sure. Bye, Aunt Lin.

321
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:32,277
A genius indeed.

322
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:35,367
Even your lie is genius.

323
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:38,127
Is Jing Xi Chi playing football again?

324
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:39,817
Definitely.

325
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:41,927
He does extra training every weekend.

326
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:46,757
If his mom ever finds out, he's in for some pain.

327
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:50,217
But why is Aunt Lin against him going professional?

328
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,767
Because it's tough.

329
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:57,297
Everyone wants to get into the top schools.

330
00:21:57,297 --> 00:22:01,677
But going professional is so much harder,

331
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:05,627
especially since he was injured before.

332
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:14,717
In his own words, "If you love something,

333
00:22:14,717 --> 00:22:18,867
you'll accept it to hurt you and never regret it."

334
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:25,537
It's hard to believe he'd actually say that.

335
00:22:27,987 --> 00:22:30,777
He's not as worthless as you think.

336
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:34,137
Sometimes I think his mind is more brilliant than mine.

337
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:38,927
I only do things I know I can manage.

338
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:44,137
However, when I saw how Xi Chi told his dad he wanted to go professional...

339
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:45,577
 Come on, give me another chance. 

340
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:48,087
 Just one more time. Let me show you. 

341
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:51,307
- He inspired me. 
  - Just let me show you. 

342
00:22:57,847 --> 00:23:00,677
So it was because of him.

343
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:04,587
Curse you, Jing Xi Chi. You tricked me again.

344
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:07,797
What was that?

345
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:11,077
It's nothing.

346
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:19,277
I just think that you both are really special.

347
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:22,197
You grew up knowing what you like.

348
00:23:22,197 --> 00:23:23,957
You know what you want.

349
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:26,317
Everything goes smoothly.

350
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,927
But not me.

351
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:32,987
I'm always studying without a goal.

352
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:35,137
I'm so silly.

353
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,647
Sign up for some talent courses.

354
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:47,757
It's not too late to start.

355
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:49,297
Talent courses?

356
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:50,757
Yeah.

357
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:56,127
If you're afraid of strangers, I can go with you.

358
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:59,517
Never mind. My problem is nothing compared to yours.

359
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:02,147
I can handle it. Thanks.

360
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:08,587
Talent courses?

361
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:13,077
I do envy you sometimes.

362
00:24:15,757 --> 00:24:19,067
- Did you just say— 
 - Nothing.

363
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:20,667
Have some crabs.

364
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,557
You too.

365
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:27,237
All right.

366
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:29,127
Calm down.

367
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:33,757
Song Cong must be starving. You can't starve your own kid.

368
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:36,087
I don't care.

369
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:39,137
You should listen to what he said that night.

370
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:43,907
After everything I did for him, he thinks I'm wrong.

371
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:50,807
Do you remember when he was born?

372
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:52,717
His dad left to study in Germany.

373
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,577
I had to raise the kid alone.

374
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:58,167
Did I leave my job at the provincial hospital for nothing?

375
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,857
All right.

376
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:04,067
I left the job to look after Song Cong.

377
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:07,327
At the time, I knew his career was starting to take off.

378
00:25:07,327 --> 00:25:09,517
I said, "It's all right, I can make the sacrifice.

379
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:12,167
I can give this family everything."

380
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,517
Guess what?

381
00:25:13,517 --> 00:25:17,897
The old man spends every day in the hospital and barely comes home.

382
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:20,757
Seriously?

383
00:25:20,757 --> 00:25:23,677
As a man, he always avoids getting involved in problems.

384
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:29,367
When things get serious, he never takes a firm stance.

385
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:32,140
Yes, I can totally relate to that.

386
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,517
Over the years, you've been the one taking care of the family.

387
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:37,857
You made the most sacrifices.

388
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:39,777
Let me just say one thing.

389
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:42,137
Let's not keep calling it a sacrifice.

390
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:44,567
We did it for the kids because we chose to.

391
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:46,607
We did it because we wanted to.

392
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:48,680
That is not sacrifice.

393
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,662
You're here for a free meal.

394
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:53,677
- You talk too much. Just eat your food! 
 - Fine. Chen Lei, long time no see.

395
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,477
Just eat this. Stuff your mouth.

396
00:25:55,477 --> 00:25:57,037
Whose side are you on?

397
00:25:57,037 --> 00:25:58,717
- Yeah. 
 - Calm down.

398
00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:01,097
Let's not talk about sacrifices.

399
00:26:01,097 --> 00:26:03,507
Anyway, Hao Mei, listen to me.

400
00:26:03,507 --> 00:26:05,807
Since the father and his son won't appreciate your efforts,

401
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:07,677
we might as well cut our losses.

402
00:26:07,677 --> 00:26:09,057
Is that okay?

403
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:11,277
Just like me. I'm not sacrificing anything.

404
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:13,517
I want to live my own life and realize my worth.

405
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:14,887
Yeah.

406
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,167
Everything you say here is pointless.

407
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:20,367
If you ask me, you've expected too much from Song Cong.

408
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,847
He can't take it anymore. You should pay more attention.

409
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,517
Quiet down.

410
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:28,957
It may sound harsh, but it's for your own good.

411
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:32,477
Honestly, you want Song Cong to be in the international class.

412
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:34,197
Is that it?

413
00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:35,617
The class?

414
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:38,297
Who told you that? I never said that.

415
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:43,847
Unlike some parents I know, I fully respect my son's decision.

416
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:45,707
There's nothing wrong with Song Cong.

417
00:26:45,707 --> 00:26:47,887
His only outstanding trait is being too smart.

418
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:49,517
He can be in any class he wants.

419
00:26:49,517 --> 00:26:51,957
He is free to be in the regular class.

420
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:55,347
As long as he wants it, I don't mind.

421
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:58,137
See you.

422
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:00,887
International class?

423
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:02,237
Come now.

424
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,957
- Eat up. 
 - People are so nosy.

425
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:23,507
Dad.

426
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,517
Why are you making dinner?

427
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,207
Where is Mom?

428
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:36,677
When you go to school tomorrow, finish the transfer paperwork.

429
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:40,127
I called your homeroom teacher.

430
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:41,237
What's wrong?

431
00:27:41,237 --> 00:27:42,887
I'm your parent too.

432
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:45,297
I have authority too.

433
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:49,847
Are you saying you're willing to go against Mom for my sake?

434
00:27:49,847 --> 00:27:51,427
No way.

435
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:56,867
Actually, you should thank Li Tian's mother.

436
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,477
Move aside.

437
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:08,677
Are you cooking or operating?

438
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:10,087
Stop if you don't want to cook.

439
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:12,317
Go do your stitches instead.

440
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:19,907
Well... Mom.

441
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:23,037
I brought the books back.

442
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:24,757
And...

443
00:28:24,757 --> 00:28:27,537
- Dad says... 
 - Yes.

444
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:30,297
Your dad is finally acting like a good father.

445
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:31,507
He made the decision.

446
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:32,907
I didn't.

447
00:28:32,907 --> 00:28:34,327
I wouldn't dare.

448
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:36,407
I don't get it.

449
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:40,027
If you want to get transferred, why did you win first place in the contest?

450
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:42,097
You wasted a spot.

451
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,847
Well... Mr. Fu provoked me.

452
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,820
I had to clap back at him.

453
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,327
Besides, the contest questions were more interesting than my usual exercises.

454
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:54,327
I can totally relate.

455
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:56,927
Solving questions is sometimes about the thrill.

456
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:59,037
It's hard to hold that thrill back.

457
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,167
You might just get a perfect score.

458
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,807
Sometimes, when I'm stitching my patients,

459
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:08,440
I wonder how I manage to do it so neatly and so firmly.

460
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,980
I'd love to do a few extra stitches just for fun.

461
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:24,437
Your mom is mad.

462
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:25,957
This is going to take a while.

463
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:28,567
Go to the regular class tomorrow.

464
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,847
But Dad...

465
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:32,057
Let's listen to Mom on this.

466
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:34,407
You fool.

467
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:40,317
Would I make this decision without her permission, given how serious this is?

468
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:48,777
Actually, your dad was pretty brave when he was younger.

469
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:50,867
But now...

470
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:54,237
This is why I support your decision.

471
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:59,977
Cherish your single life and the freedom you have now.

472
00:30:16,327 --> 00:30:17,887
- Up ahead! 
 - Come, center!

473
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:19,747
- Intercept! 
 - Keep an eye on them!

474
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,960
Pass it here!

475
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,337
Over here!

476
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:25,177
Jing Xi Chi!

477
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:28,587
Come here.

478
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:30,927
Watch them.

479
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:32,847
Pass it to me.

480
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:34,507
Why are you here?

481
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:36,027
Why isn't your dear Cong with you?

482
00:30:36,027 --> 00:30:38,427
He is not my dear Cong.

483
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,467
He wanted to get transferred because of what you said.

484
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,037
Drop the act.

485
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:48,097
I came to tell you he didn't make the decision because of me.

486
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:51,417
He made up his mind after seeing the effort you put into football.

487
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:56,127
No wonder.

488
00:30:56,127 --> 00:31:00,287
After all, I'm destined to be a spiritual leader.

489
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:04,027
You could make a decision because of me too.

490
00:31:04,027 --> 00:31:06,517
I can guarantee your success.

491
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:10,617
What guarantee?

492
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:15,987
Is Song Cong really transferring?

493
00:31:22,617 --> 00:31:25,327
Turns out Aunt Hao is all bark and no bite.

494
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:26,427
Dad.

495
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:29,757
When I went to Song Cong's house for dinner, I was worried about him.

496
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:33,237
I thought he was going to starve forever.

497
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:40,617
My precious girl has been through so many ads.

498
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:42,197
I'll leave in a few days.

499
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:43,647
Who knows when I'll be back?

500
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:47,047
Don't you want to see me more often?

501
00:31:48,027 --> 00:31:52,057
Yeah. I'm watching you with my eyes wide open.

502
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:53,307
- Fine. Enough. 
 - Not yet.

503
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:55,507
Okay, you can stop now. This is getting creepy.

504
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:59,237
- Cut it out. Read your ads. 
 - More! Nope.

505
00:31:59,237 --> 00:32:01,857
I'll seal away this evil spirit!

506
00:32:01,857 --> 00:32:03,677
We ran out of oranges. I'll go and get some.

507
00:32:03,677 --> 00:32:05,677
Okay.

508
00:32:05,677 --> 00:32:08,477
What is this? Wilderness survival?

509
00:32:09,197 --> 00:32:11,277
Haven't decided on anything yet?

510
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:13,207
Nope.

511
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:19,457
Your grandpa didn't even take this long to pick a son-in-law.

512
00:32:20,197 --> 00:32:22,537
I want to try something new.

513
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:25,667
I have to pick the right one. I'll take my time.

514
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,997
Give me a break.

515
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:35,517
Are you trying to catch up to Song Cong after seeing how ambitious he was?

516
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:40,537
I bet you won't get it.

517
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:46,427
Jing Xi Chi is quite ambitious too.

518
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,417
 He's not as worthless as you think. 

519
00:33:54,037 --> 00:33:55,327
Chen Huan Er, hurry up!

520
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:56,867
- I have a match to watch tonight! 
 - Coming.

521
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,887
- At this rate, I'll miss the match! 
 - Wait for me.

522
00:33:58,887 --> 00:34:00,757
Hurry up!

523
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:10,047
What is taking you so long?

524
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:15,597
Come on. It's taking forever to tie your shoelaces.

525
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:18,747
- It's done. Let's go. 
 - I'm going to miss the match. Hurry up!

526
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:22,847
You don't have to wait for me anymore.

527
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:25,407
But I have to put the books somewhere.

528
00:34:25,407 --> 00:34:28,147
Go!

529
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,080
Let's go! We'll watch the game together!

530
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,260
Let's watch the match! Quick!

531
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:46,617
 There are countless first times in everyone's life. 

532
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,847
 The first time they decide to change. 

533
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:49,907
   

534
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,397
 The first time they feel something for someone. 

535
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:01,010
♫  ...past your sight  ♫

536
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:04,517
   

537
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:07,877
 The first time they rebel against their parents. 

538
00:35:07,877 --> 00:35:11,927
   

539
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:14,920
 The first time they understand their child. 

540
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,637
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

541
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:28,220
 The parents know they can't stop their children from taking their first steps. 

542
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,437
♫  The me from back then  ♫

543
00:35:30,437 --> 00:35:33,787
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

544
00:35:33,787 --> 00:35:38,437
 That's because the children can finally begin their own lives. 

545
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:41,797
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

546
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:48,257
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

547
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:52,687
♫  At the right time  ♫

548
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,957
Stop copying.

549
00:36:03,957 --> 00:36:05,217
Hurry up.

550
00:36:05,217 --> 00:36:07,367
Pick up the pace.

551
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,357
Song Cong?

552
00:36:12,477 --> 00:36:15,427
Song Cong? We're in the same class again.

553
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:17,197
And you're still the class president.

554
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:19,517
By the way, I need to ask something.

555
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:25,207
Did you get transferred to see our small-town girl?

556
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,287
Liao Xin Yan.

557
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,477
As the class president, you shouldn't be spreading rumors.

558
00:36:32,477 --> 00:36:35,707
I think Cong came to our class for his buddy, me.

559
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,557
Right? Come with me.

560
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:40,807
That's what they do in dramas!

561
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:42,767
Take the seat inside.

562
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:45,437
Wait.

563
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,077
Why are you sitting here?

564
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:48,327
I discussed it with Mr. Xu.

565
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:50,307
He sits next to me from now on.

566
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,957
Sports representative, we must register for sports day.

567
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,997
The deadline is near. Ask me if you need help.

568
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:58,327
This is nothing. I can handle it in no time.

569
00:36:58,327 --> 00:37:00,587
All right, good luck.

570
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:06,207
Signing up?

571
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:07,637
- What is it? 
 - Sports day.

572
00:37:07,637 --> 00:37:09,997
- Not joining. 
 - Come on.

573
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:12,687
Girls, ladies,

574
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:14,207
my goddesses.

575
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:16,957
Just sign up for one or two of the races;

576
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:19,407
otherwise, we're as good as forfeiting.

577
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:21,937
We'd love to help, but this is beyond us.

578
00:37:21,937 --> 00:37:24,537
Sorry, Xi Chi. Find someone else. I'll sign up next time.

579
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:27,117
- Could you reconsider? 
 - Fine. I'll do you a favor.

580
00:37:27,117 --> 00:37:30,517
- Great. 
 - I'll sign up for the hammer throw.

581
00:37:32,157 --> 00:37:33,927
That is only five points.

582
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:37,627
A race gets you ten points. Please reconsider!

583
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:42,837
First place. Ten points.

584
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,247
What are you worried about?

585
00:37:45,247 --> 00:37:48,437
Your class doesn't even stand a chance of scoring.

586
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,597
Look who we have here. It's Qin Liang.

587
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:55,077
Are you itching to get destroyed after so long?

588
00:37:55,077 --> 00:37:58,117
I heard your leg injury flared up again. Think you can even compete?

589
00:37:58,117 --> 00:37:59,247
What?

590
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:02,287
- Do you want a match? 
 - I don't pick on the disadvantaged.

591
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:04,037
The match would be pointless.

592
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:05,997
Let's make it class versus class.

593
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:07,207
Think it through.

594
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:09,287
Don't cry when you lose.

595
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,327
Jing Xi Chi, spare me the bluff.

596
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:17,157
Your class of nerds will be crushed by the sports class.

597
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:19,247
Fine. Let's make a deal.

598
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:24,687
When you get crushed by our class, you must call me Big Boss Chi.

599
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:26,267
Fine.

600
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,557
Watch the ball.

601
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:35,707
No one for the 1,500-meter sprint.

602
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:41,077
Chen Huan Er.

603
00:38:41,077 --> 00:38:44,367
Would you like to join the 1,500-meter sprint?

604
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:46,117
No.

605
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:48,557
I only jog at night for exercise.

606
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:51,157
I can't handle the sprint race.

607
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:52,847
Chen Huan Er!

608
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:57,687
Chen Huan Er, give it a shot! You won't know until you try.

609
00:38:57,687 --> 00:39:01,357
Forget it. Why does it have to be her?

610
00:39:02,637 --> 00:39:05,077
It's the athletes from Class 6.

611
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,477
They are short sprinters and high jumpers.

612
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:10,157
We are no match for them in raw power.

613
00:39:10,157 --> 00:39:14,767
We can only focus on sports that rely on stamina, and no one cares about that.

614
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,117
I asked everyone.

615
00:39:16,117 --> 00:39:18,637
No one could do the 1,500-meter sprint.

616
00:39:18,637 --> 00:39:20,890
But it gives a lot of points.

617
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:23,517
We can't lose.

618
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:27,187
You mean you can't lose.

619
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:36,687
Miss Huan Er.

620
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:38,037
Please sign up.

621
00:39:38,037 --> 00:39:39,207
- No, thanks. 
 - Come on.

622
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:41,887
- Miss Huan Er! I asked Aunt Hao to... 
 - No!

623
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:43,557
- I'm not eating it! 
 - Try it out!

624
00:39:43,557 --> 00:39:45,077
If you like it, sign up for the race!

625
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:47,397
You say it stinks!

626
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:59,667
   

627
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:04,957
   

628
00:40:04,957 --> 00:40:06,957
Chen Huan Er!

629
00:40:11,557 --> 00:40:14,687
- Please. 
 - Jing Xi Chi!

630
00:40:14,687 --> 00:40:16,917
Can you solve this?

631
00:40:19,437 --> 00:40:21,187
No.

632
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,957
Miss Huan Er!

633
00:40:27,957 --> 00:40:30,037
Join the race. Join the race!

634
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:32,887
Don't be a creep!

635
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:49,077
Jing.

636
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,037
It's me.

637
00:40:51,037 --> 00:40:52,807
You brat.

638
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:55,327
I scared you, right?

639
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:58,157
You're scared of Mom too?

640
00:40:58,157 --> 00:40:59,847
She has no power over me.

641
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:02,807
- Who is the family head? 
 - Yeah.

642
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:06,267
You are taking great risks coming here.

643
00:41:08,957 --> 00:41:11,557
Dr. Song came to our place.

644
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:13,557
The check-up results are here.

645
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:16,637
Your Mom doesn't want you to play football again.

646
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:19,767
But me? I saved your neck.

647
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:23,517
Dr. Song! He betrayed me!

648
00:41:23,517 --> 00:41:25,807
Son, be honest.

649
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:28,887
Is your leg not feeling well lately?

650
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:32,957
No. I swear, Dad. I mean it. See? It's fine.

651
00:41:36,157 --> 00:41:37,517
Don't believe me?

652
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:41,517
In that case, let's play half a match right now.

653
00:41:41,517 --> 00:41:45,157
You little brat. I'm not afraid of you!

654
00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:47,437
Come on, Mr. Jing!

655
00:41:48,997 --> 00:41:51,327
   

656
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:53,437
From Dr. Song.

657
00:41:53,437 --> 00:41:55,917
Look at this boy.

658
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:01,407
Aunt Hao, Aunt Lin.

659
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:03,517
Finished your study?

660
00:42:06,517 --> 00:42:11,367
As you know, Xi Chi suffered a knee injury in the past.

661
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:12,997
The doctor asked him to take a break,

662
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,957
but he wouldn't listen.

663
00:42:14,957 --> 00:42:18,117
When he's in pain, he secretly gets acupuncture.

664
00:42:18,117 --> 00:42:20,557
Song found out, so he sent me the files.

665
00:42:20,557 --> 00:42:21,557
This is not good.

666
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:24,327
Song told me he needed to take a break,

667
00:42:24,327 --> 00:42:27,307
or he'll be left with permanent damage.

668
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:34,077
I've always thought going professional isn't easy.

669
00:42:34,077 --> 00:42:37,037
He should just study like the others. Wouldn't that be great?

670
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:39,887
You know, his father went through the same thing.

671
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:42,957
When he was young, he was one of the best on the city's football team.

672
00:42:42,957 --> 00:42:47,997
In the end, he was never chosen by a professional team.

673
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:52,077
I thought he'd give up because he couldn't get into a sports school.

674
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:53,957
But guess what?

675
00:42:53,957 --> 00:42:56,037
The boy was too stubborn to give up.

676
00:42:56,037 --> 00:43:00,597
I'm always worried he might get injured again.

677
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:04,557
Huan Er, isn't the school's sports day around the corner?

678
00:43:04,557 --> 00:43:06,887
Yeah, it is.

679
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,117
Huan Er.

680
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:10,997
Listen up. Don't go signing up for anything.

681
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:13,557
I want you to sit in the audience.

682
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:14,762
Is that clear?

683
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:15,847
Yes.

684
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:16,997
I have more studying to do.

685
00:43:16,997 --> 00:43:18,397
Go on.

686
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:27,157
How is her health?

687
00:43:27,157 --> 00:43:29,597
Not bad.

688
00:43:29,597 --> 00:43:32,437
It's nice to have a daughter.

689
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:44,880


690
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,700
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

691
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:56,677
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

692
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:03,547
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

693
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:09,977
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

694
00:44:09,977 --> 00:44:16,467
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

695
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:24,077
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

696
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:31,107
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

697
00:44:31,807 --> 00:44:37,687
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

698
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:44,387
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

699
00:44:44,387 --> 00:44:48,247
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

700
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:53,467
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

701
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:58,187
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

702
00:44:58,187 --> 00:45:01,647
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

703
00:45:01,647 --> 00:45:07,017
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

704
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:11,907
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

705
00:45:11,907 --> 00:45:15,707
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

706
00:45:15,707 --> 00:45:20,747
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

707
00:45:20,747 --> 00:45:24,437
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

708
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:28,977
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

709
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:32,487
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

710
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:38,567
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

711
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:44,067
♫  At the right time  ♫
