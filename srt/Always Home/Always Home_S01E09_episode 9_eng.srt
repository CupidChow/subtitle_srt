14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,890
â™«  Because of you, I have become a little braver  â™«

15
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,880
   
   

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,700
   

18
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,960
 Life in the second year of high school may seem peaceful, 

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,520
 but undercurrents are surging beneath the surface. 

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,535
 Exams and papers are like monsters with a huge appetite, 

21
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,420
 always showing up right on time, 

22
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,020
 devouring every bit of space in your brain. 

23
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,050
 As for Qi Qi and me, 

24
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,670
 we still haven't reconciled. 

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,275
 Those emotions that can't be explained slowly get buried by time. 

26
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:29,410
 I just hope that this time the teacher who sets the questions 

27
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,080
 won't overthink them. 

28
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,810
 Buried along with everything else in my dream. 

29
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,300
 We've had this essay topic since elementary school. 

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:47,090
 It feels like a descending curve, mentioned less and less. 

31
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,580
 In the end, no one talks about it anymore 

32
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,880
 because everyone starts to care about their own ego. 

33
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,930
 We realize how hard it is to achieve our dreams. 

34
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,420
Chen Huan Er, can I use your computer?

35
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,030
 Don't touch my computer. 

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,490
What are you doing?

37
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,500
Sports University?

38
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:26,335
Why are you suddenly paying attention to the exam? 
    

39
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:27,935
I just wanted to try it.

40
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:31,431
You and Cong have no worries about getting into a good university in a big city.

41
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:36,080
Right now, I'm actually a little worried I won't get into any school.

42
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,530
That won't happen.

43
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,780
If not, you could work in the city,

44
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,900
or we could support you.

45
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,695
Do you really think I can't support myself?

46
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:47,354
I want to get into Sports University because it's my dream to play soccer.

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,800
I achieve my goal in a roundabout way, okay?

48
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,850
It would be so great if I were like you and knew what I wanted to do from a young age.

49
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,690
Then I wouldn't have to think so much.

50
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,590
It'd be much easier.

51
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,900
Otherwise, you could just study agriculture.

52
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,626
That mysterious herb you have seems to work well for treating diarrhea.

53
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:10,940
I think you have a talent,

54
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,360
and your family has a history in it. Isn't that great?

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,900
My family's connection is with Traditional Chinese Medicine.

56
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,785
It's related to pharmacy.

57
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:22,110
The field you were talking about was agriculture, bro.

58
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,330
Don't disturb me anymore. I'm still calculating the scores.

59
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,250
Gosh, why are they all so high?

60
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,935
Why don't you go home and calculate?

61
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,280
If I could go home and calculate, I wouldn't be racking my brains

62
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,730
in this little shabby room of yours.

63
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,860
Your house doesn't even have a game console.

64
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,220
Later, I'll lend you my PSP. You can have it for two days. 
  (T/N: Portable game console) 

65
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,122
You should practice more since you're such a noob.

66
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:49,220
And you're still thinking about playing games?

67
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,370
Move aside. Let me check.

68
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,050
Go ahead and check. I've already lost all hope.

69
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:06,420
   

70
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,740
   

71
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,860
Mom.

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,170
Don't look at it.

73
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,130
I really didn't do well this time.

74
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,460
I'm very satisfied!

75
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,335
According to your school's first-tier status, you can get into college.

76
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,840
I'm very content.

77
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,420
Mom, can't you have a little more expectation for me, a little more hope?

78
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,020
I use encouragement-based education.

79
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,340
Do you want me to be like Li Tian's family?

80
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,960
Be grateful for what you have.

81
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,910
Here.

82
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,470
Mom, our teacher said I'm good at biology and chemistry.

83
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,130
How about I study pharmaceutical sciences in the future?

84
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,030
Think it over.

85
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,780
Mom!

86
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,957
Didn't you and Dad say that as long as I don't study medicine, I can study whatever I want?

87
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:14,265
Huan Er, pharmacy is closely related to medicine.

88
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:17,100
It might even be harder than studying medicine.

89
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,230
A girl should choose an easier major.

90
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,100
If this isn't okay, and that's not okay,

91
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,320
then what's the difference between me and a salted fish without dreams?

92
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,780
Isn't salted fish just fine?

93
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,740
You see, there's a whole wall of them at home.

94
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,320
I'm full, Mom. I'm going out for a walk.

95
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,220
Aren't you eating?

96
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,620
I'm a salted fish. I don't deserve to eat.

97
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,020
Nothing wrong with being a salted fish.

98
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,930
Li Tian?

99
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,050
What's your problem?

100
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,300
You're the problem.

101
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,130
What are you doing standing here?

102
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,310
This isn't your block's hallway. Why do you care?

103
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,420
 Earlier, you said if Song Cong came in second, it would be like getting first. 

104
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,610
 So what's going on now? 

105
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,938
 Can't even hold onto second place? 

106
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:25,580
 So what do you want me to do? 

107
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,580
 I already tried my best, okay? 

108
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,896
 I went to study with him because I was afraid he wouldn't learn. 

109
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:32,045
 Don't question me when you're raising the kid. 

110
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:33,452
 Shouldn't it be me asking you? 

111
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:36,710
 No matter what, I just care about the result. 

112
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,540
This hallway has poor soundproofing.

113
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,475
 He's a boy, so I don't want to be too harsh on him. 

114
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:48,010
 But isn't it obvious? 

115
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,506
 Spending so much money, going through all this effort, and he still can't learn? 

116
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:52,890
 What's the reason? It's because he's dumb. 

117
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,898
 If this continues, he might as well transfer to the art stream. 

118
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:57,460
Third place is considered dumb?

119
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,890
What?

120
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,260
If you go back in, you'll be digging your own grave.

121
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,940
What then?

122
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,540
No thanks. I'm going back in a bit.

123
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,300
I didn't bring it specifically for you.

124
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,550
I didn't eat enough at dinner.

125
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,460
Thanks.

126
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,300
Just now, my parents were having a study discussion about my studies.

127
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,690
My whole family are ace students. It's normal to have such discussions.

128
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,090
You wouldn't get it, so don't spread gossip.

129
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,660
What's there to gossip about?

130
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Your family isn't the center of the universe.

131
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,660
Besides, last time we...

132
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,550
Don't mention last time.

133
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,330
You did well enough to get third.

134
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,090
You know, when I did poorly on exams, I used to tell myself

135
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,180
that the sun would still rise tomorrow.

136
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,380
I still have to get up, eat, and go to school.

137
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
Life has to go on.

138
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,900
I'm not like you.

139
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,935
For me, scores are my life.

140
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:34,800
The ranking in exams determines whether you win or lose.

141
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,670
If I can't get first, it's like waiting to die.

142
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,300
It looks like I have shallow knowledge.

143
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,450
I just don't understand the worries of top students.

144
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,330
Of course, you've never even made it to the top ten,

145
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,200
so you wouldn't know the feeling of falling down.

146
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,660
Can I ask you a question?

147
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,490
Shoot.

148
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,940
How did you get 45 points on that essay?

149
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,790
What's wrong with that? How much did you score?

150
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,020
- 29. 
 - 29?

151
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,180
Did you go off-topic?

152
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,780
I didn't go off-topic.

153
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,450
My dream is a simple, happy, and ordinary life.

154
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,720
That's not off-topic?

155
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,210
Was it?

156
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,260
So, what was your essay topic?

157
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,850
Keep your feet on the ground, look up at the stars,

158
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,340
and do your best to make the world a better place.

159
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,300
Is that really your dream?

160
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,780
Didn't I say this long ago?

161
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,587
My dream is to study abroad, polish my credentials,

162
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:47,868
and follow the elite path to become a winner in life.

163
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:50,610
I'm not talking about how well your answer matched the topic.

164
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,170
I'm asking, do you really think this way?

165
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,040
As long as the score is high, thatâ€™s all that matters.

166
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,850
Besides, why should I tell you?

167
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,670
I'm heading home now.

168
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,070
Song Cong, come here for a moment.

169
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,420
- What is it? 
 - I got this from a colleague.

170
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,730
Their kid prepped for the college entrance exam last year.

171
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,180
Since you're staying in the country,

172
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,660
you'll definitely be aiming for either Yenching or Huaqing.

173
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,490
Both schools have excellent economics programs.

174
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,990
Which independent admission do you want to prepare for?

175
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,970
Of course, you'll get in anyway.

176
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,850
- Butâ€” 
 - Mom.

177
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,610
Mom, I'm only in my second year.

178
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,695
Isn't it a bit too early?

179
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:47,490
The Independent Admission Exams for these schools are different.

180
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,780
You need to prepare in advance.

181
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,450
It'd be too late if you do it later.

182
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,020
Oh no.

183
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,280
What is it?

184
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,190
I suddenly remembered Xi Chi asking to meet up.

185
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,060
I better get going.

186
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,730
It's late. What could be so important?

187
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,180
I almost forgot.

188
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,690
This is more important.

189
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,220
- Get home soon. 
 - Yeah, okay.

190
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,270
Bu, pass the ball!

191
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,340
Yeah.

192
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,820
Jing Xi Chi.

193
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,820
How come you two came together?

194
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,680
What's up with you two?

195
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,100
- Taking a breather. 
 - Releasing stress.

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,260
Good timing.

197
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,330
I have something to announce.

198
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,384
I'm going to represent our school in the inter-high school soccer league.

199
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:03,900
That's awesome.

200
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,680
It's your chance to make the school proud.

201
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,420
Of course.

202
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,570
I heard the coach from Sports University will be there.

203
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,420
Congrats! You're one step closer to your dream.

204
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,340
We'll see.

205
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,360
Pass the ball!

206
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,730
 I'm sure Song Cong is like me. 

207
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,450
 Sometimes, I'm so envious of Jing Xi Chi. 

208
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,960
 He's always able to talk about his dream so easily. 

209
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:47,450
 To him, his dream is never blurry, never a burden, nor out of reach. 

210
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,820
 They're just things you decide to do, and then you make them happen. 

211
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,260
 Â­  
   
   

212
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,900
Everyone, it's okay if the experiment fails.

213
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,300
The important thing is that we have to remember the steps and test points.

214
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,972
Knowing what to write during the exam is key.

215
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:18,035
To observe the Tyndall effect more clearly,

216
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:23,900
first of all we need to produce a colloidal substance that meets the requirements.

217
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Jing Xi Chi! Any more mischief and you're out of here!

218
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,940
During the experiment, we need to carefully observe

219
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,380
the state of different liquids after mixing.

220
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,350
We should conduct the experiment while taking notes.

221
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,090
As you work on the experiment, I want to emphasize...

222
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,380
- This is pretty cool. 
 - Another important test point.

223
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,970
- Magic... 
 - The magnitude of the Tyndall effect

224
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,460
is influenced by several factors,

225
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,515
including the intermolecular forces between the solute and the solvent.

226
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:56,310
Jing Xi Chi!

227
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,140
Also, consider the molar ratio of the solute to the solvent.

228
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,300
The stronger the interaction between them, the more pronounced

229
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:15,690
the Tyndall effect will be when we finish the experiment.

230
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,791
Under the same number of molecules, a lower molar ratio of solute

231
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:25,850
will result in a weaker Tyndall effect.

232
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,090
Therefore, when conducting the experiment,

233
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,180
pay close attention to the molar ratio between the solute and the solvent.

234
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,300
This is the key to achieving the desired results.

235
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,510
- Sorry about that. 
 - Jing Xi Chi! Get out!

236
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,660
Are you okay?

237
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,260
I'm fine.

238
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,210
Wow, impressive, Chen Huan Er!

239
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,380
But still not as good as mine just now.

240
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,210
This student did a great job.

241
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,980
- Thank you, sir. 
 - Thank you.

242
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,300
Huan Er, how did you do it?

243
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,080
It's actually not that hard.

244
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,180
Just add a sufficient amount of solution, and when the water reaches boiling point,

245
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,270
you get the result.

246
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,760
Chen Huan Er, here.

247
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:50,203
Mr. Zhang, 
    

248
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:51,540
your chemistry teacher nominated you.

249
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,920
I agree. Your results in chemistry are pretty good.

250
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,090
You should go for it.

251
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,260
Right now, the coursework isn't too overwhelming,

252
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,140
so you should take advantage of these valuable opportunities.

253
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,900
Who knows? It might help you in the college entrance exam.

254
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,010
Don't feel overly pressured.

255
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,720
Just go and see how it feels.

256
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,730
I don't feel pressured.

257
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,820
I just thought that before, only top students like Song Cong could take part.

258
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,140
I didn't expect I'd have the opportunity too.

259
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,990
Jing Xi Chi, this is your application.

260
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,100
The chemistry teacher told me

261
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:42,660
that even though you're always causing trouble in class, you have good execution skills.

262
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
So you should take part in the competition.

263
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,340
We shouldn't waste your creative mind or your talent.

264
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,970
Mr. Xu.

265
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,490
I know my mistake. Say no more.

266
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,450
You actually admitted you're wrong?

267
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,250
- Yes. 
 - Jing Xi Chi, let me say this again.

268
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:07,690
If you dare act naughty during chemistry again, I'll get your mom to take you away.

269
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,260
- Mr. Xu. 
 - You may go.

270
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,580
You can have this back, sir.

271
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,886
- Thank you, sir. 
 - You keep it.

272
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:15,080
No, don't waste it.

273
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,970
- Yes, Li Tian. 
 - This is my application.

274
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,260
I thought you were going to apply for the English speech competition.

275
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,770
How come you switched?

276
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,580
I think I'm better suited for the Math competition.

277
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,270
Thanks, sir.

278
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,380
Can you wait for a bit?

279
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,977
- I'm hungry. Why can't I start eating? 
 - Huan Er isn't here.

280
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:38,440
I can still eat when she comes. We can start eating first.

281
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,340
- Are you that hungry? 
 - I'm coming.

282
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,580
Here comes the eggplant.

283
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,335
Let me try it.

284
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:45,780
- Isn't it delicious? 
 - Huan Er.

285
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,200
Last night, I overheard my mom and her friends talking.

286
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,512
They said that the English competition is useless for independent admissions.

287
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:53,240
That's why Aunt Li didn't let him sign up.

288
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,340
No wonder.

289
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,900
Today, Mr. Xu even asked Li Tian why he changed his registration form.

290
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,800
That guy has loved English since he was little.

291
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,120
Back in elementary school, he even signed up for an English speech contest,

292
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,490
but for some reason he didn't go in the end-

293
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,857
Probably, he got shut down by Uncle Li again.

294
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:09,490
Not "probably." Definitely.

295
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,620
Last night, there was another argument upstairs about this.

296
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,620
I looked it up: the two competitions are happening at the exact same time.

297
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,420
So what then?

298
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,660
Come on. We have to find a way to help him.

299
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,530
Why do you even care what he signs up for?

300
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,100
Jing Xi Chi, have you forgotten?

301
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,275
He helped us steal fireworks during New Year's.

302
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:28,580
And now you're turning your back on him?

303
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,600
You're acting like a total jerk.

304
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,320
What are you laughing at?

305
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,155
You're the one who lit the fireworks. Don't act all innocent; that makes you a bigger jerk.

306
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:40,030
Jerk!

307
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,660
- Just focus on your own competition. 
 - Yeah, don't worry. We'll handle it.

308
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,640
The eggplant is too salty.

309
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,490
Don't eat it if it's bad. Leave it.

310
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,470
- Here, Cong. You eat it. 
 - Let me try it.

311
00:19:56,975 --> 00:19:58,290
Tian.

312
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,250
Have you got everything ready?

313
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,200
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

314
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,620
Coming.

315
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,970
Who is it?

316
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,050
Hello.

317
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,450
Why are you guys here?

318
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,200
Who is it?

319
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,290
- Aunt Li. 
 - It's you guys.

320
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,900
Aunt Li, we're here to get Li Tian for the competition.

321
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,550
Xi Chi, what competition are you participating in?

322
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,200
He's going there to cheer for us, Aunt Li.

323
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,949
I'm actually competing in the math competition. Same exam hall as Li Tian.

324
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:32,655
- That's right. 
 - Oh, I see.

325
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,352
We'll get going then, Aunt Li.

326
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:35,160
No need to send us off.

327
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,480
We'll see ourselves out.

328
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,115
- Bye, Aunt Li. 
 - Okay.

329
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,180
Hurry up and go.

330
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,100
- Easy, now. 
 - Move it.

331
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,750
- What are you trying to do? 
 - You tell me!

332
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,620
Are you kidnapping me? You two can't do this!

333
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,730
Let me go!

334
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,320
Let go!

335
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,900
Oh, I know.

336
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,970
You two must be afraid I'd get a ranking in the competition.

337
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,660
I'll get bonus points for the college entrance exam and end up ranking higher than you.

338
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,670
All that stuff about wanting to be friends again. That was all a lie, wasn't it?

339
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,530
- Stop trying to sabotage me! 
 - Li Tian, are you crazy or what?

340
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,290
You need to stop making up stories.

341
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,690
Li Tian.

342
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,170
Here.

343
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
I got this pass from Mr. Xu for you.

344
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,800
Whether you wish to participate in the Math or English competition is up to you.

345
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,450
   

346
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,210
Wait... it's real?

347
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,030
Are you happy now?

348
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,010
Hang on. You two must be up to something.

349
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,970
- Just shut it and get moving! 
 - Let's be clear.

350
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,140
You two forced me to go. I didn't go willingly.

351
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,530
Do it.

352
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,170
Hurry up! You don't want to be late.

353
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,990
Du Man?

354
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,250
The world becomes more colorful and warm. 
    

355
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,380
Everyone is good to you, 
    

356
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,490
and the world is full of love.

357
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,650
That's all. Thank you for listening.

358
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,175
Little Four-Eye...

359
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:48,680
He was all nervous just now, and now he's up there on his own.

360
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,480
Oh no.

361
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,855
We might have acted too recklessly.

362
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:57,895
Go get him back; he isn't prepared!

363
00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:59,495
Relax. He doesn't need to prepare.

364
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:02,065
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.

365
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:04,970
I'm honored to be here today.

366
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,240
The topic of my speech is "My Dream."

367
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:15,620
My dream is to create a world where people are not forced to speak English.

368
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,100
Wow, Little Four-Eye is actually pretty cool.

369
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,210
He's speaking really well.

370
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,130
Oh? You understood?

371
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,420
Of course!

372
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,900
Then what was he saying?

373
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,490
Wait...

374
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,470
You didn't understand?

375
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,710
Thank you.

376
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,810
Thank you.

377
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,978
What did he just say? What was it? What did you say?

378
00:23:54,978 --> 00:23:57,320
I said thank you.

379
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,340
You're welcome.

380
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,530
While listening to your speech, I was reminded of the competition back in elementary school.

381
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,900
I still remember the topic to this day.

382
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,290
They wanted us to write about our favorite thing.

383
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,050
You wrote about watching cartoons with us.

384
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,660
That's why I ended up not going.

385
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,380
I saw what other people wrote and thought my story was too childish.

386
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,100
So it's childish watching cartoons with us?

387
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,210
Then what about going up there today for a last-minute speech?

388
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,730
It was made clear.

389
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,050
Talk about your favorite thing, right?

390
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,730
If you liked it, then that's all that matters.

391
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,270
- Did you grow taller? 
 - Keep your hands to yourself.

392
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,940
What was your speech about just now?

393
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,380
I thought you understood.

394
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:45,770
Yes, I understood.

395
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,510
I just wanted to check if his grammar was right.

396
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,900
Are you feeling better?

397
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,290
Much better.

398
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,250
Thanks for today.

399
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,214
No worries.

400
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:00,450
If not for you,

401
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,690
I might not have been able to sit for the test.

402
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,010
It's nothing.

403
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,860
- Come, quick. 
 - Are you buying something?

404
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,380
You're eating all these?

405
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,030
Daughter.

406
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,480
It's you.

407
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,250
Are you two classmates?

408
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,620
We're desk mates.

409
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,730
Deskmates? What a coincidence. Here, take some more.

410
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,260
- Hello, sir. 
 - Dad, can you get me a bag?

411
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,310
Okay.

412
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,450
That's your father?

413
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,560
Do you remember? When you first got transferred, I told you that I had met you before.

414
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,190
 How much? 

415
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,340
 Ten yuan. 

416
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,620
It was right here.

417
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,420
Is that so?

418
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,140
Here. Put the things inside.

419
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,940
Sir, I can't eat all of these.

420
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,420
It's fine. Take it.

421
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,860
- I should pay for these. 
 - No need.

422
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,610
Just take it.

423
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,860
Thank you.

424
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,470
I'm off.

425
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,950
Jing Xi Chi, what is going on? Li Tian is competing today...

426
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,210
Li Tian?

427
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,330
How did the test go?

428
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,690
She obviously didn't do well.

429
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,210
That's no way to speak to Miss Chen.

430
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,660
What happened today was her idea.

431
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,050
Come on, bro.

432
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,690
Come.

433
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,970
Sit down, please.

434
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,290
Enough with the act, Jing Xi Chi.

435
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,050
It's English. Good, good!

436
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,510
Go on and talk in English the whole day then.

437
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,050
Sure, I can.

438
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,970
Look, TV.

439
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,820
I like television.

440
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,490
Bro, cheers.

441
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,310
Where's mine?

442
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,660
Sorry.

443
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,860
I don't know you come...

444
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,420
So you forgot?

445
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,940
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

446
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,280
But... there's water in the kitchen.

447
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,420
   

448
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,140
This time, only Du Man from our class made it to the finals.

449
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,690
If only Song Cong had participated.

450
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,340
Yeah, Song Cong definitely would have made it if he had gone.

451
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,250
- A bit of a shame. 
 - Yeah...

452
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,290
Morning.

453
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,580
Li Tian, congratulations!

454
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,040
You won first place in the English speech competition.

455
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,650
Congrats, Li Tian!

456
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,970
You're welcome.

457
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,851
   

458
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,960
   

459
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,340
What's the point of bringing this back to me?

460
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,015
It's not even useful as a paperweight.

461
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:47,000
Does it give extra points for admissions?

462
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,180
At the very least, my English is great.

463
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,453
When I go abroad in the future, I want to study English.

464
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:55,290
You're getting more ridiculous by the day. Am I sending you abroad to study English?

465
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,490
- Does that even need to be studied? 
 - Of course, it does!

466
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,325
In English studies, there's also English Literature major.

467
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:02,200
The world is a global village now. English is just a tool.

468
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,340
Everyone can say at least a few words in English.

469
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,860
What a lack of ambition!

470
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,010
This is my life. I have the right to choose my major.

471
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,660
- It's none of your business. 
 - What did you say?

472
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,170
Say that to me again if you dare!

473
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,230
What did he mean?

474
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,050
Aren't you good at English? Why are you asking me?

475
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,695
He spoke too fast. I didn't catch it.

476
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:26,380
   

477
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,030
Have water.

478
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,340
Come, try this.

479
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,230
It's really sweet.

480
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,690
Yeah, it is.

481
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,530
Then eat more.

482
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,980
That's enough.

483
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:52,660
Actually, taking part in competitions is all about participation.

484
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,660
Winning or not doesn't really matter.

485
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,490
Mom, what are you talking about?

486
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,210
Listen up. I'm very likely to win an award in this competition.

487
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,530
I've made up my mind. I want to study pharmacy.

488
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,360
I'll still do it even if it's exhausting.

489
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,480
Whatâ€™s gotten into you now?

490
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,010
What's wrong?

491
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,580
It's nothing.

492
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,480
I just have a bit of a stomachache.

493
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,650
Every time my period comes, my stomach hurts a lot.

494
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,490
What medicine did you take? Let me see.

495
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,970
   

496
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,210
These two medicines shouldn't be taken together!

497
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,180
I had no idea until I checked, but once I saw it, I was shocked.

498
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:37,100
The TCM* she usually takes and the painkiller can't be taken at the same time. 
  (T/N: Traditional Chinese Medicine) 

499
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,200
Taking them can irritate the stomach.

500
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,280
I don't know if her menstrual cramps are caused by poor blood circulation,

501
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,580
so she really shouldn't be taking medicine randomly.

502
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,530
I mean, seriously. What would she do without me?

503
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,889
You did an amazing job this time, Huan Er.

504
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:58,410
I, Qian Li Na, raised a great daughter!

505
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,260
I totally understand the sense of fulfillment you get from helping others.

506
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,010
But listen, pharmacy isn't as simple as you think.

507
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,120
We'll see about that.

508
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,440
All right. You really are my child.

509
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,120
You acted just like me when I was young. Wait right here.

510
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,440
Here you go. You want to study pharmacy, right?

511
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,288
First, read through this book. 
    

512
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:27,845
Then decide whether or not you want to study pharmacy.

513
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:30,720
Mom, this is traditional medicine.

514
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,610
I want to study Western medicine.

515
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,855
You need to first understand the stuff our ancestors left behind.

516
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:38,160
Then we can talk about Western medicine.

517
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,746
 I've got my final match with the football academy in two days. 

518
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,600
 Wait for my good news. 

519
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,540
 All the best. 

520
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,305
 Looking back, compared to other people, 

521
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:38,260
 I wondered if this little goal of mine even counts as a dream. 

522
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,380
   

523
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,360
   

524
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,740
Jing Xi Chi.

525
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,830
I'm fine, Mom. I dropped the ball.

526
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:10,110
 Nevertheless, it's given me unprecedented peace of mind and satisfaction. 

527
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,540
Headed to school?

528
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,340
Watching soccer, Dad?

529
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,210
Barcelona.

530
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:40,340
Dad, these are the tickets for today's match.

531
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,100
Are they for your mom and me?

532
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,095
Are you trying to get me in trouble?

533
00:32:49,095 --> 00:32:53,395
You asked me to keep this from her, and now you're exposing everything.

534
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:56,800
Dad, I have to go to this match.

535
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,770
The youth team coach will be there.

536
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,150
Basically, he's coming to scout me.

537
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,480
If I perform well, he might let me join the youth team,

538
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,860
and if I get in, it'll be a huge help for my development.

539
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,100
Plus, Dad, think about it.

540
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,777
If I play really well and the coach likes me, he might put in a few good words for me.

541
00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:17,260
That could make all the difference!

542
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,820
I'll see what I can do.

543
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,790
No matter if your mom goes or not, just do your best.

544
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,180
- Good luck, son. 
 - I'll leave the tickets here.

545
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,620
Got to go.

546
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,320
   

547
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,350
I wonder how Xi Chi's game is going...

548
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,200
Jing Xi Chi from your class got injured. Hurry, come with me to the infirmary!

549
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,210
- No way. He got hurt? 
 - Jing Xi Chi is injured?

550
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,900
What do we do?

551
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,420
How is he?

552
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,530
What happened?

553
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,650
Two players collided. He got pinned underneath.

554
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,084
He seemed fine when he got up, but after a few steps, he suddenly collapsed.

555
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:21,120
He can't even stand now.

556
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,280
He needs to get to the hospital as soon as possible.

557
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,228
Go to the entrance and flag down a taxi for us!

558
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:27,478
- Got it. 
 - Huan Er, help us get a leave of absence

559
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:30,000
and take our bags.

560
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,955
What happened?

561
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:34,236
I'll take you to the hospital. Quick, quick. Put him on my back!

562
00:34:34,236 --> 00:34:36,175
Come on. Here.

563
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,120
- Careful. 
 - Slowly.

564
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,530
- Slowly. 
 - Be careful.

565
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,740
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

566
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,878
- Let's go. 
 - Go on.

567
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:43,960
- Go. 
 - Go.

568
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,090
Where is he? What's the diagnosis?

569
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,130
A hamstring injury. It's pretty bad.

570
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,490
Is it that way?

571
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,340
Huan Er, sit down.

572
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,240
Calm down. Take a seat.

573
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,450
His parents are inside.

574
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,120
Let's wait here.

575
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,880
Will he need surgery?

576
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:16,820
My dad recommended conservative treatment.

577
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,020
How long will it take to recover?

578
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,810
The recovery period will take at least a few months.

579
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,620
Uncle, Auntie.

580
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,130
You guys need not worry.

581
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,050
Right now, we should believe in him.

582
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:46,450
Aunt Jing, why are you the one comforting me?

583
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,470
Habit, I guess.

584
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,220
Song Cong.

585
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,090
Huan Er.

586
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,650
Xi Chi wouldn't tell us anything.

587
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,340
You're his close friends.

588
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,620
Please talk to him for us.

589
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,780
We will. Don't worry.

590
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,940
Okay, it's getting late. We'll be here.

591
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,490
You guys can go home; you still have classes tomorrow.

592
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,220
Then...

593
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,350
Then we'll leave first.

594
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,610
Our boy asked me to give this to you. 
    

595
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,900
He said you might change your mind if you watched him play.

596
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,800
I didn't give it to you.

597
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,650
I reckon he went too hard and got injured.

598
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,940
Anyway, back to the main point.

599
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,470
What's so wrong about playing soccer?

600
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,900
Jing.

601
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,300
Don't you put up a front with me.

602
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,090
Didn't we agree to stand on the same page?

603
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,170
You said he's in a rebellious phase, and we should give him some room.

604
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,130
I'll be the bad cop, and you're the good cop.

605
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,940
Sooner or later, he won't be able to handle it and will give it up.

606
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,340
Now what? You blame everything on me. I'm responsible while you get a pass.

607
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,860
I knew it.

608
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:25,090
When you were being the good cop, you had a different idea.

609
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,720
Now you're going overboard.

610
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,460
All I wanted was the best for our son.

611
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,820
What's wrong with playing soccer?

612
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:35,090
You wanted the best for him? In what way? Is being bedridden the best for him?

613
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,650
To be frank, I was giving you respect.

614
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,699
I know you weren't able to be a professional soccer player.

615
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:44,740
That's why you forced your dream upon your son.

616
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:52,050
I failed to go pro because your family thought there was no future in it.

617
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,970
To put it bluntly, you despise soccer.

618
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,380
Jing Li Qiang.

619
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,220
Where is your conscience?

620
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,090
I despise it? If I despised it, I wouldn't have married you!

621
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,350
Fine, whatever. We'll never be on the same page!

622
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,390
You're back, Huan Er?

623
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,470
Mom.

624
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:38,870
Tell me the truth about Jing Xi Chi's condition.

625
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,300
Hard to say.

626
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,260
Song Cong's dad said it's not looking great.

627
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,190
What does that mean?

628
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,740
It is common when it comes to athletes like him who push their bodies to the limit.

629
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,130
Look, he has a hamstring injury.

630
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,300
He should recover swiftly, but there's a higher chance of future injuries.

631
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,479
It's hard to say if he can return to his former condition.

632
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:06,740
That's why you should care about your health.

633
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,610
It's the foundation of all foundations.

634
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:12,700
Even if one tiny part of your body gives up,

635
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,560
no matter how big your dreams are, they'll all come crashing down.

636
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,450
That...

637
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,220
That sounds pretty serious.

638
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,950
It's up to his recovery. Maybe he'll recover well. Right?

639
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,280
Okay, it's late.

640
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,130
You should go to bed. You have classes tomorrow.

641
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,700
 He has a hamstring injury. 

642
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,860
 He should recover swiftly, but there's a higher chance for future injuries. 

643
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,120
 It's hard to say if he can return to his former condition. 

644
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,610
 What about you? 

645
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,220
 Do you want to play soccer? 

646
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,940
 I guess. 

647
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,135
 Do you really think I can't support myself? 

648
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:37,726
 I want to get into Sports University because it's my dream to play soccer. 

649
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,040
 I achieve my goal in a roundabout way, okay? 

650
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,740
 I'm going to represent our school in the inter-high school soccer league. 

651
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,090
 That's awesome. 

652
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,660
 It's your chance to make the school proud. 

653
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,830
 Of course. 

654
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,850
 Are you all right? 

655
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,890
   

656
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,010
   

657
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,450
   

658
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,980
   

659
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:30,020
 There's no way for me to know how it feels when a soccer fanatic injures his leg. 

660
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,940
 Mom's words keep circling in my head. 

661
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:43,130
 Dreams seem brilliant but are actually so fragile. 

662
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:50,710
 Even if one tiny part of your body gives up, no matter how big your dreams are, they'll all come crashing down. 

663
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,520
 No matter how hard you try, how persistent you are, 

664
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,560
 and how much passion you have, it can all become meaningless. 

665
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,160
 Are you all right?
