(The Last Lesson)

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,800
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year.

17
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,790
I really want to set off fireworks.

18
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,580
Song and I searched everywhere,

19
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,580
but there was no one selling it.

20
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,830
Is he okay?

21
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,860
He's fine.

22
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,670
He drank less than half a bottle.

23
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,270
Only half a bottle?

24
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,390
He's considered
to perform exceptionally well today.

25
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,670
Have you drunk alcohol before?

26
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,670
Just once.

27
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,740
We just graduated
from junior middle school,

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,230
and his mom insisted
that he join the international class.

29
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,860
We both felt like the sky was falling,

30
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,860
so we had a drink to say goodbye.

31
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,180
He only took a sip

32
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,420
and slept the whole day.

33
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,270
Since then,

34
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,950
we never drank again.

35
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,700
I think

36
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,180
you two have a pretty good relationship.

37
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,990
We've been in the same class
from kindergarten

38
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,460
to junior middle school.

39
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,670
Even the teacher said
we were like twins,

40
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,110
inseparable.

41
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,020
Just like

42
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,990
I never thought

43
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,550
that one day
I would be separated from my parents.

44
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,790
Are you okay?

45
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm okay.

46
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,460
Give me a hand.

47
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,700
Help him to the bedroom.

48
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,510
The floor is cold.

49
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,680
Don't let him catch a cold.

50
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,900
Song.

51
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,470
Get up, Song.

52
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,180
Lie down.

53
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,110
I feel dizzy.

54
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,150
I'll get you a glass of water.

55
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,990
Jing Xichi.

56
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,670
Jing Xichi.

57
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,380
(Sad, I think I will be alone forever.
Misery. Sorry. It's my fault)

58
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,100
(Sad, I think I will be alone forever.
Misery. Sorry. It's my fault)

59
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,150
Jing Xichi!

60
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,550
Jing Xichi!

61
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,110
Jing Xichi.

62
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,060
Jing Xichi.

63
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,670
Jing Xichi!

64
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,620
Jing Xichi!

65
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
Jing Xichi!

66
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,670
Aunt Lin.

67
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,910
Aunt Lin.

68
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,710
Chen Huan'er.

69
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,990
Why did you come out?

70
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,670
I went to buy you some fireworks.

71
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,960
I searched for a long time
but couldn't find it.

72
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,230
I searched a few streets.

73
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,440
It took me a lot of effort
to find a store

74
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,590
selling fireworks.

75
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Jing Xichi.

76
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,860
Can you take your phone with you
when you go out?

77
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,740
Can't you tell me first?

78
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,740
Don't make it hard for me to find you!

79
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,950
If you do this again,

80
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,380
I won't look for you anymore!

81
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,780
Do you know

82
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,500
that when I opened my eyes
and saw you were gone,

83
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,710
I...

84
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,830
I thought...

85
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,260
Didn't I go buy fireworks for you?

86
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,430
Didn't you just say you wanted to play?

87
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,260
I searched several streets
and didn't find it.

88
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,660
It wasn't easy to find.

89
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,470
Huan'er.

90
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,660
Sorry.

91
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,140
I'll make sure
you can always find me in the future.

92
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,500
Stop crying.

93
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,710
Come on.

94
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,590
I'll take you to set off fireworks.

95
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,590
Look, I bought sparklers for you.

96
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,380
Here. Take this.

97
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,470
Stop crying.

98
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,190
Cheer up.

99
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,840
Happy Chinese New Year.

100
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,350
Chen Huan'er.

101
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,260
(I don't know)

102
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,260
(why I cried.)

103
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,350
What are you doing?

104
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,070
(Adolescence is complex.)

105
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,500
(At least I didn't understand)

106
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,740
(the complex emotions back then.)

107
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,620
(All I know)

108
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,470
(is that Jing Xichi)

109
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,310
(is very important to me.)

110
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,020
(I'm happy)

111
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,900
(if he's happy.)

112
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,260
(I'm upset)

113
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,310
(if he's upset.)

114
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,950
Chen Huan'er.

115
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,260
Everything

116
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,780
will be fine.

117
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,590
(I know Jing Xichi
forced himself to smile.)

118
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,020
(But even if I can't comfort him,)

119
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,350
(I also want to be by his side)

120
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,540
(and accompany him
through the most difficult moments.)

121
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,740
Let's light another one up.

122
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,860
Happy Chinese New Year, Chen Huan'er!

123
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,620
Happy Chinese New Year, Jing Xichi!

124
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,310
Sun Hanyu.

125
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,500
Have you not washed your hair in a week?

126
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,110
Shut up.

127
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,540
It's only been three days.

128
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,780
Only

129
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,540
three days?

130
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,140
Stop being sarcastic.

131
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,560
You think I don't want to wash it?

132
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,800
Guys have short hair,
so you can wash it in five minutes.

133
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,660
It takes me an hour

134
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
to wash and blow dry it.

135
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,430
It's annoying.

136
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,660
(Although Senior Three's revision)

137
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,900
(has entered a fierce stage,)

138
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,660
(Jing Xichi)

139
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,020
(is finally getting better.)

140
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,710
(I felt a little upset)

141
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,660
(when Jing Xichi's results
surpassed mine.)

142
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,900
(I even made an excuse)

143
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,430
(that he had short hair)

144
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,660
(and easier to wash,)

145
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,830
(so he had)

146
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,020
(a lot more time to study.)

147
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,780
(Good Luck!)

148
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,700
(Good Luck!)

149
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:47,340
(Good Luck!)

150
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,430
Chen Huan'er.

151
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,860
Chen Huan'er.

152
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,940
What are you doing?

153
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,380
Have you become stupid
from studying?

154
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,260
I'm memorizing words.

155
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,070
Hurry up.

156
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,080
We're going to be late
for English tuition class.

157
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,540
We're skipping today.

158
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,070
I'll take you to another English class

159
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:20,990
for a change.

160
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,590
Come on.

161
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,420
Where are we going?

162
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,820
Tell me where we're going first.

163
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,780
We're learning English.

164
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,860
Learning English?

165
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,710
Is this what you mean

166
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,020
by learning English?

167
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,190
Why can't we learn English
by watching movies?

168
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,780
We're watching How to Train Your Dragon.

169
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,900
We can relax and practice our listening.

170
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,460
It's killing two birds with one stone.

171
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,540
If you want to watch a movie,
just say so.

172
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,740
It's mainly

173
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,990
to feel the vibe.

174
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,780
What...

175
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,080
What's the most important thing
in learning English?

176
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,140
The vibe.

177
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,990
Stupid.

178
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,590
Stupid.

179
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,900
Why do you carry a small notebook
everywhere like Du Man?

180
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,740
Give it back.

181
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,860
Give it back.
You're hindering my studies.

182
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,070
Watch the movie.

183
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,920
I'll ask questions after the movie.

184
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,540
Why are you looking at me?

185
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,710
I just realized

186
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,040
that you look a lot like it.

187
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,500
Who?

188
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,710
That one.

189
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,800
Do you mean the female warrior?

190
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,190
Yes.

191
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,900
The dragon next to the female warrior.

192
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,740
The one that flies.

193
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,660
You're the one who looks like a dragon.

194
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,830
Surrender to me.

195
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,020
Surrender to me.

196
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,380
Can you stop talking?

197
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,540
Li Tian?

198
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,140
Why are you here?

199
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,380
Don't you have tuition classes?

200
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,660
How dare you ask me?

201
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,740
Why are you here?

202
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,860
Are you on a date?

203
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,500
We're learning English.

204
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,720
What about you?

205
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,070
I'm here to learn English too.

206
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,710
But don't tell my parents.

207
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,110
Why are you pretending?

208
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,800
How does it feel to skip class?

209
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,470
Don't worry.

210
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,840
We will never tell your parents.

211
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,800
We won't tell them.

212
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,500
Don't worry.

213
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,880
Could you three just be quiet?

214
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,140
Sorry.

215
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,140
Sorry.

216
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,830
Chen Huan'er.

217
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,020
Have you never had popcorn?

218
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,830
Popcorn is my favorite.

219
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,140
I can't believe you.

220
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,070
Eat more.

221
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,470
(Time flies.)

222
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,470
(Winter is finally over.)

223
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,870
(As the leaves turn green again,)

224
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,300
(the gloom of Uncle Jing's death
gradually fades away.)

225
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,100
(Everyone's life is back on track.)

226
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,950
(Our time is filled with study.)

227
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,060
(The occasional sorrow
is like a shooting star)

228
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,780
(that flashes by.)

229
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,470
(Every day,
I do exercises besides memorizing.)

230
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,670
(Although it's repetitive,)

231
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,390
(there's also)

232
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,190
(a sense of security in being on track.)

233
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:26,100
(Countdown to Gaokao)

234
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,910
A.

235
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,150
No, pick B.

236
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,900
B isn't right either. Pick C.

237
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,100
No.

238
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,020
Pick D.

239
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,870
How come all this is right?

240
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,670
Pick A, B, C, and D.

241
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,840
This is a multiple-choice question.

242
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,700
Li Tian, have you become stupid
from studying too much?

243
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,340
Take a break.

244
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,160
Continue studying
when you're clear-headed.

245
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,720
You can't even understand the questions.

246
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,680
How can you study?

247
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,740
(Many people said they would never
want to return to Senior Three,)

248
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,820
(but I miss the night study session
when the power was out.)

249
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,910
Is there a power outage?

250
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,540
Calm down.

251
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,390
It must be a power outage.

252
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,990
Students.

253
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,950
Stop what you're doing.

254
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,230
I have a few words

255
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,190
to tell you.

256
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,020
Give me a few minutes.

257
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,710
And give yourselves

258
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,540
a few minutes.

259
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,500
Okay?

260
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,150
Students of Senior Three Class 5.

261
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,470
Today is the last time

262
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,020
you will sit in this class

263
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,150
before Gaokao.

264
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,340
I should have

265
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,470
emphasized the key exam points more

266
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,580
or reminded you

267
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,630
about what to prepare

268
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,190
before the exam.

269
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,020
But I suddenly thought

270
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,820
that I should talk

271
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,660
about something
more important than key exam points.

272
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,020
I've taken care of you for three years.

273
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,630
During these three years,

274
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,300
I forced you

275
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,580
to answer countless exam papers

276
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,430
and filled your mind

277
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,300
with countless standard answers.

278
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,740
But what I really want to say

279
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,060
is that there's no standard answer
in life.

280
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,340
You can memorize the answers,

281
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,580
but it is best not to copy your life.

282
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
An exam

283
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,740
may affect your life,

284
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,340
but it can't determine your life.

285
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,990
No matter what the result is,

286
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,500
you must try your best

287
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,990
to live your own life

288
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,190
without regrets.

289
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,260
Have you kept that in mind?

290
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,060
(During the last lesson
of senior middle school life,)

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,150
(I'm very grateful to Mr. Xu)

292
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,300
(for telling us that.)

293
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,540
(But I'm more grateful)

294
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:08,020
(that the sudden power outage)

295
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,580

sleep a little longer?

It's noon, and you're still sleeping?

I'm telling you.

329
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,500
Song and I have already

330
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,640
put away those old books.

331
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,740
We're planning to sell them

332
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,320
and earn some money to have a good meal.

333

I'm almost done putting them away too.

Those are books and papers.

336
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,670
Sell them all.

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,280
You kept those from
primary school and junior middle school?

I'd like to see
what's so precious about it.

Yeah.

I didn't know you were quite cute
when you were little.

349
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,910
What do you mean by that?

350
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,230
Am I not cute now?

351
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,470
You're a weirdo now.

352
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,660
You're the weirdest
in the whole compound.

353
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,820

354
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,120
no one dares to sit next to you.

Who are you calling a weirdo?
Give it back.

356
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,020
I used to be popular. Alright?

357
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,150
You don't behave

358
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,190
like a girl at all.

359
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,060
Who will like you?

360
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,150

00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,150
in the photo?

362
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,060
Let me introduce you formally.

363
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,740
He's my Sishui's childhood friend.

364
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,950
His name is Yu.

365
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,880
I get along the best
with him in all of Sishui.

366
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,910
He was so good-looking
when he was a kid.

367
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,100
Fair-skinned and clean,
and he has big eyes.

368
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,740
And he's particularly popular.

369
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,390
The people there call him
the Prince of Sishui.

370
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,940
Those who were good-looking
when they were young

371
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,620
usually grow up to be ugly, okay?

372
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,300
Why do you sound

373
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,500
a bit jealous?

374
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,500
I'm not jealous.

375
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,300
Besides,

376
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,260
no matter how close you were,

377
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,120
you haven't been
in touch for years, right?

378
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,920
Who said we haven't been in touch?

379
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,060
We just got in touch yesterday.
He's visiting today.

380
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,780
He's visiting you today?

381
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,020
Later.

382
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,950
Later?

383
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,740
Why didn't you tell me just now?

384
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,820
You didn't ask.

385
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,230
Huan'er.

386
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,230
Yu is downstairs.

387
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,340
Help me get him.

388
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,190
Wait.

389
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,870
Yu, right?

390
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,840
Let me meet him first.

391
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,470
What Yu?

392
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,990
Are you

393
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,540
the Prince of Sishui?

394
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,540
I'm Jing Xichi.

395
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,060
I'm Chen Huan'er's neighbor

396
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,740
and best friend.

397
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,340
I'm probably older than you.

398
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,710
You can call me Big Boss Chi.

399
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,580
When it comes to brotherhood among men,

400
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,300
it's not about age,

401
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,580
but about ability.

402
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,870
Yu.

403
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,580
You're here.

404
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,400
Come on.
We've waited for you for a long time.

405
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,920
Let's go.

406
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:21,910
This way.

407
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,540
I'm telling you.

408
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,960
My parents kept talking about you.

409
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,950
Yu.

410
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,760
You must be tired
from your journey here.

411
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,580
I'm alright.

412
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,870
Do as I say. You hear me?

413
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,100
What are you up to?

414
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,670
How cute.

415
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,630
Fair and chubby.

416
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,780
You're more handsome.

417
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,630
Be gentle.

418
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,320
You're even more handsome
as you grow up.

419
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,710
How did it go?

420
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,910
How did you do in Gaokao?

421
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,870
I did alright.

422
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,990
I performed as usual.

423
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,740
You'll be okay then. Here.

424
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,780
Have a strawberry.

425
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,230
No.

426
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,870
Eat it.

427
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,260
Chen Huan'er.

428
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,060
How obedient.

429
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,670
Can you be a little more reserved?

430
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,870
What's wrong?

431
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,080
We slept in the same bed

432
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,950
when we were little.

433
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,740
Right? Yu.

434
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Right?

435
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,780
Yes, you're right.

436
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,020
Chen Huan'er.

437
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,430
You're really a weirdo.

438
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:27,470
Here.

439
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,150
Yu.

440
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,060
Have another one.

441
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,910
I can't take it anymore.

442
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,420
I need to go to the toilet first.

443
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,740
The toilet is over there. Hurry.

444
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,340
How obedient.

445
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,340
Chen Huan'er, did you do it on purpose?

446
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,500
What am I doing on purpose?

447
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,710
Why are you

448
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,740
so pretentious today?

449
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,960
This is how I act around him.

450
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,320
If you don't like it, don't watch.

451
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,470
Food's ready.

452
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,820
Xichi.

453
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,340
Uncle Chen isn't around.

454
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,140
We're only having a simple meal at home.

455
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,840
Sure, Aunt Lina.

456
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,540
Where's Yu?

457
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,950
Toilet.

458
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,190
Yu.

459
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,390
Food's ready.

460
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,100
Hurry. Here, eat.

461
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,150
Yu.

462
00:29:59,300 --> 00:29:59,870
Here.

463
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,670
Sit here.

464
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,740
- Sit.
- Here, Yu.

465
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,740
Sit with me.

466
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,060
Here, sit beside me.

467
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,870
Mom's cooking smells so good.

468
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,670
You must eat more, Yu.

469
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,390
Yu.

470
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,780
It's your first time here
since we moved here.

471
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,390
It's nice here, right?

472
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,580
I looked around just now.

473
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,820
The environment here is good.

474
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,560
Right?

475
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,540
You've lost weight. Eat more.

476
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,060
Sure.

477
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:28,870
Aunt Lina.

478
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,430
You don't have to help me with the food.

479
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,420
I'm familiar with this place.
I come here often.

480
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,300
I can do it myself.

481
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,540
Here, Yu. Eat more.

482
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,060
Isn't this your favorite meat?

483
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,710
Eat more.

484
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,910
Yu.

485
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,300
Stay a few more days since you're here.

486
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,300
Spend more time with Huan'er.

487
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,540
Sure.

488
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,230
Aunt Lina.

489
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,300
Let Yu

490
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,820
stay at my place tonight.

491
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,020
Why should Yu stay at your place?

492
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,820
I just think

493
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,630
Yu's a guy.

494
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,580
Surely it would be

495
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,660
somewhat inconvenient

496
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,980
for him to stay the night.

497
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,540
No.

498
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,150
Yu, do you think it's inconvenient?

499
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,190
How is that possible? Auntie Lina.

500
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,190
Yeah.

501
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,780
What's inconvenient about Yu staying
at his aunt's and cousin's house?

502
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,620
You're funny.

503
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,500
What did you call Aunt Lina?

504
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,060
Auntie Lina.

505
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,150
So Chen Huan'er is your...

506
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,260
Cousin.

507
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:26,870
Yeah.

508
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,580
Nothing, Aunt Lina.

509
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,190
I... Well...

510
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,140
The food looks good.

511
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,800
No, well...

512
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,630
The sun is nice.

513
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,470
No, I got to go.

514
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,390
I got to go, Aunt Lina.

515
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,670
Well...

516
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,100
What's come over him?

517
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,150
Nothing.

518
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,710
Here.

519
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,580
You did good.

520
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,430
Have a prawn.

521
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,430
Here.

522
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,060
Why are you so strange today?

523
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,670
What's wrong with me?

524
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,950
You're overly enthusiastic.

525
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,580
Did you take the wrong pill?

526
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,390
Hey!

527
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,910
Don't ask so much. Eat.

528
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,710
Don't hit him.

529
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,020
I didn't, Mom.

530
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,500
It was just a pat.

531
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:06,910
Eat.

532
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,080
Why did you call me here?

533
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:19,990
Sit.

534
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,100
Why are you looking at me?

535
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,950
Has Prince of Sishui left?

536
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,150
Yeah.

537
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,000
He left after staying for two days.

538
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,670
Prince of Sishui?

539
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,020
She said he was her childhood friend

540
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,580
and her best friend,

541
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,980
but he's actually her cousin.

542
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,190
Chen Huan'er.

543
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,430
Don't you think you're silly?

544
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,900
Do you think it's funny to trick me?

545
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,150
Didn't you say it first?

546
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,480
You said I don't behave like a girl

547
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,620
and that nobody will like me.

548
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,040
Song.

549
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,950
In what way do I not behave like a girl?

550
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,670
How am I

551
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,710
not worthy of being liked?

552
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,990
You're...

553
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,190
worthy.

554
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,630
Ignore him.

555
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,150
He's just blind.

556
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,910
Look, Song said it himself.

557
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,710
Song Cong.

558
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,820
I'm upset that you said that.

559
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,300
I was even planning
to help you get rich.

560
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,580
Get rich?

561
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,190
How?

562
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,820
Didn't I tell you a few days ago

563
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,540
that I was going to sell
all our school's

564
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,980
supplementary teaching materials?

565
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,910
But then I thought,

566
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,230
no.

567
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,420
Think about it.

568
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Song's notes

569
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,990
are priceless.

570
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,230
If we sell it by weight,

571
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,380
we'll lose a lot of money.

572
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,580
Right?

573
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,190
You have a point.

574
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:30,870
So?

575
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,740
So

576
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,300
I'm going to put them up

577
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,500
for sale on a website

578
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,020
and sell them at a marked price.

579
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,950
So you mean

580
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,780
you want to register as a seller online?

581
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:41,990
Chen Huan'er.

582
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,600
Can you broaden
your perspective a little?

583
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,580
What's wrong with me?

584
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,100
He just wants to set up

585
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,950
a second-hand book trading website.

586
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,230
Yes.

587
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,100
This is a good idea.

588
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,820
Have you thought
of a name for your website?

589
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,120
It's so troublesome to think of a name.

590
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,600
Does it matter what it's called?

591
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,780
Lying on my back in bed.

592
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,990
Gazing at the roof beams
while writing a book.

593
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,220
I got it.

594
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,540
We'll call it

595
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,140
Yangwu.

596
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,830
Yangwu?

597
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,820
What do you think?

598
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,700
It sounds alright.

599
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,500
Not bad, right?

600
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,310
Not bad.

601
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:27,990
Not bad, right?

602
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,620
No one objects, right?

603
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,220
Okay.

604
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,580
Meeting adjourned.

605
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:32,750
Go home.

606
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,310
Bye.

607
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,910
Let's go, Song.

608
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,750
Sleep early.

609
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,350
Good night.

610
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,580
Jing Xichi

611
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,470
sent me away

612
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,860
as soon as he called me over.

613
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:56,660
Song.

614
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,430
I'll go now.

615
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,180
Huan'er.

616
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,760
What's the matter?

617
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,310
Nothing.

618
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,860
See you tomorrow then.

619
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,270
Okay.

620
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,750
Thank you.

621
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,580
Xinyan.

622
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,350
Help me take two.

623
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:49,950
Okay.

624
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,540
Is that all?

625
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,660
Let's go.

626
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,750
Milk tea again.

627
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,870
Everyone.

628
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,020
Drink this.

629
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,220
Everyone.

630
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,580
Let's discuss

631
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,540
where to go later.

632
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,580
What's fun?

633
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,540
Why are you so excited?

634
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,940
My mom won't control me anymore.

635
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,180
I can go out and play freely.

636
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,460
How could I not be excited?

637
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,870
Look how sorrowful he is.

638
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,430
How about we watch a movie?

639
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,220
I heard there's

640
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,700
a good romance movie recently.

641
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,910
Who wants to watch romance movies?

642
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,060
I remember

643
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,790
there's an action movie that's not bad.
Do you want to watch it?

644
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,790
You can watch it.

645
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,860
The two of us
will watch the romance movie.

646
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,220
If you ask me,

647
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,360
let's go to an Internet cafe.

648
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,500
You two can also watch movies
in the Internet cafe.

649
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,840
The three of us can play games,

650
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,830
have some instant noodles,
and add a sausage.

651
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,140
Isn't that great?

652
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,350
All you know

653
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,460
is to play online games.

654
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,580
Didn't we agree

655
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,830
on group activities?

656
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,950
Group!

657
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,660
How annoying.

658
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,220
How come we don't know

659
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,470
what to do after graduation?

660
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,790
Yeah.

661
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,700
Suddenly being able to play

662
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,400
feels a bit uncomfortable.

663
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,390
How about we go sing?

664
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,640
I still think I'm okay
with going to an Internet cafe.

665
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,910
Go to hell.

666
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,830
What's wrong?

667
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,700
Alright.

668
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,960
You boys can figure it out.

669
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,620
Huan'er.

670
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,470
There are photo booths over there.

671
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,750
Shall we take some photos?

672
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,990
Sure.

673
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,270
We should take a photo after graduation.

674
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,390
Let's go.

675
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:28,950
Go.

676
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,500
You can surf the internet yourself.

677
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,100
Bye.

678
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,910
- Bye.
- Bye.

679
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,310
Bye.

680
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,020
Bye.

681
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,660
Let's surf the internet. Go.

682
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,750
You can go yourself.

683
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,990
You prioritize romance over friendship.

685
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,350
Aren't the three of us

686
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,870
a bit out of place here?

687
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,020
Looks quite good, right?

688
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,830
Ladies, are you two done?

689
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,620
Hurry up.

690
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,060
Don't urge us. We'll be done soon.

691
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,790
Last one.

692
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,270
This one looks good.

693
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,180
Take a photo too.

694
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,000
You're here anyway.

695
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,580
Come on.

696
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,020
No.

697
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,440
I'm not taking any photos either.

698
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,350
Hurry up.

699
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,960
I still want to go to the internet cafe.

700
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,060
Then you two can shoot.

701
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,960
Take a photo.

702
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,060
- We've graduated. Take a photo.
- No, I don't want to.

703
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,220
Here, hurry up.

704
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:48,620
No.

705
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,280
We're taking the photo without you.

706
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,870
I'll take a photo then.

707
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,660
Just one photo.

708
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,020
Wait, Jing Xichi.

709
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,060
Hold this for me.

710
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,870
I'll help you one more time.

711
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,100
Let's go.

712
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:10,830
Wait.

713
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,620
Add me in.

714
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,270
Looks good.

715

from studying?

Find a book to read.

00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,500
You haven't been here in a long time.

756
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,140
The study pressure
in Senior Three must be tough.

757
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,310
Yes, it is.

758
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,950
The girl

759
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,060
who used to come with you

760
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,790
hasn't been here in a long time too.

761
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,020
Here. Take it.

762
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,540
Be careful. It's hot.

763
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,020
This taro cake

764
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,020
tastes better when shared.

765
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,580
That's not a problem.
We'll come here often.

766
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,430
Huan'er.

767
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,350
Qi Qi.

768
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,310
Huan'er.

769
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,060
(I hope)

770
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,060
(Qi Qi and Huan'er)

771
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,830
(can be friends forever.)

772
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,310
You and I

773
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,830
are never from the same world.

774
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,220
You don't want
to be friends with me anymore?

775
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:00,700
Qi Qi.
