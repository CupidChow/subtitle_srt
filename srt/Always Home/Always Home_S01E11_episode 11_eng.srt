1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,860


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,840
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,990
Xi Chi.

18
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,300
It's almost time. Why don't you go in first?

19
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,780
Do lots of warm-ups.

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,580
I'll get going then, Mom.

21
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,700
- Here. 
 - Take care.

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,860
I'm off.

23
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,240
Be careful.

24
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,040
- Hi. 
 - I'm Jing Xi Chi.

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,940
All right, you're good to go.

26
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,600
Good luck!

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,140
   

28
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,060
   

29
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,700
   

30
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,750
He's pretty fast.

31
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,860
How was it?

32
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,400
- Uncle, you're here! 
 - Hey, Huan Er.

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,320
Over there. Look.

34
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,590
That's great!

35
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,160
We're here!

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,900
- Dad, why are you here? 
 - I came to see you.

37
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,510
Did you see that goal I scored?

38
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,320
That was incredible!

39
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,120
- You played well. 
 - Coach Li is over there, let's go talk to him.

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
- Catch your breath first. 
 - Take a break.

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,640
- All right. 
 - Here, have some water.

42
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,260
- Well done, Xi Chi. 
 - Of course! What did you expect?

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,620
But for this red string, I tested it for you.

44
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,740
It really works.

45
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,880
See? I told you.

46
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,127
- I'll give it back to you. 
 - No.

47
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:09,180
Wait until you pass the final selection, then return it to me.

48
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,260
Okay.

49
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,060
Jing Xi Chi, come fill out this form.

50
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,740
- Coming. 
 - Give it to me.

51
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,260
I'm going.

52
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,740
Congratulations!

53
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,000
What's wrong?

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,040
Didn't you pass the preliminary selection? You don't look too happy.

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,498
It's nothing.

56
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,470
I just haven't been on the field for a long time.

57
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,740
I suddenly had to play so aggressively today. I'm just a bit tired.

58
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,850
Come on, you're not telling the truth.

59
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,720
Honestly... today was me at my best.

60
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,860
But compared to the academy players, there's still a gap.

61
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,540
And that gap will only get bigger.

62
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,540
Is it because of your leg?

63
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,520
They have professional coaches guiding them.

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,812
So, of course, the conditions aren't equal.

65
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:43,790
But you made it to the preliminary selection. It means you have what it takes.

66
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,260
Oh, please don't tell Huan Er about this.

67
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,930
Why?

68
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,220
I just don't want her to worry.

69
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,669
Don't worry.

70
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:07,640
There's no need to mention it anyway.

71
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,400
I know you'll make it to the final selection.

72
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,910
How do you know?

73
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,470
Because you're Jing Xi Chi.

74
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,280
My best buddy, Jing Xi Chi, would never give up.

75
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,705
All right.

76
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:31,830
Buddy, with your words, I'm confident now.

77
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,710
All right, what are we sitting here for?

78
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,060
- Let's go and eat. 
 - Let's go!

79
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,250
I've been craving Aunt Hao's cooking.

80
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,210
Come to my house.

81
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,550
Dad.

82
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,740
What happened? Is something wrong?

83
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,520
I just wanted to ask. Is there any more advanced surgery

84
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,620
that could help Xi Chi recover fully?

85
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,480
Right now, there aren't any better surgical options.

86
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,940
Getting him back to his original state probably isn't realistic.

87
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,690
That's why I recommended conservative treatment.

88
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,060
Don't overthink it.

89
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,540
   

90
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,030
 My mom made me wear this red string since I was little. 

91
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,510
 Consider it me sharing some of my luck with you. 

92
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,220
 It should help a bit, right? 

93
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,580
   

94
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:59,260
   

95
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,730
You're here.

96
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,740
Huan Er, thank you.

97
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Without your red string, I wouldn't have made it to the final selection.

98
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,160
I learned a lot today.

99
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,990
Let's go.

100
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,880
   

101
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,380
This novel by Haruki Murakami 
    

102
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,850
was largely inspired by Faulkner's Barn Burning.

103
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,760
You didn't even copy from the right source.

104
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,040
You think your mom only reads contracts all day?

105
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,830
Half of these books were mine when I was younger.

106
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,490
You actually read books like these?

107
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,040
Writing depends on talent.

108
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,010
It's not just about reading a bunch of books.

109
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,760
If you're just stacking fancy words together, that's fine for school essays,

110
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,160
but for real writing, it's impossible.

111
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,260
Losing a competition isn't a big deal.

112
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,250
It's just a small setback in your life. 
    

113
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,800
Hold on. Why do you always speak that way?

114
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,850
Can't you at least encourage me?

115
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,110
Of course, I can.

116
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,970
I could say, "My dear, you're awesome! It's okay even if you don't do it well."

117
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,330
But the reality is harsh.

118
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,440
I have to tell you the truth to equip you for the real world.

119
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,920
That again...

120
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:49,591
   

121
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:50,990
Oral surgery?

122
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,350
We have a patient here who fell and broke his teeth.

123
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,880
This morning has been exhausting. It's like splitting myself into eight pieces.

124
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,220
You just need more training.

125
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,041
Back when I worked in the operating room, I was way more tired than this.

126
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,190
Isn't this just the nature of our job?

127
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,310
Head nurse, did you hear the news?

128
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,603
- What happened? 
 - That resident doctor who was on duty here

129
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:13,901
is resigning due to high work pressure.

130
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:19,760
If all the new doctors are like him, one day we might not even be able to hire anyone.

131
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,020
 Doctor! We need a doctor, quickly! 

132
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,982
- There's bleeding. 
 - Please remain silent.

133
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:25,140
Hurry, hurry!

134
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,140
Sure. Go to Dr. Gu.

135
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,600
All right. Does anyone have any problem with this question?

136
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,260
 No. 

137
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,910
Ms. Guo.

138
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,700
Song Cong.

139
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,710
Please come out for a while.

140
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,070
Dad! What happened? 
    

141
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,910
How's Mom?

142
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,590
Intracranial hemorrhage.

143
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,830
It doesn't look good.

144
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,540
How did this happen?

145
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,520
What exactly happened?

146
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,580
There was an accident in the emergency room.

147
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,900
 From what I heard, the emergency patient wasn't that critical. 

148
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,520
 But their family got agitated and wanted to go into the emergency room. 

149
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,900
 Your Aunt Hao Mei tried to stop him, to hold him back. 

150
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,140
 But that person gave Aunt Hao Mei a hefty shove, and her head hit the edge of the bed. 

151
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,420
 She lost consciousness right away. 

152
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,360
What kind of person does that...

153
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,706
All right, you eat something first.

154
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:59,010
I don't know what's going on. I have to go and check.

155
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,260
Mom, I'll go with you.

156
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,110
His backpack is still with me. I'll take it to him.

157
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,910
- All right. 
 - Okay.

158
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,070
Song Hang.

159
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,350
Uncle Song.

160
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,270
How is she?

161
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,310
It's hard to say right now.

162
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,750
Mom.

163
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,580
You're here.

164
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,180
Song Cong.

165
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,470
Look.

166
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,470
Song Cong, you and Huan Er can go home first.

167
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,150
Your dad and I will be here. Don't worry.

168
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,640
Aunt, I'm fine.

169
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,500
You haven't eaten yet, right?

170
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,480
What about if I go and buy you something?

171
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,450
Song Hang, come with me. Let's go together.

172
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,230
What exactly happened?

173
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,120
How did it end up like this?

174
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,876
It was an accident in the emergency room.

175
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:10,140
I never thought it would be this serious.

176
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,590
This is so...

177
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,230
How could this even happen?

178
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,750
Are you okay?

179
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,260
I grew up here.

180
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,560
Before this, I used to watch other people's families come and go.

181
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,840
It didn't really mean anything to me.

182
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:50,969
But today, seeing my mom being taken away like that...

183
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,470
I finally understand how they must have felt.

184
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,680
You guys probably know... I wasn't very healthy when I was a kid.

185
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,230
Back then, I was too young.

186
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,190
All I remember is the strong smell of disinfectant.

187
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,930
Later, my parents told me that before I turned five,

188
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,010
I had to stay here for treatments all the time.

189
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:49,470
At that time, what I remember most is how worried my parents looked.

190
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,930
Even now,

191
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,810
I still feel guilty about it.

192
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,290
I believe Aunt Hao, just like little me back then,

193
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,790
wouldn't want you to feel sad seeing her like this.

194
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,710
Song Cong, Aunt Hao's always been strong.

195
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,440
She will be okay.

196
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,190
Huan Er.

197
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,340
Thank you.

198
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,960
 Honestly, I don't know if my words actually comforted Song Cong. 

199
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,770
 Perhaps, in this moment, in Song Cong's eyes, all words felt utterly powerless. 

200
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,840
 The healer of wounds is only time. 

201
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,978
You finally showed up.

202
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:19,400
What exactly happened last night? You didn't explain it clearly.

203
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,960
She... she's still in the ICU.

204
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,540
She hasn't woken up yet.

205
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,610
It's that serious?

206
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,340
My mom told me it wasn't serious and not to worry...

207
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,150
It's pretty serious.

208
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,770
Let's just wait for Aunt Hao to wake up.

209
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,060
Then...

210
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,330
What about Song? Is he okay?

211
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,640
I don't think he'll come to school today.

212
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,920
Let's go.

213
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,680
Did you hear the news?

214
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,130
Song Cong's mom got hurt and is paralyzed.

215
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,580
- Really? 
 - Yes.

216
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,950
So that's why Mr. Xu called him yesterday.

217
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,640
That's right. He didn't even finish class before he left.

218
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,594
Is it true? Who told you?

219
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:20,840
Stop making wild guesses.

220
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,720
I think Xin Yan is right.

221
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,540
If this spreads, it won't be good for any of us.

222
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,610
Exactly.

223
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,740
Song Cong has always been a good guy.

224
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,440
Are you handing in your physics homework or not?

225
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:35,200
Come to the bathroom with me.

226
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,630
I want to go too.

227
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,020
It's so stuffy in here. Let's go.

228
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,480
Stop writing. Let's go to the bathroom.

229
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,190
Let's go.

230
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,440
Let's go.

231
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,630
I'm heading to the bathroom first.

232
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,600
Me too.

233
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,610
I just heard about your family.

234
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,760
How is your mom?

235
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,700
She hasn't woken up yet.

236
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,430
If you need to file a lawsuit, my mom might be able to help.

237
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,430
- No need. Actually, I— 
 - You can ask me for help.

238
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,670
Thanks.

239
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,060
How is she?

240
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,180
She's awake now.

241
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,150
We'll keep monitoring her. Don't worry too much.

242
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,930
 Your mom... 

243
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,780
has nerve damage.

244
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,340
Her right leg's motor function is impaired.

245
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,510
When she will be able to stand again depends on her recovery.

246
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,680
But the good news is she's out of danger and has been moved to a general ward.

247
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,031
I plan to transfer her to the city hospital.

248
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:26,331
The conditions there are better.

249
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,710
Dad.

250
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,680
Does Mom know about her condition yet?

251
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,700
No, she doesn't know.

252
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:51,261
All right, I'm heading to the hospital.

253
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,810
 When I saw my dad break down in tears, I don't know why I hid. 

254
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,100
 Maybe I was afraid of facing his helplessness. 

255
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,810
 Or maybe I was afraid of facing my own powerlessness. 

256
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,300
 Wanting to be a good parent isn't wrong. 

257
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,131
 But they love their children so much that they forget themselves. 

258
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:40,990
 They demand of themselves to be unbreakable in front of me, 

259
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,500
 too ashamed to show vulnerability or grief. 

260
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,430
 But what I really hope for is that they speak up 

261
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,240
 so I can share the burden, too. 

262
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,870
Mom always keeps the cigarettes there.

263
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,297
 Dad, aren't you basically smoking right under her nose? 

264
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,740
 Aren't you afraid she'll find out? 

265
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,060
 Only the first pack was mine. 

266
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,540
 The rest was put by your mom. 

267
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,780
 She's known about it for a long time. 

268
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,150
 She definitely has a stash somewhere. 

269
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,430
 I just haven't found it yet. 

270
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,556
Dad, I want to transfer to an experimental high school.

271
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:35,920
I want to take care of Mom.

272
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,340
You don't have to worry about your mom.

273
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,530
Just focus on your studies.

274
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,720
Mom's always been the one taking care of us...

275
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,870
Now she needs someone to take care of her. How could I just act like nothing happened?

276
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,540
I know you're a thoughtful kid.

277
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't see you as a child either.

278
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,710
But from today on, let me handle everything.

279
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,500
Even if I can't, there's still your aunt and grandma.

280
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,150
Aunt is already busy taking care of the family.

281
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,470
Grandma is getting old.

282
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,500
Mom hates troubling others, too.

283
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,370
Telling them will only make them worry more.

284
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,130
I just want to do something for Mom.

285
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,440
Moreover, it doesn't really matter to me where I study.

286
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,620
And don't tell Mom about the transfer.

287
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,020
Transfer?

288
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,710
If Aunt Hao finds out you transferred because of her, she'll be upset.

289
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,050
Yeah. Isn't Aunt Hao most concerned about your education?

290
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,430
I can get into college no matter where I study.

291
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,880
And I've already decided.

292
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,948
My dad's been so busy with work.

293
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:02,100
Ever since my mom was transferred,

294
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,630
he's been running back and forth between two hospitals every day.

295
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,480
If this keeps up, his health will suffer, too.

296
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,990
If I transfer to an experimental high school, I'll be closer to my mom's hospital.

297
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,680
At least I can bring her meals and help out a bit.

298
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,020
Then... when are you transferring?

299
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,250
- I'm handling the documents tomorrow. 
 - That soon?

300
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,850
Sorry, you two.

301
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,500
We won't be going to school together anymore.

302
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,000
What's there to be sorry about?

303
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,020
Of course, you'd choose your mom in this situation.

304
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,230
If it were me, I'd do the same.

305
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,820
Come on... it's not like I'm abandoning you two.

306
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,520
It's fine. We still live in the same compound.

307
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,040
We can see each other anytime.

308
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:14,500
 From the first time I met Song Cong, I could already sense how mature he was. 

309
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,630
 I never expected he'd become 
   

310
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,260
 an adult before us in this way. 

311
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,820
 As a friend, all I could do was pat his shoulder to show my support. 

312
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,390
 Anything else would have felt unnecessary. 

313
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,060
You're not going to say goodbye to your classmates?

314
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,780
Mr. Xu, I'm not good at handling this kind of situation.

315
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,390
I understand. It's okay.

316
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,780
I'll let them know.

317
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,910
We'll walk you to the school gate, then.

318
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,150
It's not a farewell. Just sending you off.

319
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,490
Class is about to start. You two should stay.

320
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,060
Song Cong.

321
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,935
This is...

322
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:36,230
These are notes from the past few days. Every subject is in there. Catch up soon.

323
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,202
You have to get first place even if you get there.

324
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:41,660
Don't let anyone surpass you, okay?

325
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,674
I thought we finally had a star student in class, and now everything has changed.

326
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:52,954
We don't even have a class rep now.

327
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,990
- Isn't Li Tian still here? 
 - I'm not taking your place.

328
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,100
It's too time-consuming.

329
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,870
- I need to focus on studying. 
 - Li Tian, don't be so ungrateful.

330
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,230
I...

331
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,870
Song Cong is leaving.

332
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,850
Stop arguing.

333
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,160
Just take up the role.

334
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,060
It won't interfere with your studies.

335
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,470
Besides, you're the only one I can trust with this role.

336
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,710
Fine, I'll take it.

337
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,810
- I'm heading in now. 
 - Go ahead.

338
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,820
Well...

339
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,340
Mr. Xu.

340
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,020
Xin Yan.

341
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,020
I'll be going now.

342
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,640
Thank you for everything.

343
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,580
Take care.

344
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,950
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

345
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,540
Go on.

346
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,500
Hurry inside. Class is starting.

347
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,500
 Then do you know why I just told you all those things from my heart? 

348
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,260
 Why? 

349
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,250
 Because I like you. 

350
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:43,007
   

351
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:49,180
     
     

352
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,930
 What did you say? 

353
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,230
 I said I will become someone as outstanding as you. 

354
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:07,020
   

355
00:34:12,832 --> 00:34:15,340
   

356
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,600
 Song Cong has always been the most mature among us. 

357
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,060
 Someone has to take care of Aunt Hao. 

358
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:38,120
 Watching Uncle Song running back and forth, he couldn't just stand by and do nothing. 

359
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,390
 He never mentioned how he was doing. 

360
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,430
 I don't know if it's because he didn't want us to worry 

361
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:48,770
 or because he didn't want us to see his sadness. 

362
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,220
 When we heard that Aunt Hao's health was gradually improving, 

363
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,220
 we were all happy for Song Cong. 

364
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:05,200
 But still, on the way to school every day, it was just me and Jing Xi Chi left. 

365
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,680
 The lively times we had before were gone. 

366
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,060
Hey, you're finally discharged.

367
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,760
You really scared Song Hang this time.

368
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,500
The last time I saw his face looking that gloomy was back when we were still in school.

369
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,056
Back then, in our major, there were way more girls than boys.

370
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:13,320
Every day, we had to practice cupping therapy several times.

371
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,500
When no one was left, we pulled him over, pressed him down,

372
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,470
and everyone took turns practicing on him.

373
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,220
In the end, his whole forehead turned dark.

374
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,960
Really? That actually happened? He never told me about it.

375
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,309
I didn't have a camera back then.

376
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:30,390
If I did, I would have taken a picture, framed it, and hung it in your living room.

377
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,350
Listen to her talking nonsense.

378
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,220
Don't tell him about this, okay?

379
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,500
- Keep it a secret. 
 - Keep it a secret.

380
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,790
I caused you all a lot of trouble this time in the hospital.

381
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,020
And Huan Er, too.

382
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,870
She came so many times.

383
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,350
Daughters are the best.

384
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,220
They know how to care for people.

385
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,100
Actually, you can always have another one.

386
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,360
Who knows, maybe it will surprise you.

387
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,865
What nonsense are you talking about?

388
00:36:59,865 --> 00:37:02,790
We're already "old canned goods." As long as we don't rust, we're good.

389
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,500
Aunt Lin, is there any canned food to eat?

390
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,980
Canned food? What canned food?

391
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,500
Are the discharge procedures done?

392
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,540
All done.

393
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,760
Help tidy up.

394
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,140
Let's move your mom over here.

395
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,700
- Yeah, come on. 
 - Be careful.

396
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,020
Slowly, Mom.

397
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,760
- Careful, careful. 
 - Take it slow.

398
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,260
- I'll put in some strength. 
 - Hold her leg.

399
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,140
It's okay.

400
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,760
- It's okay. 
 - Okay?

401
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,960
- It's fine. 
 - All right, turn around.

402
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,950
Yes. That's it.

403
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,430
Great.

404
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,280
Slowly, slowly.

405
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,920
- Are you okay, Mom? 
 - Lower her down slowly.

406
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,700
- Must've worn you out. 
 - Not at all.

407
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,180
- It's good to have a son. 
 - I'm definitely not getting tired.

408
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,700
- Slowly. 
 - All right.

409
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,140
I'll take these two bags. You wheel your mom out.

410
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,620
- Be careful. 
 - Okay. I'll do it.

411
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,740
- I'll take it. 
 - I'll come back for the bags later.

412
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,140
I'll take it.

413
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,990
All right.

414
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,310
Mom, you're discharged now.

415
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,540
It's a little bumpy here.

416
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,350
It's fine.

417
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,580
Take good care of your mom.

418
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,980
- Okay. 
 - If anything comes up,

419
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,250
- just let us know. 
 - Yes, let us know.

420
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,950
Hao, we've been waiting for you to come home.

421
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,510
My husband said if you need anything, just let us know.

422
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,270
Thank you.

423
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,390
And thank Dr. Li as well.

424
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,750
We're all family. No need to thank me.

425
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,470
Hao, hurry up and go upstairs to rest.

426
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,950
Yes. Come, I'll carry you.

427
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,820
I'll do it. Let me do it.

428
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,080
You won't be able to carry me.

429
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,470
- I can. 
 - Song Hang.

430
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,920
- Don't worry. Come on. 
 - Slowly, slowly.

431
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,830
One, two, three.

432
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,220
Slowly, slowly.

433
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,900
- Watch the steps. 
 - Be careful.

434
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,120
- I'll help you pack up. 
 - No, no. It's fine, I'll do it myself.

435
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,700
It's nothing, really.

436
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,390
Hurry up and go home. You've worked hard.

437
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,480
Mom, lean on the sofa.

438
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,440
This is quite heavy.

439
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,950
- Where is she? 
 - I told her to head home.

440
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,790
Are you tired?

441
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,840
I'm fine.

442
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,908
Hang, how about we switch to a ground-floor apartment?

443
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:02,900
This back-and-forth upstairs every day is wearing you two out.

444
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,910
Mom, don't worry.

445
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,960
After transferring, I'll go with Dad to take turns taking care of you.

446
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,950
Transfer schools?

447
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,253
Why would you transfer?

448
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:15,240
Have you already transferred schools?

449
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,897
The other day, you wore a different school uniform.

450
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:19,790
You told me it was a new standardized design from the school.

451
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,020
- I was— 
 - You lied to me, didn't you?

452
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,280
No, Mom.

453
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,390
That experimental high school is really good too.

454
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:28,500
Song Hang, you agreed to this?

455
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,320
Did you even think about your college entrance exams?

456
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,100
Mom, you don't have to worry about my grades. I can still be ranked first over there.

457
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,480
This is our son's own decision.

458
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,380
He wants to take on the responsibility of being your child.

459
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,440
I believe he's capable of doing so.

460
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,180
You should respect his decision and accept his care.

461
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,241
- It's not a bad thing. 
 - It's bad!

462
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:48,891
I don't need you all to take care of me!

463
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:51,260
I'm not completely paralyzed.

464
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,956
I don't need you to worry about me.

465
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:55,560
All right. That's enough now.

466
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,620
You shouldn't get too worked up in your condition.

467
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,160
It's about mealtime. I'll go buy some food.

468
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,534
Take good care of your mom.

469
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,180
I don't need you to look after me.

470
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,700
Leave. All of you, just leave!

471
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,160
Why are you going through all this formal nonsense?

472
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,664
Do you think Aunt Hao needs this pot of flowers?

473
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:32,830
You know you're going to have an allergy flare-up later.

474
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,910
That's why I told you to stay away from me.

475
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:40,990
Song Cong said Aunt Hao had already prepared matching scarves for her trip.

476
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,750
With this unexpected situation, she must be feeling awful.

477
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,680
You boys just don't understand a mother's feelings at all.

478
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,875
Oh, and you do?

479
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:51,220
So when are you dropping that off?

480
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:55,060
Right now. I'll just leave it at their door.

481
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,820
Do you smell something burning?

482
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,750
Really? No, I don't.

483
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,790
Wait, it is coming from Aunt Hao's house!

484
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,580
- Aunt Hao! 
 - Is anyone home? Open the door!

485
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,350
There's so much smoke! I'll make a call.

486
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,310
- What could we do? 
 - Cong, hurry! Open the door!

487
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,040
- Open the door! 
 - Is Aunt Hao home alone?

488
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,385
My mom is still inside!

489
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:20,750
Hao Mei!

490
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,140
- Aunt Hao! 
 - Hao Mei, say something!

491
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,500
Aunt Hao!

492
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,080
Mom!

493
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,990
- Aunt Hao! 
 - Aunt Hao!

494
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,290
- Fire... 
 - Hao Mei!

495
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,750
Are you okay?

496
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,160
- Aunt Hao! 
 - Come on!

497
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,910
- Aunt Hao! 
 - Mom, are you all right?

498
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,300
Go away, Huan Er.

499
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,850
You and Xi Chi leave. Go!

500
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,270
- Go now! 
 - Aunt Hao, we'll leave first.

501
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,470
Don't touch me.

502
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,750
Did you get burned anywhere?

503
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,110
- Are you hurt? 
 - Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

504
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,060
It's fine.

505
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,190
I'll take you to change clothes.

506
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,250
It's fine. It's fine.

507
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:25,030


508
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:30,260
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

509
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:36,370
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

510
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:43,340
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

511
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:49,770
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

512
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:55,960
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

513
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:03,970
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

514
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:10,800
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

515
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,380
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

516
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:24,080
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

517
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,040
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

518
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,160
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

519
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,880
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

520
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,440
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

521
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,710
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

522
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:51,600
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

523
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,500
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

524
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:00,440
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

525
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,230
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

526
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,670
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

527
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:12,080
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

528
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:18,260
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

529
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:23,760
♫  At the right time  ♫
