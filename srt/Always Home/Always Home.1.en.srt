(The Fallen Star of Sishui)

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,799
Huan'er.

3
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,640
It's time to go.

4
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:41,759
Coming.

5
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,359
Goodbye, Dahuang.

6
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,420
=Always Home=

7
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,447
(Adapted from an original novel
first published on Douban Books)

8
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:33,860
("Always Home" by Xiao Ge)

9
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,239
Is that the one?

10
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

11
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,120
That's her.

12
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,159
Yifan!

13
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,599
Mister, stop the car here.

14
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,239
Yifan!

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,480
Mister.

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,060
Thanks, Mister.

17
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,200
Turn the car around.

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,360
The house is just over there.

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,310
Alright, no problem.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,879
Yifan!

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,719
It's been so many years.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,589
I'll help you get the key.

23
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,160
Let's go.

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,790
Okay.

25
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:05,599
Huan'er.

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,870
Do you remember Aunt Lin Yifan?

27
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,759
She used to carry you
when you were little.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,599
Say hello.

29
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,520
Hello, Aunt Yifan.

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
She doesn't remember.

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,420
She was so little back then.
How could she remember?

32
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,040
This way.

33
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,780
No problem.

34
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,700
I'll finish the paperwork
before I get off work.

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,150
Thank you.

36
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,960
See you later.

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,400
Okay.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,240
Huan'er.

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm going to the hospital.

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,300
Watch over things for me.

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,280
Lina, I'll go with you.

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,940
Okay, Yifan.

43
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,960
Watch my stuff for me.

44
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,719
Hey...

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,180
There's bird poop on your head.

46
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,319
Here.

47
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,360
Use this to wipe it off.

48
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,479
Thanks.

49
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,630
Did you just move in?

50
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,960
I haven't seen you before.

51
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,540
My home is right here.

52
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,919
I guess we're neighbors now.

53
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,919
Thanks.

54
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,960
Nice to meet you.

55
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,490
My name is...

56
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,120
Bye-bye.

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,759
(This guy...)

58
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,480
(Why is he so weird?)

59
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,360
(My name is Chen Huan'er.)

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,360
(I'm sixteen years old.)

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
(Before this,)

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,279
(I lived in Sishui County,
on the far west side of Tianhe.)

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,200
(Don't underestimate me just
because I come from a small town.)

64
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
(I'm fully confident that I can handle)

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,519
(this new chapter in my life.)

66
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,959
(After all,)

67
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,639
(when I was a kid,)

68
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,639
(I had my share of big moments.)

69
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,450
(The "Star of Sishui" Award Ceremony)
Let's all congratulate Chen Huan'er.

70
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,759
She overcame every challenge,
performed outstandingly

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
in this academic competition

72
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,090
(Certificate)
and won the title of "Star of Sishui".

73
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,120
Chen Huan'er,

74
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,519
tell us how you feel.

75
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,600
I...

76
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,279
I'm so excited.

77
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,759
Louder.

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,120
I...

79
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,120
I'm so excited.

80
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,620
(Award Ceremony)
Excited about what?

81
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,160
Excited to become

82
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,519
the Flower of Sishui.

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,750
I was young back then.

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,079
But now, I definitely
don't trip over my words.

85
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,280
(Tianhe No. 1 Middle School,)

86
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,270
(get ready to welcome the Star of Sishui.)

87
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,720
Students.

88
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,160
Everyone...

89
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,319
Quiet down.

90
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,160
Settle down.

91
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,879
I have an announcement.

92
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:37,959
Our class

93
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,000
has a new student.

94
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,400
Her name is Chen Huan'er.

95
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,759
Everyone's busy

96
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,519
studying,

97
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,199
so I won't give a long introduction.

98
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,639
Chen Huan'er.

99
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,790
There's an empty seat
in the second-to-last row.

100
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
You can sit there.

101
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,639
Okay, sir.

102
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,480
You guys,

103
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,199
get to know each other after class.

104
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,069
New girl.

105
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,540
Hello.

106
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,360
Hello.

107
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,520
I'm the class monitor.

108
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,780
Just call me Xinyan.

109
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,360
Where did you transfer from?

110
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,920
Sishui.

111
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,879
Where's Sishui?

112
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,680
Out of town?

113
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
Sishui is a county.

114
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,399
Never heard of it.

115
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,480
You're just bad at geography.

116
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,400
It's the county on the far west side.

117
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,319
Class, stand up.

118
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,949
Good morning, sir.

119
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,040
Good morning, students.

120
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Please sit down.

121
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:43,759
Students,

122
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,600
for this month's exam,

123
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,320
we will only cover up to
Required Course 3.

124
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,190
So in this class,

125
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,759
I won't review the previous topics.

126
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,880
Let's get straight

127
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,800
into the trigonometric functions
of any angle.

128
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,160
Please open your math textbooks
to page 53.

129
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,240
Students,

130
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,959
we've covered these key points,
tricky parts and exam topics

131
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,680
in the previous lessons.

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,000
(I won the "Flower of Sishui")
Today, we'll focus on the x-coordinates.

133
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,160
Stretch them to four times
their original length.

134
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,800
The y-coordinates stay the same.

135
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,560
Hey,

136
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
why aren't you guys eating
in the cafeteria?

137
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,940
The school doesn't have a cafeteria.

138
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,560
Then where can I buy food outside?

139
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,600
You didn't bring lunch?

140
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
Let's go buy lunch together.

141
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,560
Isn't that not enough food?

142
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,439
Not for both of us. Let's go.

143
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,720
By the way,

144
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,480
I still don't know your name.

145
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,639
Qi Qi.

146
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,300
Bring me a meat sandwich
while you're out.

147
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:13,959
Get it yourself.

148
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,439
I have training.

149
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,240
Just bring it over
when you're done. Thanks.

150
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,720
Jing Xichi.

151
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,120
Our class's sports committee member.

152
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,180
Sports committee?

153
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,879
No wonder he looks so athletic.

154
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,580
Do you two know each other?

155
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,200
No.

156
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,360
You've been so quiet all morning.

157
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,480
I thought you were shy.

158
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,220
What kind of competition
is the "Flower of Sishui"?

159
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,000
I saw the note you wrote this morning.

160
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,639
It's just a local academic competition.

161
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,600
Actually, it's called
the "Star of Sishui,"

162
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,860
not the "Flower of Sishui."

163
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,980
I heard students
from the suburban county areas

164
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,860
are all really smart.

165
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,750
Are students from your area

166
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,639
all academic geniuses?

167
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,840
Where did you hear about that rumor?

168
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,320
I get it.

169
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,960
You top students are all so modest.

170
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,080
To be honest, my grades
are a mess.

171
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:07,879
Can you

172
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,280
help a deskmate out?

173
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
No, you've got the wrong idea.

174
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:11,919
I...

175
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,919
I'm really not that smart.

176
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,679
The Flower of Sishui,

177
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,280
I'm counting on you for tomorrow's exam.

178
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,980
(Welcome to Tianhe No. 1 Middle School!)

179
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:31,390
(Chen Huan'er ranks 44;
Qi Qi ranks 45)

180
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,660
The new girl and her deskmate really
are a perfect match.

181
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,820
One ranked dead last,
the other second to last.

182
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,519
Look.

183
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,390
Li Tian is in first place again.

184
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,620
(Math Exam Paper)

185
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,020
(Math Exam Paper)

186
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,519
Sorry, Qi Qi.

187
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,900
If you hadn't copied from me,
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

188
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,399
Qi Qi.

189
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,279
Sorry.

190
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,039
I accidentally did too well.

191
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,000
If I had scored just a little lower,

192
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,460
our names would have been
right next to each other.

193
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,150
Huan'er, Qi Qi, Mr. Sports Committee.

194
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,620
The homeroom teacher wants to see you.

195
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,919
Qi Qi.

196
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,759
What should I even say to you?

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,360
If you're going to copy answers,

198
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,879
at least

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,399
be a bit more discerning.

200
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Her answers were completely wrong.

201
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,919
Didn't you even notice?

202
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,840
Always trying to be clever.

203
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,360
Chen Huan'er.

204
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,240
This doesn't add up.

205
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,080
Your mom told me

206
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,799
that back in your old school,

207
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,080
your grades were pretty good.

208
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,679
So why is it that now,

209
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,120
you don't even know the basics?

210
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,799
Give me your parent's phone number.

211
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,720
I need to call and ask.

212
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:07,679
But sir...

213
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,600
And you.

214
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,080
You did well this time.

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,759
Keep it up.

216
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,519
Whether our class average improves

217
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,159
depends on you.

218
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,519
Don't worry, sir.

220
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,679
From now on,

221
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,910
I won't be ranked last again.

222
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't just stand there.

223
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:41,960
Get to class.

224
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,039
Bye, sir.

225
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,480
Jing Xichi.

226
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,840
Keep it up.

227
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,960
Got it, sir.

228
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,559
(Off to a bad start.)

229
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,120
(I have to go all out now.)

230
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,320
Mom...

231
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,120
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,440
I totally messed up my exam.

233
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,919
The school might call you.

234
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,799
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,600
(Not bad.)

236
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,400
(My acting skills are still sharp.)

237
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,480
The Flower of Sishui is back.

238
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,600
Go wash up and eat.

239
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
I bought your favorite
salt-baked chicken.

240
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,679
Oh no.

241
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,080
What if I can't cry?

242
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,519
Mom...

243
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,320
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,480
I failed the exam.

245
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,780
If you can't cry, don't force it.

246
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,560
Don't waste water.

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,540
Your teacher called.

248
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,620
Come and eat.

249
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,679
I didn't cry.

250
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,440
Nope.

251
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,679
Good, then.

252
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Sit down and eat.

253
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,480
Here.

254
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,320
It's not a big deal, right?

255
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
School is tough.

256
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,039
Having classmates

257
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,960
who are better than you is a good thing.

258
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,600
The Flower of Sishui

259
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,840
can't just wither so easily.

260
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,880
Here, eat more.

261
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,639
I'm a wilted flower now.

262
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,759
What wilted flower?

263
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,039
You're still a budding blossom.

264
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,519
Alright, enough drama.

265
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,679
Hurry up and eat.

266
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,679
Also,

267
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,880
next time you don't do well,
don't waste water.

268
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,460
Here, have some vegetables.

269
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,120
Eat more veggies.

270
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,399
Hurry up.

271
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,600
Huan'er.

272
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:37,679
Quick.

273
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,180
Mom, where are we going?

274
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,360
To Aunt Yifan's house.

275
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,039
She called and invited us over.

276
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,800
By the way,

277
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,440
her son goes to
Tianhe Middle School too.

278
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,480
Same age as you.

279
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,919
We'll take this chance
to get some study tips.

280
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,360
Hurry up and eat.

281
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,159
Come on, hurry up.

282
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,440
This kid...

283
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,759
Coming.

284
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,600
Yifan!

285
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Come on in, sweetie.

286
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,789
What do you have there?

287
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,700
You shouldn't have.

288
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,940
No need to be so formal.

289
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,720
Come on.

290
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,320
Have a seat.

291
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,039
It's getting late, where's Liqiang?

292
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,080
He's in a meeting.

293
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,840
The Fire Department is always busy.

294
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,679
Son,

295
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,679
come out.

296
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,919
Aunt Lina is here.

297
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,159
Xichi, right?

298
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,440
Hello, Ma'am.

299
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,870
You've grown up.

300
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,840
(Why is it him again?)

301
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,600
Looking sharp!

302
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,360
Today, I brought Huan'er over...

303
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,160
(I'm speechless.)

304
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,900
to visit.

305
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,640
You two must be in the same school.

306
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,560
Why are you standing? Sit down.

307
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,120
Here, have a drink.

308
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,519
Look,

309
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,120
he's back from his meeting.

310
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,030
Speak of the devil.

311
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,799
Jing Xichi!

312
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,519
How many times have I told you?

313
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Stop leaving your
stinky shoes everywhere.

314
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,399
We have guests. How embarrassing.

315
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,600
Liqiang.

316
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,720
Lina is here.

317
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:57,639
Come, Huan'er.

318
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,879
Say hello.

319
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,960
Hello, sir.

320
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,639
Is she your daughter?

321
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,039
I can hardly

322
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,279
recognize her now.

323
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,420
She was so young back then.

324
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,940
Hadn't even started primary school yet.

325
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,970
So many years have passed.

326
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,320
Sit down.

327
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,840
Sit, sit.

328
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,399
Now,

329
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
our kids

330
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,919
are finally together.

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,600
That's right.

332
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,799
But if that's the case,

333
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,269
don't let our rascal corrupt her.

334
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

335
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,700
Like Lina just said,

336
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,670
kids need encouragement.

337
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,519
Liqiang, you can't talk like that.

338
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
They're all good kids.

339
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,919
Today,

340
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,399
I brought Huan'er here

341
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,919
to learn from Xichi.

342
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,840
Since school just started,

343
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,039
she's having a little trouble
keeping up.

344
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,440
You're asking the wrong person.

345
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,980
When it comes to studying, my son...

346
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,720
He's good at sports.

347
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Xichi, hurry up.

348
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,840
Go to the kitchen and wash the fruit

349
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,159
that Aunt Lina brought us.

350
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:49,879
Alright.

351
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,679
Huan'er,

352
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,320
be a good girl and go help him.

353
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,320
I suppose you're staying here for good?

354
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,840
That's right.

355
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,030
We're finally together now.

356
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,039
It's good to have someone

357
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,080
living in the same complex

358
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,759
to rely on.

359
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,140
The knife's over there.

360
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:01,919
You cut it.

361
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,680
Don't forget to wash it first.

362
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,599
Huan'er.

363
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,240
Your eyes look a little swollen.

364
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:12,839
Don't tell me

365
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,960
you cried because you
didn't do well on the exam?

366
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,319
I was just...

367
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,160
No need to explain.

368
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,440
It's fine.

369
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,460
Nothing to be ashamed of.

370
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,790
It's just that there's no need
to cry over a test.

371
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,750
Guess how I did
on the senior middle school

372
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,720
entrance exam?

373
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,079
Dead last?

374
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,880
Good guess.

375
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,079
So,

376
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,520
just so you know,

377
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,290
I consistently scored in the middle
to upper range in junior middle school.

378
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,839
You're already doing great.

379
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,480
You and Qi Qi seem pretty close.

380
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,680
Why are you asking?

381
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,780
You acted like you didn't want
to know me at school.

382
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,540
That was because you acted
like you didn't want to know me.

383
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,920
Come on, answer me.

384
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,340
Are you close with her?

385
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,160
Yes.

386
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,349
Stop eating.

387
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,100
There won't be any left for our parents.

388
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,100
Mind your own business.

389
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,920
Jing Xichi!

390
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,359
Stop bullying her.

391
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,590
Act like a man, will you?

392
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,480
I didn't, Dad.

393
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
I was just having a discussion
with Huan'er.

394
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:28,960
Starting tomorrow,

395
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,920
she can walk to school with me
and Song Cong.

396
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,440
It's safer.

397
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,960
That's wonderful.

398
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,350
The apples are ready.

399
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,880
I heard

400
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,440
that Song's kid is a top student.

401
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,000
Of course.

402
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
Let me tell you,
he's exactly like his father.

403
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,440
Always ranked first in every exam.

404
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,839
Do you think academic success
is genetic?

405
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,839
I really think so.

406
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,839
It's all in the genes.

407
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:51,400
Aunt Lina,

408
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,400
how about I ask Song Cong

409
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,799
to help tutor Huan'er?

410
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,680
That would be great.

411
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,680
If you need any help, just let me know.

412
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,560
No need to be polite.

413
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,200
Now that's more like a real man.

414
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,279
I'm running late.

415
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,880
Mom, I'm off to school.

416
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,680
Everyone's here today.

417
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,519
Let me introduce you.

418
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,599
This here

419
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,559
is Chen Huan'er,

420
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Aunt Lina's daughter.

421
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
She's under my care.

422
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,240
She'll be walking to school
with us from now on.

423
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,759
Hello.

424
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,240
Hello.

425
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,760
She's the one who helped you
get out of last place?

426
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,079
Did you all have breakfast?

427
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
These are wild vegetable dumplings
from Sishui.

428
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,680
Want to try one?

429
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,240
Sure.

430
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,790
What kind of vegetable is this?
It tastes weird.

431
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,960
My grandpa grew these himself.

432
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,820
If you don't like it, give it back.

433
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,480
I never said it.

434
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,060
Give it back.

435
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,270
It's pretty good. Let's go.

436
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,220
We're running late.

437
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,440
If you don't like it,
just leave it here.

438
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,960
It's fine.

439
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,560
Leave it...

440
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,350
It's really good.

441
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:58,359
Song Cong,

442
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,440
when you have time,
help tutor her a bit.

443
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,440
You should join too.

444
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,940
I'll think about it.

445
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,799
Alright.

446
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,109
I'll find some time

447
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,680
to list out this semester's key topics.

448
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,900
Then we can all study together.

449
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,359
Well then, thank you, Mr. Song.

450
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,740
What are you standing there for?

451
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,270
Hurry up and thank our teacher.

452
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,740
If you don't, he might charge you.

453
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,839
Thank you.

454
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,119
Thank you, Mr. Song.

455
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,599
No problem.

456
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,440
Isn't my little brother obedient?

457
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,270
Who's your little brother?

458
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:28,759
Chen Huan'er!

459
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,319
Qi Qi.

460
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,440
Why are you coming from that way?

461
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,799
I thought you lived in the new district.

462
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,400
Did you move?

463
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,440
You guys...

464
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,700
The three of us live in the same
residential compound.

465
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:08,960
Hello.

466
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,039
Hello.

467
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,519
Hello.

468
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,279
I'm Qi Qi.

469
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,759
Huan'er is my deskmate.

470
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,110
I went to No. 3 Middle School too.

471
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,320
I knew about you back then.

472
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,039
I remember your essay

473
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,160
was even selected
as an exemplary piece, right?

474
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,800
You guys went
to the same junior high school?

475
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,599
Why do you act like strangers?

476
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,000
There were hundreds of students
in our grade.

477
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,519
You think it's like Sishui, a county?

478
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,190
We had hundreds of students
in Sishui too.

479
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh wow, impressive.

480
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,040
Did you know every single person
in your grade?

481
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,900
Then why do you expect them
to know each other?

482
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,660
Alright, enough.

483
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,920
Can you stop teasing her?

484
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,920
You want to speak up for her?

485
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,799
If so, then join us commoners

486
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,799
in the regular class.

487
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:42,920
Not happening.

488
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,590
My grades aren't bad enough.

489
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,319
By the way,

490
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,519
my dad just sent these from abroad.

491
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,660
I thought I'd share them
with my classmates. Here.

492
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,000
Try one.

493
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,519
Are those

494
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,680
Danish butter cookies?

495
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:00,920
Delicious.

496
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,200
Song Cong, have one too.

497
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,310
I've had them before.

498
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm heading off now.

499
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,000
Why is he walking that way?

500
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,519
Didn't you hear me?

501
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,830
He's not an ordinary student.

502
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,340
He's in the international program.

503
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,880
His classes are in another building.

504
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,700
Let's hurry. The homeroom teacher
is giving a public lecture.

505
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,500
We mustn't be late.

506
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:23,920
Let's go.

507
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,640
No way.

508
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,480
Mr. Xu is giving a public lecture again?

509
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,860
Now I'll never get the chance

510
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,620
to take a nap.

511
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,840
And that little glasses guy

512
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,510
is going to try
to stand out again.

513
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,000
For sure,

514
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,599
he's going to be like, "Sir! Sir!"

515
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,359
So annoying.

516
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,039
What do you mean?

517
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,359
You'll find out later.

518
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,200
Alright, class.

519
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,279
Turn to page 51.

520
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,060
Sir, I know this one!
I know the answer, sir!

521
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,540
Sir...

522
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,500
I can do this one!

523
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,799
Why don't we give other students
a chance?

524
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,680
Chen Huan'er.

525
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,599
Explain how to solve this problem.

526
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,000
Since A equals 4,

527
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,680
B equals 3, and C equals 2,

528
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,720
the largest angle is A.

529
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,920
According to the cosine rule,
we can deduce that

530
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,799
cosine A equals B...

531
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,680
What are you laughing at?

532
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,519
What's so funny?

533
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,720
Math exams don't test oral skills.

534
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,160
Chen Huan'er, continue.

535
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,119
Equals...

536
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,200
B squared plus C squared,

537
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,519
minus A squared, divided by 2AB.

538
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,039
Equals negative one-fourth.

539
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,240
So...

540
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,880
So the answer is D.

541
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,640
Uncle,

542
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,200
where are my instant noodles?

543
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,279
I have training later.

544
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,760
Thanks, Uncle.

545
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:12,799
No problem.

546
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,100
Didn't we say we'd study together?

547
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,380
I only said I'd consider it.

548
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,590
Stop considering.

549
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,850
You agreed to help Chen Huan'er.

550
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,100
Hurry up and go study. Come on.

551
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,110
No, I have training later.

552
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,000
I have things to do.

553
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,279
You help her first, okay?

554
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,660
She's struggling with her studies.

555
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,510
Help her out. Just go.

556
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,240
Don't come back, just go.

557
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,140
Help her out, alright?

558
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,820
Fine, carry on.

559
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,700
She really needs help.

560
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,680
Go and tutor her.

561
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,839
Daniel Lin was waiting at the airport.

562
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,319
And her cousin, Liu Qian,

563
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,119
went on a trip to Canada

564
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,960
to visit their cousins.

565
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,640
A lot of Chinese families...

566
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,640
Families...

567
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,000
Celeb...

568
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,540
Chen Huan'er.

569
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,640
Celebrate...

570
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,279
Celebrate the New Year.

571
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,079
Did you hear?

572
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,880
Some country bumpkin in the regular class

573
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,200
pronounced "cosine" as "kao sai"
during the public lecture.

574
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,799
Who?

575
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,079
Someone named Chen Huan'er.

576
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,160
"Kao sai", that's hilarious.

577
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,640
Celebrate...

578
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,240
Celebrate...

579
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,799
Celebrate...

580
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,079
A lot of Chinese

581
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,000
celebrate the New Year

582
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,440
together.

583
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:44,799
Celeb...

584
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,880
What are you doing?

585
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm listening to a recording.

586
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,340
Are you coming up?

587
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,759
Let's go.

588
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,260
I'll get your shoes.

589
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,279
Thanks.

590
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,400
Have a seat.

591
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,000
Where's Jing Xichi?

592
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,599
Why isn't he here yet?

593
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,440
Xichi said we'd study together
so you wouldn't feel awkward.

594
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,759
He's focused on training.

595
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,880
He's not coming to study.

596
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,760
Just sit tight for a bit.

597
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,960
Here, this tape is for you.

598
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,599
It should help you a little.

599
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,079
Thanks.

600
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,359
(New Concept English 3)

601
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,680
It seems everyone here
is so good at English.

602
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,440
We had a head start, that's all.

603
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,920
Practice more,

604
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,320
and you'll catch up in no time.

605
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,160
Let's start with the questions.

606
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,599
Okay.

607
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:05,480
Try solving this question first.

608
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,000
Thanks.

609
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,640
This problem works like this.

610
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,440
Look at this triangle.

611
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,359
In triangle ABD,

612
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,880
we use the cosine rule to get...

613
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,000
(New Concept English 3)

614
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,119
I'll write it down for you.

615
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,839
Okay.

616
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,480
Who hasn't turned in
their math homework yet?

617
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:39,960
Hand it in now.

618
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,180
(Tianhe No. 1 Middle School -
International Class - Song Cong)

619
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,680
Isn't this Song Cong's notebook?

620
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,640
I must've taken the wrong one.

621
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,920
I need to get it back to him.

622
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,200
Xiaoyu, here you go.

623
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,519
Thanks.

624
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,559
Song Cong.

625
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:14,880
Mr. Fu.

626
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,680
Can I skip this competition?

627
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,519
Skip it?

628
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,079
Why?

629
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,620
I've been really busy
with schoolwork lately.

630
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,559
Song Cong, stop trying to fool me.

631
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,119
I know you too well.

632
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,920
For an international competition
like this,

633
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,559
whether it's English

634
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
or math,

635
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,400
besides you,

636
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,759
who else do you think I can send?

637
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,240
Plus, the competitors in this contest
are all top-tier.

638
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,640
Don't take it lightly.

639
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,519
Winning first place isn't guaranteed.

640
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,799
Excuse me,

641
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,880
is Song Cong in your class?

642
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,960
(Why are the international class
students so weird?)

643
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,320
Excuse me, is Song Cong here?

644
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,020
No idea.

645
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,559
Huan'er.

646
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,680
There you are.

647
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,720
Sorry,

648
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,160
I accidentally took your notebook.

649
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,240
Sorry for the inconvenience.

650
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:12,960
It's fine.

651
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,270
Oh right, today...

652
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:14,920
Song Cong,

653
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,240
I heard from Mr. Fu that you don't

654
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,990
want to participate
in the math competition.

655
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,620
Why?

656
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,030
I just don't want to.

657
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,400
If you don't want to join,

658
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,480
then give me your spot.

659
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,799
What were you about to say?

660
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,920
I wanted to say that I have
a test after school today.

661
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,160
I might be half an hour late.

662
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,559
You and Jing Xichi should go home
without me.

663
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,480
It's fine.

664
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,559
We'll wait for you.

665
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,350
How about this?

666
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,640
I'll hand in my paper early,

667
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,150
you guys wait for me at the back gate.

668
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,480
You can do that?

669
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,519
Alright then.

670
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:51,480
Good.

671
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,080
Got some fresh gossip about
Ms. Kao Sai from Class 5.

672
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,990
Do you want to hear it?

673
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:25,839
Spill it.

674
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,200
She may look all innocent,

675
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,359
but she's not that simple.

676
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,599
How so?

677
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,600
She went to the international class
this morning

678
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,840
to return Song Cong's notebook.

679
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,460
For real?

680
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,000
Why would I lie?

681
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,400
I think she went there on purpose,

682
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,079
just to get noticed.

683
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,200
So people would think

684
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,940
there's something going on between them.

685
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,360
She's only been here a few days,

686
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,160
and she's already hanging out
with Qi Qi.

687
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,740
Now she's cozying up to Song Cong too.

688
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,119
She's definitely not that simple.

689
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,799
One hand grabs the smart ones,

690
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,400
and the other grabs the rich ones.

691
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,039
Who?

692
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,960
Class 5's social butterfly,

693
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,839
Ms. Kao Sai.

694
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,310
The new girl in Class 5?

695
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,640
Doesn't stand out at all,

696
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,000
but turns out she's a socialite?

697
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,440
That's why she's impressive.

698
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,540
No wonder the area outside the bathroom

699
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,980
smells worse than inside.

700
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,520
Turns out it's because some people
have filthy mouths.

701
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,680
What do you mean?

702
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,980
Who are you talking about?

703
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,119
I'm talking about you Class 6 guys.

704
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,920
Not everyone is

705
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,759
as nasty

706
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,519
as you lot.

707
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,680
Jing Xichi.

708
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,079
Stop looking for trouble here.

709
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,119
I am looking for trouble.

710
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,039
What about it?

711
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,799
Chen Huan'er is my friend.

712
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,440
Next time you gossip behind her back,

713
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,319
think twice.

714
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,519
Why are you acting so arrogant?

715
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,119
Try touching me again.

716
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,039
Jing Xichi.

717
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,310
Is this really necessary?

718
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,440
We were just casually talking.

719
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:12,359
Qin Liang.

720
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,440
Keep your classmates' mouths in check.

721
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
You should spend more time practicing

722
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,200
instead of getting dominated by me
on the soccer field,

723
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,559
then trying to act tough at school.

724
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,279
Forget it, Qin Liang.

725
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,510
Let's not lower ourselves
to Class 5's level.

726
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,279
Let's go.

727
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,400
Yeah.

728
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,160
You heard everything just now,

729
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,799
didn't you?

730
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,620
You're not crying in the bathroom,
are you?

731
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,559
If you had arrived a second later,

732
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,360
I would've already thrown hands.

733
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,199
Impressive.

734
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,480
Don't believe me?

735
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,159
My dad is a martial arts coach.

736
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,039
Impressive.

737
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,920
For real.

738
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm sorry

739
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,320
for the wait.

740
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,880
I came right after handing in my paper.

741
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,200
We've been waiting forever.

742
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,000
You had better make up for it,

743
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,480
especially to Huan'er.

744
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,280
What's wrong?

745
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm fine.

746
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,480
It's all because of you.

747
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,560
You must be the last person
to leave the school.

748
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,760
What? All my classmates are still here.

749
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,680
What are they doing?

750
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,560
Comparing answers.

751

Checking my answers.

753
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,519
So arrogant.

754
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,400
You guys are such good friends.

755
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,840
How come one of you is a top student
and the other a slacker?

756
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,760
Didn't Darwin say?

757
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,800
We should respect species diversity.

758
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,119
Darwin never said that.

759
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,860
I'm done joking with you.

760
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,150
I'm off to training.

761
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,000
You two be careful.

762
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,519
Did the tape I gave you

763
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:25,480
help at all?

764
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:27,480
Yeah.

765
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:28,840
Thanks.

766
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,400
How are you adjusting to Tianhe?

767
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,239
Not bad.

768

I need to make amends.

773
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,280
No need for now.

774
