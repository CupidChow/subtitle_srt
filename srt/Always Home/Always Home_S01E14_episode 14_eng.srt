00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:20,870


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,780
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,360
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,880
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,170
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,460
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,370
   

16
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,500
I'm off to art class, bye.

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,070
Bye.

19
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,500
She's switching to the art track now.

20
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,200
It's clearly because of the lower admission scores.

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,730
You can't say that.

22
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,670
She's always been interested in drawing.

23
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,990
Probably she wants to pursue her dreams.

24
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,520
Du Man.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,820
Didn't you say before that you wanted to sit in the front row?

26
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,870
- Do you still want to? 
 - Yes.

27
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,080
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

28
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,820
I didn't mean anything by it.

29
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,540
I just think sitting in the front makes it easier to see and ask questions.

30
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,030
All right.

31
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,660
Mr. Xu, can I sit in Du Man's seat?

32
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
Go ahead.

33
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,740
- Thank you, Mr. Xu. 
 - This session is for self-study.

34
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,560
- Why did you come over here? 
 - To study.

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,920
I was afraid you'd feel lonely studying by yourself, so I came to keep you company.

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,190
Are you crazy? Go back to your seat and stop bothering me.

37
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,460
How can you stop me from making progress?

38
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,620
How am I stopping you from progressing?

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,780
- You think I'd believe that? 
 - Fine. Just stop talking.

40
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,800
You're disturbing my studies.

41
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,530
Let me tell you something in secret.

42
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,300
My mother signed me up for a top-tier math tutor who seems good

43
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,600
at predicting exam questions. Do you want to join?

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,710
How much?

45
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,130
Two hundred? That's not bad.

46
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,320
Per session.

47
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,540
That's way too expensive!

48
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,200
We're in our senior three now. Shouldn't we invest everything into this?

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,570
I don't have that kind of money.

50
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,940
Jing Xi Chi, are you in?

51
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm not going. I don't have money either.

52
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,060
I'll lend it to you first. Just give it a try.

53
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,880
What if it helps your grades?

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,160
Wow, so generous.

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,470
What are you saying?

56
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,910
Just go. I'll cover your debt.

57
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,780
- Jing Xi Chi, you... 
 - Xin Yan.

58
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,780
Just ignore him.

59
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,780
Jing Xi Chi, you're so young, and you've learned to get something for nothing.

60
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,270
When you grow up, you're going to be a menace to society.

61
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,280
What are you looking at?

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm spiritually connecting with the exam paper setters.

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
Be serious.

64
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,480
Seriously though... What if I don't get into a sports university?

65
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,430
What if I can't get into any school at all?

66
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,980
That's why you need to work hard now.

67
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,480
At least give yourself another option.

68
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,030
Why didn't you collect it yourself?

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,070
Take this.

70
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,750
Why are you giving me money?

71
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:49,320
Aren't you planning to take that tutoring class?

72
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,120
You go first, and I'll figure something out later.

73
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,510
Thanks, but you should keep the money.

74
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,430
My grades aren't that bad; I don't need tutoring.

75
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,490
My point is that you go first, and then when you're done, you come back and teach me.

76
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,080
Think about it: this way, we pay for one person but get lessons for two.

77
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,490
Isn't that a great deal?

78
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,830
Then later, you can just pay me back half.

79
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,960
You've thought this through, haven't you?

80
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,170
Basically, you're making me do double the work.

81
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,130
What double work?

82
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,540
I take the class, then I come back and teach you. Isn't that doing two jobs?

83
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,280
No, it's just one job.

84
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,640
I was just messing with you.

85
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,390
Seriously though, just go.

86
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,690
At least one of us needs to bring honor to our family, right?

87
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,530
All right then, I'll take one hundred first.

88
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,980
What do you mean?

89
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,980
Tuition fee.

90
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,080
Starting today, I'll tutor you.

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,921
Forget about it.

92
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:08,510
After my "spiritual connection" with the exam setters today,

93
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,830
I don't even know where to start studying.

94
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,220
You can't save me.

95
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,840
That's true.

96
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,500
You weren't that smart to begin with.

97
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,830
I'm not sure if you'll even understand what I learned in class.

98
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,200
That's worrying.

99
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,850
Chen Huan Er, are you calling me stupid?

100
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,420
I'm just too lazy to work hard.

101
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,760
Then prove it to me.

102
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Fine, I will. Give me a question.

103
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's do it when we get home.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,780
   

105
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,710
So, mitochondria are the main site of aerobic respiration in cells.

106
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,470
Ribosomes are where amino acids are assembled into proteins.

107
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,860
If you memorize the entire cell structure,

108
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,900
no matter how the questions change, you'll still get them right.

109
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,401
- Got it? 
 - Yes.

110
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,780
All right, next question.

111
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,880
- In the human body— 
 - Miss Chen,

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,780
we've already been studying for three hours.

113
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,030
Let's call it a day, all right?

114
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,830
You need rest too.

115
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,580
Don't overwork yourself.

116
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,960
Well, all right, Jing, take your test papers with you.

117
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,210
Thanks, Miss Chen.

118
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,360
Honestly, biology is basically the art subject of science.

119
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,030
No matter what, you have to memorize it. So keep working hard.

120
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,440
Okay.

121
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,300
Miss Chen, be honest.

122
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,560
Is this wasting your time?

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,850
Not at all. I'm just treating it as a revision.

124
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,390
Then how about this?

125
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,100
If your rank improves by even one spot, you have to buy me a cup of milk tea.

126
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,420
Deal.

127
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,150
Then can you give me back the 100 yuan first?

128
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,620
No way, that's the registration fee.

129
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,300
Class dismissed!

130
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,270
Goodbye, Miss Chen.

131
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,390
Wait! You'd better memorize those key points. I'm checking tomorrow.

132
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,850
Okay.

133
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,880
So, what's the minimum value here?

134
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,520
What is it?

135
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,940
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

136
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,370
This question is tricky.

137
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,070
Look at this line.

138
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,580
Where are you going?

139
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,160
How can you fall asleep?

140
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,680
- Ouch! 
 - Hurry up!

141
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,880
Write!

142
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,330
I got it.

143
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,380

♫  Between you and me  ♫

145
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,410
It's wrong. The answer is A.

146
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,720
Are you dumb?

147
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,940
Can't you solve this?

148
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,300
Stop hitting me! If you keep hitting me, I'll get dumb.

149
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,760
I'm not studying anymore!

150
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,812
Fine, then forget it!

151
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:07,780
If you don't want to study, I won’t bother teaching you!

Is this correct?

161
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,310
Hello, three cups of milk tea, please.

162
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,240
♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

163
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,770
Don't look at me. Just focus and write.

164
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,880
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

165
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,800
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

166
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,200
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

167
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,300
Am I awesome or what? Am I? Am I?

168
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,440
♫  Goodbye to the ordinary me  ♫

169
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,540
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

170
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,850
Choose C.

171
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,090
How are you even studying?

172
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,730
It's wrong.

173
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,912
Why can't I figure this out?

174
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,680
It's not right.

175
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,080
Take a nap.

176
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,740
You've been too exhausted recently.

177
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,750
Your brain's not working anymore.

178
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,800
Jing Xi Chi.

179
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,440
I can't sleep.

180
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,300
Close your eyes.

181
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,120
Close your eyes.

182
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,940
♫  The wind carries your scent  ♫

183
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,578
♫  Falling asleep on my shoulder in the afternoon  ♫

184
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:11,360
♫  My baby  ♫

185
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,720
♫  My baby  ♫

186
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,134
♫  Dreaming of sorrowful times  ♫

187
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:25,060
♫  Drifting into your dreams with the clouds  ♫

188
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,940
♫  My baby  ♫

189
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,960
♫  My baby  ♫

190
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,620
♫  Pain and life trouble me every year  ♫

191
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,080
♫  Pain and life trouble me every year  ♫

192
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,980
♫  The silence and loneliness I cannot escape, I tell you in my dreams  ♫

193
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,860
♫  The silence and loneliness I cannot escape, I tell you in my dreams  ♫

194
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,060
♫  But the weather is clear and hope shines like light on the grasslands  ♫

195
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,280
♫  But the weather is clear and hope shines like light on the grasslands  ♫

196
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,000
♫  Your kindness I long for but the wind makes it cold  ♫

197
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,400
♫  Your kindness I long for but the wind makes it cold  ♫

198
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,090
 You're welcome. 

199
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,320
 If I do well on tomorrow's exam, buy me a milk tea. 

200
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,080
♫  You give me a short moment of sweetness  ♫

201
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,660
♫  But our love is long-lasting  ♫

202
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,640
♫  My baby  ♫

203
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,210
Jing Xi Chi!

204
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,850
Jing Xi Chi, hurry up! We're going to be late!

205
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,420
Jing Xi Chi!

206
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:24,040
 Sorry. The number you dialed is temporarily unavailable. 

207
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,110
 Please try again later. 

208
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,620
 Sorry. The number you dialed— 

209
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,333
 Mom, Jing Xi Chi didn't show up for the monthly exam today. 

210
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:42,690
 He's not answering his phone either. Ask Aunt Lin what's going on. 

211
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,460
 Just focus on the test for now. 

212
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,940
   

213
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,050
Hello?

214
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,960
How is it?

215
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,950
No way! No way!

216
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,950
No way! Tell me where he is! Where is he?

217
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,780
Where is he? Where is he?

218
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,860
No way! No way!

219
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,970
Where is he? Tell me!

220
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,840
 A wildfire broke out suddenly. 

221
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,840
 Xi Chi's father went missing during the rescue operation. 

222
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,054
 No one knows if they've found him yet. 

223
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:13,520
 We can't get in touch with anyone either. 

224
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,580
 Among all the uncles in the family housing compound, Uncle Jing was the friendliest. 

225
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,173
 I could never bring myself to associate him 

226
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,440
 with the black-and-white photo. 

227
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,190
 It always felt like one day he would pick up his suitcase again, 

228
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,740
 covered in dust and appear before us. 

229
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:54,200
 Until that day, in the pouring rain, when I saw Aunt Lin's grief, 

230
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,610
 I finally realized... 

231
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,570
 Uncle Jing was truly gone. 

232
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,330
 However, Jing Xi Chi was unexpectedly calm. 

233
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,920
 When I looked into his eyes, 

234
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,610
 I seemed to understand... 

235
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,210
 No matter how hard you try, there are some things you just can't bring back. 

236
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,860
 It's completely and utterly helpless. 

237
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,110
 That kind of despair... He didn't know how to face it. 

238
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,300
 In just one night... 

239
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,260
   

240
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,470
 he was forced to grow up. 

241
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,260
It's been so many days since he last came.

242
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,290
Why don't you take me to see him?

243
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,800
I haven't seen him at all these past few days.

244
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,390
It's so unfair.

245
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,570
Why does Jing Xi Chi have to go through all of this?

246
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,570
 Are you okay? 

247
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,320
 If you need someone to keep you company, I'll wait for you at our secret base after school. 

248
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,230
You're here.

249
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,600
Milk tea for you, Jing.

250
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,970
My ranking went up again this time.

251
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,630
Drink up while it's still warm.

252
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,800
Thanks.

253
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
It's quite sweet.

254
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,580
Right? I added double the sugar just for you.

255
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,060
I'm fine.

256
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,860
I'll be back at school tomorrow.

257
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,740
 Milk tea can be twice as sweet, 

258
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,600
 but the bitterness in Jing Xi Chi's eyes was even stronger. 

259
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,140
Don't go to school the day after tomorrow.

260
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,840
I've arranged for you to attend a training program at Tonglin City Sports School.

261
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,940
Coach Li will take you there. 
    

262
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,423
 I heard the sports university in Tonglin is quite good. 

263
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,910
 I'm near the place. Let me check it out for you first. 

264
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,570
 Got it. 

265
00:24:57,225 --> 00:24:59,600
   

266
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,710
My father arranged this for me.

267
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,870
Jing Xi Chi!

268
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,680
You've got to hold on until the very end.

269
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,180
   

270
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,980
No matter how sad you are, you can't just give up on your legs.

271
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,050
What's the use of my legs now?

272
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,430
I failed the physical exam.

273
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,190
I didn't make it.

274
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,480
I really tried my best,

275
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,740
but my legs are still like this.

276
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:14,820
Maybe in life, there really are things that can't be solved just by working hard.

277
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,860
Cong.

278
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,810
I really tried so hard...

279
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,440
So why do I still have regrets?

280
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,910
You know...

281
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,470
Actually...

282
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,780
It wasn't supposed to be my dad's shift that day.

283
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,290
Do you know why he switched shifts?

284
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:13,920
He had arranged a meeting with a sports school coach for me.

285
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:25,530
 He went to ask if they could give me a chance to transfer and continue playing football. 

286
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,870
If only my father had given up on me sooner...

287
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,820
If only I hadn't been so stubborn...

288
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,870
If I had realized this earlier,

289
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,600
would my father still have gotten into that accident?

290
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,400
It'll all pass eventually.

291
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:27,960
 Many people say that facing loss is the true beginning of growth. 

292
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,240
 I hate this way of romanticizing loss. 

293
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,666
 Loss is just loss. 

294
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:37,540
 If growth comes at the cost of losing something, it's unfair. 

295
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:46,230
 Later on, Uncle Jing was honored, becoming a hero in everyone's eyes. 

296
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:51,470
 But for Xi Chi, all he faced was still just loss. 

297
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:57,327
 But what he chose to do was exactly what Uncle Jing had done. 

298
00:30:57,327 --> 00:30:59,540
 He stepped up to hold the family together. 

299
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,610
Mom.

300
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:45,610
I have an early meeting tomorrow, so I might leave home early.

301
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,740
I washed your school uniform for you.

302
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,890
If it's not dry, just use the hairdryer yourself.

303
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,130
Mom.

304
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,240
I'm sorry.

305
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,410
I know I've let you down.

306
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,090
Silly boy.

307
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,910
You will always be my pride.

308
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,140
And your father's too.

309
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,470
 Today is Uncle Jing's birthday. 

310
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,000
 Xi Chi kept his window shut the entire day. 

311
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,190
 Football, family, and the things he cherished most are all slipping away. 

312
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:07,100
 Even the light in his heart seemed to have been taken too. 

313
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,390
 Opening the window would let sunlight into the room. 

314
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,250
 But how could that light find its way into his heart? 

315
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,990
Sorry.

316
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:45,020
I didn't go to school because I had something to deal with.

317
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,390
Here, take this.

318
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:53,690
You can listen to it when you're feeling tired.

319
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,070
Is everything okay?

320
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,670
I'm going to start studying.

321
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,350
Let's go.

322
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,020
   

323
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,100
 Senior year's exhausting... and honestly, 

324
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,700
 everyone's just handling it in their own weird way. 
   

325
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,210
Abandon. Abandon.

326
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,930
A, B, A, N, D, O, N.

327
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,570
Abandon. Abandon.

328
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,680
Can you stop acting crazy?

329
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,720
You always start with the word "abandon," then you want to abandon your studies!

330
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,540
It's bad luck!

331
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,580
Stay calm, stay peaceful, and go with the flow.

332
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:47,300
Mindset determines everything.

333
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:03,020
 Among all the strange things, the strangest was definitely Jing Xi Chi. 

334
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,850
 He went through roughly three stages. 

335
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,750
 First stage. He turned into a studying machine. 

336
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:23,210
 I knew this was the only way he could temporarily push aside thoughts about Uncle Jing. 

337
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,990
 However, I didn't expect him to push himself this hard. 

338
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,990
Exactly.

339
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,240
I don't know what triggered Xi Chi.

340
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,120
He studies until midnight every day.

341
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:40,290
Yi Fan. You can't let him continue this. His body won't take it.

342
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,180
I know.

343
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,700
I'm worried too. Now, he barely talks anymore.

344
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,210
I have no idea what's going on in his head.

345
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,420
Negative angle and zero angle...

346
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,090
 When it came to the second stage, he basically lost it. 

347
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,100
You're not paying attention in my class anymore.

348
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,240
Come to my office after school.

349
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,580
 Third stage: A legendary top student was born. 

350
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,460
 Everyone said he was acting strange, and that this wasn't the right way to cope. 

351
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,090
 However, the changes on the ranking board told a different story. 

352
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,630
Take a look.

353
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,000
Jing Xi Chi. You did pretty well.

354
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,280
You're only five ranks behind me now.

355
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,116
Really?

356
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:50,590
- That high? 
 - Didn't you check?

357
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,770
No.

358
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,430
It doesn't mean anything until the final results.

359
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,240
This year, the Chinese New Year holiday lasts until the eighth.

360
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,940
Are you going back to Sishui?

361
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,156
No. My mother is working the night shift on Chinese New Year's Eve.

362
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:08,100
I'll probably stay in the hospital with her.

363
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,450
Robot, what about you?

364
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,010
- She's asking you. 
 - We'll see.

365
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,190
Here.

366
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,390
Eat more.

367
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,049
All right, Mom. Don't worry about me.

368
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:35,425
Why does everyone decide to give birth during the New Year?

369
00:38:35,425 --> 00:38:37,080
- I know, right? 
 - Li Na.

370
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,367
Hello.

371
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:40,940
Why are you eating instant noodles during the New Year?

372
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,288
Have some dumplings.

373
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:44,315
Thank you, Li Na, but it's fine. Our noodles are almost ready.

374
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:46,500
Dumplings are a must during the New Year.

375
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,725
These are really good.

376
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,170
Eat more so that you have the energy to take care of the patients.

377
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,750
Thank you.

378
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,000
I won't have time to check on you later.

379
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,103
If you feel bored, go to Aunt Yi Fan's house.

380
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,838
Aunt Yi Fan is on duty today.

381
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,820
Jing Xi Chi must be home. Go find him.

382
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,110
Eat.

383
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,130
What's up?

384
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,070
What are you doing?

385
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,721
I just got back from having dinner at Cong's place.

386
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:59,000
I have nothing much to do.

387
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,770
I'm planning to go over the final exam papers again.

388
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,976
 What about you? 

389
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:06,890
 Aren't you at the hospital keeping Aunt Li Na company? 

390
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,990
She's busy.

391
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:14,080
If I stay there, I'll just distract her, so I came back.

392
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,737
Then get some rest early.

393
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:18,210
I'm going to do my exercises.

394
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,770
 It's Chinese New Year's Eve. Why are you still studying? 

395
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,160
What else would I do?

396
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,730
I'm hanging up.

397
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,430
Hello? Cong.

398
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,120
What are you doing?

399
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,040
Where's Jing Xi Chi?

400
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,872
He's studying at home.

401
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,560
Is he studying at home on New Year's Eve?

402
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,520
That's insane.

403
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,700
- Du Man. 
 - Du Man.

404
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,800
- Happy New Year! 
 - You're here.

405
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,830
- Where's your father? 
 - He went out to play Mahjong.

406
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,950
- Take whatever you want to eat. 
 - No.

407
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,770
Uncle Du already gave me loads of snacks.

408
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,120
I feel bad.

409
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,120
That's just how my father is.

410
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,060
He gives away more than he sells.

411
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,852
He's been like this for over ten years. Whatever he touches turns to bad business.

412
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:24,090
Don't say that about him.

413
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,220
We'll take a few, then.

414
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,390
How many bottles?

415
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,980
Six.

416
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,920
Are you guys drinking?

417
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,170
Is that okay?

418
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,580
Are you 18 already?

419
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,220
Of course.

420
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,720
I turned 18 three months ago.

421
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,330
All right, take them.

422
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,040
- Take my money. 
 - No need. Just take them.

423
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,900
If you don't, we won't come next time.

424
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,600
- Let's go. 
 - Happy New Year.

425
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,340
- Happy New Year. 
 - Happy New Year.

426
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,300
You're just like your father.

427
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:34,060
   

428
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,770
Happy New Year, Robot!

429
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,902
Why are you two here?

430
00:42:42,902 --> 00:42:44,670
My parents are home for the New Year, for once.

431
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,670
I figured I'd give them some space.

432
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,690
Stop studying. Look what I brought.

433
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,300
Let's go!

434
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:08,940


435
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,040
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi
