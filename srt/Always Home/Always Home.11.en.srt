I came to see you.

42
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,260
Did you see that goal I scored?

43
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,300
That was incredible!

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,950

54
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,900
I tested it for you.

55
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,620
It really works.

56
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,550
See, I told you.

57
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,700

69
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,320
Didn't you pass
the preliminary selection?

70
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440
You don't look too happy.

71
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,060
It's nothing.

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,350
I just haven't been
on the field for a long time.

73
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,420
Suddenly playing so aggressively today,

74
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,740
I'm just a bit tired.

75
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,710
Come on, you're not telling the truth.

76
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,860
Actually,

77
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,820
I played beyond my usual level today.

78
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,350
Compared to those guys
from the soccer academy,

79
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,860
there's still a gap.

80
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,590
And that gap

81
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,740
will only get bigger.

82
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,740
Is it because of your leg?

83
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,860
They have professional
coaches guiding them.

84
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,620
So of course, the conditions

85
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,860
aren't equal.

86
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,300
But you made it
to the preliminary selection.

87
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,990
It means you have what it takes.

88
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,550
Oh, please don't tell Huan'er
about this.

89
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,030
Why?

90

I just

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,420
don't want her to worry.

92
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,710
Don't worry.

93
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,740
There's no need to mention it anyway.

94
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
I know you'll make it
to the final selection.

95
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,180
How do you know?

96
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,550

101

102
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,030
I'm confident now.

103
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,030

Dad.

110
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,590
What happens?

111
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,790
Is something wrong?

112
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,910
I just wanted to ask,

113
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,940
is there any

114
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,500
more advanced surgery

115
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,620
that could help Xichi recover fully?

116
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,260
Right now, there aren't

117
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,710
any better surgical options.

118
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,380
If you want him to get back
to his previous state,

119
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,820
that's probably not realistic.

120
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,030
That's why

121
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,910
I recommended conservative treatment.

122
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,260

to write at the same level.

fancy words together,

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,620
Alright.

191
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,800
Does anyone have
any problem with this question?

192
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,260
No.

193
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,110
Ms. Guo.

194
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,710
Song Cong.

195
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,710
Please come out for a while.

196
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,070
(Operating Room)
Dad! What happened?

197
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,110
How's Mom?

198
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,590
Intracranial hemorrhage.

199
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,590
It doesn't look good.

200
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,900
How did this happen?

201
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,620
What exactly happened?

202
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,190
There was an accident

203
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,780
in the emergency room.

204
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,860
From what I heard,

205
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
the emergency
patient wasn't that critical.

206
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,060
But, their family got agitated

207
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,620
and wanted to go
into the emergency room.

208
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,990
Aunt Hao Mei tried to stop him,

209
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,860
to hold him back.

210
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,500
But, that person gave

211
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,710
Aunt Hao Mei a hefty shove

212
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,070
and her head hit the edge of the bed.

213
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,620
She lost consciousness right away.

214
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,430
What a rude person.

215
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,420
Alright, you eat something first.

216
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,710
I don't know what's going on.

217
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,820
I have to go and check.

218
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,780
Mom,

219
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,710
I'll go with you.

220
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,020
His backpack

221
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,950
is still with me.

222
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,070
I'll take it to him.

223
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,710
Alright.

224
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,710
Song Hang.

225
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,070
Uncle Song.

226
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,470
How is she?

227
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,230
It's hard to say right now.

228
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,950
Mom.

229
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,780
You're here.

230
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,380
Song Cong.

231
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,470
Hmm...

232
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,020
Song Cong.

233
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,430
You and Huan'er could go home first.

234
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,590
Your dad and I will be here.

235
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,350
Don't worry.

236
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,740
Aunt, I'm fine.

237
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,950
You haven't eaten yet, right?

238
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,310
What about I go and buy you something?

239
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,380
Song Hang, come with me.

240
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,350
Let's go together.

241
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,230
What exactly happened?

242
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,500
How did it end up like this?

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,740
It was an accident
in the emergency room.

244
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,860
I never thought
it would be this serious.

245
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,830
This is so...

246
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,830
How could this even happen?

247
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,950
Are you okay?

248
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,070
I grew up here.

249
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,070
Before this,

250
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,140
I used to watch other people's
families come and go.

251
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,040
It didn't really mean anything to me.

252
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,310
But,

253
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,110
seeing my mom get wheeled in today...

254
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,470
Only I understand how they felt.

255
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,020
You all probably know

256
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,590
I was sick a lot as a kid, right?

257
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,500
Back then, I was too young.

258
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,710
All I remember

259
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,990
is the strong smell of the disinfectant.

260
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,070
Later, my parents told me

261
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,830
that before I turned five,

262
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,350
I had to stay here

263
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,110
for treatments all the time.

264
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,950
At that time,

265
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,190
what I remember most

266
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,470
is how worried my parents looked.

267
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,990
Even now,

268
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,110
I still feel

269
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,710
guilty about it.

270
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,470
I believe

271
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,390
Aunt Hao, just like little me back then,

272
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,950
wouldn't want you

273
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,990
to feel sad seeing her like this.

274
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,300
Song Cong,

275
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,990
Aunt Hao is always healthy.

276
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,340
She will be okay.

277
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,390
Huan'er,

278
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,340
thank you.

279
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,990
(Actually, I don't know if my words)

280
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,500
(can really comfort Song Cong.)

281
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,430
(Perhaps, in this moment,
in Song Cong's eyes,)

282
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,300
(all words feel utterly powerless.)

283
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,540
(The healer of wounds)

284
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,740
(is only time.)

285
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,990
You finally showed up.

286
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,320
What exactly happened last night?

287
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,500
You didn't explain it clearly.

288
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,390
She...

289
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,710
She's still in the ICU.

290
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,870
She hasn't woken up yet.

291
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,710
It's that serious?

292
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,780
My mom told me it wasn't serious,

293
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,000
and told me not to worry...

294
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,430
It's pretty serious.

295
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,870
Let's just wait for Aunt Hao to wake up.

296
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:35,950
Then...

297
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,470
What about Song? Is he okay?

298
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,950
I don't think

299
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,740
he'll come to school today.

300
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,820
Let's go.

301
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,390
Did you hear the news?

302
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,990
Song Cong's mom got hurt and paralyzed.

303
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,150
Really?

304
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,190
Yes.

305
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,780
So, that's why Mr. Xu

306
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,780
called him yesterday.

307
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,820
That's right.

308
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,600
He didn't even finish class
before he left.

309
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,430
Is it true? Who told you?

310
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,820
Stop making wild guesses.

311
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,150
I think Xinyan is right.

312
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,710
If this spreads,

313
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,940
it won't be good for any of us.

314
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,400
Exactly.

315
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,300
Song Cong has always been a good guy.

316
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,860
Are you handing in
your physics homework or not?

317
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,400
Come to the washroom with me.

318
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,230
I want to go too.

319
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,020
It's so stuffy in here. Let's go.

320
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,540
Stop writing.

321
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,680
Let's go to the washroom.

322
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,190
Let's go.

323
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,340
Let's go.

324
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,870
I get to go to the washroom.

325
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,500
Me too.

326
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,060
I just heard about your family.

327
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,740
How is your mom?

328
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,580
She hasn't woken up yet.

329
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,230
If you need to file a lawsuit,

330
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,710
my mom might be able to help.

331
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,430
No need. Actually, I...

332
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,630
You can ask me for help.

333
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,870
Thanks.

334
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,470
How is she?

335
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,950
She's awake now.

336
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,230
We'll keep monitoring her.

337
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,150
Don't worry too much.

338
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,990
Your mom

339
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,230
has nerve damage.

340
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,540
Her right leg's motor
function is impaired.

341
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,470
When she will be able to stand again

342
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,710
depends on her recovery.

343
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,500
But the good news is,
she's out of danger

344
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,440
and has been moved to a general ward.

345
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,630
I plan to transfer her
to the city hospital.

346
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,500
The conditions there are better.

347
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,710
Dad,

348
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,020
does Mom

349
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,580
know about her condition yet?

350
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,580
No, she doesn't know.

351
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,300
Alright, I'm heading to the hospital.

352
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,950
(The moment I saw my father in tears,)

353
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,910
(I don't know why I hid.)

354
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,260
(Perhaps,)

355
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,100
(I was afraid
of facing his helplessness.)

356
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,990
(Or maybe I was afraid)

357
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,710
(of facing my own powerlessness.)

358
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,100
(Wanting to be
a good parent isn't wrong.)

359
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,300
(But they love their children so much)

360
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,230
(that they forget themselves.)

361
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,200
(They demand of themselves)

362
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,950
(to be unbreakable in front of me,)

363
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,500
(ashamed to show
vulnerability or grief.)

364
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,430
(But what I really hope for)

365
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,230
(is for them to speak up.)

366
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,710
(So that I)

367
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,240
(can share the burden too.)

368
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,870
Mom always keeps the cigarettes there.

369
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,430
Dad,

370
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,500
aren't you basically smoking
right under her nose?

371
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,940
Aren't you afraid she'll find out?

372
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,630
I only put the first pack there.

373
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,540
The rest was put by your mom.

374
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,780
She's known for a long time.

375
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,150
She definitely has a stash somewhere.

376
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,230
I just haven't found it yet.

377
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,820
Dad,

378
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,120
I want to transfer to
an experimental high school.

379
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,660
I want to take care of Mom.

380
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,710
You don't have to worry about your mom.

381
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,500
Just focus on your studies.

382
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,260
Mom's always taken care of us.

383
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,440
Now she needs someone
to take care of her.

384
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,280
How could I just act
like nothing happened?

385
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,710
I know you're a thoughtful kid.

386
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,020
I don't see you as a child either.

387
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,230
But from today on,

388
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,710
let me handle everything.

389
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,780
Even if I can't,

390
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,390
there's still your aunt and grandma.

391
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,060
Aunt is already busy
taking care of the family.

392
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,470
Grandma is getting old.

393
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,470
Mom hates troubling others too.

394
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,470
Telling them will just
make them worry more.

395
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,230
I just want to do something for Mom.

396
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,390
Moreover,

397
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,340
it doesn't really matter
to me where I study.

398
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,430
And,

399
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,820
don't tell Mom
about the transfer.

400
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,630
Transfer?

401
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,300
If Aunt Hao finds out
you transferred because of her,

402
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,470
she'll be upset.

403
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,150
Yeah.

404
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,780
Isn't Aunt Hao most concerned

405
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,150
about your education?

406
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,430
I can get into college
no matter where I study.

407
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,500
And, I've already decided.

408
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,390
My dad's been so busy with work.

409
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,100
Ever since my mom was transferred,

410
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,630
he's been running back and forth
between two hospitals every day.

411
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,630
If this keeps up,

412
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,990
his health will suffer too.

413
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,100
If I transfer to
an experimental high school,

414
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,820
I'll be closer to my mom's hospital.

415
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,820
At least I can bring her meals

416
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,780
and help out a bit.

417
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:17,950
Then...

418
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,020
When are you transferring?

419
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,950
I'm handling the document tomorrow.

420
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,150
That soon?

421
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,740
Sorry, you two.

422
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,710
We won't be

423
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,150
going to school together anymore.

424
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,870
What's there to be sorry about?

425
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,820
Of course, you'd choose
your mom in this situation.

426
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,060
If it were me,

427
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,990
I'd do the same.

428
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,500
Come on,

429
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,780
it seems that I'm abandoning you guys.

430
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,710
It's fine.

431
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,340
We still live in the same compound.

432
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,060
We can see each other anytime.

433
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,060
(From the first time I met Song Cong,)

434
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,990
(I sensed his maturity.)

435
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,390
(Pawn)
(I never expected he'd become)

436
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,430
(an adult before us in this way.)

437
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,340
(As a friend,)

438
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,390
(all I can do is pat
his shoulder in support.)

439
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,390
(Anything else feels unnecessary.)

440
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,150
You're not going to
say goodbye to your classmates?

441
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,820
Mr. Xu,

442
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm not good at
handling this kind of situation.

443
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,300
I understand. It's okay.

444
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,710
I'll let them know.

445
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,910
We'll walk you to the school gate then.

446
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,470
It's not a farewell,
just sending you off.

447
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,190
Class is about to start.

448
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,390
You two should stay.

449
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,060
Song Cong.

450
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,990
This is...

451
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,440
These are notes from the past few days.

452
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,230
Every subject is in there.
Catch up soon.

453
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,020
You have to get the first place
even if you get there.

454
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,860
Don't let anyone surpass you, okay?

455
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,230
I thought we finally
had a top student in class,

456
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,760
and now everything has changed.

457
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,300
We don't even have a class rep now.

458
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,020
Isn't Li Tian still here?

459
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,300
I'm not taking your place.

460
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,020
It's too time-consuming.

461
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,280
I need to focus on studying.

462
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,680
Li Tian, don't be so ungrateful.

463
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,430
I...

464
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,500
Song Cong is leaving.

465
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,950
Stop arguing.

466
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,740
Just take it.

467
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,460
It won't interfere with your studies.

468
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,710
Besides,

469
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,470
you're the only one
I can trust with this role.

470
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,710
Fine, I'll take it.

471
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:23,990
I'm heading in now.

472
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,710
Go ahead.

473
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,820
Well...

474
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,740
Mr. Xu.

475
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,020
Xinyan.

476
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,740
I'll be going now.

477
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,740
Thank you for everything.

478
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,580
Take care.

479
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,190
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

480
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,540
Go on.

481
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,300
Hurry inside. Class is starting.

482
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,300
Do you know why

483
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,230
I just told you

484
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,390
those things from my heart?

485
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,260
Why?

486
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,150
Because I like you.

487
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,007
(Results of the Second-Year
High School Periodic Test Announced)

488
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:49,180
(Top 10 in Science, 1: Song Cong)
(Top 10 in Art, 1: Qi Qi)

489
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,910
(What did you say?)

490
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,500
(I said,)

491
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,230
(I will become someone
as outstanding as you.)

492
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,220
(Song Cong. Qi Qi.)

493
00:34:12,832 --> 00:34:15,340
(Inpatient Building A)

494
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,870
(Song Cong has always been)

495
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,350
(the most mature among us.)

496
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,100
(Someone has to take care of Aunt Hao.)

497
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,100
(Watching Uncle Song
running back and forth,)

498
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,620
(he didn't want to just
stand by as a spectator.)

499
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,060
(He never mentioned)

500
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,470
(how he was doing.)

501
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,790
(I don't know if it's because
he didn't want us to worry)

502
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,790
(or because he didn't want us)

503
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,270
(to see his sadness.)

504
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,540
(When we heard that Aunt Hao's
health was gradually improving,)

505
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,220
(we were all happy for Song Cong.)

506
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,790
(But still,)

507
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,100
(on the way to school every day,)

508
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,100
(it was just me and Jing Xichi left.)

509
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,580
(The lively times
we had before were gone.)

510
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,390
Hey,

511
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,870
you're finally discharged.

512
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,350
You really scared Song Hang this time.

513
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,750
I remember the last time

514
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,990
his forehead turned dark

515
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,270
was back in school.

516
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,790
Back then, in our major,

517
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,200
there were way more girls than boys.

518
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,540
Every day, we had to
practice cupping therapy several times.

519
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,310
When there was no one left,
we pulled him over, pressed him down,

520
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,310
and everyone took turns
practicing on him.

521
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,220
In the end, his whole
forehead turned dark.

522
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,100
Really? That actually happened?

523
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,390
He never told me about it.

524
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,270
I didn't have a camera back then.

525
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,180
If I did, I would have taken a picture,

526
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,270
framed it, and hung it
in your living room.

527
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,310
Listen to her talking nonsense.

528
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,060
Don't tell him about this, okay?

529
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,910
Keep it a secret.

530
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,700
Keep it a secret.

531
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,990
I caused you all

532
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,900
a lot of trouble
this time in the hospital.

533
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,830
And, Huan'er too.

534
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,350
She came so many times.

535
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,350
Daughters are the best.

536
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,220
They know how to care for people.

537
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,620
Actually, you could always
have another one.

538
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Who knows,

539
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,430
maybe it will surprise you.

540
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

541
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,000
We're already "old canned goods".

542
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,580
As long as we don't rust, we're good.

543
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,500
Aunt Lin, is there canned food to eat?

544
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,790
Canned food? What canned food?

545
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,480
Are the discharge procedures done?

546
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,220
All done.

547
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,500
Help tidy up.

548
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,060
Let's move your mom over here.

549
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,790
Yeah, come on.

550
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,700
Be careful.

551
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,430
Slowly, Mom.

552
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,790
Careful, careful.

553
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,620
Take it slow.

554
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,720
I'll put in some strength.

555
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,240
Hold her leg.

556
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,140
It's okay.

557
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,180
It's okay.

558
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:22,750
Okay?

559
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,140
It's fine.

560
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,080
Alright, turn around.

561
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,310
Yes. That's it.

562
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,700
Great.

563
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,310
Slowly, slowly.

564
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,990
Are you okay, Mom?

565
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,060
- Lower her down slowly.
- Alright.

566
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,660
Are you okay?

567
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,700
Must've worn you out.

568
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,620
Not at all.

569
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,700
It's good to have a son.

570
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,540
I'm definitely not getting tired.

571
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,750
Slowly.

572
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,500
Alright.

573
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,830
I'll take these two bags.

574
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,100
You push your mom.

575
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,830
Be careful.

576
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,620
Okay. I'll do it.

577
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,260
I'll take it.

578
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,700
I'll come back for the bags later.

579
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,300
I'll take it.

580
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,990
Alright.

581
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,310
Mom, you're discharged now.

582
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,540
There is a little bumpy here.

583
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,350
It's fine.

584
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,580
Take good care of your mom.

585
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,140
Okay.

586
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,980
If anything comes up,

587
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,350
- just let us know.
- Yes, let us know.

588
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,870
Hao, we've been waiting
for you to come home.

589
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,990
My husband said

590
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,310
if you need anything, just let us know.

591
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,870
Thank you.

592
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,580
And thank Dr. Li as well.

593
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,700
We're all family. No need to thank me.

594
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,470
Hao, hurry up and go upstairs to rest.

595
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,830
Yes. Come, I'll carry you.

596
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,910
I'll do it.

597
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,500
Let me do it.

598
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,160
You won't be able to carry me.

599
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,000
I can.

600
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,470
Song Hang.

601
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,350
Don't worry. Come on.

602
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:30,950
Slowly, slowly.

603
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,140
One, two, three.

604
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,790
Slowly, slowly.

605
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,950
Watch the steps.

606
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,750
Be careful.

607
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,910
I'll help you pack up.

608
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,220
No, no.

609
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,500
It's fine, I'll do it myself.

610
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,220
I'll do it myself.

611
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,220
It's nothing, really.

612
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,620
Hurry up and go home.

613
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,580
You've worked hard.

614
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,580
Mom, lean on the sofa.

615
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,540
This is quite heavy.

616
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,870
Where's Mrs. Li?

617
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,950
I let her go back already.

618
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,750
Are you tired?

619
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,470
I'm fine.

620
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,140
Hang, how about we switch
to a first-floor apartment?

621
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,990
With me having to go up
and down every day,

622
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,080
won't that wear you all out?

623
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,310
Mom, don't worry.

624
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,700
After transferring, I'll go with Dad

625
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,980
to take turns taking care of you.

626
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,830
Transfer schools?

627
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,910
Why would you transfer?

628
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,820
Have you already transferred school?

629
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,000
The other day, you wore
a different school uniform.

630
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,390
You told me it was a new
standardized design from the school.

631
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,310
I was...

632
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,360
You lied to me, didn't you?

633
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,390
No, Mom.

634
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,020
That experimental high school
is really good too.

635
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,020
Song Hang,

636
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,500
you agreed to this?

637
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,400
Have you ever thought about
what will happen to his Gaokao?

638
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,240
Mom, you don't have
to worry about my grades.

639
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,940
I can still be ranked first over there.

640
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,950
This is our son's own decision.

641
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,480
He wants to take on
the responsibility of being your child.

642
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,080
I believe he's capable of doing so.

643
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,700
You should respect his decision

644
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,910
and accept his care.

645
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,990
It's not a bad thing.

646
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,060
It's bad.

647
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,960
I don't need you all to take care of me!

648
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,460
I'm not completely paralyzed.

649
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,020
I don't need you to worry about me.

650
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,500
Alright. That's enough now.

651
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,820
You shouldn't get too
worked up in your condition.

652
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,470
It's about mealtime.
I'll go buy some food.

653
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,180
Take good care of your mom.

654
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,980
I don't need you to look after me.

655
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,700
Leave. All of you, just leave!

656
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,140
Why are you going through

657
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,160
all this formal nonsense?

658
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,180
Do you think Aunt Hao
needs this pot of flowers?

659
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,680
If your rhinitis acts up again,
I'd love to see what you'll do.

660
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,760
That's why I told you
to stay away from me.

661
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,220
Song Cong said

662
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,390
Aunt Hao had already
prepared matching scarves

663
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,580
for her trip.

664
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,270
With this unexpected situation,

665
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,750
she must be feeling awful.

666
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,430
You boys

667
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,380
just don't understand
a mother's feelings at all.

668
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,700
Yes, you know it.

669
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,700
When are you planning
to take it over to her?

670
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,100
Right now.

671
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,260
We'll just drop it off
at Song Cong's doorstep.

672
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,020
Do you smell something burning?

673
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,750
Really? No, I don't.

674
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,090
Wait, it is coming
from Aunt Hao's house!

675
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,470
Aunt Hao!

676
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,310
Is anyone home? Open the door!

677
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,540
There's so much smoke!

678
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,350
I'll make a call.

679
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,020
What could we do?

680
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,180
Song, hurry! Open the door!

681
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:16,910
Open the door!

682
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,140
Is Aunt Hao home alone?

683
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,470
My mom is still inside!

684
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,350
Hao Mei!

685
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,500
Aunt Hao!

686
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,990
Hao Mei, say something!

687
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,990
Aunt Hao!

688
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,180
Mom!

689
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,830
- Aunt Hao!
- Aunt Hao!

690
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,470
Fire...

691
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,060
Hao Mei!

692
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,270
Are you okay?

693
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,310
Aunt Hao!

694
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,060
Come on!

695
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,540
Aunt Hao!

696
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,910
Mom, are you alright?

697
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,220
Go away, Huan'er.

698
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,790
You and Xichi leave.

699
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,750
Go!

700
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,180
Go now!

701
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,870
Aunt Hao, we'll leave first.

702
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,470
Don't touch me.

703
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,700
Did you get burned anywhere?

704
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,310
Are you hurt?

705
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,910
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

706
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:15,830
It's fine.

707
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,390
I'll take you to change clothes.

708
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,500
It's fine.

709
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,350
