1
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:20,900


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,830
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,280
   
   

17
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,220
Hello, what's up?

18
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,700
I'm at the door.

19
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,030
Now?

20
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,230
I... Wait a minute.

21
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,310
Good morning.

22
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,470
You're here.

23
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,540
Am I too early?

24
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,940
A little.

25
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,100
Come in.

26
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,420
- Keep it down. 
 - Okay.

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,128
What's wrong with your back?

28
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,430
Nothing. I kind of sprained it yesterday.

29
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,360
Well, sit down.

30
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,710
I haven't finished packing yet. I'll be done in a minute.

31
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,430
So where do I sit?

32
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,390
Wherever you like.

33
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,990
Just like before.

34
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,150
How can it be the same?

35
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,710
My status is different now, so my mindset has to change too.

36
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,075
Huan Er.

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,370
When are we going to tell our parents about us?

38
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,060
- I... 
 - Huan Er.

39
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,620
- Huan Er. 
 - Uncle Chen.

40
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,580
Xi Chi's here.

41
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,470
It's so early. What are you two doing here?

42
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,540
Well, school is about to start, isn't it?

43
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,580
We're just discussing something.

44
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,764
Yes. Dad, where's Mom? Is she still sleeping?

45
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:32,500
Right. This time, pack more clothes when you go.

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,750
And pack your toiletries separately from your clothes.

47
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,520
Don't get it all over the place like last time.

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,710
Okay. I've packed them all.

49
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,660
You packed better this time. My Huan Er has grown up.

50
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,910
Xi Chi, it's been hard for you these past few days.

51
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,270
No. This is what I should do.

52
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,990
There's something else I'd like to ask you.

53
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,030
Go ahead, Uncle.

54
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,120
That is, when you go to school, please take care of Huan Er for me.

55
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,968
- No problem. 
 - I know there are

56
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:08,030
many handsome guys and temptations at university.

57
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,940
Keep a close eye on her.

58
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,470
Don't let any boy trick my girl away.

59
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,540
Dad, what are you saying?

60
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,160
What? Did I say anything wrong?

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,581
Sure, no problem, Uncle. Don't worry.

62
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:21,710
- I will take good care of Huan Er. 
 - Good.

63
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,070
I'll leave her with you then.

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,100
I'll make you two some breakfast. You can have a chat.

65
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,620
Okay.

66
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,740
No, right now I...

67
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,980
With your dad saying that, I feel like the big bad wolf who steals what he's supposed to guard.

68
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,940
What should we do?

69
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,630
Maybe... maybe we shouldn't tell them yet, especially not my dad.

70
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,200
He's probably not ready to accept our relationship right now.

71
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,740
Okay.

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,780
By the way, you haven't told Qi Qi and Song Cong about us, have you?

73
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,420
I... They already know.

74
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,950
- Since when? 
 - I told them last night.

75
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,300
- Why didn't you tell me? 
 - My back hurts.

76
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,540
 Xi Chi, do you eat milk and eggs? 

77
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm not eating, Uncle. I have something to do.

78
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,820
I'll go now. I'm not eating.

79
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,630
- Have breakfast here. 
 - How do I dare to sit here and eat?

80
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,520
Bye, Uncle.

81
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,470
Thanks.

82
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,120
Be careful. It's hot.

83
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,300
Thank you.

84
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:42,286
It's so good.

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,630
You've got some on your lips. Wipe it off.

86
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,150
Stop it. They're sitting here watching.

87
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,150
What's wrong?

88
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,760
I'll wipe it off myself.

89
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,980
- They're watching us. 
 - What's wrong?

90
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,180
They're calm.

91
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,830
Like it's no big deal, they're not even surprised.

92
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,100
We knew you two would be together.

93
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,920
The whole world knew you liked each other.

94
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,950
Was it that obvious?

95
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,070
How can it not be?

96
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,597
You were practically orbiting around her every day.

97
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,300
Huan Er, listen.

98
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,520
Xi Chi has liked you for a while.

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,420
He was afraid to confess, fearing you'd reject him.

100
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,420
Really?

101
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,950
Since when?

102
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,050
- About since... 
 - Song&nbsp;Cong,

103
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,980
can you stop broadcasting everything like a bullhorn?

104
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,530
Okay.

105
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:32,710
Since high school?

106
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,300
- No, not that early. 
 - Since high school?

107
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,130
Last Thursday night, around 8:40 p.m.

108
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,630
We're still here. Stop showing affection.

109
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,390
Are you going back to school tomorrow?

110
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,831
Yes.

111
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:46,853
What about you?

112
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,160
We're going back tomorrow too.

113
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,408
I've got to leave quickly. After I changed my major,

114
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:53,200
my mom has been impatient with me every day.

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,196
I can't stand it.

116
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:57,220
Did you get the connecting tickets?

117
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,950
Tickets are hard to come by now.

118
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,510
We'll have to sit separately.

119
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,050
No.

120
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,950
Song Cong, which compartment did you get?

121
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,760
Let me see.

122
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,800
- Twelve. What about you? 
 - Twelve?

123
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,920
You bought a second-class seat?

124
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,360
Yes.

125
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,440
It's okay. They'd probably swap your second‑class seat

126
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,710
for a business‑class one.

127
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,860
I want to sit with you.

128
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,540
Don't do that.

129
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,200
We're just not on the road together.

130
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,834
When we get there, I'll take you back to school.

131
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,710
It's okay. It isn't worth much.

132
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,490
It's decided.

133
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:49,300
Qi Qi, didn't your mom freeze your card because you changed your major?

134
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,100
I sold some of my old clothes and bags,

135
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,108
- so I'm okay for now. 
 - Okay.

136
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,808
I read the novel you posted online.

137
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:26,253
Are you going to mock me again?

138
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,942
The wording's a bit childish and the idea a bit clichéd,

139
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:36,630
but I admit that you have perception and talent.

140
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:45,960
If you really want to study literature, I think you should go abroad.

141
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,460
Aunt Zhou's daughter is studying literature at Cambridge. You can contact her.

142
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,700
I don't want to go abroad.

143
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,440
You need more than talent to study literature. You need vision, insight,

144
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,631
experience and a strong philosophical foundation.

145
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:02,440
No matter what direction you're going to take in the future,

146
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,320
the experience of studying abroad will definitely nourish your creativity.

147
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,380
But writing for a living on a second-rate website only saps your passion for literature.

148
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,620
Are you afraid your boyfriend will stop you from going abroad?

149
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,390
Listen here.

150
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,210
Only incompetent men hinder their partner's growth.

151
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,950
Think about it.

152
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,810
Since you're going after your dreams, I want you to have no regrets.

153
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,940
- Are you tired? 
 - No.

154
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,560
This is nothing. Have you forgotten I have muscles?

155
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,086
- I'm strong. 
 - Enough. All right.

156
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,940
I've arrived. Give it to me.

157
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
I'll walk you up.

158
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,560
I'll go up myself.

159
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,750
By the way, should we tell Zhou&nbsp;Ye and the others about us?

160
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,350
Okay. I'll go back and find a chance to tell them.

161
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,150
- Okay. 
 - Xi Chi, Huan Er.

162
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,180
- Hui Xin. 
 - It's good you're all back.

163
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,700
Call your roommates and have dinner in our dorm tonight.

164
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,520
I've brought a lot of specialties from home.

165
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,250
We'll make a hot pot together.

166
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,780
Isn't it inconvenient for us girls to go to the boys' dormitory?

167
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,030
Not really.

168
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,720
Our dormitory isn't as strict as yours.

169
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,000
Besides, it gets crowded at night.

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,700
When it's time, we guys will cover for you. You'll sneak in with the crowd.

171
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,420
Come on, Huan Er.

172
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,640
Or Hui Xin will be alone.

173
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,030
All right. Worst‑case, we get a scolding. I'll go with Hui&nbsp;Xin.

174
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,497
Hui Xin, see you this evening.

175
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:09,750
Let's go back and tidy up.

176
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,510
Okay. Let's meet this evening.

177
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,230
Wait. You'd better tidy up. Don't leave smelly socks all over the place.

178
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,508
How can that be? The boys' dorm is really clean, right, Zhou Ye?

179
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:19,750
Clean? Is it clean?

180
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,680
Of course it's clean. We'll get going now.

181
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,810
Bye.

182
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,360
- Bye, Huan Er. 
 - Bye.

183
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,280
Bye.

184
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,542
- What's the hurry? 
 - Let's tidy up.

185
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,875
Run quickly, and go back first.

186
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,490
Oh, no.

187
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,750
Wait, bro, why did you run so fast?

188
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,909
Zhou&nbsp;Ye, put away the underwear on the balcony first.

189
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,930
Yan&nbsp;Mu, wash your smelly socks.

190
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,790
Now I'm going to fetch water and mop the floor.

191
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,864
We have a lot to do or we won't finish in time.

192
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,770
No, wait. Wait a minute.

193
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,180
What are you doing?

194
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,470
Are you role‑playing a dorm warden?

195
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,229
You asked the girls to come over. You're going to let them see this?

196
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:05,120
Girls are coming to our dormitory?

197
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,600
Before the dormitory is cleaned, no one is allowed to leave.

198
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,300
No, Jing Xi Chi, you're being too much of an idol now.

199
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,140
My girlfriend is coming and I said nothing about it. Why are you anxious?

200
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,770
Just clean it up, okay?

201
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,860
Or I won't help you with group work anymore.

202
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,010
Wait, where is Zhang Yang?

203
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,680
He's gone out to have fun.

204
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,910
He...

205
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,460
- Hi, Madam. 
 - You're back.

206
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,210
Hi, Madam.

207
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,080
Hi, Madam.

208
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,530
You've gained weight.

209
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,600
No.

210
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Hi, Madam.

211
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,520
You're back.

212
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,080
This is what you call a big crowd, and you think it's easy to sneak in?

213
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,600
I really didn't expect this.

214
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,650
Aren't we being a little bold?

215
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,130
Don't worry.

216
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,600
With the way you three are dressed, who'd recognize you?

217
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,650
Hello, Huan Er!

218
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,530
Let's forget it.

219
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,050
- I... 
 - No, Hui Xin. I've got it all ready.

220
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,220
- I... 
 - Since we're here, let's go.

221
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,230
Is this hairstyle for men or women?

222
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,150
We can actually do this?

223
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,643
Let's go. I'll cover you.

224
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:30,142
Let's go. Hui Xin, it's going to be fine.

225
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,110
Which dormitory are you from?

226
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,320
Madam, it's me.

227
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,420
- Jing Xi Chi. 
 - Room 258.

228
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,316
- Zhou Ye. 
 - Yes. Zhou Ye.

229
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:48,042
- Which dormitory are they from? 
 - Madam, this is my junior, a street dancer.

230
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,531
- Dance for her. 
 - Those weird clothes...

231
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:50,650
Yeah. Look.

232
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,708
Madam, you watch this TV series too?

233
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,908
Let me tell you, my mom loves to watch this too.

234
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:58,530
- Really? 
 - This guy's a scumbag.

235
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,900
He ran off with his sister-in-law and cheated on his wife.

236
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,050
- Which episode is that? 
 - All right, Madam. Enjoy it.

237
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,440
I'll spare you the spoilers.

238
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,810
- Does her husband divorce her? 
 - Yes.

239
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,160
Catch me up on what's happened.

240
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,080
Come on.

241
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,080
The boys' dormitory is cleaner than the girls'.

242
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,650
How can it not be?

243
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,220
He made us clean it all afternoon.

244
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,680
It's as if your girlfriend is coming over.

245
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,442
Stop it.

246
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,900
Wait, aren't we two chairs short?

247
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,050
Oh, right.

248
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,960
Yan Mu, go borrow two from the next dormitory.

249
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,650
- No problem. 
 - Thank you.

250
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,440
Come on, let's sit down. Sit down.

251
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,650
- I'll help you. 
 - No. I can do it.

252
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,660
I can do it.

253
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,600
You still haven't told them we're dating?

254
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,770
I just... haven't found the right time.

255
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,180
Why don't we just tell them now while everyone's here?

256
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,310
Okay.

257
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,564
Zhou Ye, let me help you.

258
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:05,020
Don't move. I'll take a picture first.

259
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,530
I have to send it to the group chat to piss off Zhang Yang and Qiu Li.

260
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,090
- They're so late. 
 - Okay.

261
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,050
Okay, let's eat now. Come on.

262
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,840
- Thank you. 
 - Let's start eating, my friends.

263
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,650
Come on, Hui Xin.

264
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,840
Here, try this. You love bean curd, don't you?

265
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,030
I bought a lot of them.

266
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,770
- It must be enough for you. 
 - Okay.

267
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,960
And... And this.

268
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,442
My mom made these fish balls herself.

269
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:27,410
- They're really good. Just try one and you'll see. 
 - Really?

270
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,086
I'm sure there's enough for you to eat.

271
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:30,770
You can have another one of these.

272
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,720
Zhou, we know you're in love.

273
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,440
Can't you restrain yourself?

274
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,840
There are four singles here.

275
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,530
All right, Hui Xin.

276
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,664
I'll leave you to it then.

277
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,540
Come on, Huan Er. Don't you love tripe?

278
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,960
Come on, try some tripe. It must be delicious.

279
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,320
It smells good when you serve it.

280
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,890
Is it good?

281
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,708
- Yes, it's so delicious. 
 - I'll get another one for you.

282
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,810
- Try a meat ball. 
 - Thank you, Huan Er.

283
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,170
It's good for your health. Try some fish tofu.

284
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,390
It smells so good. Thank you. Huan Er. Thank you.

285
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,680
Lu, don't just look at your phone.

286
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,320
Why aren't you eating?

287
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,840
Let me upload this first.

288
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,242
You love eating that much?

289
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:24,664
Have you never eaten before or what?

290
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm hungry, Bro.

291
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,397
Jing, you and Chen Huan Er... you two have matching profile pictures.

292
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,870
Guys, actually, we...

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,050
- You two are so destined for each other. 
 - Yes.

294
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,060
You just change your profile pic and suddenly it's a matching one?

295
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,408
Good thing neither of you has a partner

296
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:53,760
otherwise this would cause a huge misunderstanding.

297
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,023
- Watch out. 
 - Yeah.

298
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,440
Wait, no.

299
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,380
Why can't you all just take a wild guess? Could it be that the two of us... are actually together?

300
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,842
Jing Xi Chi, did you not get enough to eat or what?

301
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:16,860
If you two wanted to be in love, you'd been in love long ago.

302
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,600
Why wait until now?

303
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,530
Besides, I thought you liked the mature schoolgirl type.

304
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,220
Mature schoolgirl?

305
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,331
No, I don't. Who told you I like mature girls? Don't talk nonsense.

306
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:30,970
Don't you know about it?

307
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,400
- I don't. 
 - Stop.

308
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,290
- Elaborate. 
 - Let me list them for you.

309
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,210
Du Wei, the one who's pretty.

310
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,080
And Fu Ying.

311
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,560
She was rumored to be with him.

312
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,075
All of them are older girls.

313
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,450
You just said it was a rumor. Can you believe rumors?

314
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,942
Even if you're interested in Huan Er, it's only unrequited love

315
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:58,530
Because our Huan Er's not into the whole childhood friends thing.

316
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,560
When? When did I say that?

317
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,600
Last year, we played the love game, didn't we?

318
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Didn't you go for the domineering boss mode?

319
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,250
Didn't you say the childhood love mode was too boring for you?

320
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,810
Like the left hand holding the right hand. No spark.

321
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,730
- No. When did I say that? 
 - You did.

322
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,320
You like the domineering boss type?

323
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,290
No, that's not true.

324
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,640
Well, it's just a game. Can a game be like reality? Am I right?

325
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,840
I chose it blindly, didn't I? I chose it blindly.

326
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,740
Look, Xi Chi, Huan Er likes the domineering type, and you like the mature type.

327
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,550
How can you be together?

328
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,900
Jing Xi Chi.

329
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,828
Enough!

330
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:44,600
I'm done pretending. Time to lay it all out.

331
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,420
All of you, put down your phones and bowls.

332
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,720
Put it down. Listen to me.

333
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,220
I'll be straight with you.

334
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,760
Actually, a couple of days ago, we already—

335
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,020
Why are the lights off?

336
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,500
- It's not even 10 p.m. Why are the lights off? 
  - Who is using a high-powered appliance? 

337
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,764
Open the doors. I'm going to check the dormitory.

338
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:08,020
Quick. I'll deal with it.

339
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,070
Hurry up.

340
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,830
Hide it. Hide it.

341
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,900
Put it in the cabinet.

342
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,360
Did you guys use any high-powered appliances?

343
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,700
No, that's impossible. We didn't.

344
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,020
Madam, we're all good, law-abiding kids. We’d never use that kind of thing.

345
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,890
Are you sure?

346
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,630
Madam, whose fault was it that caused our dormitory to go off the grid?

347
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,180
None of you kids are trustworthy.

348
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,186
Come on, step aside.

349
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,260
Let me search your room.

350
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,490
 Mage, guess where I am now. 

351
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,970
What's in here?

352
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,210
 Where is my darling? 

353
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,091
 We came to the guys' dorm for hot pot. 

354
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:09,664
 The warden came to check the dormitory. 

355
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:11,910
 I'm hiding under the boys' blanket. 

356
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,840
 What do you think? Pretty dramatic, right? 

357
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:49,627
 Gosh, that boy farted. 

358
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:51,420
 I'm afraid to breathe now. 

359
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,730
 I'm suffocating. 

360
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,200
Are you sure you don't have any high-powered appliances?

361
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
No, don't worry, Madam.

362
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,232
Don't let me find out, or you'll get a demerit.

363
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:06,720
No, we don't have it. For sure.

364
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:25,660
Madam, it's just a teeny little personal quirk.

365
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,740
All right.

366
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,660
- Rest early. 
 - Okay, Madam.

367
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,630
- Bye, Madam. 
 - Goodbye.

368
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,180
- Rest early. Good night. 
 - Good night.

369
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,740
Bye, Madam.

370
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,980
She's gone.

371
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,860
Bro, are you sick?

372
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,786
Get up.

373
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:53,020
She's gone.

374
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,080
She's gone.

375
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,500
She's gone. She's gone.

376
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,980
I was afraid you'd get caught.

377
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,450
I almost suffocated.

378
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,940
It was a close call last night.

379
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,310
Did they ever find that high-powered appliance?

380
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,180
She found it in the other dorms.

381
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,940
We got lucky and dodged a bullet.

382
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,930
What a relief.

383
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,940
Well, did you tell them about us?

384
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,140
Not yet.

385
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,870
I couldn't find a chance.

386
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,390
Same here.

387
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,600
As soon as I told them it was you, they stopped asking questions.

388
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,800
It's so strange.

389
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,687
 Jing, you haven't been yourself lately. 

390
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:49,310
 Which one of the older girls are you chatting with? 

391
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,020
 What older girls? 

392
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,500
 It's Chen Huan Er. 

393
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,583
 Boring. I thought it was someone else. 

394
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,308
 Sleep earlier. 

395
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,460
Yes, same in my dormitory.

396
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,520
 Well, see you at the cafe. 

397
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,080
 There is a new situation. 

398
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,040
 Who are you eating with? 

399
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,690
 Jing Xi Chi. 

400
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:24,390
Do you think maybe we've been acting a little too much like "bros for life"?

401
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:31,130
So how do we switch from a buddy vibe to a couple vibe?

402
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,800
How about...

403
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:18,260
I... I don't think it's a good idea to do it in public.

404
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,208
Well, what about in private?

405
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,080
We'll talk about it later.

406
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,880
Yeah. Let's talk about it later.

407
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:49,220
Hey, can you help me check if I can move my shift to Wednesday afternoons?

408
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,500
I'm taking a lot of electives this semester.

409
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,630
I can only be on duty on Wednesday afternoons.

410
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,590
Please.

411
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,880
That's great. Thanks.

412
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,730
I'll buy you a meal some other time.

413
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,630
Okay. Thanks.

414
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,850
I'll buy you a meal when I'm free.

415
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,930
I can do it.

416
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,980
   

417
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,830
Jing Xi Chi.

418
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,860
You're here.

419
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,050
Are you wearing make-up?

420
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,040
A little.

421
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,886
This is for you.

422
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,500
Thank you.

423
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,210
Do you like it?

424
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,700
Yes, I do.

425
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,030
You've prepared so much food.

426
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,830
These... These are not for eating.

427
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,980
This is my

428
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,180
"V."

429
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,800
Look.

430
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,000
   

431
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,550
Love?

432
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,480
Thanks for your kind thoughts.

433
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,600
You...

434
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,220
Well, we...

435
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,940
Now?

436
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,510
Okay.

437
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,260
Wait.

438
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,830
Wait.

439
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,730
I don't think I can get into it like this.

440
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,660
Yeah, it feels awkward to me too.

441
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,220
Right?

442
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,420
How do we get the feeling?

443
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,830
How do we get the feeling?

444
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,830
I know.

445
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,700
What are you doing?

446
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,700
Kabedon. 
  (T/N: wall slam) 

447
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,070
That's how it's done on TV.

448
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,660
Come on,

449
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,110
kabedon me.

450
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,520
How?

451
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,170
That's how kabedon works.

452
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,260
This is kabedon.

453
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,900
Got it?

454
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,408
How could I not know? Come on, stand here.

455
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,108
Stand still.

456
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,500
I'm coming.

457
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,110
Come on.

458
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,520
Wait.

459
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,960
- What's wrong again? 
 - I think the bag is in the way.

460
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,120
Is it okay now?

461
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,760
It's okay.

462
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,070
Can you stop laughing?

463
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,790
You... I can't do it when you're laughing.

464
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,400
Sorry. I'm sorry.

465
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,896
Again. One more time. I'm sorry.

466
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:12,390
- I'll stop laughing. 
 - Don't laugh.

467
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,253
Again. Again.

468
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,042
I'm coming.

469
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,010
Chen Huan Er.

470
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,070
Sorry. I'm sorry.

471
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,800
Again. One more time, just once more.

472
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,808
- It's the last time. 
 - Okay, the last time.

473
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,846
Close your eyes.

474
00:29:35,846 --> 00:29:37,664
Close your eyes.

475
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:13,930
You're both here.

476
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:16,664
I put it here for you.

477
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,440
That's a lot of nuts. Pretty cool.

478
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,520
Did you prepare it for me, Jing?

479
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,790
What are you two doing?

480
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,920
I... I'm looking for something.

481
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,740
Okay, I'm leaving.

482
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,310
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

483
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,620
It's quite nice.

484
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,520
Zhou Ye totally ruined a perfectly good date.

485
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,830
It's all right.

486
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,720
I have a question for you.

487
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,110
Ask away.

488
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,860
When exactly did you start liking me?

489
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,420
I can't say exactly when.

490
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,070
But I liked you when I first met you,

491
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,460
but I didn't know what kind of feelings they were back then.

492
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,164
What about you?

493
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,460
When did you start liking me?

494
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,170
I...

495
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,740
I have a little secret.

496
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,550
What secret?

497
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:58,750
Actually, the first time we held hands wasn't the night my dad proposed.

498
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,350
When was it then?

499
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,040
It was before that.

500
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,140
 What are you doing? 

501
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:26,390
 What are you doing? 

502
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,150
 I... I was just sitting here, and you suddenly grabbed my hand. 

503
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,700
 Are you a pervert? 

504
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,600
 You creep. 

505
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,830
So you tricked me.

506
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,910
You lied and made me look like a pervert.

507
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:41,680
If you didn't have anything in your heart, why would you believe me?

508
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,160
That's true.

509
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:49,842
So if I hadn't believed you back then, do you think we'd have gotten together sooner?

510
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,940
Not necessarily.

511
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,390
How is it? How does our control of the lights work for you?

512
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,630
- Go on. 
 - Don't stop.

513
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,320
Well, you...

514
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,427
We've known you two were together for ages.

515
00:33:56,427 --> 00:33:58,960
We've just been teasing you.

516
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,853
Kiss again. Go on, quick.

517
00:34:00,853 --> 00:34:02,053
There are no outsiders here.

518
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:02,775
- One more. 
 - Quick.

519
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:05,250
You four are crazy.

520
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,964
- Let's go. 
 - Not bad.

521
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:08,742
- We won't show you. 
 - Don't go.

522
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:10,980
- Come back. 
 - We haven't seen enough.

523
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,620
That's it?

524
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,342
Qi Qi, what've you been up to?

525
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:22,400
I haven't seen you around.

526
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,620
I'm busy writing a novel.

527
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,790
I changed my major.

528
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,386
When my mom found out, she got so mad she froze my card.

529
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:29,960
I have to make money.

530
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,438
Then why are you buying me drinks?

531
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:32,940
How much money do you make writing novels?

532
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,146
I've got some money for drinks.

533
00:34:35,146 --> 00:34:38,080
Where is your boyfriend? Doesn't he care about you?

534
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,060
It doesn't concern him. I don't want to bother him.

535
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,920
Qi Qi, to be honest, are you happy in this relationship?

536
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,710
I'm happy.

537
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,560
Why do you ask?

538
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,902
I just have a feeling you two aren't from the same world.

539
00:34:56,902 --> 00:34:58,346
Okay, I'll stop talking.

540
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,246
Let's drink.

541
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,750
Qi Qi, we're here.

542
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,310
Song Cong, we're here.

543
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:20,506
Song Cong?

544
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,440
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

545
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,620
How are you feeling?

546
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:31,620
Am I drunk, or am I hallucinating?

547
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,020
Xu Wen Wen called me and said you were drunk.

548
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,140
She lied to you. I'm not drunk.

549
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,080
She's just testing to see if you care about me.

550
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,190
- What are you doing? 
 - Let's go back.

551
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,720
I don't want to go back yet.

552
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,940
Have a drink with me.

553
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,830
You know I can't drink.

554
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,290
Just a bottle.

555
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,236
I have an exam tomorrow morning.

556
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,197
One bottle.

557
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,020
Okay. I'll have a glass of something with you.

558
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,388
We'll leave after that, okay?

559
00:36:02,388 --> 00:36:03,990
Okay.

560
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,140
- Let's go. 
 - No.

561
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,790
Song Cong, what are you doing?

562
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,910
Cheers. Let's drink!

563
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,980
I'm dead drunk.

564
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,720
You're fine.

565
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:32,710
Come on, let's keep drinking.

566
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,886
Stop it.

567
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:34,960
Don't drink too much.

568
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,770
I came here to drink and have a good time.

569
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:42,590
If you don't let me drink... Don't kill the vibe.

570
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,280
Xu Wen Wen.

571
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,980
Let's drink.

572
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,400
Song Cong, let's drink.

573
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,468
Stop it.

574
00:37:19,468 --> 00:37:21,150
Come on.

575
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,710
I told you not to drink so much.

576
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,910
I just want to drink.

577
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,620
How are you feeling?

578
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,100
Are you okay?

579
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,070
I'm fine.

580
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,260
Song Cong, I want some water.

581
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,060
I have an exam early tomorrow morning.

582
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,820
When you're asleep, I'll go back.

583
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,540
Are you leaving?

584
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,230
Can you not go?

585
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,790
I can't. I've got things to do in the morning.

586
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,570
Why can't you stay with me?

587
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,140
Song Cong,

588
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,140
do you really like me?

589
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,620
Of course I do.

590
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,420
No.

591
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,790
That's not how you like someone at all.

592
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:23,360
You treat me totally differently than you treat Chen Huan Er.

593
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,420
What does this have to do with Chen Huan Er?

594
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,190
I've seen how you looked at her when you liked her.

595
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,160
Wasn't that over ages ago?

596
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,170
Yes.

597
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,190
I liked Chen Huan Er before.

598
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,320
But I also lost myself because I liked her.

599
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,310
Now I don't think that's the right way to go.

600
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:47,020
Is it wrong for me to like someone in a different way?

601
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,230
Isn't it true that people grow up?

602
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,890
Why are you so mean to me?

603
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,230
So now you think I'm being unreasonable?

604
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,500
I'm not being mean to you.

605
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:10,980
I've been doing my best to be good to you, to be worthy of your love.

606
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,620
But now you're telling me that's wrong too.

607
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,453
So what should I do to be right?

608
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,850
Okay.

609
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,020
You said you shouldn't change yourself if you like someone.

610
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,720
But it was only after I changed that you fell in love with me. Don't you see?

611
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,710
Over the past year, I've been acting the way you like in front of you.

612
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,930
I've never been my true self in front of you.

613
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,500
Don't you realize that?

614
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,100
Then what's the real you like?

615
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,370
Would you even like...

616
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,690
the real me?

617
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,720
Isn't what I've been seeing the real you?

618
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,790
I'll tell you what the real me is.

619
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,120
The real me...

620
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,547
The real me is the one who claims to be into literature,

621
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:20,190
but in reality, I'm on a second-rate fiction site

622
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,890
and I'm just spouting nonsense for the rewards.

623
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:28,620
The real me is the one who says I have to rely on myself and not on my family,

624
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:35,080
but in fact, I rely on selling those bags my mom bought me just to save face.

625
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:40,840
The real me obviously wants an equal love,

626
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:46,780
but in an unequal relationship, I tread carefully,

627
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,300
and lose myself.

628
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:02,910
Do you still like this vain, weak...

629
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,520
real me?

630
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,670
Qi Qi, you're not like that.

631
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:23,730
The girl I know is sensitive, but she’s kind, brave, and longs for freedom.

632
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:30,330
You've always been Qi Qi. Dream-chasing, freedom-loving, and brave.

633
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,460
But we all have to grow up.

634
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,590
Isn't that what you said?

635
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,790
Leave now.

636
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,340
I don't want to see you right now.

637
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,840
I just want to be myself for real.

638
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:20,690
If I told you that I turned into someone I don’t even like...

639
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,290
would you still want to be with me?

640
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:53,580
♫  You are silent, tangled in lies  ♫

641
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,770
 We were never on the same page to begin with. 

642
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,100
 If I can give her a better life by working hard, 

643
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,040
 then I'm willing to work as hard as I can. 

644
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,620
 But the truth is that my pursuit of a career 

645
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:13,190
 my career goals will never match the life she's used to. 

646
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:21,070
 I thought all two people needed to be together was to be true to each other. 

647
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:27,520
 But now I realize that family, background,  

648
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,270
 social circle, all these gaps 

649
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:36,620
 can't be overcome just by love. 

650
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,060
♫  Is letting go the only choice we have?  ♫

651
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:51,580
♫  You are silent, tangled in lies  ♫

652
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:15,040

 "Yesterday’s Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

654
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:26,511
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

655
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:33,481
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

656
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:39,811
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

657
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:46,201
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

658
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:54,011
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

659
00:44:54,801 --> 00:45:00,841
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

660
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:07,421
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

661
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:14,121
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

662
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:18,081
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

663
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:23,201
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

664
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:27,921
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

665
00:45:27,921 --> 00:45:31,381
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

666
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:36,751
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

667
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:41,641
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

668
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:45,541
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

669
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:50,481
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

670
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:54,271
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

671
00:45:55,181 --> 00:45:58,711
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

672
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:02,121
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

673
00:46:02,121 --> 00:46:08,301
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

674
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:13,801
♫  At the right time  ♫
