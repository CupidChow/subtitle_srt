16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,480
(Tianhe No.1 Middle School
welcomes you!)

17
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,670
(Life in the second year
of high school seems calm.)

18
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,500
(But in reality, there are
turbulent undercurrents.)

19
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,419
(Exams and papers are like monsters
with a huge appetite,)

20
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,900
(always showing up right on time.)

21
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,420
(It swallows all the space
in your mind.)

22
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,470

23
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,190

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,500

(It feels like a descending curve,)

33
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,270
(less and less mentioned.)

34
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,900
(In the end,
no one talks about it anymore.)

35
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,270

to care about their face.)

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,340

00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,550
(to achieve your dreams.)

Chen Huan'er, can I use your computer?

39
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,150
Don't touch my computer.

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,550
What are you doing?

41
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,710
Sports University?

42
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,880
How come you're suddenly

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,120
(Undergraduate admission scores inquiry)
paying attention to the exam?

44
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,980
(of Sports University of Jing City)
Just wanted to try it.

45
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,780
You and Song

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,480
have no worries about getting
into a good university in a big city.

47
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,590
Right now,

48
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,480
I'm actually a little worried
I won't get into any school.

49
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,449
That wouldn't happen.

50
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,620
If not, you could work in the city.

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,100
Or we could support you.

52
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,500
You really think I can't support myself?

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,080
I want to get into the Sports University

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,540
because it's my dream to play soccer.

55
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
I get my goal in roundabout way, okay?

56
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,169
It would be so great
if I were like you and knew

57
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,940
what I wanted to do from a young age.

58
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,380
Then I wouldn't need to think so much.

59
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,710
It'd be much easier.

60
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,660
Otherwise, you could
just study agriculture.

61
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,100
That mysterious herb you have

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,780
seems to work well
for treating diarrhea.

63
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,840
I think you have a talent.

64
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,800
And your family has a history.
Isn't that great?

65
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,819
My family's connection is
with Traditional Chinese Medicine.

66
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,500
That's also related to pharmacy.

67
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,060
The field you're talking about
is agriculture,

68
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,310
bro.

69
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,979
Don't disturb me anymore.

70
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,430
I'm still calculating the scores.

71
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:30,929
Gosh.

72
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,500
Why are they all so high?

73
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,580
Why don't you go home and calculate?

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,060
If I could go home and calculate,

75
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,280
I wouldn't be racking my brains

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,690
in this little shabby room of yours.

77
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,560
Your house doesn't even
have a game console.

78
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,219
Later, I'll lend you my PSP.
You can have it for two days.

79
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,240
You should practice more
since you're such a noob.

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,140
And you're still thinking
about playing games?

81
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,870
Move aside.

82
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,190
Let me check.

83
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,129
Go ahead and check.

84
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,350
I've already lost all hope.

(Student Transcript, Chen Huan'er)

87
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,260
Mom.

88
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,020
Don't look at it.

89
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,580
I really didn't do well this time.

90
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm very satisfied.

91
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,060
According to your school's
first-tier status,

92
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,280
you can get into college.

93
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,870
I'm very content.

94
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,990
Mom,

95
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,249
can't you have a little
more expectation for me?

96
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,620
A little more hope?

97
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,019
I use encouragement-based education.

98
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
Do you want me
to be like Li Tian's family?

99
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,820
Be grateful for the things you have.

100
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,620
Here.

101
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,029
Mom, our teacher said

102
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,290
I'm good at biology and chemistry.

103
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,940
What about I studying pharmacy

104
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,430
in the future?

105
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,230
Think it over.

106
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,779
Mom!

107
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,100
Didn't you and Dad say
as long as I don't study medicine

108
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,180
I can study whatever I want?

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,230
Huan'er, pharmacy is
closely related to medicine.

110
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,910
Pharmacy might even be harder
than studying medicine.

111
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,489
A girl

112
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,430
should choose an easier major.

113
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,099
If this isn't okay, and that's not okay,

114
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,049
then what's the difference between me

115
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,580
and a salted fish without dreams?

116
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,779
Isn't the salted fish just fine?

117
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,940
You see, there's a whole wall
of them at home.

118
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,779
I'm full, Mom.

119
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,230
I'm going out for a walk.

120
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,670
Aren't you eating?

121
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,019
I'm a salted fish.

122
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,820
I don't deserve to eat.

123
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,020
Nothing wrong with a salted fish.

124
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,310
Li Tian?

125
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,910
What's your problem?

126
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,500
You're the problem.

127
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,910
What are you standing here for?

128
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,419
This isn't your block's hallway.

129
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,310
Why do you care?

130
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,120
Earlier, you said
if Song Cong came in second,

131
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,350
it would be like getting first.

132
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,609
So what's going on now?

133
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,020
You can't even keep second place.

134
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,460
So what do you want me to do?

135
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,899
I already tried my best,

136
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,579
okay?

137
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,680
I went to study with him

138
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,350
because I was afraid
he wouldn't learn it.

139
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,380
Don't question me
when you're raising the kid.

140
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,620
Shouldn't it be me asking you?

141
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,320
No matter what,

142
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,910
I just care about the result.

143
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,539
This hallway has poor soundproofing.

144
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,929
He's a boy.

145
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,419
I don't want to say too much.

146
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,870
But isn't it obvious enough?

147
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,899
Spending so much money,

148
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,100
going through all this effort,
and he still can't learn?

149
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,900
What's the reason?

150
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,810
It's because he's dumb.

151
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,899
If this continues,

152
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,660
he might as well transfer
to the art stream.

153
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,900
Third place is considered dumb?

154
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,500
What?

155
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,859
If you go back in,

156
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,380
you'll be digging your own grave.

157
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,060
What then?

158
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,419
No thanks.

159
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,870
I'm going back in a bit.

160
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,219
I didn't bring it specifically for you.

161
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,670
I didn't eat enough at dinner.

162
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,580
Thanks.

163
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,179
Just now,

164
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,979
my parents were having
a study discussion

165
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,219
regarding my studies.

166
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,729
My whole family are ace students.

167
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,609
It's normal to have such discussions.

168
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,699
You wouldn't get it.

169
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,310
So don't spread gossip.

170
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,460
What's there to gossip about?

171
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,550
Your family isn't the center
of the universe.

172
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,790
Besides, last time we...

173
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,670
Don't mention last time.

174
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,249
You did well enough to get third.

175
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,729
You know when I did poorly in exams,

176
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,910
I used to tell myself,

177
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,099
that the sun would still rise tomorrow.

178
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,220
I still have to get up,
eat, and go to school.

179
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,670
Life has to go on.

180
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,670
I'm not like you.

181
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,060
For me,

182
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,310
scores are my life.

183
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,720
The ranking in exams determines
whether you win or lose.

184
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,790
If I can't get first,
it's like waiting to die.

185
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Looks like I have shallow knowledge.

186
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,360
I just don't understand
the worries of top students.

187
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,409
Of course,

188
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,100
you've never even
made it to the top ten,

189
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,220
so you wouldn't know
the feeling of falling down.

190
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,390
Can I ask you a question?

191
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,310
Shoot.

192
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,299
How did you get 45 points

193
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,060
on that essay?

194
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,670
What's wrong with that?

195
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,910
How much did you score?

196
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,529
29.

197
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,670
29?

198
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,099
Did you go off-topic?

199
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,550
I didn't go off-topic.

200
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,889
My dream is

201
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,150
"a happy life in the midst
of ordinariness."

202
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,940
That's not off-topic?

203
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,430
Was it?

204
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,940
So, what was your essay topic?

205
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,529
"Keep your feet on the ground,

206
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,769
look up at the stars,

207
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,460
and do your best to make
the world a better place."

208
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,580
Is that really your dream?

209
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,580
Didn't I say this long ago?

210
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,820
My goal is to go abroad
for a "gold-plated" degree,

211
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,930
and follow the elite path
to become a winner in life.

212
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,310
I'm not talking about
predicting exam questions.

213
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,699
I'm asking,

214
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,390
do you really think this way?

215
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,980
As long as the score is high,
that's all that matters.

216
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,460
Besides, why should I tell you?

217
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,790
I'm heading home now.

218
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,980
Song Cong,

219
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,190
come here for a moment.

220
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,760
What is it?

221
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,220
I got this from a colleague.

222
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,099
Their kid used it

223
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,700
to prepare for last year's Gaokao.

224
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,099
Since you're staying in the country,

225
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,579
you'll definitely be aiming
for either Yenching or Huaqing.

226
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,339
Both schools have excellent

227
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,409
economics programs.

228
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,459
Which independent admission

229
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,910
do you want to prepare for?

230
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,889
Of course, you'll get in anyway.

231
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,489
But...

232
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,220
Mom.

233
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,310
I'm only in Year 2.

234
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,699
Isn't it a bit too early?

235
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,000
The Independent Admission Exams

236
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,400
for these schools are different.

237
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,699
You need to prepare in advance.

238
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,670
It'd be too late if you do it later.

239
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,860
Oh no.

240
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,820
What is it?

241
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,970
I suddenly remembered

242
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,310
Xichi asking to meet up.

243
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,310
I better get going.

244
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,649
It's late. What could be so important?

245
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,030
I almost forgot.

246
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,550
This is more important.

247
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,009
Get home soon.

248
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,979
Yeah, will do.

249
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,740
Okay.

250
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,390
Bu, pass the ball!

251
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,460
Yeah.

252
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,940
Jing Xichi.

253
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,940
How come you two came together?

254
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,459
What's up

255
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,510
with you two?

256
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,220
- Taking a breath.
- Releasing stress.

257
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,060
Good timing.

258
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,820
I have something to announce.

259
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,009
I'm going to represent our school

260
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,409
in the inter-high school soccer league.

261
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,819
That's awesome.

262
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,600
It's your chance
to make the school proud.

263
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,700
Of course.

264
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,489
I heard the coach
from Sport University will be there.

265
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,489
Congrats!

266
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,220
You're one step closer to your dream.

267
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,460
We'll see.

268
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,580
Pass the ball!

269
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,060
(I'm sure Song Cong is like me.)

270
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,729
(Sometimes,)

271
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,790
(I am so envious of Jing Xichi.)

272
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,489
(He's always able
to talk about his dream)

273
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,100
(so easily.)

274
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,310
(To him,)

275
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,270
(his dream is never blurry,)

276
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,910
(never a burden,)

277
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,030
(nor out of reach.)

278
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,740
(As long as you want to do it,)

279
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,940
(it can be accomplished.)

280
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,150
Everyone,

281
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,630
it's okay if the experiment fails.

282
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,649
The important things

283
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,740
are that we have to remember

284
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,060
the steps and test points.

285
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,529
Knowing what to write during the exam

286
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,790
is key.

287
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,339
To observe the Tyndall effect

288
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,979
more clearly,

289
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,030
first of all,

290
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,219
we need to produce

291
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,940
a colloidal substance
that meets the requirements.

292
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,729
Jing Xichi!

293
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,430
Anymore mischief
and you're out of here!

294
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,409
During the experiment,

295
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,859
we need to carefully observe

296
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,889
the state of different liquids

297
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,980
after mixing.

298
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,910
We should conduct the experiment
while taking notes.

299
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,609
As you work on the experiment,

300
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,009
I want to emphasize...

301
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,059
This is pretty cool.

302
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,630
Another important test point.

303
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,459
Magic...

304
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,889
The magnitude of the Tyndall effect

305
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,270
is influenced by several factors,

306
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,550
including

307
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,459
the intermolecular forces
between the solute and the solvent.

308
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,430
Jing Xichi!

309
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,609
As well as

310
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,430
the molar ratio of solute to solvent.

311
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,939
The stronger the interaction

312
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,030
between the solute and the solvent,

313
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,339
the Tyndall effect we observe

314
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,889
will be more pronounced

315
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,609
after we complete the experiment.

316
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,299
When the number
of molecules is the same,

317
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,699
the lower the molar ratio of the solute,

318
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,009
the weaker

319
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,579
the Tyndall effect we observe

320
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,769
after the experiment.

321
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,529
Therefore,

322
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,670
when conducting the experiment,

323
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,430
pay close attention

324
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,910
to the molar ratio
between the solute and the solvent.

325
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,219
This is the key

326
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,219
to achieving the desired
experimental results.

327
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,220
Sorry about that.

328
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,179
Jing Xichi!

329
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,630
Get out!

330
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,460
Are you okay?

331
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
I'm fine.

332
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,030
Wow, impressive, Chen Huan'er!

333
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,670
But still not as good

334
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,820
as mine just now.

335
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,030
This student did a great job.

336
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,129
Thank you, sir.

337
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,100
Thank you, sir.

338
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,190
Huan'er, how did you do it?

339
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,980
It's actually not that hard.

340
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,219
Just add a sufficient
amount of solution,

341
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,099
and when the water
reaches boiling point,

342
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,390
you get the result.

343
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,980
Chen Huan'er, here.

344
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,680
(Chemistry Competition Registration Form)
Mr. Zhang, your chemistry teacher, nominated you.

345
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,859
I agree your results in chemistry
are pretty good.

346
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,980
You should go for it.

347
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,129
Since the study term

348
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,100
isn't that packed right now,

349
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,219
you should try out more prominent

350
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,740
competitions like these.

351
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,889
Who knows

352
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,739
one of them would come in clutch

353
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,020
in your Gaokao?

354
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,929
Don't feel overly pressured.

355
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,940
Just go and check out the scope.

356
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,300
I don't feel pressured.

357
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,929
I just thought

358
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,739
that previously

359
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,739
only top students like Song Cong
could take part.

360
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,020
I didn't expect

361
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,260
I'd have the opportunity too.

362
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,059
Jing Xichi,

363
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,110
this is your application.

364
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,019
The chemistry teacher told me.

365
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,150
Although Jing Xichi

366
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,689
is a troublemaker

367
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,070
in class,

368
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,780
the boy has good execution skills.

369
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,059
So he should take part
in the competition.

370
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,390
Don't waste the boy's creative mind

371
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,460
or his talent.

372
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,740
Mr. Xu.

373
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,590
I know my mistake. Say no more.

374
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,300
You actually admitted you're wrong?

375
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,059
Yes.

376
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,969
Jing Xichi,

377
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,169
let me say this again.

378
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,019
If you dare act naughty

379
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,150
during chemistry again,

380
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,500
I'll get your mom to take you away.

381
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,500
Mr. Xu.

382
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,390
You may go.

383
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,490
You can have this back, sir.

384
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,240
Thank you, sir.

385
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,800
You keep it.

386
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,190
No, don't waste it.

387
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,409
Yes, Li Tian.

388
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,460
This is my application.

389
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,870
I thought you were going to apply

390
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,460
for the English speech competition.

391
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,390
How come you switched?

392
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,339
I think

393
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm better suited
for the Math competition.

394
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,590
Thanks, sir.

395
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,499
Can you wait for a bit?

396
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,059
I'm hungry.

397
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,100
Why can't I start eating?

398
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,920
Huan'er isn't here.

399
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,369
I can still eat when she comes.
We can start eating first.

400
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,240
Are you that hungry?

401
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,150
I'm coming.

402
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,499
Here comes the eggplant.

403
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,299
Let me try it.

404
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,020
Yum.

405
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,980
Isn't it delicious?

406
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,700
Huan'er.

407
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,900
Last night, I overheard

408
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,120
my mom and her friends talking.

409
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,460
They said
that English competition

410
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,940
is useless for independent admissions.

411
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,700
That's why Mrs. Li
didn't let him sign up.

412
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,220
No wonder.

413
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,969
Today, Mr. Xu even asked Li Tian

414
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,819
why he changed his registration form.

415
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,670
That guy has loved English
since he was little.

416
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,140
He signed up for an elementary school
English speech contest.

417
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,960
But for some reason,
he didn't go in the end.

418
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,579
Probably,

419
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,920
he got shut down by Dr. Li again.

420
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,880
Not "probably."

421
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,070
Definitely.

422
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,129
Last night,

423
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,040
there was another argument
upstairs about this.

424
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,609
I looked it up.

425
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,060
The two competitions are happening
at the exact same time.

426
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,700
So what then?

427
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,889
Come on.

428
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,579
We have to find a way to help him.

429
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,300
Why do you even care
what he signs up for?

430
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,019
Jing Xichi, have you forgotten?

431
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,859
He helped us

432
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,299
steal fireworks during New Year's.

433
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,110
And now you're turning your back on him?

434
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,300
You're acting like a total jerk.

435
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,870
What are you laughing at?

436
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,779
You're the one who lit the fireworks.

437
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,980
Don't act all innocent.
That makes you a bigger jerk.

438
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,150
Jerk!

439
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,929
Just focus on the match.

440
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:46,929
Yeah, don't worry.

441
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,780
We'll handle it.

442
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,190
The eggplant is too salty.

443
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,739
Don't eat if it's bad.

444
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,409
Leave it.

445
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,649
Here, Song. You eat.

446
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,590
Let me try it.

447
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,209
Tian.

448
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,169
Have you got everything ready?

449
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,369
Yes.

450
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,220
Okay.

451
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,540
Coming.

452
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,630
Who is it?

453
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,670
Hello.

454
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,190
Why are you guys here?

455
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,350
Who is it?

456
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,099
Mrs. Li.

457
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,209
It's you guys.

458
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,779
Mrs. Li,

459
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,579
we're here

460
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,980
to get Li Tian for the competition.

461
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,830
Xichi.

462
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,670
What competition
are you participating in?

463
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,129
He's going there
to cheer for us, Mrs. Li.

464
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,779
I'm taking part in the Math competition.

465
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,260
Li Tian and I are
in the same place.

466
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,780
That's right.

467
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,739
Oh, I see.

468
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,220
We'll get going then, Mrs. Li.

469
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,220
No need to send us off.

470
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,520
We'll see ourselves out, Mrs. Li.

471
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,090
Bye, Mrs. Li.

472
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,110
Okay.

473
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,099
Hurry up and go.

474
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,579
Easy, now.

475
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,019
Move it.

476
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,080
What are you trying to do?

477
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,770
You tell me!

478
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,650
Are you kidnapping me?

479
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,500
You two can't do this!

480
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,390
Let me go!

481
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,540
Let go!

482
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,819
Oh, I know.

483
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,779
You two must be afraid

484
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,220
I'd get a ranking in the competition

485
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,000
and I'd beat you two

486
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,280
with extra points in the Gaokao.

487
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,369
So it was all an act of wanting

488
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,670
to mend our friendship.

489
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,969
Stop trying to sabotage me!

490
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,449
Li Tian, are you crazy or what?

491
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,209
You need to stop making up stories.

492
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,220
Li Tian.

493
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,390
Here.

494
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,259
I got this pass from Mr. Xu for you.

495
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,060
Whether you wish to participate
in the Math

496
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,120
or English competition

497
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,020
is up to you.

(English Speech Contest Entry Pass)

499
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,430
It's the real deal.

500
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,150
Now you're happy?

501
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,150
Hang on.

502
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,929
You two must be up to something.

503
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,299
Just shut it and get moving!

504
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,460
Let's be clear.

505
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,859
You two forced me to go.

506
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,220
I didn't go willingly.

507
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,910
Do it.

508
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:33,969
Hurry up!

509
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,390
You don't want to be late.

510
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,110

(7th "Tianhe Elegance Cup")
The world becomes more colorful and warm.

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,299
(English Speech Competition)
Everyone is good to you,

513
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,409
and the world is full of love.

514
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,129
That's all.

515
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,870
Thank you for listening.

516
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,780
Little Four-Eye...

517
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,299
He was all nervous just now,

518
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,980
and now he's up there on his own.

519
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,700
Oh no.

520
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,670
We might've acted too recklessly.

521
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,400
Go get him back.

522
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,430
He isn't prepared!

523
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,579
Relax.

524
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,680
He doesn't need to prepare.

525
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,010
Ladies and gentlemen,

526
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,059
good afternoon.

527
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,150
I am honored to be here today.

528
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,870
The topic of my speech

529
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,390
is "My Dream."

530
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,209
My dream

531
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,889
is to create a world where people

532
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,740
are not forced to speak English.

533
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,940
Wow,

534
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Little Four-Eye
is actually pretty cool.

535
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,260
He's speaking really well.

536
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,350
Oh? You understood?

537
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,540
Of course!

538
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,220
Then what was he saying?

539
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,910
Wait...

540
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,590
You didn't understand?

541
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,830
Thank you.

542
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,430
Thank you.

543
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,880
What did he just say?

544
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,449
What was it?

545
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,140
What did you say?

546
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,300
I said thank you.

547
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,460
You're welcome.

548
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,490
While listening to your speech,

549
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,920
I was reminded of the competition

550
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,110
back in elementary school.

551
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,649
I still remember the topic

552
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,819
to this day.

553
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,739
They wanted us

554
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,590
to write about our favorite thing.

555
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,129
You wrote about

556
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,830
watching cartoons with us.

557
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,110
That's why I ended up not going.

558
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,980
I saw what other people wrote

559
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,910
and thought my story was too childish.

560
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,019
So it's childish
watching cartoons with us,

561
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,320
but it's not childish
doing an impromptu speech today?

562
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,590
It was made clear.

563
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,969
Talk about your favorite thing, right?

564
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,460
You just had to like it.

565
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,940
Did you grow taller?

566
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,390
Keep your hands to yourself.

567
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,850
What was your speech about just now?

568
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,500
I thought you understood.

569
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,689
Yes, I understood.

570
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,609
I wanted to check

571
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,630
if he used proper language.

572
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,460
Are you feeling better?

573
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,870
Much better.

574
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,670
Thanks for today.

575
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:57,859
No worries.

576
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,900
(Convenience Store)

577
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,369
If not for you,

578
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,540
I might not have been able
to sit for the test.

579
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,590
It's nothing.

580
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,689
Come, quick.

581
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,980
Are you buying something?

582
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,299
You're eating all these?

583
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,150
Daughter.

584
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,910
It's you.

585
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,169
Are you two classmates?

586
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,539
We're deskmates.

587
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,820
Deskmates? What a coincidence.

588
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,300
Here, take some more.

589
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,259
Hello, sir.

590
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,420
Dad, can you get me a bag?

591
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:25,830
Okay.

592
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,670
That's your father?

593
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,409
Do you remember?

594
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,680
When you first got transferred,

595
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,360
I told you

596
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,400
that I met you before.

597
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,700
How much?

598
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,300
Ten yuan.

599
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,540
It was right here.

600
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,220
Is that so?

601
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,609
Here.

602
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,020
Put the things inside.

603
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,859
Sir, I can't eat all of these.

604
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,649
It's fine.

605
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,540
Take it.

606
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,730
I should pay for these.

607
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,910
No need.

608
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,830
Just take it.

609
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,910
Thank you.

610
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,590
I'm off.

611
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,689
Jing Xichi, what is going on?

612
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,070
Li Tian is competing today...

613
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,129
Li Tian?

614
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,350
How did the test go?

615
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,260
She obviously didn't do well.

616
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,129
That's no way to speak to Miss Chen.

617
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,830
What happened today was her idea.

618
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,740
Come on, bro.

619
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:24,830
Come.

620
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,630
Sit down, please.

621
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,940
Enough with the act, Jing Xichi.

622
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,969
It's English. Good, good!

623
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,760
Go on and talk in English
the whole day then.

624
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,980
Sure, I can.

625
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,590
Look, TV.

626
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,110
I like Television.

627
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,190
Bro, cheers.

628
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,430
Where's mine?

629
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,350
Sorry.

630
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,220
I don't know you come...

631
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,300
So you forgot?

632
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,019
Yes.

633
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,859
Okay.

634
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,500
But, there's water in the kitchen.

635
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,330
(Tianhe No.1 Middle School
welcomes you!)

636
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,780
This time, only Du Man from our class

637
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,910
made it to the finals.

638
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,609
If only Song Cong had participated.

639
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah, Song Cong definitely would
have made it if he had gone.

640
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,129
A bit of a shame.

641
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,020
Yeah...

642
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,940
Morning.

643
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,499
Li Tian, congratulations!

644
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,660
You won first place
in the English speech competition.

645
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,670
Congrats, Li Tian!

646
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,190
You are welcome.

647
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,770
(7th "Tianhe Elegance Cup")

648
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:38,180
(English Speech Competition.
First Prize: Li Tian)

649
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,259
What's the point
of bringing this back to me?

650
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,780
It's not even useful as a paperweight.

651
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,880
Does it give extra points
for independent admissions?

652
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,090
At the very least, my English is great.

653
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,460
When I go abroad in the future,

654
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,660
I want to study English.

655
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,320
You're getting more ridiculous
by the day.

656
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,200
Am I sending you abroad
to study English?

657
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,620
Does that even need to be studied?

658
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,400
Of course, it does!

659
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,200
In English studies,

660
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,660
there's also English Literature major.

661
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,129
The world is a global village now.
English is just a tool.

662
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,259
Everyone can say at least
a few words in English.

663
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,430
What a lack of ambition!

664
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,969
This is my life.

665
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,929
I have the right to choose my major.

666
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,299
It's none of your business.

667
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,350
What did you say?

668
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,190
Say that to me again if you dare!

669
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,540
What did he mean?

670
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,169
Aren't you good at English?

671
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,630
Why are you asking me?

672
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,169
He spoke too fast.

673
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,614
I didn't catch it.

674
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,299
(Mastership lies in
excellence and honesty)

675
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,150
Have water.

676
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,190
Come, try this.

677
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,350
It's really sweet.

678
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,220
Yeah, it is.

679
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,740
Then eat more.

680
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,300
That's enough.

681
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,590
Actually,

682
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,220
taking part

683
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,739
in competitions

684
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,540
is all about participation.

685
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,220
Winning or not doesn't really matter.

686
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,260
Mom, what are you talking about?

687
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,369
Listen up.

688
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,129
I'm very likely to win an award
in this competition.

689
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,099
I've made up my mind.

690
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,449
I want to study pharmacy.

691
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,220
I'll still do it
even if it's exhausting.

692
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,700
What nonsense are you talking about?

693
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,500
What's wrong?

694
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,910
It's nothing.

695
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,190
I just have a bit of a stomachache.

696
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,670
Every time my period comes,
my stomach hurts.

697
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,260
What medicine did you take? Let me see.

698
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,100
(Acetaminophen Tablets,
Black-Boned Chicken Bai Feng Pills)

699
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,910
These two medicines
shouldn't be taken together!

700
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,299
I had no idea until I checked,

701
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,830
but once I saw it, I was shocked.

702
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,299
The TCM she usually takes

703
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,299
and the painkiller

704
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,019
can't be taken at the same time.

705
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,520
Taking them can irritate the stomach.

706
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,250
I don't know if her menstrual cramps

707
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,209
are caused by poor blood circulation.

708
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,700
So, she really shouldn't be
taking medicine randomly.

709
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,260
I mean, seriously.
What would she do

710
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,630
without me?

711
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,870
You did an amazing job
this time, Huan'er.

712
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,190
I, Qian Lina, raised a great daughter!

713
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,339
I totally understand

714
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,830
the sense of fulfillment you get
from helping others.

715
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,859
But listen, pharmacy

716
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,110
isn't as simple as you think.

717
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,150
We'll see about that.

718
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,780
Alright.

719
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,339
You really are my child.

720
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,620
You acted just like me when I was young.
Wait right here.

721
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,910
Here you go.

722
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,440
You want to study pharmacy, right?

723
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,580
(Compendium of Materia Medica)
First, read through this book.

724
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,380
Then decide whether or not
you want to study pharmacy.

725
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,160
Mom!

726
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,819
This is TCM.

727
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,609
I want to study Western medicine.

728
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,019
You need to first understand

729
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,700
the stuff our ancestors left behind.

730
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,350
Then we can talk about Western medicine.

731
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,680
(The day after tomorrow,)

732
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,840
(I will have a death match
versus the soccer academy.)

733
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,780
(Wait for my good news.)

734
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
(All the best.)

735
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,260
(Looking back,)

736
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,129
(compared to other people,)

737
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,259
(I wondered)

738
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,929
(if this little goal of mine)

739
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,500
(passes as a dream.)

740
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,420
(Teaching material, key points)

741
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,500
(Surgery)

742
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,020
Jing Xichi.

743
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,499
I'm fine, Mom.

744
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,070
I dropped the ball.

745
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,059
(Nevertheless, it's given me)

746
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,350
(unprecedented peace of mind
and satisfaction.)

747
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,260
Headed to school?

748
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,150
Watching soccer, Dad?

749
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,430
Barcelona.

750
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,350
Dad,

751
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,460
these are the tickets for today's match.

752
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,830
For your mom and me?

753
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,780
Are you trying to get me in trouble?

754
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,430
You asked me to keep this from her,

755
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,339
and now you're exposing everything.

756
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,300
Dad,

757
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,590
I have to go to this match.

758
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,689
The youth team coach will be there.

759
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,449
Basically,

760
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,110
he's coming to scout me.

761
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,579
If I perform well,

762
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,460
he might let me join the youth team.

763
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,859
And if I get in,

764
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,700
it'll be a huge help for my development.

765
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,980
Plus, Dad, think about it.

766
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,110
If I play really well

767
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,689
and the coach likes me,

768
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,240
he might put in a few good words for me.

769
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,680
That could make all the difference!

770
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,780
I'll see what I can do.

771
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,390
No matter if your mom goes or not,

772
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,910
just do your best.

773
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,739
Good luck, son.

774
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,910
I'll leave the tickets here.

775
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,940
Got to go.

776
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,540
(Preliminary Match Entry Ticket)

777
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,670
I wonder how Xichi's game is going...

778
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,140
Jing Xichi from your class got injured.

779
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,600
Hurry, come with me to the infirmary!

780
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,739
No way. He got hurt?

781
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,910
Jing Xichi is injured?

782
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,020
What do we do?

783
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,510
How is he?

784
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,300
What happened?

785
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:16,339
Two players collided.

786
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,569
He got pinned underneath.

787
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,740
He seemed fine when he got up,

788
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,450
but after a few steps,
he suddenly collapsed.

789
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,380
He can't even stand now.

790
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,020
He needs to get to the hospital ASAP.

791
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,219
Go to the entrance
and flag down a taxi for us!

792
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,049
Got it.

793
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,760
Huan'er, help us get a leave of absence

794
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,580
and take our bags.

795
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,220
What happened?

796
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,420
I'll take you to the hospital.
Quick, quick.

797
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,360
Put him on my back!

798
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:34,990
Come on.

799
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,900
Here.

800
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,040
- Slowly does it.
- Slowly.

801
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,260
- Slowly does it.
- Careful.

802
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,260
Okay.

803
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,659
Okay.

804
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,259
Let's go.

805
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,030
Go on.

806
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:42,449
Go.

807
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,260
Go.

808
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,819
Where is he?

809
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,900
What's the diagnosis?

810
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,260
A hamstring injury.

811
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,049
It's pretty bad.

812
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:03,950
Is it that way?

813
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,219
Huan'er,

814
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,259
sit, sit down.

815
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,009
Calm down.

816
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,900
Take a seat.

817
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,360
Mr. and Mrs. Jing are inside.

818
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,340
Let's wait here.

819
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,150
Will he... need surgery?

820
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,420
My dad recommended
conservative treatment.

821
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,340
How long will it take to recover?

822
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,700
The recovery period will take at least

823
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,030
a few months.

824
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,740
Mr. and Mrs. Jing...

825
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,990
You guys need not worry.

826
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,380
We should have confidence
in the patient at this time.

827
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,110
Mrs. Jing,

828
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,510
why are you the one comforting me?

829
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,590
Occupational disease, I guess.

830
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,590
Song Cong.

831
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,190
Huan'er.

832
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,420
Xichi wouldn't tell us anything.

833
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,070
You're his close friends.

834
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,740
Please talk to him for us.

835
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,150
We will.

836
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,420
Don't worry.

837
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,699
Okay, it's getting late.

838
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,859
We'll be here.

839
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,969
You guys can go home.

840
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,510
You still have classes tomorrow.

841
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,260
Then...

842
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,470
Then we'll leave first.

843
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,640
(Preliminary Match Entry Ticket)
Our boy asked me to give this to you.

844
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,969
He said you might change your mind

845
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,420
if you watched him play.

846
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,070
I didn't give it to you.

847
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,739
I reckon he went too hard

848
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,900
and got injured.

849
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,070
Anyway, back to the main point.

850
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,740
What's so wrong

851
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,590
about playing soccer?

852
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,190
Jing.

853
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,510
Don't you put up a front with me.

854
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,739
Didn't we agree

855
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,300
to stand on the same page?

856
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,860
You said he's in a rebellious phase.

857
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,080
We should give him some room.

858
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,030
I'll be the bad cop,
and you're the good cop.

859
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,859
Sooner or later he will not
be able to handle it and give it up.

860
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,569
Now what?

861
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,299
You blame everything on me.
I'm responsible

862
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,510
while you get a pass.

863
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,779
I knew it.

864
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,489
When you were being the good cop,

865
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,550
you... you had a different idea.

866
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,670
Now you're going overboard.

867
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,260
All I wanted was the best for our son.

868
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,730
What's wrong with playing soccer?

869
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,400
You wanted the best for him?
In what way?

870
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,730
Is being bedridden

871
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,900
the best for him?

872
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,969
To be frank,

873
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,300
I was giving you respect.

874
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,089
I know you weren't able

875
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,659
to be a professional soccer player.

876
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,779
That's why you forced

877
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,950
your dream upon your son.

878
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,819
I failed to go professional

879
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,929
because your family thought

880
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,740
there was no future in it.

881
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,110
To put it bluntly,

882
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,190
you despise soccer.

883
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,220
Jing Liqiang.

884
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,030
Where is your conscience?

885
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,969
I despise it?

886
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,960
If I despised it,
I wouldn't have married you!

887
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,969
Fine, whatever.

888
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,470
We'll never be on the same page!

889
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,510
You're back, Huan'er?

890
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,220
Mom.

891
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,070
Tell me the truth

892
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,990
about Jing Xichi's condition.

893
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,070
Hard to say.

894
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,820
Song Cong's dad said it's common.

895
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,380
What does "common" mean?

896
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,859
It is common

897
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,780
when it comes to athletes like him

898
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,659
who push their bodies to the limit.

899
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,049
Look, he has a hamstring injury.

900
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,339
He should recover swiftly,

901
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,190
but there's a higher chance
of future injuries.

902
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,049
It's hard to say

903
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,680
if he could go back
to how he was before.

904
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,659
That's why you should
care about your health.

905
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,529
It's the foundation of all foundations.

906
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,700
Even if one tiny part
of your body gives up,

907
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,820
there's no use talking about
whatever dream

908
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,780
you might have.

909
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,260
That...

910
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,340
That sounds pretty serious.

911
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,630
It's up to his recovery.

912
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,070
Maybe he'll recover well. Right?

913
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,700
Okay, it's late.

914
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,880
You should go to bed.

915
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,150
You have classes tomorrow.

916
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,619
(He has a hamstring injury.)

917
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,969
(He should recover swiftly,)

918
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,100
(but there's a higher chance
for future injuries.)

919
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,569
(It's hard to say)

920
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,540
(if he could go back
to how he was before.)

921
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,380
(What about you?)

922
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,300
Do you want to play soccer?

923
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,220
I guess.

924
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,820
You really think I can't support myself?

925
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,400
I want to get into Sports University

926
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,860
because it's my dream to play soccer.

927
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,700
I get my goal in roundabout way.

928
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,619
I'm going to represent our school

929
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,659
in the inter-high school soccer league.

930
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,009
That's awesome.

931
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,780
It's your chance
to make the school proud.

932
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,950
Of course.

933
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,070
(Are you alright?)

934
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,809
(Are you alright?)

935
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,929
(Send to Piggy Jing)

936
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,369
(Send a message to Piggy Jing)

937
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:19,980
(Sending)

938
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,529
(There's no way for me to know)

939
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,070
(how it feels when a soccer fanatic)

940
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,340
(injured his leg.)

941
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,820
(Mom's words keep circling in my head.)

942
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,300
(Dreams seem brilliant)

943
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,470
(but are actually so fragile.)

944
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,550
(When a tiny part
in your body breaks down,)

945
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,510
(it could mark the end of a dream.)

946
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,260
(No matter how hard you try,)

947
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,030
(how persistent you are,)

948
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,740
(and how much passion you have,)

949
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,780
(it is all futile.)

950
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,380
(Are you alright?)
