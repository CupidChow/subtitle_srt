Du Wei,

17
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,750
here's the schedule

18
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,420
for tonight.

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
Alright, let me take a look.

20
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,750
Hey.

21
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,110
The skit might be

22
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,340
delayed a little.

23
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,750
Alright.

24
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,020
This spot

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,070
should be fine.

26
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,440
Try to maintain it for now.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,020
Du Wei,

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,380
does this outfit look good on him?

29
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,790
You should button up your blazer.

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,220
I can do it myself.

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,840
Everyone has been
working hard these days.

32
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,510

37

Great.

Don't be nervous.

(First Event)
You can't find the place?

44
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,780
Okay, I can come and fetch you.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,510
Where are you?

46
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,260
Have some water.

47
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,510
Thanks, senior.

The event is about to start,

49
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,740
and only two people are here.

50
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,620
Maybe it's too far

51
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,560
that they don't want to come.

52
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:19,740
Huan'er,

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,270
look!

54
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,420
(Du Wei: Surprises
are always unexpected.)

55
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,020
Are they

56
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,270
declaring their relationship officially?

57
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,270

member No.1 is here to report!

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,190
Are you surprised? Is this unexpected?

61

Coach Chen.

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,580
Hello.

63
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,270
Coach Chen,

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,270
you should protect

65
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,300
our dignity as men later.

66
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,820
Why are you just standing there?

67
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,640
Are we not welcome?

68
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,900
Welcome, come on in!

00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,840
Please come in.

Great!

77
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,030
When facing sexual harassment,

78
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,550
many women

79
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,500
are taught to self-reflect.

80
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,470
Was I being too flirty?

81
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,260
Was my outfit too revealing?

82
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,300
Did I release

83
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,470
the wrong signals?

84
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,620
The purpose

85
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,620
of this event

86
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,550
is not to promote

87
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,860
violence as a solution,

88
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,110
but

89
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,380
to teach some

90
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,110
basic self-defense techniques,

91
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,260
so that when facing danger,

92
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,260
we have

93
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,620
the ability to protect ourselves.

94
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,260

Women's self-defense

96
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,760
is all about practicality.

97
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,990
There are no fixed moves,

98
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,900
no specific environments
or timing required.

99
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,420
Everything is aimed at escape

100
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,420
as the ultimate goal.

101
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,710
Now,

102
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,230
we need a male volunteer

103
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,500
to help demonstrate with me.

104
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,740
Then...

105
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,940
I'll do it.

106
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,420

Please stand here.

110
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,910
Alright.

111
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,300
In most cases,

112
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,620
women will face

113
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,470
much stronger attackers.

114
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,940
When we are grabbed...

115
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,420
Come on, Zhou Ye. Grab me.

116
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,820
Alright.

117
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,760
We must take advantage of the moment

118
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,860
and let him...

119
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,260
Well done!

00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,880

121
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,910
Did everyone see that clearly?

122
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,860
Yes.

123
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,180
Now, we will pair up

124
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,030
and practice.

125
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,470
Okay.

126
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,360

We're just observing.

129
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,550
You can proceed learning it.

Don't leave.

132
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,500
That was awkward.

Zhou Ye,

134
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,350
your acting was too fake.

135
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,710
You scared them all off.

136
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,300
You...

137
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,060
You guys

138
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,990
arrange this?

139
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,420
No, no.

140
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,080
Not at all.

141
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,300
Don't be discouraged!

142
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,420
Let's practice on our own.

143
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,500
I want to learn that move.

144
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,790
Learn?

145
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,710
Huan'er trained so hard,

146
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,820
but not to teach you!

147
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,860
Still want to learn?

148
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,640
The move was designed to defend against
you, and you want to learn it?

149
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,790
Huan'er,

150
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,300
don't give up.

151
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,860
We did our best.

152
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,710
It's fine, Huan'er.

153
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,180
It's fine.

No, I can't do it anymore.

No, no, no.

194
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,700
I'll do it then.

what can you do?

Tian Chi,

203
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,880
please hold me from behind.

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,500
Uh...

205
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,020
This is not appropriate.

206
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,620
It's fine.

207
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,160

Tian Chi,

219
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,470
this demonstration is too risky.

220
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Let me do it instead.

221
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,660
No need to trouble you.

222
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,580

Didn't we agree that I'd be
your personal punching bag?

Nothing.

312
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,830

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,470
Jing Xichi feels a little different.

315

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,950
are always temporary.

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,110
Even if at some point,

320
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,280
you were close enough

321
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,580
to share the same pair of pants.

322
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,740
One day,

323
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,590
they'll just become

324
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,350
a listed name in your contact.

325
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,230
Back in high school,

326
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,860
someone told me

327
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,710
the same thing.

328
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,190
I didn't believe it then.

329
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,740
Now you do?

330
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,310
Not entirely.

331
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,500
We'll grow up, after all.

332
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,350
Different majors,

333
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,540
and different social circles,

334
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,950
so there are fewer

335
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,140
common topics.

336
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,740
Don't believe me?

337
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,710
Think about it,

338
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,190
do you still keep in touch

339
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,950
with your primary

340
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,460
or secondary school classmates?

341
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,660
Not really.

342
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,470
See.

343
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,830
That's just reality.

344
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,780
But, it's not a bad thing.

345
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,990
Some people leave,

346
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,260
but new ones

347
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,430
will slowly become

348
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,500
part of your life.

349
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,020
For instance,

350
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,190
you encounter me now,

351
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,230
Huan'er.

352
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,260
So...

353
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,990
Is there something
between you and Tian Chi?

354
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,780
Tian Chi doesn't

355
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,470
like me that way.

356
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,110
Come on.

357
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,480
He went all out helping

358
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,780
with the event of the
Women's Self-Defense Activity Club.

359
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,430
And you say he doesn't like you?

360
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,070
He just thinks

361
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,710
that the event is meaningful.

362
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,070
You're so oblivious,

363
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,140
Chen Huan'er.

364
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,190
Look,

365
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,590
Tian Chi

366
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,590
is gentle and considerate.

367
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
He's also handsome,

368
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,980
and academically outstanding.

369
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,900
But, you really have

370
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,190
no affection for him?

371
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,230
I know he is nice,

372
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,110
but...

373
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,260
No buts!

374
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,020
See,

375
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,380
you think he is nice too.

376
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,310
So, why

377
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,350
not give it a try?

378
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,260
Love

379
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,310
is all about practicing love.

380
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,860
Who knows, maybe you'll develop
feelings for him over time.

381
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,500
Huan'er,

382
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,740
don't just spend your days studying

383
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,780
or going on duty
in the sports department.

384
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,260
Go out and explore more!

385
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,830

386
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,990
have you been a class monitor

387
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,430
in your high school years?

388
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,540
What do you mean?

389
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,070
Nothing.

390
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,580
Your phone is ringing.

391
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,070
(Do you have class tomorrow night?)

392
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,260
See, what did I say?

393
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,470
He really likes you.

394
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,720
It's happening.

395
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,430
Love is happening!

396
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,500
What an amazing university life!

397
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,950
I love my university life!

398
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,230
This is so familiar.

399
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,830
Respected leaders,

400
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,620
teachers,

401
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,660
(2010 Wuan University Welcome Party)
and dear students.

402
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,710
Good evening.

403
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,470
It's another autumn.

404
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,990
Autumn brings cool weather.

405
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,540
The golden season of October

406
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,660
is a good time to sow the hope...

407
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,260
Sorry, everyone.

408
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,620
I'd like to take

409
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,540
a minute of your time

410
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,780
to make a brief advertisement.

411
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,710
The Women's Self-Defense Activity Club

412
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,230
hosted by the Sports Department

413
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,470
held its

414
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
first event today.

415
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,140
The location

416
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,300
was on the second
floor of Zhishan Building.

417
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,940
(Welcome Party)
The preparation isn't easy.

418
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,950
So if anyone is interested

419
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,540
and has time,

420
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,540
please go and check it out.
It's really worth it!

421
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,150
Alright, let's continue.

422
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,100
In this festive

423
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,910
October,

424
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,710
we gather here

425
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,220
to welcome our new students.

426
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,230
Now, we'll start
the 2010 Wuan University

427
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,720
(2010 Wuan University Welcome Party)
Welcome Party.

428
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
Let's enjoy the first performance,

429
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,820
"The Embark of Youth".

430
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,540
Thank you.

431
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,540
Du Wei,

432
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,950
sorry

433
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,870
about today.

434
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,540
If the school wants
to hold someone accountable,

435
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,820
I'll take full responsibility.

436
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,460
Regarding this matter,

437
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,120
I've already explained it to the school.

438
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,100
The student council

439
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,630
won't pursue it any further.

440
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,910
So,

441
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,910
why did you call me here?

442
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,580
Have you heard before

443
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,950
the piece I just played?

444
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,340
I haven't.

445
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,150
This piece

446
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,710
was composed by Liszt,

447
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,390
based on a poem by a German poet.

448
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,230
There are two lines in it

449
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,260
that I particularly like.

450
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,820
The poem says:

451
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,430
"There was no bad intention,

452
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,910
yet tears were shed upon parting."

453
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Perhaps love is just

454
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,820
like a dream.

455
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,300
If you don't grasp it,

456
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,580
it will just fade away in a moment.

457
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,390
Is that so?

458
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,780
I guess

459
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,340
I didn't quite catch that.

460
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,020
Then...

461
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,710
Did you understand

462
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,950
what I meant?

463
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,540
I did.

464
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,390
Liszt's composition, right?

465
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,640
It sounds wonderful.

466
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,990
I've settled this matter for you.

467
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,870
That means you owe me a favor.

468
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,190
You have

469
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,870
to return my favor one day.

470
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,390
Of course.

471
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,150
Of course, I will return it.

472
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,910
Hmm...

473
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,060
How about

474
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,870
I treat all the members
of the Arts Department

475
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,020
to a meal sometime soon?

476
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,820
I'll be going now, Du Wei.

477
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,836
(Today is the official start of
the semester. Wish you luck.)

478
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,300
(Do you have class tomorrow night?)

479
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,190
Are they

480
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,060
declaring their relationship officially?

481
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,580
(Wuan University
Student Council Recruitment)

482
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,320
You're here so early.

483
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,150
There's still a lot to do.

484
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,340
What are you up to?

485
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,910
Writing

486
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,470
a proposal.

487
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,190
You wear makeup?

488
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,150
Aren't you just on duty?

489
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,230
Why go all out?

490
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,470
I'm not.

491
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,430
I just put on some lipstick.

492
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,950
It's not for duty.

493
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,820
I have dinner plans tonight,

494
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,630
so I have to make up a bit.

495
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,190
Then, why don't you make up

496
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,580
when you eat with me?

497
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,710
Why would I need to for you?

498
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,020
So, who are you eating with?

499
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,440
Your roommates?

500
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,190
Not them.

501
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,580
Other than your roommates,

502
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,710
did you make new friends?

503
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,340
Am I not allowed to have new friends?

504
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,300
Tian Chi?

505
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,300
What time are you
meeting Tian Chi tonight?

506
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,820
Can I join you guys?

507
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
You want to join us?

508
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,870
Don't you have classes?

509
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,740
The class will end earlier.

510
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,820
And, I should be able to make it.

511
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,540
What time?

512
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,580
By the time you're done,
we'll have finished eating.

513
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,340
Besides,

514
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,580
Tian Chi asked me out alone

515
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,710
to discuss something.

516
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,710
Why would you tag along?

517
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,300
Aren't we

518
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,020
best friends?

519
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,540
And,

520
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
what's wrong with me joining?

521
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,190
I think he's a nice guy.

522
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,760
I'd like to get to know him.

523
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,540
Can't I?

524
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,230
Are you childish?

525
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,230
Oh, right.

526
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,740
Du Wei

527
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,470
looked for you yesterday.

528
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:24,990
What for?

529
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,740
Something

530
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,540
about the welcome party...

531
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,300
Hello, Tian Chi?

532
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,020
Huan'er,

533
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,000
I sent you the
restaurant location for tonight.

534
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,910
Got it.

535
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,580
I forgot to check.

536
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,340
Sorry about that.

537
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,740
See you tonight.

538
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:57,950
Jing Xichi.

539
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,340
Du Wei.

540
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,840
The Arts Department is organizing

541
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,640
a movie night.

542
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,580
Do you want to join?

543
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,430
Sure.

544
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,670
See you tonight.

545
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,190
See you tonight.

546
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,580
See, you won't let me come along?

547
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,580
I have other plans.

548
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Wow, great!

549
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,740
A romance movie?

550
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,190
It should be pretty good.

551
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,380
Do you like the food?

552
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,100
Yes, it's great.

553
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,100
Thank you, Tian Chi.

554
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,760
Sorry for making you spend money.

555
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,430
It's nothing.

556
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,990
I should thank you

557
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,630
for helping to promote my friend's brand
during the last event.

558
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,900
They are interested
in collaborating with you again.

559
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,000
Could you pass that along

560
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,140
to your department head?

561
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,430
That's great!

562
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,820
As long as there's sponsorship,

563
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,920
our department head
will agree to anything.

564
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,470
Huan'er,

565
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,150
are you free later?

566
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,870
I am.

567
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,390
Then,

568
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,460
do you want to watch a movie together?

569
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,240
The student council gave me tickets.

570
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,220
The tickets are given
by the student council?

571
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,580
The cinema is just upstairs.

572
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,200
The Arts Department

573
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,340
is organizing a movie night.

574
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,260
Do you want to join?

575
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,060
Sure.

576
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,740
Let's go.

577
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,340
Let's go.

578
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,230
You're here.

579
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,820
Why didn't I see
any other student council members?

580
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,910
Maybe they

581
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,100
don't have dates.

582
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,780
Du Wei,

583
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,430
I just remembered

584
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,150
I have to do something tonight...

585
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,470
Tian Chi!

586
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,720
You guys are here?

587
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,180
We just finished dinner downstairs

588
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,420
and decided to watch a movie.

589
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,200
Good evening, Du Wei.

590
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,190
Where are you sitting?

591
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,100
Excuse me, let us through.

592
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,540
Thanks.

593
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,260
Huan'er,

594
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:08,990
you sit here.

595
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,340
What were you about to say?

596
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,470
I was saying...

597
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,740
This movie

598
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,780
should be pretty nice.

599
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,360
The movie's starting.

600
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,500
Do you usually watch this kind of movie?

601
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,060
I...

602
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,580
I prefer action films.

603
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,630
Me too.

604
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,910
What's wrong?

605
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,260
I...

606
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,190
I want to put this down.

607
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Do you want some popcorn?

608
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,470
Thank you.

609
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,440
Eat slowly, don't get choked.

610
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,100
Have a drink.

611
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:03,740
Huan'er,

612
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,100
is this popcorn

613
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,300
really that good?

614
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,340
Can I have one?

615
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,670
It's finished...

616
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,820
Sorry, sorry.

617
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,990
You can eat mine.

618
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'll buy another bucket.

619
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,820
No, I'm good.

620
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,440
I've had enough.

621
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,390
Tell us,

622
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,470
how was the date?

623
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,020
Hard to say.

624
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,230
What do you mean by "hard to say"?

625
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,820
What's that supposed to mean?

626
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,020
This is for you, Jing.

627
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,540
You fell so badly yesterday.

628
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,710
This is for you.

629
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,920
(Tianhe Injury Relief Spray)

630
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,150
What are you doing?

631
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,340
This was bought by Huan'er specifically

632
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,710
after our dinner gathering yesterday.

633
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,120
I brought it back for you.

634
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,820
(Tianhe Injury Relief Spray)

635
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,470
She gave this to you yesterday?

636
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,460
Why are you only giving it to me now?

637
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,260
I thought it was just for me.

638
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
Did she say

639
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,020
who it was for?

640
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,500
Nope.

641
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,080
I was confused too
why did she give me two bottles?

642
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,880
Maybe this one is meant for you.

643
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,940
(For Jing Xichi)
Look at yourself.

644
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,780
(For Jing Xichi)

645
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,060
Wait, is this really for you?

646
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,300
How can you simply use it?

647
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,760
You weren't the only one
who got hurt though.

648
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,500
Where are you going this late?

649
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,190
I need to use some too.

650
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,150
What's wrong?

651
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,870
Not happy with your date?

652
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,870
It wasn't a date.

653
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,340
Then, why are you coming back so late?

654
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,990
What did you eat that took so long?

655
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,150
After dinner,

656
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,100
we watched a movie.

657
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,340
And you're saying it wasn't a date?

658
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,260
A guy and a girl,

659
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,420
having dinner
and watching a movie together.

660
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,910
It wasn't just us.

661
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,230
There are

662
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,190
Du Wei and Jing Xichi too.

663
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,820
Du Wei and Jing Xichi?

664
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,950
Something is between them?

665
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,710
Definitely not.

666
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,100
Let me send you a video.

667
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,240
Someone from the Arts Department
sent me this.

668
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,430
What video?

669
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,820
Watch it and you'll know.

670
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,540
(Sorry, everyone.)

671
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,500
(I'd like to take a minute of your time)

672
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,940
(to make a brief advertisement.)

673
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,540
(The Women's Self-Defense Activity Club)

674
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,060
(hosted by Sports Department)

675
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,470
(held its)

676
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,500
(first event today.)

677
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,150
(The location was on the second floor)

678
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,540
(of Zhishan Building.)

679
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,950
(The preparation isn't easy.)

680
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,990
(So if anyone is interested
and has time,)

681
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,190
(please go and check it out.)

682
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,470
(It's really worth it.)

683
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,430
(Please go and check it out.)

684
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,630
Oh, that's why

685
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,300
so many students

686
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,580
suddenly showed up at the event.

687
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,230
There's something going on.

688
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,910
Stop it.

689
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,540
(Piggy Jing)

690
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,900
(Piggy Jing)

691
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,870
Hello? What's up?

692
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,500
Come downstairs.

693
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,150
Why?

694
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,040
Just come down, hurry.

695
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,950
What's going on?

696
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,630
I'm taking you somewhere nice.

697
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
I promise you'll love it.

698
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,020
So...

699
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,870
This is

700
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,670
your "nice place"?

701
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,340
Didn't we always say

702
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,950
we'd go back to Sishui to watch the sea?

703
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,150
We never made it happen.

704
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,780
So, I'm trying

705
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,580
to make it now.

706
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,580
The world's

707
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,820
smallest ocean

708
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,190
is here.

709
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,100
Just wait.

710
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,390
I have something else!

711
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,190
Here, try this.

712
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,470
Wait, Jing Xichi.

713
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,950
Are you three years old?

714
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,340
Who cares how old I am?

715
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,800
How to play this?

716
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,820
Just press this.

717
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,780
It's moving, right?

718
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,750
It's on.

719
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,990
Jing Xichi, don't crash into mine!

720
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,790
Jing Xichi!

721
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,350
Stop crashing into mine!

722
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,060
Jing Xichi!

723
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,270
Chen Huan'er!

724
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,060
What happens?

725
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,950
Your Titanic

726
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:26,790
is about to sink.

727
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:27,220
Your Jack

728
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,580
is about to get sunk by me.

729
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,180
Your Rose

730
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,430
is about to get sunk by me too.

731
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,870
Jing Xichi!

732
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,910
Is this how you chase after Du Wei?

733
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,140
Taking her to play
such a childish thing?

734
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,950
If you act like a child,

735
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,870
this won't work.

736
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,580
And you know better?

737
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,160
Instead of studying properly,

738
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,620
you spend your time thinking
about these ridiculous things?

739
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,180
What?

740
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,350
It's okay for you to do
whatever you want, but I'm not allowed?

741
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,060
What do you mean?

742
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,790
I just saw

743
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,750
you and Du Wei

744
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,870
were having a great time together
at the cinema today.

745
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,020
I also saw

746
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,620
you and Tian Chi sharing that popcorn

747
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,620
pretty happily too.

748
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,060
I...

749
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:23,580
So,

750
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,960
what is your current status with him?

751
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,880
Are you still getting
to know each other?

752
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,200
Or it's still in an ambiguous stage?

753
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,950
What's wrong?

754
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,380
Are you jealous?

755
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,700
I jealous?

756
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,040
I'm just keeping an eye
on you for your mom.

757
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,740
I'm worried that when Aunt Lina
finds out,

758
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,100
she'll come and set you straight.

759
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,360
You better think about
how much hush money you owe me.

760
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,640
I'm not giving you anything.

761
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,470
I tell you,

762
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,700
if my mom finds out

763
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,350
I'm dating such a high-quality senior,

764
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,390
she'd be thrilled!

765
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,560
She wouldn't even worry
about my studies anymore.

766
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,660
Yeah, he's an option
with high potential.

767
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,500
He's great.

768
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,990
Then, why aren't you two together yet?

769
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,750
You're literally a match made in heaven.

770
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,540
If you don't end up together,
it'd cause great outrage.

771
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,360
Still saying you're not jealous?

772
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,060
I'm not jealous.

773
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,700
You're jealous.

774
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,100
I'm not.

775
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,700
You're jealous.

776
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,660
I never get jealous.

777
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,660
I know

778
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,460
about the chaos you caused
at the welcome party.

779
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,310
Don't tell me

780
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,140
you attend it because of me?

781
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,830
What else?

782
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,100
Thank you.

783
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,990
You're welcome.

784
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,430
Oh yeah,

785
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,180
from now on,

786
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,140
if you ever want

787
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,990
to give me something,

788
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,700
just give it to me directly.

789
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,300
If you give it to Zhou Ye,

790
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,240
he'll secretly use
half a bottle of it already.

791
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,830
Alright.

792
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,060
Jing Xichi, are you crashing
into me again? Jing Xichi!

793
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,700
Stop crashing into me!

794
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,020
I want to crash into you!

795
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,020
Why?

796
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,960
Just two boats,
who else should I crash into?

797
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,080
Then, can't you just make it
move in a straight line?

798
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,940
I crash into myself.

799
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,540
I make you sink.

800
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,820
Let's race and see who's faster.

801
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,860
(Senior Du Wei)

802
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,020
Hello, Du Wei.

803
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:51,830
Hello.

804
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,660
Are you free now?

805
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,020
Anything?

806
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,310
Please come down.

807
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,640
I have something to tell you.

808
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,480
If you have anything to say,

809
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,600
just tell me on the phone.

810
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,500
No.

811
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,990
We have to talk in person.

812
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,180
I'm already downstairs at your dorm.

813
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,470
I'll wait for you.

814
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,470
Alright.

815
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,270
Oh my god.

816
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,540
This is insane.

817
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,060
So many people.

818
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,580
Let's see what's going on.

819
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,910
Is this good?

820
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,620
What are you doing?

821
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,020
I ordered this especially for today.

822
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,950
Do you know

823
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,790
what pink roses mean?

824
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,910
I don't.

825
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,500
That means "a declaration of love."

826
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,790
Isn't that your childhood friend

827
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,500
and also Du Wei?

828
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,580
You really have nothing to say?

829
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,310
Should we go

830
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,300
somewhere else to talk?

831
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,020
Sure.

832
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,580
Don't be shy!

833
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,540
Kiss her before you leave.

834
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,350
Looks like Jing from Computer Science

835
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,990
is about to be taken by Du Wei.

836
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,350
Let's go.

837
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,470
Take your flowers back.

838
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,270
So, you dragged me here

839
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,990
just to save my face?

840
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,580
Sorry.

841
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:12,750
Don't worry.

842
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,660
I'm not the type to pester endlessly.

843
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,430
But, I just want to know,

844
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,750
did you reject me

845
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,830
because you already
have someone in your heart?

846
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,350
No.

847
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,700
It's hard to see the truth
when you're in the game.

848
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,470
When two people are too close,

849
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,790
they can't see each other clearly.

850
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,270
You're back, Jing.

851
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,360
Faster login to the game.

852
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,830
Humans are creatures of habit.

853
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,680
Once they get used
to a certain pattern of behavior,

854
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,310
they lose the desire to explore.

855
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,870
Over time,

856
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,500
the true place they hold in each
other's hearts will become ambiguous.

857
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,700
Just like

858
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:01,950
you and Chen Huan'er.

859
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,790
Are we really too close?

860
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,620
Come on, I'm going online.

861
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,700
Come, come. Hurry up!

862
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,270
I'm coming!

863
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,430
So, what's going on
with you and Tian Chi?

864
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:52,750
Any progress?

865
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,180
No progress.

866
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,270
Just the same.

867
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,660
What do you mean "the same"?

868
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,180
What do you

869
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,200
actually think of him?

870
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,220
I think

871
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,220
he's a great person.

872
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,540
Huan'er.

873
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,500
Why are you here, Tian Chi?

874
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,790
Uh...

875
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,820
We have something to do,

876
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,790
so we'll be leaving now.

877
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,780
Where are you going?

878
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:22,910
Wait up,

879
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:23,950
you two!

880
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,470
Where are you going later?

881
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,750
I plan to go to the library first.

882
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,980
It's such a coincidence
that I want to go too.

883
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,380
Do you want to go together?

884
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:49,910
Let's go.

885
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,540
