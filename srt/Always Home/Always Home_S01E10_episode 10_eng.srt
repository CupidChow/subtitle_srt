00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:20,880


2
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,780
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,930
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,880
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,170
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,260
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,710
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,930
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,380
   
   

17
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,660
It's okay, sit down.

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,010
Regarding Xi Chi, I'm not sure whether I should be frank.

19
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,200
But I reckon you already know.

20
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,620
Go ahead. He's already in this state.

21
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,140
Honestly, he's very talented.

22
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,800
He's also hardworking and a great talent in professional soccer.

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,532
But the boy... his ambitions are sky-high.

24
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:24,620
I worry that if I praise him too much, he'll lose himself completely.

25
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,890
So I've never directly praised him.

26
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,460
Thinking about it now, I should have communicated with him more.

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,020
And I only just found out today that you didn't approve of him playing soccer.

28
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,110
Coach, please don't say that.

29
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,470
Think about it. If he can't even protect his legs, how can he play soccer?

30
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,990
To be honest, his injury is so serious

31
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,410
because he was too desperate to prove himself in this competition.

32
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,520
And our school's team doesn't have proper professional training programs,

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,500
so he had to train on his own.

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,174
Without professional guidance, he used the wrong methods.

35
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:02,528
That's why his old injuries didn't heal, and he ended up with new ones.

36
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,740
Several teams have already shown interest in nurturing him

37
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,390
after this selection match.

38
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,790
So if he only plays on our school team, it's really a waste of his talent.

39
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,140
I just hope you'll reconsider letting him go pro.

40
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,270
Eight...

41
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,600
Why are you here?

42
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,120
You're awake? I came to check on you.

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,560
How are you feeling? Does it hurt?

44
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,890
- Chen Huan Er... 
 - I'll call the doctor.

45
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,150
No, no, no! No need.

46
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,740
Painkillers...

47
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,470
This one, right? How many?

48
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,910
One.

49
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,230
Can you be more careful?

50
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,720
Sorry, sorry! Really sorry, bro.

51
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,260
Here.

52
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,500
Does it hurt that bad?

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,400
Of course!

54
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,940
The doctor said you need to rest and not move around.

55
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,320
What's that?

56
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,840
It's not bone broth, is it?

57
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,380
Aunt Hao just brought some over at noon.

58
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,960
I've been drinking it like water these days.

59
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,280
- Then I'll just leave it here. 
 - No, no. I'll drink it.

60
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,900
I'd rather finish it quickly and get better sooner.

61
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,470
You know what?

62
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,150
Last night, I dreamed I was playing soccer.

63
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,860
I played so well.

64
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,710
Look at you showing off.

65
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,100
Thanks.

66
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,790
Why were you so careless?

67
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,470
Maybe because

68
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,420
I wanted to win too badly this time.

69
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,740
I've had enough. This medicine makes me drowsy.

70
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,600
Then go ahead and sleep.

71
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,890
I'll leave when Aunt Lin gets here.

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,820
 This was the first time I had ever seen Xi Chi so down and defeated. 

73
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,790
 He's always been bright, optimistic, and full of energy. 

74
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,890
 Always the one encouraging and uplifting us. 

75
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,380
 But at that moment, I realized that he had been 

76
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,300
 silently digesting all his negative emotions on his own. 

77
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,200
Who is it?

78
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,630
- Li Na, how come you're here? 
 - Yi Fan, I came to see you!

79
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,390
You came as well, Huan Er.

80
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,180
Sorry... can I use the restroom?

81
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,960
- Over here, this way. Go ahead. 
 - Go on.

82
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,000
We especially went to that old shop where you used to love buying pastries

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,020
and got some for you.

84
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,880
Try them and see if they still taste the same.

85
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,740
Thank you.

86
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,520
If I hadn't come, you wouldn't have come either.

87
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,540
- You followed the scent, right? 
 - That's right.

88
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,860
If you're here, how could I not be?

89
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,270
Have some tea.

90
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,740
Thanks.

91
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,630
You two have been working and still made time to visit me.

92
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,630
It must be exhausting. I really appreciate it.

93
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,560
What are you saying? Why are you thanking us?

94
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,740
Are you going to act all formal with us?

95
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,860
Song Hang said

96
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,910
that Xi Chi is young and has great physical fitness.

97
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,740
As long as he does proper rehab, he'll fully recover with no problem.

98
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,180
Exactly.

99
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,230
But Yi Fan, why do you look so worn out lately?

100
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,830
Why are you tearing up as we talk?

101
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,480
Yeah. Is it because it's exhausting running back and forth between the clinic and the ward?

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,660
You need to rest.

103
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,440
Just tell us if there's anything wrong. No need to be polite with us.

104
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
I'm fine, really.

105
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,760
I know my own limits.

106
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,270
But these past few days, I have been a little worried.

107
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,630
I need you guys' advice.

108
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,240
Do you think I should let him take a year off from school?

109
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,520
Give him some time to adjust?

110
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,130
- That could work. 
 - Aunt Lin, Jing Xi Chi can do it.

111
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,630
Don't worry.

112
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,540
If needed, I, along with Song Cong, can tutor him.

113
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,860
He'll catch up for sure.

114
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,940
Yes, I'll tell Song Cong that once school is out, he should come over to tutor him.

115
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,490
- No problem. 
 - Yes, that should work.

116
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,710
Thank you, Huan Er.

117
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,910
It's nothing, really.

118
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,590
I'm really jealous of you two.

119
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,510
Your kids are so well-behaved. Unlike my little troublemaker at home.

120
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,860
Oh, come on.

121
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,390
Here, try this pastry. See if it still tastes the same.

122
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,060
Thanks, I got it.

123
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,880
I'll just have one.

124
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,130
Take a guess! Guess what we brought you?

125
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,460
What is it?

126
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,960
I was just relieved that being in the hospital meant no homework...

127
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,350
- But you guys... 
 - You wish!

128
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,880
Starting today, we're tutoring you every day.

129
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,500
My head hurts... I think I need to sleep.

130
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,240
In this chapter, we're exploring the periodicity of the cosine function.

131
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,120
- Got it? 
 - What's even going on in your brain?

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,960
I'm begging you...

133
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,940
 Pay attention! 

134
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,680
All right, Cong, explain it to him again.

135
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm done. I'm done!

136
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,230
Who's next? Who's next?

137
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,420
I'm not studying anymore!

138
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,110
No more!

139
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,510
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

140
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,110
Time to study, study, study!

141
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,900
"Before, he often struggled to understand the confusing world he lived in."

142
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,610
Cong...

143
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,350
I'm fine, thank you.

144
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,120
- And you? 
 - Song Cong.

145
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,270
And you?

146
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,420
Listen to me read.

147
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,210
"Today, we're using chemicals..."

148
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫

149
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,260
♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

150
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,760
I give up. No more!

151
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,230
- You will study. 
 - I won't listen to anyone.

152
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,380
I'm not studying no matter who shows up!

153
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,870
Take away his phone.

154
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,300
Fine, I'll study. Don't take my phone.

155
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,300
- Wake up! 
 - My little treasure, Jing Xi Chi!

156
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,630
Let knowledge flow into your brain.

157
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,940
Look closely. The periodicity of the cosine function will yield...

158
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,620
Wrong! "A" is the answer.

159
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,180
What's your answer?

160
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,250
- Have some fruit. 
 - No!

161
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,150
- Have a bite. 
 - No.

162
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,070
No.

163
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,380
Are you going to eat? Are you going to eat or not? Eat it...

164
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,800
   

165
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,390
The weather is so nice.

166
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,780
The sun is shining bright on the day Jing Xi Chi is discharged.

167
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,534
My mom was just talking about the good weather.

168
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,440
She said she wanted to find a time to go to Sishui together.

169
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,480
The wintersweets there should be blooming by now.

170
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,870
- I almost forgot! 
 - Yeah.

171
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,060
Once Xi Chi recovers, let's go see them together.

172
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,300
Sounds good! Let's go quickly, then.

173
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,820
Jing Xi Chi is probably getting impatient.

174
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,944
Finally! You can go home!

175
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,910
We won't have to come to the hospital every day.

176
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,780
Here, let me take that.

177
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,536
- Where's Cong? 
 - He said he wanted to learn more

178
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:34,250
about your condition.

179
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,730
- Let's go. 
 - Wait.

180
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,880
- What's this? 
 - For you.

181
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,540
   

182
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,360
Where did you get these match tickets?

183
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,500
It's a secret.

184
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,860
Come on, let's go.

185
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,670
- Come on. 
 - Thanks.

186
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,250
No need to thank me.

187
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,940
Take it slow.

188
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:25,381
Don't put too much pressure on your foot.

189
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,110
Dad, Mom.

190
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,270
So, um...

191
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,700
This Sunday is the league finals.

192
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,270
I have an extra ticket.

193
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,830
Is either of you free to go with me?

194
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,660
It's your dad's day off. You go with him.

195
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,680
- Look after your son. 
 - Don't worry about that.

196
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:54,700
- I'll help you to your room. 
 - It's okay, Dad.

197
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,410
I can manage.

198
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,870
Be gentle with that leg.

199
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:25,080
   

200
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,350
 Yes, that's it! Keep at it! 

201
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,420
Let your hamstrings activate.

202
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,460
You can do it.

203
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,610
Slowly lower down.

204
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,370
That's good.

205
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,540
Go back and rest more.

206
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,160
Pay attention to your dosage. Ease up on the painkillers.

207
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,520
- Thank you. 
 - Let's go, Zhang.

208
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,270
Are you tired?

209
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,940
Have some water.

210
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,390
Here.

211
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,630
Why are you here?

212
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,450
I came to see you.

213
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,070
Are you tired?

214
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,320
Here.

215
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,260
Thanks.

216
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,490
Is it going well?

217
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,890
Not too bad.

218
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
It's just that...

219
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:10,981
I think I underestimated how hard this would be.

220
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,700
I've actually thought it through.

221
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Many great soccer players have been injured before.

222
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,660
This injury of mine is nothing in comparison.

223
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,180
But, Huan Er...

224
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,700
I feel like my body... is not listening to me anymore.

225
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,060
Perhaps... God is giving me a warning.

226
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,410
I should have quit earlier

227
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,770
so I wouldn't have caused my parents so much worry.

228
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,510
I've been thinking a lot lately.

229
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,970
You know, they both have their own jobs and careers.

230
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:25,180
I can't just let them keep living in constant worry because of me, right?

231
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,540
This is just the beginning, isn't it?

232
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,420
You have to be patient with your body.

233
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,030
Listen to me.

234
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,508
You will definitely get better.

235
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:42,400
Once you're well, we'll go to school together.

236
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,270
You have no idea. In the mornings when Song Cong and I walked to school, he actually...

237
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,150
He what?

238
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:55,110
He started explaining math problems to me!

239
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,580
You've got to save me. Cong is driving me crazy.

240
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,150
You need to save me.

241
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,730
Chen Huan Er.

242
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,740
Don't come to see me anymore.

243
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,746
You don't want us to visit you now?

244
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:16,196
It's not that.

245
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,001
Look, all I do every day is rehabilitation.

246
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,845
There's nothing else going on.

247
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:23,920
I don't want to delay your studies.

248
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,020
That won't happen.

249
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,740
Fine, then I'll tell Cong not to come.

250
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,110
I mean,

251
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,000
you shouldn't come either.

252
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,560
I'll help you.

253
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,760
Here.

254
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,420
Here.

255
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,560
Come on, go slow.

256
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,690
- Here. I've got you. 
 - I'm fine. I can do it.

257
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,490
It's fine. I can manage.

258
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,800
 The intense pain and the doctor's words 

259
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,840
 made Jing Xi Chi painfully aware of reality. 

260
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,900
 He didn't want us to go because he was worried about affecting our studies; 

261
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,350
 he didn't want us to see him like this. Afraid and uncertain. 

262
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,580
Oh my God.

263
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,140
This is a huge challenge.

264
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,390
 Honestly, I can't even tell who's right and who's wrong anymore. 

265
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,480
 Absolutely no clue. 

266
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,329
 But I will definitely find enough evidence to prove to him 

267
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:22,020
 that the road ahead is still long and that everything can start over. 

268
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,010
 There's still time for everything. 

269
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,520
- Let me help you. 
 - No, it's fine. No need.

270
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,020
I can do it myself.

271
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,540
- Where's Cong? 
 - The teacher called him away.

272
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,670
What, you want Cong to help you?

273
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,640
No, I was just thinking...

274
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,590
His big brother is back in school now.

275
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,200
Shouldn't he personally come to greet me?

276
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,060
   

277
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm fine. I can do it.

278
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,120
- It's okay. Let me help. 
 - No need, really.

279
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,230
If you don't want to go back to class, I can stay here with you for a bit.

280
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:35,870
I used to do pull-ups on the goalpost, and the coach would tell me off.

281
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,430
He said it wasn't solid.

282
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,160
Jing Xi Chi...

283
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,050
how old are you this year?

284
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,180
Did you fry your brain?

285
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,680
I'm only a few months older than you.

286
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,390
You're 17 years old, right?

287
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,130
Obviously.

288
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,890
Do you know Baggio?

289
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,800
When he was 17, Baggio suffered a ligament tear on his right knee.

290
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,310
He had 220 stitches.

291
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,460
In total, he underwent six surgeries.

292
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,150
Finally, at the age of 28, he made his Champions League debut.

293
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,870
In 1998, Piero also suffered a ligament tear.

294
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:27,460
In 2006, he scored a hat-trick during the second half of Italy's quarterfinals.

295
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,110
In 1999, Ronaldo suffered a complete rupture of his cruciate ligament.

296
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,310
When everyone thought he would retire,

297
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:39,320
he returned in the 2001-2002 season with an improved form.

298
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,890
In 2006, Owen tore his ligament.

299
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,520
In 2008, he became the captain of Newscal.

300
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,290
Newcastle.

301
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,550
Captain of Newcastle, yes.

302
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,550
He scored 11 goals that season.

303
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,070
- Chen Huan Er. 
 - In 1999, the UEFA Cup.

304
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,320
- At Celtic Park... 
 - Chen Huan Er.

305
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,546
Larsson suffered a double leg fracture.

306
00:22:07,546 --> 00:22:10,240
- In the following season, he made it— 
 - Huan Er.

307
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,460
Thank you.

308
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,220
 Actually, I'm a very forgetful person. 

309
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,920
 I stay optimistic by leaving the past behind, 

310
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,700
 but no matter how much time has passed, I will always remember this morning. 

311
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,310
 This ever-refreshing morning made me believe 

312
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:49,590
 that only when we lose the courage to start over does youth truly come to an end. 

313
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,620
Are you going back?

314
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,110
Let me see that cheat sheet you wrote.

315
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,550
Jing Xi Chi! Give it back!

316
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,590
Why did you write so much?

317
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,550
Xi Chi, when your leg heals,

318
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,900
do you still want to play soccer?

319
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,360
Dad, you know what?

320
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:52,190
I don't really remember clearly how I started playing soccer in the first place.

321
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,260
It feels like ever since I could remember,

322
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,660
 I've loved playing. 

323
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,560
 Mom always told me that it was also the dream you never got to fulfill when you were young. 

324
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,870
 As a kid, I didn't really understand. 

325
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,560
 You told me to train, so I just followed along. 

326
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,860
Your mom cares too much about you.

327
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,110
She's afraid you'll get hurt.

328
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:34,930
She said every time she watched you play, her heart was in her throat.

329
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,830
Mom has watched me play?

330
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,300
All right.

331
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,630
No matter what, remember our promise.

332
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:51,560
No matter what happens, stick it out until the end.

333
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,630
Let's go home, okay?

334
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,180
Come on.

335
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,560
Take it slow.

336
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:08,080
- Don't put too much pressure on that foot. 
 - I'm fine, Dad.

337
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,420
- You okay? 
 - Yeah.

338
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,960
Mom...

339
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,679
I just got off work and happened to pass by, so I'll go home with you.

340
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,940
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

341
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,070
Listen to yourself.

342
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,730
It's not like Xi Chi is playing.

343
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,010
What's there to watch?

344
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,440
Yesterday, your school coach called.

345
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,771
He said the youth team coach asked about you and wanted to visit.

346
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:11,500
They think you have a lot of potential.

347
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,560
I thanked them and told them not to come

348
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,870
until you've fully recovered.

349
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,740
Once you're better,

350
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,080
I'll personally take you to visit them.

351
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,750
Mom.

352
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,260
Thank you.

353
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,660
I've thought it through, too.

354
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,240
I'm letting go. From now on, you'll make your own decisions.

355
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,709
I used to meddle too much, worrying and running around for nothing,

356
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:56,740
and it didn't help.

357
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,360
Mom.

358
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,070
I was never mad at you.

359
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,940
I knew in my heart.

360
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,590
If you weren't the one playing the serious role in this family,

361
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,860
with Dad and me being so overly dramatic, we'd have turned the house upside down sooner or later.

362
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,150
All right, now.

363
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,260
Let's go home.

364
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,700
We don't want to make your mom cry.

365
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,600
- Slowly. 
 - Be careful.

366
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,120
Okay.

367
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,840
Did you hear what I said?

368
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,630
Your dad is away on a business trip, so I'll take you to school for these few days.

369
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,910
You don't have to.

370
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,540
Why? How will you get there then?

371
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,940
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

372
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,920
   

373
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,640
   

374
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,350
Mom.

375
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:31,832
Mom.

376
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:34,002
Explain this to me?

377
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,120
Actually, I did have a meeting that day.

378
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,133
I planned to tell you guys and go together,

379
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,840
but I was afraid I wouldn't make it and didn't want to disappoint you.

380
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,980
So, as soon as the meeting ended, I rushed over,

381
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,910
but it was already over.

382
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,420
Then where did you get this ticket?

383
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,830
Huan Er gave it to me.

384
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,400
Thanks, Mom.

385
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,914
Wait!

386
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,870
Let me keep it as a souvenir.

387
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,790
Give it to me.

388
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,790
I should have invited her to come with us.

389
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,700
What did you say?

390
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,070
Nothing.

391
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,550
From now on, after school, I'll be walking home with Huan Er and Cong. Rest assured.

392
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,920
- Slowly. 
 - I'm okay. My leg is fine.

393
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,470
Gosh, this kid...

394
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,360
   

395
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,240
   

396
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,500
   

397
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,880
   

398
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,590
Hello, what's up?

399
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,760
 Chen Huan Er, some tricks you've got there. 

400
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,070
Come clean now!

401
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,740
Tell me. Where did you get so many tickets from?

402
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,020
I got them from Coach Li.

403
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,560
 Pay attention to your steps! Faster, faster! 

404
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,700
 What are you doing? 

405
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,630
 Watch your step! 

406
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,870
 Hello, sir. 

407
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,110
 The tickets for Sunday's finals. Can I have one? 

408
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,010
 Sure. Help yourself. 

409
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,870
 - Next. Hurry up! 
 - Thanks. 

410
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,560
 I'm taking three. 

411
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,160
 Hey, are you listening? Did you not eat breakfast this morning? 

412
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,380
It was that easy?

413
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,434
 What did you think? 

414
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:17,010
Did you think I had to beg on my knees just to get the tickets?

415
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,390
Okay. Never mind, just asking.

416
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,700
That's all. Bye.

417
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,210
Take it slow. Be careful.

418
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,020
I'm fine, Mom. I'm almost fully recovered.

419
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,260
- Good morning, Aunt Lin. 
 - Morning, Huan Er.

420
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,520
Jing Xi Chi, I'll take you today.

421
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,840
Didn't Cong say he'd take me?

422
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,840
The teacher asked him to go for a competition.

423
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,940
Why don't I call a cab for you guys?

424
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,959
It's okay. We can get there on the bike.

425
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,150
You're going to be late for work. Don't worry about us.

426
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,260
Okay, I'm going to be late.

427
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,160
I'll leave him to you. You guys figure it out.

428
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,960
- I'll handle it. 
 - Thank you.

429
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,720
- Call a cab if you need to. 
 - Don't worry.

430
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,690
Come on, get on.

431
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,790
You even added a back seat for me?

432
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,350
That's right.

433
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,080
Aren't I considerate? Don't want your butt to bruise.

434
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,800
Come on then.

435
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,816
Are you sure you can do it?

436
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:24,310
Why not? Just get on and see.

437
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,560
Give me your bag then.

438
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,310
No biggie. I can still ride with the bag.

439
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,140
- I'm going to get on. 
 - Go on.

440
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,550
Here, take a seat.

441
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,020
- Sit tight. 
 - Here I go.

442
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,590
- Hang on. 
 - Okay, go ahead.

443
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,560
- I'm going to go fast. 
 - Not too fast, please.

444
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,280
- My leg just healed. 
 - I'll be lightning fast.

445
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,500
Are you tired?

446
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,350
No.

447
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,660
This is nothing.

448
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,150
Chen Huan Er...

449
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:01,690
even though you added such an ugly back seat to my beloved bike, I'm actually pretty touched.

450
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,765
But at this speed, when are we ever going to get to school?

451
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:09,150
- Well, you could take a taxi. 
 - No, no, no.

452
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,700
I'm a disabled man.

453
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,110
Even if I'm late, I have a legitimate excuse.

454
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,940
But I don't, bro.

455
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,440
Exactly. So you better hurry up and push, or you're going to get punished.

456
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,420
- Don't just stand there. Push! 
 - I...

457
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,200
Let's go! Hurry up!

458
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,390
- Ugh, you're so annoying. 
 - Careful! Don't make me fall.

459
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,800
Faster.

460
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,660
 That morning on the way to school, I don't even know how long it took. 

461
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,800
 And even though he says everything's back to normal, I could tell 

462
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:59,420
 his recovery is dragging out much longer than before. 

463
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,870
 But Jing Xi Chi would never say something cheesy like, 

464
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,830
 "Pain is what makes youth real." 

465
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:38,710
 He'd just scoff, call it dramatic, and get right back to it. 

466
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,350
Look here, Jing Xi Chi.

467
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,600
Look here.

468
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,240
- What? 
 - Mountain pose. My dad taught me.

469
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,310
Stop kicking. Your leg has only just healed.

470
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:12,000
You have no idea how many rounds my heart's been flying on the field.

471
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,370
Anyway, the physical therapist said that I'm recovering well.

472
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,640
He said I could try out for the upcoming special training recruitment.

473
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,640
You have no clue how much I miss the smell of the lawn.

474
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,790
Lawn?

475
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,200
You miss the smell of grass?

476
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,500
Okay. I'll satisfy your wish.

477
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,830
You miss grass, right? Here, have a whiff.

478
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,390
- I know you know the smell of grass. 
 - It's prickling my face!

479
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,110
- Doesn't it smell good? 
 - Chen Huan Er!

480
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,640
- Don't you like it? 
 - I don't like this.

481
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,320
I want a lawn, not just grass! Why get me this?

482
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,340
- It's nice! You like it, huh? 
 - I'll end up with allergies.

483
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,020
- I don't want this. 
 - I know you like it.

484
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,690
- You like it so much! 
 - No, I don't.

485
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,350
Hello?

486
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,420
 Hi. The orthopedic book you asked for last time has arrived. 

487
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,870
 You can pick it up when you're free. 

488
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,350
Thanks. I'll come get it tomorrow.

489
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:57,240
- You're here. 
 - Hey, the book I ordered...

490
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,830
Here.

491
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,670
Thanks. It's 150, right?

492
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,350
180.

493
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,520
Wasn't it 150?

494
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,054
This book is out of print.

495
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:16,780
I had to check with multiple publishers to find it, so there's a markup.

496
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,640
Then why didn't you mention that over the phone?

497
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,380
Do you want it or not?

498
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,160
I didn't bring enough money. Can I pay you the rest next time?

499
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,850
I'll cover it.

500
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,360
This, too.

501
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,460
Just pay me back later.

502
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,120
Thanks.

503
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,140
You're here to buy books, too?

504
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,976
Math in our second year has gotten a lot harder,

505
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:59,910
so I bought two extra exercise books to practice.

506
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,870
I heard that after you transferred to the art class, you've been studying really hard.

507
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,270
- If you ever need help with anything... 
 - Song Cong,

508
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,450
is there nothing in your life besides studying?

509
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,620
I just wanted to thank you for helping me earlier.

510
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,810
I know. You don't want to owe me a favor, right?

511
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,100
Every time before I went to tutoring, I would come here for a bit.

512
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,540
Actually, back when I was taking TOEFL classes, I used to skip them and come here, too.

513
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,700
You? Skipping class?

514
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,090
Why wouldn't I?

515
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,750
Everyone thinks I'm too perfect.

516
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,630
Even Xi Chi and Huan Er do.

517
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:05,729
What's up with you three?

518
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,930
Nothing.

519
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,650
Everything's fine.

520
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,980
Honestly, I think there's still some misunderstanding between you guys.

521
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,740
Last time, I said some things that were a bit too much.

522
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,040
I thought about it afterward

523
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,080
and realized it was just me being too stubborn.

524
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,552
My family's housekeeper once told me

525
00:39:37,552 --> 00:39:40,020
that I bottle things up too much.

526
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,921
I get it.

527
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,960
Maybe if I just talked about it, everything would be fine.

528
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,030
But I just can't get the words out.

529
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:55,754
Actually, I'm the same way.

530
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,040
Do you remember when you asked me why I thought your essays were good?

531
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:11,090
It's because you always manage to express things that I don't know how to put into words.

532
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:18,040
Then do you know why I just told you all those things from my heart?

533
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,228
Why?

534
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,690
Because I like you.

535
00:40:28,566 --> 00:40:30,506
What did you say?

536
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:36,882
I said... I will become someone as amazing as you.

537
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,991
Huan Er.

538
00:40:56,991 --> 00:41:00,420
- Aunt Lin. 
 - Here, have some water. It's hot, isn't it?

539
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,540
Not too bad.

540
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,020
There are quite a few people today.

541
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,080
By the way, isn't Uncle Jing coming?

542
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,270
He's on duty today.

543
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,240
He'll come over as soon as his shift ends.

544
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,170
Coach Li is over there.

545
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,890
I'll go ask him about today's recruitment.

546
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,390
All right.

547
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,020
Here, drink some water.

548
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,540
Thanks.

549
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,500
Give me your hand.

550
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,060
What for?

551
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,680
My mom made me wear this red string since I was little.

552
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,180
Consider it me sharing some of my luck with you.

553
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,570
It should help a bit, right?

554
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,790
Are you really giving me something so important?

555
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,710
It's not a gift, just a temporary loan.

556
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,360
If you like it, I'll make you another one later.

557
00:42:23,233 --> 00:42:24,683
Thanks.

558
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,960
But don't worry.

559
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,307
Now that I'm back in the game, I'm going to dominate the field.

560
00:42:32,307 --> 00:42:35,160
Of course! You're my Big Brother Jing!

561
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:53,620


562

 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

563
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:04,730
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

564

♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

565
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:18,130
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

566
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:24,620
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

567
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:32,330

568
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:39,160
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

569
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,840
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

570
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,540
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

571
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,400
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

572
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,620
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
♫  The you from back then  ♫

573
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:06,340
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

574
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,800
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

575
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,170
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

576
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:20,060
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

577
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,960
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

578
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,900
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

579
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,490
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

580
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,130
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

581
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,540
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

582
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:46,720
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

583
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:52,120
♫  At the right time  ♫
