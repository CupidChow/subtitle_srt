1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:20,840


2
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,780
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day  ♫ 
 ♫  Or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,930
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:59,360
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,980
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,220
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,170
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,260
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,710
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:43,450
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,260
   

16
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,500
What's wrong with you today? Why are you eating so little?

18
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,260
Does it taste bad, or does your stomach hurt?

19
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,520
No. I had some bread before evening study, so I'm not too hungry.

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,910
If you don't want to eat, forget it.

21
00:02:14,518 --> 00:02:15,780
I'll put it away.

22
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,510
Mom, let me put it away.

23
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,220
Let me do it.

24
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,620
You're really thoughtful.

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,580
What are you doing? You're walking so slowly. Hurry up. Walk.

26
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,240
Mr. Song,

27
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:49,361
why aren't the lights on at night?

28
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:51,581
I just got them working.

29
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:57,331
What are you standing there for, Chen Huan Er?

30
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,711
Come here.

31
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,400
Let me introduce you. This is the puppy from our compound.

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,520
It's called Little Bro. But since you're here, you're the new Little Bro.

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
Sit.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,677
What are you waiting for? Eat.

35
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,184
Let me tell you. Aunt Hao is the best cook in our compound.

36
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:38,271
Since I was little, I've looked forward to my mom working overtime

37
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:41,540
so she could send me to their house for a free meal.

38
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm really sorry.

39
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,650
- I'm troubling— 
 - Don't mention it.

40
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,080
Let me tell you. Mr. Song gave me extra food because he saw how hard I trained.

41
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,780
Are you going to eat it? I'll eat it if you don't.

42
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,350
What are you talking about? Let her eat first.

43
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,340
- Hurry. 
 - Thank you.

44
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,910
It's good, right?

45
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,510
- It's good. 
 - I'll try it too.

46
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,360
I'm telling you,

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,520
this secret hideout is our masterpiece.

48
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:26,650
None of the parents in the compound ever figured out that we set it up

49
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,170
right along their daily commute route.

50
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,550
Song Cong.

51
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,120
 Song Cong? 

52
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,020
Bring two more dishes to Huan Er.

53
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,720
Coming.

54
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,720
 Mom. 

55
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,340
 Mom. 

56
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,500
So, is this where you saw me that day?

57
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,910
Yes.

58
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,110
But rest assured, I won't tell anyone about it.

59
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,030
I didn't cry that day.

60
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,030
I understand.

61
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,620
Girls are self-conscious.

62
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,910
But don't worry.

63
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,550
Only heaven, earth, you, and I know you cried because of your exam.

64
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,910
- No third person will know about it. 
 - Enough.

65
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,960
Stop talking about Huan Er's crying.

66
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,520
No fourth person will know. Rest assured.

67
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,840
Really.

68
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,910
I really didn't cry.

69
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,160
You didn't cry.

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,940
- She said she didn't cry. 
 - You don't believe?

71
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,720
- I believe you. 
 - You didn't cry.

72
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,000
Here, have a sip.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,700
- My mom's heavy-handed with seasoning. 
 - Thank you.

74
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,150
There are so many dishes. I can't finish them.

75
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,960
You don't have to be so polite.

76
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,211
Everyone in this compound knows each other.

77
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:16,883
Going to someone else's house for a meal is like our parents working shifts.

78
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:20,409
Now that you're here, you have to go with the flow.

79
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,499
You should quickly adapt and join us.

80
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,350
Next time when Aunt Li Na is on duty, come to my house for a meal.

81
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,600
If you refuse again, my mom will be angry.

82
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,710
Fine.

83
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,160
I'll adapt and try hard to keep up.

84
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,590
If you need us in the future, text us "Secret Base"

85
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,010
and we'll know you want to meet here in ten minutes.

86
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,690
Okay.

87
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,200
Great.

88
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,520
We're finally a trio again.

89
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,960
What do you mean, "a trio again"?

90
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,770
Do you want to know?

91
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,940
Lend me your homework for a week, and I'll tell you.

92
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,280
Stop being mysterious. Just tell me.

93
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,200
It's Li Tian.

94
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,313
Li Tian?

95
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:16,820
Let's not talk about him. Let's eat.

96
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,940
Go away.

97
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Why didn't you bring him some food?

98
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,840
He eats a lot every day.

99
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,550
Here. Call him your senior.

100
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,260
I'm not his junior.

101
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,520
- I'm the boss. He's your senior. 
 - Don't talk so much.

102
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,960
Here, look at her. She's your junior. Your new junior.

103
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,354
Chen Huan Er is your new little bro.

104
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,640
Does he need to be renamed? You don't even acknowledge him anymore?

105
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,060
What shall we name him then?

106
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,680
Call him Second Brother. You're Little Brother.

107
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,160
Song Cong, get up!

108
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,990
Huan Er.

109
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,380
I'm late. I need to rush to work.

110
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,500
You hurry up.

111
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,480
Got it.

112
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,740
Morning.

113
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,500
You didn't have breakfast, right?

114
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,280
My mom made it.

115
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,180
Is it for me?

116
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:35,617
Thank you.

117
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,260
Cherish it. It's my mom's turn tomorrow.

118
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,470
 Living in a family housing compound finally shows its advantages. 

119
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,950
 You'll never go hungry. 

120
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,540
 I'm not afraid of how busy Mom is at the hospital. 

121
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,810
 The families will help each other. 

122
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,480
 As for cooking skills, everyone is different. 

123
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,935
Are you really eating it? I gave you some, and you really ate it!

124
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:19,160
What am I going to eat if you ate it?

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,680
Don't follow me.

126
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,430
 Our vegetable buns still haven't received the family's approval. 

127
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,740
When is Aunt Hao's day off?

128
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
If you don't like it, don't eat it.

129
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,070
   

130
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,190
I heard Song Cong turned in his paper early that day

131
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,940
so he could finish school with Ms. Kaosign.

132
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,840
- Are they really— 
 - Stop talking.

133
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,570
Huan Er, is there something going on between you and Song Cong?

134
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,500
You believe it too?

135
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,480
People who don't know the truth might actually believe it.

136
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,900
Nothing is going on.

137
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,500
   

138
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,680
You improved so much on this test. 
    

139
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,220
Is it because Song Cong tutored you?

140
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,500
Then can I sit in on the lessons too?

141
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,430
Sure. I'll talk to Song Cong.

142
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,600
Stand up!

143
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,590
 Hello, Sir. 

144
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,909
Hello, students.

145
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:59,909
   

146
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,160
Cong, are these leftover bottles from infusions?

147
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,620
Empty saline bottles.

148
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:19,390
They're my dad's invention, but I think it's no different from watering plants directly.

149
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,500
Cong, after we're done eating, come to our house to play.

150
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,760
No. I have to tutor Huan Er later.

151
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,240
Tutoring on weekends?

152
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,454
I asked you to play football last week, but you had tutoring.

153
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:36,530
I asked you to go to the base before, but you were tutoring.

154
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,060
You too... you come here for tutoring every week.

155
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,850
You even freeload meals. Don't you think it's too far?

156
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,940
What's too far? We're all in the same compound.

157
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,210
Huan Er, eat it while it's hot.

158
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,620
Thank you.

159
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,160
As for you, I've never seen you be so proactive when studying.

160
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,480
When it comes to mealtime, you're more punctual than others.

161
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,710
Aunt Hao, I went to play football, and it's also a serious matter.

162
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,160
Your mother just told me today.

163
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,540
Even if you're a special student, you can't fall behind in your studies.

164
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,520
I... Yes. I'll stop talking. I'll eat, alright?

165
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,260
- I'll eat. 
 - Aunt Hao, your cooking is delicious.

166
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,710
Much better than my mom's.

167
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,830
Really? Eat more.

168
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,090
Chen Huan Er, you're a bit shameless now.

169
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,760
I'll tell your mom later.

170
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,440
- You wouldn't dare. 
 - Didn't you flatter me before by saying

171
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,872
that my mom is the best cook in the compound?

172
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:26,130
No. Why are you all siding with her?

173
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,330
Chen Huan Er, let's do this one-on-one. Don't seek outside help.

174
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,520
What one-on-one?

175
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,610
Say it in English.

176
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,890
Can you make it more international?

177
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,010
Your English has improved.

178
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,660
- Yes. 
 - You're no longer Ms. Kaosign?

179
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,360
Fine. Let me drink some water to calm down.

180
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,340
That's my water.

181
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,180
I know it's yours.

182
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,600
Why did you drink it if you knew?

183
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,900
Stop being dramatic!

184
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,937
Everyone here shares their water.

185
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,220
What's wrong with drinking your water?

186
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,510
You have oil all over your hand.

187
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,380
- Wash it. 
 - I won't. 
 - Wash it.

188
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,780
Whoever drank first should do the dishes.

189
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,020
- Didn't you drink it? 
 - I'm not doing it.

190
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,430
Why did you break the rules?

191
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,320
- Do it. 
 - What's wrong?

192
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,700
I'm not washing them.

193
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,110
I'm not washing them today!

194
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,080
- Just do it! 
 - Ouch!

195
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,190
- Are you doing it or not? 
 - Ouch!

196
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,720
My arm hurts. Cong!

197
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,360
Look, she's hurting my elbow.

198
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,109
I'm in pain. She hurt me like this.

199
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,989
- I can't move. Look. 
 - Enough.

200
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:14,389
Cong, look, I can't move it.

201
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:16,600
Be the judge here. How can she do this?

202
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,140
She'll become the boss here soon. Look.

203
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,800
Qi Qi should be here.

204
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,680
I'm going to pick up Qi Qi.

205
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,919
Cong, I'll go downstairs first. Open the door for me in a moment.

206
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:31,263
Qi Qi?

207
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:34,427
Is she coming for your tutorials?

208
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:38,553
- Yeah. 
 - Why didn't you say so earlier?

209
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:41,073
You didn't ask.

210
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,240
 What are you doing here? 

211
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,603
Studying, of course.

212
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,296
What are you looking at?

213
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:23,720
Even though you've made progress, can't I stop being the last in class?

214
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,770
You have a goal now.

215
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,400
Studying is a good thing.

216
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,920
It's good that everyone is together.

217
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,400
Qi Qi.

218
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,474
I bought some oranges. I don't know if you like them.

219
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,560
- Thank you, Aunt. 
 - Don't mention it.

220
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,593
- Song Cong, there's more. Cut more if it's not enough. 
 - Okay.

221
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:43,013
Don't exhaust yourselves with studying. Take a break later.

222
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,853
- I'm going to go. 
 - Bye.

223
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,923
- Bye, Aunt Hao. 
 - Bye.

224
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:49,333
She's so nice.

225
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:54,243
Did she go out because of me?

226
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:57,163
I'm so sorry to bother you.

227
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:01,323
Don't overthink it. My mom is in a hurry to play mahjong.

228
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,523
Well, Aunt Hao, my mom, her mom, and Li Tian's mom

229
00:15:05,523 --> 00:15:08,010
make the perfect four-player set.

230
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:10,433
Do all your parents know each other?

231
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:13,893
Of course. Every parent in this compound knows each other.

232
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,860
Li Tian from our class lives upstairs.

233
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,043
We've known each other since we were in diapers.

234
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:23,750
In that case, why don't you ever go to school with Li Tian?

235
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:26,123
Because...

236
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:30,480
That's because he's Dr. Li's son.

237
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,360
 You even answered such a question wrong. 

238
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,833
 Did you even read it? 

239
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,793
 Because of this mistake, you didn't get a perfect score. 

240
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:40,983
 Aren't you embarrassed? I'm embarrassed for you. 

241
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:49,143
 Tian, although you're number one in class, do you know that Song Cong got full marks? 

242
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:51,283
 Tian. 

243
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,513
 You must work hard. You know your father has high expectations of you. 

244
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,123
 Here's some gossip. 

245
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:09,187
 Yesterday, Mrs. Li scolded her son. Did you know that? 

246
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:13,165
 I'm telling you, Li Tian's mom scolded Li Tian again. 

247
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:15,285
 This kid is unfortunate. 

248
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,393
 I'm dying of laughter. 

249
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:27,283
Your family housing compound is really interesting.

250
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:29,553
All right, enough. Let's study.

251
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,120
- Sure. 
 - Okay.

252
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,320
Song Cong, remember the problem you explained last time? This one.

253
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,632
I haven't figured it out yet. Can you explain it again?

254
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:39,933
I don't quite understand this problem either.

255
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,593
- Let me find it. 
 - Let Song Cong explain. He explains well.

256
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:44,173
Here.

257
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:47,193
You.

258
00:16:47,193 --> 00:16:49,193
Come and listen together.

259
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:54,560
For this problem,

260
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,798
we first need to look at the small ball.

261
00:16:56,798 --> 00:17:02,163
When it's moving in the fourth quadrant, T is equal to 0.25.

262
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:04,323
Write it down.

263
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,703
T is equal to 0.25.

264
00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:11,745
When it's perpendicular to the electric field E,

265
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:16,813
- its direction of displacement is— 
 - Your hair is annoying. Can you move it aside?

266
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:20,560
C is equal to 0.2 m. Write it down.

267
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,083
0.2.

268
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,233
Direction of displacement.

269
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:25,803
Because...

270
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:30,913
Why are you so close to me?

271
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:35,080
I can't see over there.

272
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
I'm talking about this problem.

273
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:43,273
You already explained this part?

274
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:45,133
You're quite fast.

275
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,000
The ball is perpendicular to the electric field E;

276
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,313
the direction of displacement is 0.2 when it's perpendicular to E.

277
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:54,403
Qi Qi.

278
00:17:54,403 --> 00:17:58,143
You smell really good. What shampoo do you use?

279
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,353
It's a British brand my mom bought me.

280
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:02,403
- I'll bring you a bottle next time. 
 - No thanks.

281
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:03,993
I'm just asking.

282
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:05,813
It's fine.

283
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,613
Do you want to study or not?

284
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:17,033
 - Yes.  
 - Yes.

285
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:19,513
Isn't 0.25t equal to...

286
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:21,640
T equals 0.25.

287
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,273
- Here, let me repeat it again. 
 - Sure. I didn't get it either.

288
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:27,423
Please repeat.

289
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:29,333
Look at the small ball first.

290
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:34,733
When the small ball moves in the fourth quadrant, "T" is equal to 0.25.

291
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,560
 Song Cong is a good tutor. 

292
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,893
Yeah, I'll let you know 
    

293
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:40,473
once we set a time for the next tutorial.

294
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:44,193
Be careful on your way home. Message me when you get home.

295
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:45,803
Sure.

296
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:51,923
Huan Er, I'm leaving now. You don't need to see me off.

297
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,153
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

298
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:54,603
Bye.

299
00:18:58,713 --> 00:19:01,433
I told you not to stop at the entrance.

300
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:11,503
 Actually, Qi Qi didn't walk to school. 

301
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:14,860
 She doesn't want attention. 

302
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,923
 She doesn't want people to think she's superior. 

303
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,663
Stop. Stop here.

304
00:19:24,743 --> 00:19:26,643
 She's just like me. 

305
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,123
 No. 

306
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:31,593
 She's even more eager to fit in than I am. 

307
00:19:31,593 --> 00:19:34,233
   

308
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:38,023
- Here, take this. 
 - Thank you.

309
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,323
The red bean ones will take a bit longer.

310
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:42,133
That many?

311
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,240
Why don't we share it?

312
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,503
I'll take this one.

313
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:48,720
- Is it hot? Can you give us a plastic bag? 
 - Sure.

314
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,293
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

315
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:51,923
I'll help you.

316
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,770
By the way, Qi Qi, is your car coming soon?

317
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,373
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about you.

318
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:11,873
It's okay. I told them that the teacher is ending class late today.

319
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:21,480
Huan Er, I envy your family housing compound.

320
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,850
You can go to and from school with friends and have a good relationship with your parents.

321
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,870
Me?

322
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,103
You must be lonely then.

323
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:41,713
I went to private school since I was a child.

324
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:43,643
It was a boarding school.

325
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:48,363
My parents often traveled back then, so I kept transferring schools.

326
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:53,903
After a long time, I gradually got used to being alone.

327
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,943
I get it.

328
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:01,533
My parents are often not home, too.

329
00:21:01,533 --> 00:21:03,813
I'm always alone.

330
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:12,413
This taro cake tastes better when shared.

331
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:15,503
That's not a problem. We'll come here often.

332
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:17,503
Boss, remember the two of us.

333
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:20,473
Don't worry. I'll remember you.

334
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:27,683
I got to go.

335
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,833
Boss, can you hurry up? Her ride will be here soon.

336
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,083
- All right, I'll hurry. 
 - Thank you.

337
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,703
This is for you.

338
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:36,563
What's this?

339
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,593
Didn't you say last time that my hair smelled good?

340
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:43,033
I can't take this.

341
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,693
- It's fine. Take it. 
 - I really can't take it.

342
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:46,700
- Take it. I have a lot at home. 
 - Qi Qi, it's too expensive.

343
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,083
Take it!

344
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,433
I'm leaving.

345
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,933
But...

346
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:43,200
   

347
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,560
 He didn't go home after school. 

348
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:50,033
 Mom! 

349
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,253
My darling is back.

350
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:56,433
Mom.

351
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:58,880
- Look. 
 - Why are you behaving like a little magpie?

352
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,721
- Mom. 
 - What's the matter?

353
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:02,060
Smell this shampoo. Does it smell good?

354
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,023
- It's good. 
 - My desk mate gave it to me.

355
00:23:04,023 --> 00:23:06,713
Really? You made new friends so quickly.

356
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:10,663
My desk mate is called Qi Qi. She's nice.

357
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:12,853
We have oranges.

358
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,473
She likes oranges, too.

359
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:17,883
Mom, can I take some for Qi Qi?

360
00:23:17,883 --> 00:23:20,813
Sure, I'll buy more for you later.

361
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,673
By the way, tomorrow you're coming with me to Li Tian's house for dinner.

362
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:26,533
Li Tian got first place on the exam.

363
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,473
His mom is hosting a banquet.

364
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,133
She invited us.

365
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:36,083
I didn't do well on the exam. Would it be awkward for me to go?

366
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,923
What's awkward about that?

367
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:41,083
When you do well on your exam, I'll host a party too.

368
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:46,163
Besides, you'll have a chance to talk to a top student if you go.

369
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:48,433
- Right? 
 - Do I have to talk to him?

370
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:51,563
Wouldn't that be more awkward?

371
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,713
We live in the same compound. We can't avoid seeing each other.

372
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:56,273
Just go through it.

373
00:23:56,273 --> 00:23:58,603
It's called socializing.

374
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,173
Did you wash your hands before helping me with the vegetables?

375
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:04,153
I'll wash them now.

376
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:06,133
You little...

377
00:24:07,643 --> 00:24:09,803
 Here, food is served. 

378
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:11,123
 - Taste it. 
 - It's too much. 

379
00:24:11,123 --> 00:24:12,803
- This dish is so good. 
 - It's delicious.

380
00:24:12,803 --> 00:24:15,520
Take these away later.

381
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,200
Dr. Li said we need to give everyone some gifts.

382
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,753
That's what the head of the hospital should do.

383
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,193
Thanks, Dr. Li.

384
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:27,713
If it weren't for him, my family wouldn't have been able to move in here.

385
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:28,880
It's his duty.

386
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,309
It's nothing. As long as you don't mind that your home is a little old.

387
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,173
I don't mind it.

388
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,363
Li Na.

389
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:35,993
The building you live in is part of Phase 1.

390
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:38,920
It's older than Dr. Li's and the Songs' buildings, which are in Phase 2.

391
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,163
But the people living in our compound are all old hospital department heads.

392
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:44,803
So you don't need to go to the hospital if you have a headache.

393
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:48,603
Just knock on your neighbor's door, and you'll get it treated.

394
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,603
Yeah.

395
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:54,800
But most importantly, Phase 1 has good feng shui.

396
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,323
We all live in the family housing compound, but most of Phase 1's children have good grades.

397
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:01,323
Really?

398
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:04,923
The kid who used to live in your unit just got admitted to Yenching University.

399
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:07,373
Really?

400
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:10,053
But there are also exceptions.

401
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,210
By the way, we've been eating for a long time. Why hasn't Dr. Li come back yet?

402
00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:27,883
The fathers in our compound are all the same.

403
00:25:27,883 --> 00:25:30,323
They usually don't bother with the children's studies.

404
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:32,923
They won't even come for a meal.

405
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:35,373
But Dr. Li is really busy.

406
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:38,673
He has to take care of all the big and small matters in the hospital.

407
00:25:38,673 --> 00:25:42,603
- Yeah. 
 - I've said before that he could just be

408
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:44,823
the head of the orthopedics department like Dr. Song.

409
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:46,803
He'll be free.

410
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:50,403
How is he free? He's having an operation right now.

411
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:54,563
Where are Song Cong and Xi Chi?

412
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:57,163
Xi Chi will be late.

413
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:58,773
His class teacher is very responsible.

414
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:00,673
He even asked him to take extra lessons on weekends.

415
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:01,803
That's good.

416
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:03,933
 Extra lessons? 

417
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:05,263
 He didn't go to extra classes. 

418
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,403
   

419
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:11,653
I already said that learning is the right way.

420
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,563
After all, sports training is hard.

421
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:14,883
Football, right?

422
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:17,673
How many people succeed in the end?

423
00:26:17,673 --> 00:26:19,803
Xi Chi almost entered a sports school.

424
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:22,173
He's also the captain of the school team, right?

425
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:23,513
He's capable.

426
00:26:23,513 --> 00:26:25,403
That's right.

427
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,163
What about Song Cong? I wanted to ask him to share his learning experience with Tian.

428
00:26:32,163 --> 00:26:33,403
He's taking TOEFL classes. 
  (T/N: Test of English as a Foreign Language) 

429
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:34,983
Started this summer.

430
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:37,400
After all, we agreed beforehand

431
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,853
that he'd only apply to the top five universities in the world.

432
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:41,823
Amazing.

433
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:44,753
I'm full, so I'll go back to my room.

434
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:54,240
Mom. I'm full too. I want to go home.

435
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,923
Share your learning experience with Tian.

436
00:26:57,923 --> 00:26:59,380
- Go. 
 - I shouldn't...

437
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,358
Go.

438
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:01,813
Go.

439
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:02,803
Go talk to him.

440
00:27:02,803 --> 00:27:04,923
Aunt Li, I'll go find Tian.

441
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,160
I didn't expect your daughter to be so amazing.

442
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,595
I heard someone say that she won some award.

443
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,333
Military combat training.

444
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:15,360
Isn't his father a martial arts coach?

445
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,216
But don't be scared.

446
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:19,923
Huan Er never bullies the weak.

447
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:22,713
Really. She won't beat up Tian.

448
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:25,703
Eat some food.

449
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:28,233
Eat.

450
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,500
Do you read books entirely in English?

451
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,710
Amazing.

452
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,540
If you want to read, grab a book yourself.

453
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,240
If you have questions, find Song Cong.

454
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,260
If you want to make friends, find Jing Xi Chi.

455
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,710
I know you don't like me.

456
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,340
You don't have to worry about what my mom said.

457
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,100
Everyone will leave after starting university.

458
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,680
There's no need to make friends and go through this process.

459
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,430
   

460
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,440
You want to go abroad, too?

461
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Song Cong is also going abroad.

462
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,070
You've already decided your path during your first year?

463
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,120
I made up my mind first.

464
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,820
Besides, students who enter Tianhe High School

465
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,020
have already decided what they want to do in the future.

466
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,033
Do you think they're all the same as you? If you're curious, ask Song Cong.

467
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,020
 - Hello, Aunt Li. 
 - Song Cong's here. 

468
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,060
 I'm here to find Huan Er. 

469
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,760
- Huan Er. 
 - Song Cong.

470
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,945
Didn't we plan to study together this afternoon?

471
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:47,440
Yes.

472
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,370
Well, let's talk again someday. Bye.

473
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,573
Aunt, I've eaten. I'll go tutor her first.

474
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:55,880
- We're leaving, Aunt Li. 
 - Sure.

475
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,540
   

476
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,760
 The problems you're looking at now are some of the more basic ones we've learned. 

477
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Just apply the formula and solve them.

478
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,370
But you have to memorize the formula.

479
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,950
If you really can't remember, just look at the formula notes I compiled for you.

480
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,990
Okay.

481
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,260
Try solving it first.

482
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,740
 Why did you skip your piano lesson today? 

483
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,400
 I went to my classmate's house. 

484
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,780
 I always reminded you not to associate with bad students. 

485
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:45,320
 If you don't do well on this exam, I will change your tutor until you improve. 

486
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,400
Just so you know, I won't be able to come for tutoring anymore.

487
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,500
My mom is looking for a tutor for me.

488
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,910
Qi Qi, this is just your second time here.

489
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,560
My... My mom is a little weird.

490
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,545
She previously wanted me to go to an international class, too.

491
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:15,850
I asked her why, and she said it's because it's expensive.

492
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,230
Maybe she thinks it's only good if you spend money.

493
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,165
It's normal for her to have such ideas.

494
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:30,680
International class is good. You'll get good teachers, and you can study abroad.

495
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,760
Why is everyone going abroad?

496
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,662
I saw Li Tian this morning.

497
00:30:35,662 --> 00:30:38,230
He also wants to take TOEFL and go abroad.

498
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,880
Li Tian's imitating Cong.

499
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,390
He failed the admission test for international class. He's upset.

500
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,290
So, you all already know what you're going to do after graduation?

501
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,870
I...

502
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,600
I want to be a writer.

503
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,960
I want my children to see that the entire passage was written by their mom

504
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,400
during a reading comprehension test.

505
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,640
That's a really vicious idea.

506
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,520
What about Song Cong?

507
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
What do you want to do?

508
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,360
I haven't thought about it yet.

509
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,040
Maybe I'll just do whatever I can.

510
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,540
Look, you're doing it again.

511
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,740
Why are you being humble?

512
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,000
Aunt Hao already planned it for him.

513
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,058
What plan?

514
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,981
He's going abroad. Is there any need to say more?

515
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:39,640
From participating in competitions and winning awards to applying to prestigious schools.

516
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,920
He's different from us. He's going to do great things.

517
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:46,820
It sounds so tiring.

518
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,640
Will such a planned life make you happy?

519
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,360
No, I mean...

520
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,999
When I was young, my grandpa took me to the mountains to dig herbs.

521
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:07,050
He told me the most amazing thing about plants is that they have no heart.

522
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:12,440
Because they have no feelings or emotions, they survive only by natural instincts.

523
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,390
But humans are different.

524
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,870
Don't people live to be happy?

525
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,770
Don't say so much. What is he unhappy about?

526
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,020
He's a top student.

527
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,420
Why are you so proud of that?

528
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,440
Aren't you jealous?

529
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,850
Jealous of what? I'm not Li Tian.

530
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,570
Besides, do you think I'm just anyone?

531
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,260
If you want to see me in the future,

532
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,320
you have to make an appointment with my club, Real Madrid, six months in advance.

533
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,157
All right, hurry up, or we won't be able to finish this.

534
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:47,100
You don't believe me?

535
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,390
I believe you.

536
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,780
- Really? 
 - Really.

537
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,630
Then say you believe me.

538
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,820
I, Chen Huan Er, believe Jing Xi Chi will become a professional player

539
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,320
for Real Madrid in the future.

540
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,940
- You believe me? 
 - I do.

541
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,750
It's good, because if you didn't...

542
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,190
I have piano lessons, so I have to go.

543
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,630
- Jing Xi Chi, you don't need to see me off. 
 - I'm not.

544
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,320
I'm going there, too.

545
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,880
- You want to learn musical instruments as well? 
 - No.

546
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,890
I'm going to play football. The football field is over there.

547
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,780
Sure.

548
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,447
Qi Qi, what do you think of what I just said?

549
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:39,530
What is it?

550
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,330
The one about me going to Real Madrid.

551
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,100
You don't believe me?

552
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,600
I happen to have a game next week.

553
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,430
Come have a look if you have time.

554
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,130
I think I'll skip it. I don't know much about these.

555
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,120
It's good that you have a hobby, but our main duty is to study.

556
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,320
We still have to get good grades.

557
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,743
I'm leaving. You don't have to walk with me. Bye.

558
00:33:59,743 --> 00:34:02,560
Come have a look if you have time.

559
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,395
 Song Cong and Jing Xi Chi... 

560
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,770
 One can't tell others his dream. 

561
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:16,210
 The other one shared it but was dismissed as a childish fantasy. 

562
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,210
 I don't know which is more frustrating. 

563
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,080
 But I still envy them. 

564
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,560
 At least they have goals. 

565
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,650
 I don't even know where to go. 

566
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,080
 I even used something as trivial as untied shoelaces as an excuse to just stand still. 

567
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,620
Mom, how come you're back so soon?

568
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,440
Why didn't you chat with Li Tian's mom longer?

569
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,958
Isn't the position that Dad is aiming for this time quite important?

570
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,180
Let your dad worry about it himself.

571
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,370
If I stay any longer, I'll flip the table.

572
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,174
You didn't see Li Tian's mom.

573
00:35:00,174 --> 00:35:03,083
When I told her you were taking TOEFL classes, her face turned green with envy.

574
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:05,790
She's just jealous.

575
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,200
I think you're a little too sensitive.

576
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,830
I'm sensitive?

577
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,120
Do you know how many years they've been talking about my low education level?

578
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,220
What happened in the end? I still raised a child who's a top student.

579
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:27,320
I also told them my son would only apply to the top five universities in the world.

580
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,830
Here. Have some walnuts.

581
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,830
I have to thank you. You really make our family proud.

582
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,770
Mom, these walnuts were given to you. Eat them yourself.

583
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,370
You usually work so hard.

584
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,660
I'm not eating. You can eat them.

585
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,370
You're my only child.

586
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,520
You're our family's only hope.

587
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,750
Eat more to supplement yourself.

588
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,513
I'll continue studying, Mom.

589
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:57,650
Take these.

590
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,670
Finish them. Here.

591
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,000
 Will such a planned life make you happy? 

592
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,750
- You're home. 
 - Mom, I'm home.

593
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,920
Mom.

594
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,290
Did you get a promotion or a pay raise? You spent so much money.

595
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,370
That's why I said you're dumb. You don't notice anything.

596
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,670
Look who's back.

597
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,060
Dad! Dad!

598
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,550
My girl!

599
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,250
I missed you so much.

600
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,920
Dad, what's going on?

601
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,800
You betrayed me. You didn't tell me in advance.

602
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,300
I wanted to surprise you.

603
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,570
Here, let me see if you've grown stronger.

604
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,920
Good job. You kid...

605
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Grappling hand?

606
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,820
How many times have I told you not to hurt her?

607
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,620
You think I'll hurt her? She'll hurt me.

608
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,440
Good job. I can tell you've been practicing a lot lately.

609
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,720
But you guessed wrong.

610
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,605
I've been so busy with my studies lately that I don't have time to practice.

611
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:41,200
How can you be so proficient without any practice? Good job.

612
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,545
There's so much meat, Mom.

613
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:44,380
You've worked hard.

614
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,677
Dad, don't you know?

615
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:48,100
Mom rarely cooks this for me when you're not around.

616
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,782
How dare you complain?

617
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:52,380
Look at this seafood. This shrimp. I didn't even get this meat.

618
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,470
Eat more.

619
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,609
Eat more.

620
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:57,359
I abused you.

621
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,189
No. No.

622
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:02,439
Come on. Hurry.

623
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,799
The air today is really...

624
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:11,149
Dad. Did you just fart?

625
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:12,880
Mom, he farted.

626
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,529
- That smell is from your mom! 
 - Cut it out.

627
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:16,959
You ate too much corn.

628
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:23,449
Dad, since you're also here, what do you want me to do in the future?

629
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:27,500
Jing Xi Chi and Song Cong's families already have plans for them.

630
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,019
I'm sure you have one for me, too, right?

631
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:32,049
 No. 

632
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,203
Huan Er, actually, you can do anything you want.

633
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:39,499
- It's fine if you don't do anything. 
 - That's right.

634
00:38:39,499 --> 00:38:41,080
How can that work?

635
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,549
Dad, Mom, let me tell you.

636
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:47,149
Our classmates are all ambitious and have goals.

637
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:51,520
Although we come from a small place, we must also have ambitions.

638
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,320
Right?

639
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:55,579
Ambitions?

640
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:00,699
- Huan Er. 
 - Dad.

641
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:04,279
Actually, you have plenty of time to think.

642
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:06,499
- Yes. 
 - There's no rush.

643
00:39:06,499 --> 00:39:08,559
Take your time. Take one step at a time.

644
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,379
- That's right. 
 - I get it, Mom.

645
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:12,839
Aren't you talking about the tortoise and the hare?

646
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,089
I'm the tortoise.

647
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:16,009
I'll win in the end, right?

648
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:17,499
Girlie.

649
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:19,399
- Life is not a competition. 
 - Yes.

650
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,269
Why do you have to win or lose?

651
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:23,109
It's okay if we don't win, right?

652
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:24,149
Yes.

653
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:27,459
- We just hope you're healthy. 
 - Yes.

654
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,460
Health and happiness are the most important.

655
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,399
That's right.

656
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,799
Dad, Mom, actually—

657
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:35,399
Enough talking. You don't get it.

658
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,939
Children nowadays are so tired.

659
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:40,069
- Yeah. 
 - Why must there be a win or lose?

660
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:41,759
It's not like how it used to be for us.

661
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,399
You know, it used to be easy.

662
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:47,029
Dad, Mom, your child's right here.

663
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,919
If you can kick this bottle with every kick, you'll be close to being a professional.

664
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:01,049
Come on.

665
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:10,899
You're not even close.

666
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:11,799
Again.

667
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:13,109
It's fine.

668
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:14,520
It's only my first kick.

669
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,019
If I kick a thousand times, I'll definitely hit it.

670
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:23,159
Again.

671
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,440
That's enough from you.

672
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,489
You're such a lousy player, yet you want to play professionally.

673
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:29,609
Just treat it as a hobby.

674
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:30,879
No, Dad. Let me try again.

675
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:31,800
I'll give it another try.

676
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,090
Listen. Use your thigh to bring out your calf.

677
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,357
This is where you exert force.

678
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:36,917
Let me try.

679
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,020
♫  Wild roses in my hand  ♫

680
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,459
Mr. Fu. I want to change classes.

681
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,820
I wondered why you were deliberately 20 minutes late for the competition.

682
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,009
So it was to lay the groundwork?

683
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:55,399
There was a traffic jam that day.

684
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:58,880
And I won a place in the competition.

685
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,939
I just hope you can agree to let me change classes.

686
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:03,619
Why do you have to change classes?

687
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:07,589
I've made up my mind.

688
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:09,579
I hope you'll agree.

689
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

690
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:16,649
This kid...

691
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:31,640


692
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,840
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

693
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:43,007
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

694
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:49,961
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

695
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:56,291
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

696
00:41:56,291 --> 00:42:02,681
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

697
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:10,491
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

698
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:17,321
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

699
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:23,901
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

700
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:30,601
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

701
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:34,561
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

702
00:42:34,561 --> 00:42:39,781
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

703
00:42:39,781 --> 00:42:44,401
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

704
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:47,861
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

705
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:53,331
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

706
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:58,221
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

707
00:42:58,221 --> 00:43:02,021
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

708
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:07,061
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

709
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:10,951
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

710
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:15,291
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

711
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:18,701
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

712
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:24,781
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

713
00:43:24,781 --> 00:43:30,281
♫  At the right time  ♫
