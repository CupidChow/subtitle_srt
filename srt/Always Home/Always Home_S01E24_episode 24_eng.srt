 â™«  Why not find a day to meet  â™«

â™«  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  â™«

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
â™«  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  â™«

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,820
â™«  Because of you, I have become a little braver  â™«

15
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,280
   
   

17
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,370
Dad, you're still up?

18
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,290
I was sorting out your mom's medication.

19
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,180
- Is Mom asleep? 
 - Yeah, she's asleep.

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:19,800
Huan Er, I've decided to retreat to the back line.

21
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,790
I won't be going anywhere anymore.

22
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,920
I'll stay in Tianhe, do some grocery shopping, cook some meals, be a stay-at-home husband,

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,240
and spend time with you and your mom.

24
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,760
Do you know what the happiest thing in life is?

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,800
What?

26
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,608
A false alarm.

27
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,990
I think your mom's illness is most likely caused by me stressing her out.

28
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,580
How could that be?

29
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,970
Back then, I was always busy making money, and your mom handled everything at home.

30
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,590
Sometimes, I even made her angry, and added to her troubles.

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,140
Do you know?

32
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,520
She talked about divorcing me quite a few times,

33
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,020
but in the end, she couldn't go through with it because she's softhearted.

34
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,210
Now that I think about it, I really owe her a lot.

35
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,920
When we got married, there was no proposal, no romance, nothing at all.

36
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,230
We just muddled through the wedding, and then we had you.

37
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,450
At the time, I thought, there's plenty of time.

38
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,250
So, I'll make it up to her later.

39
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,270
But now, looking back,

40
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,596
half a lifetime has passed.

41
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,140
How time flies!

42
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,130
Why are we here?

43
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,250
I want to help my dad to buy a diamond ring for my mom.

44
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,464
Consider it making up for the wedding gift when they were young.

45
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,800
Did you bring enough money?

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,560
I still have my scholarship from last semester.

47
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,110
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands...

48
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:48,090
Wait, why is a tiny rock so expensive?

49
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Huan Er, how much money do you have?

50
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,820
Not much.

51
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,080
How much exactly?

52
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,210
3,000.

53
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,260
Can I try this one?

54
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,110
Sure.

55
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,620
You have great taste, Miss.

56
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,420
This is our store's latest design.

57
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,230
The price is 94,800 yuan.

58
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,780
This is pretty nice. I'll take this one.

59
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,092
- Okay, I'll use a credit card. 
 - Okay, please come over here.

60
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:33,512
It's not that nice.

61
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:35,470
Let's look around a bit more.

62
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,060
94,800...

63
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,810
And she didn't even blink before buying it.

64
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,690
Maybe for her, it's just like buying a couple of expensive outfits.

65
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,940
Jing Xi Chi, how many cups of milk tea can 90,000 yuan buy?

66
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,860
90,000...

67
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,800
If we assume 10 yuan per cup, that is 9,000 cups.

68
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,840
If you drink one a day, you could drink it for 24 years.

69
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,010
24 years...

70
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,330
What would you like to drink?

71
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:15,610
Just three glasses of water for now, thanks.

72
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,350
All right.

73
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,428
I was too naive.

74
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:24,876
I thought by gathering all my New Year's money from the past few years,

75
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:27,300
I could get that ring.

76
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,644
But, it turns out that I can't even afford the display stand.

77
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:38,590
It seems that the power of adults in this world has nothing to do with the grades in school.

78
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,180
Qi Qi invited me to dinner.

79
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,940
I'll get going now.

80
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,719
- Bye. 
 - By the way...

81
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:53,144
Happy Valentine's Day to you two.

82
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,230
Thank you.

83
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,240
- Thank you. 
 - Happy Valentine's Day.

84
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,740
Guess who I am.

85
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,500
Stop it.

86
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,300
Happy Valentine's Day.

87
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,330
Happy Valentine's Day.

88
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,180
I got you a present.

89
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,960
What is it?

90
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,590
I made it myself.

91
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,910
It's beautiful!

92
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,260
Do you want to try it on?

93
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,710
Yeah.

94
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,380
- I can't find it. 
 - Here.

95
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,500
Pretty?

96
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,790
Yes.

97
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,350
I'll wear the other one.

98
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,740
- Is it done? 
 - Yeah.

99
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,540
Thank you.

100
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,390
I got you something too.

101
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,701
This is...

102
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,470
Check it out when you get home.

103
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,890
I also made plans with some friends for dinner. Let's go or weâ€™ll be late.

104
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,856
- All right. 
 - Let's go.

105
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,768
- Are you hungry? 
 - I'm okay.

106
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:36,340
- What about you? 
 - I'm okay too.

107
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,740
Qi Qi, you are finally here!

108
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,110
Long time no see.

109
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,050
Wen Wen.

110
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,830
Song Cong, this is Wen Wen.

111
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,380
And, that's Da Zhao.

112
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,330
Nice to meet you.

113
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,710
I heard you're studying medicine at Yenching University.

114
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,960
Respect.

115
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,480
If you open a private clinic abroad, you'll make good money.

116
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,743
Public hospitals in China are great too.

117
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:02,760
You can only earn a little in a public hospital here.

118
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,990
What are you saying?

119
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,540
Let's sit.

120
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,170
Let's sit.

121
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,540
I know you like this.

122
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,500
I saw it at a boutique overseas.

123
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,710
What is it?

124
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,110
Take a look.

125
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,990
That's exactly the one!

126
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,900
How did you know I like it?

127
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,260
It's gorgeous.

128
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,240
Put it on now.

129
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,850
Looks good.

130
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,950
Put this one on too.

131
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,760
Waiter, we'd like to order.

132
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,970
Song Cong, over the years, many people pursued Qi Qi, but she never agreed to anyone.

133
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,160
- He'll pay the bill. 
 - You managed to win her over.

134
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,230
No matter what, you have to treat us to this meal today.

135
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,440
Aren't you embarrassed?

136
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,560
You invited them to eat, and now you're making them pay?

137
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,877
- Pay the bill. 
 - It's my first time meeting everyone,

138
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:23,323
so I should treat you.

139
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,010
I'll pay the bill.

140
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,350
- Cash or card? 
 - Cash.

141
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,590
All right, here's your bill.

142
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,110
I'll use my card.

143
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,430
Okay, one moment, please.

144
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,740
Where are you guys heading afterward?

146
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,430
We've got something to do later, so we won't be joining you.

147
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,190
- Oh, come on. 
 - What a killjoy you are!

148
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,800
I hardly come back here, yet you prioritize your boyfriend over me.

149
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,938
Nothing I can do about it.

150
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,310
All right, let's go.

151
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:00,565
Let's grab something warm to drink.

152
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,490
Hello.

153
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,990
- Hey! 
 - It's you!

154
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,310
- You still remember me? 
 - Of course!

155
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,500
We're selling our cakes by the slice now.

156
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,430
Do you want to try some?

157
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,830
No, thanks. Just two hot chocolates, please.

158
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,400
- Sure. 
 - Thanks.

159
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,590
What's up? Why are you so serious?

160
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,430
Nothing.

161
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,020
I'm just thinking that back in school,

162
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,500
we were taught that if we study hard, and get into a good university,

163
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,330
we'll definitely have a good life.

164
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,190
But now, it doesn't seem that simple.

165
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,830
Maybe the school just protected us too well.

166
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:56,370
Hold on. Are you just making excuses to avoid studying?

167
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,860
Aunt Lin told me specifically to keep an eye on you.

168
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,740
If you dare skip class, she won't let you off the hook!

169
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,133
- You're so evil! 
 - Here's your hot chocolate.

170
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:06,990
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks.

171
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,977
Happy Valentine's Day.

172
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,960
- Wait. 
 - Thank you.

173
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,360
I'm telling you, you better be kinder.

174
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,610
Otherwise, every year on this day, you'll be celebrating alone.

175
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,200
I won't spend it with you.

176
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,977
What do you mean you won't spend it with me?

177
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:21,610
Obviously, I'm the one spending it with you, okay?

178
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,710
Aren't you alone too?

179
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,070
Since we're both alone...

180
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,020
Why...

181
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,780
Don't we...

182
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,160
Just go to McDonald's?

183
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,080
They have a buy-one-get-one ice cream deal for today.

184
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,980
It's your treat.

185
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:43,960
- Hey, you haven't paid for your hot chocolate. 
 - Oh, right!

186
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,004
- How much? 
 - Twenty.

187
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:47,555
Is there a Valentine's Day discount?

188
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,155
No.

189
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,740
- Hao! 
 - Hao!

190
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,020
Why did you come here alone?

191
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,520
I mainly came to drop off some documents for you.

192
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,110
Your recovery seems to be going well.

193
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,740
Yeah, pretty good.

194
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,520
Let me take a look...

195
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,360
You haven't reached retirement age yet.

196
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,880
But, it's a work-related injury.

197
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,460
The hospital said I can take early retirement.

198
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,200
All right, let me check the documents...

199
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:22,660
   

200
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,400
Why hasn't the finance department signed it?

201
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,470
Finance said HR can sign first.

202
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,470
That's not allowed.

203
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,495
They have to sign it first before we can process it.

204
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:31,400
Finance said HR could sign first.

205
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,230
But, Director Zhang is out on a business trip.

206
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,160
He said he'll be back in two days, then he'll sign for me.

207
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,645
Then, you can wait two more days.

208
00:13:36,645 --> 00:13:39,140
Once they sign it, you can come again.

209
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,380
It's just that... I'm not very mobile right now.

210
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,710
How about this? I'll leave it with you for now.

211
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,710
Once Director Zhang returns, could you help get it signed and stamped for me?

212
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,280
Then, I'll come pick it up. Would that be okay?

213
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,500
Definitely not. Look at my place. How messy it is!

214
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,230
If I lose it, I can't take responsibility.

215
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,830
Zhou, we've known each other for years.

216
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,331
It's just a small favor, and this doesn't break any rules.

217
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:05,240
I've got all the documents ready.

218
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,737
This isn't standard procedure.

219
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:08,977
It's hard for me to do.

220
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,190
Yan! What brings you here?

221
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,830
You could have just called, and I would have come to you.

222
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,310
This early retirement was personally approved by the director.

223
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,500
Now, you check if it can be processed now.

224
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,350
All right.

225
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,950
Here you go, take it.

226
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,510
Thank you.

227
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:39,422
   

228
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,760
Be careful.

229
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,050
I'm fine.

230
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,640
- You're back. 
 - Mom.

231
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,620
What are you holding?

232
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,722
This is a Valentine's Day gift from Qi Qi.

233
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:09,257
It looks nice.

234
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:12,190
Wash your hands first. Dinner is ready.

235
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
It looks expensive.

236
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,820
What did you get for Qi Qi?

237
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,800
I gave her a pair of earrings. I made them myself.

238
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,360
You can make earrings?

239
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,280
I think you should have bought her a standard gift.

240
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,420
Later, you check how much this costs

241
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,623
and buy something of a similar price, 
    

242
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,140
so we don't look lowâ€‘class.

243
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,850
Did you hear me?

244
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,620
All right.

245
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,430
Hurry up and eat.

246
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,044
Mom.

247
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,900
Did you go to handle your retirement today?

248
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:04,222
Yeah, it's done.

249
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,590
Didn't you want to continue...

250
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,066
Forget it. I don't want to push myself anymore.

251
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,510
Is Qi Qi's family very wealthy?

252
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,820
What does her mom do?

253
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,377
Her mom owns a law firm.

254
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,430
That's much better than our family's situation.

255
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,580
Does her mom know about your relationship?

256
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,880
Qi Qi hasn't had the chance to tell her yet.

257
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,540
Does Qi Qi mind my current situation?

258
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,260
I know you young people don't like hearing about "matching social status,"

259
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,740
but given our circumstances, does it put a lot of pressure on you?

260
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,630
Mom, what are you talking about?

261
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,330
- All right. I won't say anything. 
 - Can you stop bringing this up again?

262
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,950
Fine, fine. Let's eat. Let's eat.

263
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,860
   

264
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,555
Huan Er, you've been wearing this shirt for so long. I'll bring it for washing.

265
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,530
Huan Er, I want to talk to you about something.

266
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,300
What's up, Dad?

267
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,500
I know that university life is full of temptations,

268
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,920
but academics should always come first.

269
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,330
Right?

270
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,520
I was young once too and I know young people are always impulsive,

271
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,337
acting without thinking things through.

272
00:18:55,337 --> 00:19:00,210
But, I have to remind you, don't get confused by your emotions.

273
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,660
Don't make rash decisions without careful thought.

274
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,500
Who's confused by emotions?

275
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,330
Hold on, Dad.

276
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,210
What exactly are you trying to say?

277
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,080
Do you have a boyfriend?

278
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,630
I don't have a boyfriend!

279
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,280
- Stop making things up! 
 - I really don't have a boyfriend!

280
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,910
Look at this. What's going on? You're still in school, yet you're looking at diamond rings?

281
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,050
No, Dad.

282
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,408
I was planning to buy you a diamond ring.

283
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:28,830
Buy me a diamond ring?

284
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,460
What?

285
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,520
Didn't you once tell me that Mom didn't get a diamond ring when you two got married?

286
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,980
And, you feel regret.

287
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,740
So, I thought I'd buy one for you to make Mom happy.

288
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,390
   

289
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,350
Dad, what do you think?

290
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,980
It's unnecessary.

291
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,220
This is an adult matter.

292
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,740
You little kid just stay out of it.

293
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,400
You should prioritize your studies.

294
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,930
Stop thinking about buying diamond rings. Go study in your room.

295
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,550
I wasn't meddling!

296
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,070
Mom has always said she wanted a diamond ring.

297
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,875
Do you have money for buying a diamond ring?

298
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,750
I have no money.

299
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,200
Did you want to see me?

300
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,020
What's up? Missing me already?

301
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,710
I came to return this to you.

302
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,910
I checked the price, and it's too expensive.

303
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,310
I can't accept it.

304
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,150
It's just a gift.

305
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,710
Moreover, didn't you also give me earrings?

306
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,480
The price is just a number.

307
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,640
What matters is the thought.

308
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,821
Price is price.

309
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:53,542
Thoughtfulness is thoughtfulness.

310
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:57,120
I appreciate your gesture, but I really can't accept this.

311
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,600
Do you have to be like this?

312
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,680
Fine. You won't accept it, right?

313
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,808
- Then, I'll just throw it away. 
 - Qi Qi!

314
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,810
Stop messing around, okay?

315
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,280
Then, just accept it this time.

316
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,550
I promise I won't give this to you again next time.

317
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,260
Okay?

318
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,508
All right.

319
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:24,350
Let's order some drinks then.

320
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,700
Waiter, we'd like to order.

321
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,864
Don't stay up too late. Go to sleep.

322
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,630
Take a shower and go to bed.

323
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,140
Mom! Keep your voice down, you scared me.

324
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,720
I have to go shower and sleep. I know.

325
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,931
You're going back to university tomorrow and you're still playing. Go to bed early.

326
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,400
   

327
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,498
   

328
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:18,080
   

329
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,700
Hello, where is Mr. Jiang's office?

330
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,380
Thank you.

331
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,730
Please come in.

332
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,667
Hello. I'm...

333
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,150
You're Jing Xi Chi, right?

334
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,490
Yes.

335
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,740
I'm Jiang Sen, head of Huan Dao Technology in Wuan Branch.

336
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,231
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Have a seat.

337
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,310
I heard you're still in university.

338
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,740
Yes, I'm a freshman.

339
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,360
A freshman?

340
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,220
That's impressive.

341
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,700
Your second-hand book trading website has great potential, and a decent user base.

342
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,790
However, your platform has been operating as a non-profit.

343
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,253
If you upgrade it, the future possibilities are limitless.

344
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:15,790
- Thank you. 
 - All right. I'll get straight to the point.

345
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,220
I have two proposals for you.

346
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,400
First, we create an identical platform.

347
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,585
With Huan Dao's team and technology, we can launch quickly.

348
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:26,420
But when that happens, we'll be competitors.

349
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,240
Second, we provide you with funding and technical support,

350
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,831
and you continue running the platform.

351
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:36,840
You'll receive dividends later on, and if it does well, it could be quite lucrative.

352
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,980
So, you mean...

353
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,460
What I mean is that, while your team is still inexperienced in terms of technical part,

354
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,970
Huan Dao values your potential.

355
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,560
All right. I'll think about it.

356
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,242
Sure. I'll wait for your response.

357
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,964
- See you. 
 - All right.

358
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,822
Hello?

359
00:24:13,822 --> 00:24:16,310
 Jing Xi Chi, are you free these next few days? 

360
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,177
I have my last final exam tonight.

361
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:19,800
After that, I'm free. Why?

362
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,560
 Let's head home together after finals. 

363
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,260
What happened?

364
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,550
 A semester passed quickly. 

365
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,110
 Mom has fully recovered. 

366
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,164
 It's time to make the surprise plan happen. 

367
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:35,420
Mom, let's go inside and pick out some clothes.

368
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,070
- Yeah. We don't even have a photo together. 
 - Let's go.

369
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,920
It's so pretty, Mom.

370
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,110
Come on, let's check inside.

371
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,740
Wow, it is beautiful!

372
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,740
Mom.

373
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,980
This is a bridal shop. Wearing this?

374
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,440
- Dad! 
 - It's not appropriate.

375
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,212
Why not?

376
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:53,630
Other people have wedding photos, but we don't.

377
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,070
When I think about it, I get jealous. Right?

378
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,342
Yeah, Mom. I've never seen you in a wedding dress!

379
00:24:58,342 --> 00:24:59,870
You must be very beautiful.

380
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,480
Our daughter is an adult now.

381
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,020
What's the wedding photo for?

382
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,870
- Mom, Mom! 
 - It's not a problem.

383
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,630
Besides, who says wedding dresses can only be worn at weddings?

384
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,751
- Exactly! 
 - If you're willing,

385
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:12,910
we can take a photo every year until Huan Er is as old as we are now.

386
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,660
We'll take them until we're 90.

387
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,740
Yeah! I agree with Dad!

388
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,980
Mom, when you're 90, Dad will be the most handsome old man in Tianhe!

389
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,220
And, you'll be the most stunning beauty!

390
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,740
Come on! Come on.

391
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,310
Wearing a wedding dress at 90 would be ridiculous.

392
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,150
- People will laugh at us. 
 - Stop messing around.

393
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,630
Just pick one. We're already here.

394
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,460
- This one looks nice. 
 - No. The neckline is practically down to the stomach.

395
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,910
What about this one?

396
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,220
- It's puffy. 
 - The back... No, no, no.

397
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,240
Dad, hurry up and pick one.

398
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,829
How about this one?

399
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:44,200
It even has a ribbon here.

400
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,600
- It's not nice? 
 - Too old-fashioned.

401
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,631
Fine. Let's see another one. There are so many styles...

402
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,497
Why don't you pick one yourself?

403
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:50,980
You choose, okay?

404
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,830
Choose from these.

405
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,310
I think these look pretty good.

406
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,070
This one looks great, Mom!

407
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,910
You'll look absolutely stunning in it.

408
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,070
See? My mom has such a great taste.

409
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,440
Isn't it beautiful?

410
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,200
It's so beautiful!

411
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,096
- Here she comes! 
 - I've never worn anything

412
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:20,460
like this in my life.

413
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,150
Snow White!

414
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,310
- Be careful. 
 - You guys...

415
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,800
- So beautiful! 
 - Why are you all here?

416
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,040
You see, wearing a wedding dress at this age is quite embarrassing.

417
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,740
- Mom! 
 - I tell you, you look stunning in this dress.

418
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,700
Just like twenty years ago.

419
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,910
- Come on! 
 - Why are you here too? Your leg...

420
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,740
It doesn't hinder me from joining in on the fun.

421
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,980
- Exactly. 
 - See what you have done.

422
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,630
You look amazing.

423
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,700
So handsome!

424
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,910
Since you're all here, let's do it together.

425
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,740
No, you two first.

426
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:51,497
You two stand in the center.

427
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:52,830
- Okay, here we go. 
 - Here.

428
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,930
Look over here.

429
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,800
Three, two, one.

430
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,097
- Okay? 
 - Great!

431
00:27:02,097 --> 00:27:03,630
Get a little closer. We'll take another one.

432
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,390
Take a photo of you holding her.

433
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,040
Wait a second.

434
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,560
What's wrong?

435
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,830
You know, I've always been a straightforward guy.

436
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,453
I don't know romance, and I don't know how to make people happy.

437
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,540
When you got sick, I felt really guilty.

438
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,573
I felt guilty for not taking good care of you.

439
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:45,400
In these past few days, I've been thinking about how I can do better,

440
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,840
and how I can be a good husband.

441
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,980
In the end, it was Huan Er who reminded me.

442
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,070
Even our kid could think of it, but I couldn't.

443
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:02,200
After all these years, we've stumbled our way to today.

444
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,440
And there's always been a regret in my heart.

445
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,810
I never properly proposed to you.

446
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,306
So today, in front of everyone,

447
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:22,364
I want to ask you the question I should've asked twenty years ago.

448
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,630
Li Na, will you marry me?

449
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,310
Yes, I do.

450
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,950
Don't cry.

451
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,740
Dad! Dad!

452
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,250
Put the ring on!

453
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,410
Oh, right! Put the ring on!

454
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,250
Here, here.

455
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,410
This is for you.

456
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,460
Purple roses.

457
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,550
So beautiful.

458
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:40,180
Purple roses mean eternal love.

459
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,220
Eternal love.

460
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,890
Mom.

461
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,805
Watching television?

462
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,504
Thank you.

463
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:27,920
Thank me for what?

464
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,240
Thank you for giving me everything you could.

465
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,630
So, don't ever think our family is any less than others.

466
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,386
In my eyes, you've always been the best mom in the world.

467
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,150
What's wrong with this kid?

468
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,150
Why are you grinning like that?

469
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,220
Why? Can't I smile now?

470
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,350
My dad just proposed to my mom.

471
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,110
I'm really happy!

472
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,740
Uncle Chen and Aunt Li Na's love is deeper than I imagined.

473
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,350
Yeah.

474
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,940
My mom doesn't care about material things.

475
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,660
She cares about two hearts that truly love each other.

476
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,460
But, this is such an important event. Why didn't you even tell me in advance?

477
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,970
- Only my dad and I knew. No one else did. 
 - Okay.

478
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,870
What's wrong? Are you upset?

479
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,886
- No. 
 - Don't be mad.

480
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,460
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

481
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,830
I'm not mad.

482
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,450
What's wrong?

483
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,180
What's that smell?

484
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,070
- What smell? 
 - Did you put on perfume?

485
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,600
No.

486
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,410
Are you wearing perfume?

487
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,040
â™«  A snack bar by the lake  â™«

488
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,300
I...

489
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:02,340
â™«  I stared straight at you  â™«

490
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,260
â™«  I wished that you would stay  â™«

491
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:13,260
â™«  I don't remember what I said  â™«

492
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,700
â™«  I treated you to a cake  â™«

493
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,700
â™«  And maybe ice cream  â™«

494
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:26,140
â™«  Like you're as sweet as it  â™«

495
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,980
â™«  Fantastic date  â™«

496
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:37,040
â™«  It happened in my fate  â™«

497
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,420
â™«  While you're counting to three  â™«

498
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,060
â™«  I'll tell you a tale  â™«

499
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:48,580
â™«  No matter how late  â™«

500
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,880
â™«  I haven't complained  â™«

501
00:34:52,880 --> 00:35:01,460
â™«  You used to cheat to win the game  â™«

502
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,720
 What we smelled was probably the scent of pheromones. 

503
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,490
I'm sweating.

504
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,329
I've arrived.

505
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,508
What a coincidence. My house is here, too.

506
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,620
Yeah.

507
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,060
Just now...

508
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,500
Was that your first kiss?

509
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,431
Of course, it was my first kiss.

510
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:55,670
I've never even dated before.

511
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,750
But you seemed pretty smooth about it.

512
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,371
I thought maybe... you'd done it before.

513
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:03,790
Stop it.

514
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,080
Maybe it's just that I watch too many movies. And that I...

515
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,070
couldn't hold myself back... So I...

516
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,830
Chen Huan Er.

517
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:28,300
So, does this mean we're a couple now?

518
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,270
How does that make us a couple?

519
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,770
But, we justâ€”

520
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:44,510
Yet, you haven't even properly confessed to me.

521
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,590
Chen Huan Er.

522
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,720
I like you.

523
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,550
Will you... be my girlfriend?

524
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,490
Xi Chi, what are you two still doing out so late?

525
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,500
Dad.

526
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,660
I'll go in first.

527
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,008
You guys have a lot of topics to talk, right?

528
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:20,760
Your mom's been looking for you. She called me just now. Get home now.

529
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,400
Really?

530
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,710
What's up? Anything else?

531
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,364
- No, nothing at all. 
 - I... I'll walk you home.

532
00:37:27,364 --> 00:37:29,310
No need, Uncle. My home is upstairs.

533
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,608
- Go on, hurry up. 
 - Bye, Uncle.

534
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,240
Why hasn't he called me yet? That Jing Xi Chi.

535
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,140
   

536
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,020
Hello?

537
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,750
Hello?

538
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,910
Just now...

539
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,620
Why does my mobile plan...

540
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,020
Hello?

541
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,460
What's going on?

542
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,230
How dare he hang up on me!

543
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,409
How do I cancel this? Help me check it.

544
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:42,660
How to cancel it? Why isn't it working?

545
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,946
Mom, it's just easy. You go to sleep first. I'll fix it for you tomorrow.

546
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:48,540
- It's late now. Go to sleep. 
 - It keeps deducting money!

547
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,390
- Go ahead, Mom. 
 - Fine. Don't forget to help me tomorrow.

548
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,030
- Don't worry. 
 - What's going on?

549
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,740
   

550
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,808
 I just wanted to tell you that I was serious just now. 

551
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,430
 Will you be my girlfriend? 

552
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,720
 Dummy. 

553
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,005
 What does that mean? 

554
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,490
 Good night, my boyfriend. 

555
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,430
 Good night, my girlfriend. 

556
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,900
Boyfriend! I have a boyfriend!

557
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,540
Yes! Yes!

558
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,770
 - What was that sound?  
 - Mom!

559
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,790
The bed collapsed.

560
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,750
What? But it's...

561
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,620
Be careful. What's going on?

562
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,164
I just rolled over.

563
00:41:14,164 --> 00:41:15,953
Gosh...

564
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,186
- What kind of quality is this? 
 - So weird...

565
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:35,920


566
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,130

â™«  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  â™«
