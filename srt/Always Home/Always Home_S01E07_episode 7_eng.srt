1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:20,890


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,890
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,560
Have you heard?

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,190
I just heard that Chen Huan Er, Jing Xi Chi, and Song Cong were robbed yesterday.

19
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,190
Who told you that?

20
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,360
Liao Xin Yan told me.

21
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,590
The police were here to collect evidence or something.

22
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,410
Speaking of that, Qi Qi, last night I ran into Chen Huan Er looking for you at the taro cake shop.

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,190
Fortunately, you three are safe.

24
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,000
Otherwise, I'll be in big trouble.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,410
Mr. Xu.

26
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,640
- With me here, what can go wrong? 
 - Enough.

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,044
Among the three of you, you're the one who worries me the most.

28
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:29,070
If Song Cong and Chen Huan Er weren't there last night...

29
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,577
You punk...

30
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:34,657
Mr. Xu, it's a bit hurtful when you say that.

31
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:38,307
- After all, I'm also— 
 - Enough. Stop bluffing.

32
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:41,540
The robber grabbed you by the neck, yet you still had the nerve to brag.

33
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,020
How do you know this, Mr. Xu?

34
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:49,787
Did you really have to go into so much detail?

35
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:51,407
Can't you just say what happened?

36
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,787
Enough.

37
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:57,137
From today on, the three of you aren't allowed to stay on campus after school.

38
00:02:57,137 --> 00:03:00,067
Go home and do your homework.

39
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:04,137
Providing the police with clues to solve a case is considered a merit.

40
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:06,097
Leave. Go to class.

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,347
Also, stay safe until the robber is caught.

42
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:16,597
- Okay, sir. 
 - Go.

43
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:19,882
Can you please stop talking about it?

44
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:22,083
I don't have much to brag about.

45
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,227
Do you consider me your buddy? You've revealed everything.

46
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:26,520
Are you okay?

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,417
- We're all okay. 
 - We're okay.

48
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,857
To be honest, I'm still a little scared.

49
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:32,687
We won't get retaliated against, right?

50
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:36,347
What are you scared of? I'm here. I'll protect you.

51
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:38,697
- Cut it out. 
 - It's so scary.

52
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:40,520
- Let's go. 
 - Song Cong.

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,467
Do you want to get beaten by me again?

54
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,427
It's starting again.

55
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:31,257
Can I ask you a question?

56
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:41,257
If you have a good friend, will you grow distant over a little separation?

57
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:43,777
You'd better not ask me that kind of question.

58
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:47,497
I want to get into Yenching University, not to make friends.

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,178
Du Man.

60
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,447
I heard you were on the aerobics team. Right?

61
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:00,760
Sun Xiao Ting went to the hospital with gastroenteritis,

62
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,160
but the performance is in the afternoon.

63
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,196
Can you take her place and join us in the talent show?

64
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:08,187
I haven't practiced in a long time. I can't help you.

65
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:09,267
Please.

66
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,752
Saving the situation is like putting out a fire.

67
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:13,052
I hate performing in public. Sorry.

68
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:16,762
Help us. Please. I can't find anyone else in our class except you.

69
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:20,067
Get lost! You're blocking my way.

70
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:22,307
No, why are you like this? I already begged you.

71
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:25,440
Did I ask for your help? It's for our class's honor, you know.

72
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,817
Xin Yan.

73
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:30,897
Why did you forget yourself? You can do it on your own.

74
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:34,817
I can't. I have no dancing background. How can I do it?

75
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,904
You don't need much expertise for this performance.

76
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,880
Besides, with your long arms and legs, you'll look graceful when you jump.

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,240
It'll be pleasing to the eyes.

78
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,560
At least you can represent our class.

79
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:49,457
How can I represent our class?

80
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:53,987
Of course you can, Xin Yan. You're just so dedicated.

81
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:57,747
You can't always be our class' unsung hero, right?

82
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:02,577
I thought our class might win a prize if Du Man could participate.

83
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:05,427
Xin Yan, you're really underestimating yourself.

84
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:08,457
If Du Man learns the performance now, she might not be able to memorize it.

85
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:12,307
Unlike you. You participated in the rehearsal and even made up some of the moves yourself.

86
00:06:12,307 --> 00:06:14,427
You can do it. I trust you.

87
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:17,217
Okay, I'll try my best.

88
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:20,017
- I've got to go. 
 - Good luck.

89
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:31,747
True friends won't grow apart just because they're in different classes.

90
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:34,377
There must be a reason you don't know.

91
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:45,457
   

92
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:48,460
Sorry. I made a mistake and dragged everyone down.

93
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,067
It's fine.

94
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,817
It's all right. It's all about participation anyway.

95
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:55,307
Yeah. And there's nothing particularly great about winning.

96
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,217
Look at what the school gave us.

97
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,485
One correction book per person. What's that supposed to mean?

98
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,367
How about this? I'll buy everyone a milk tea.

99
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:05,187
- Winning second place is also a reward. 
 - Xin Yan is generous.

100
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,427
- Let's go. 
 - Thank you, Xin Yan.

101
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:21,747
I saw you greet Qi Qi during the competition, but she ignored you.

102
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:22,867
What happened to you two?

103
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,677
- Has your friendship faded? 
 - Don't talk nonsense.

104
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:28,777
Maybe there were too many people, and she didn't see me.

105
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:31,987
- Come on, let's get milk tea. 
 - Come on.

106
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:47,784
 Qi Qi, we're going to the milk tea shop at the back entrance for drinks. 

107
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:49,137
 Do you want to join us? 

108
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:51,137
Wait for me!

109
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:05,337
Have some fruit and take a break.

110
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:15,967
Don't you think this orange doesn't match the other fruits?

111
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:19,327
I won't display it like this anymore then.

112
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,217
I'm not blaming you.

113
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:24,257
I just...

114
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:31,867
I like oranges.

115
00:08:32,617 --> 00:08:37,787
They don't need to look fancy or be expensive.

116
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:40,697
Just buy one from the most ordinary fruit store,

117
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:45,507
cut it up, and share it with everyone.

118
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,097
What's so hard about that?

119
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:52,217
You never told me, so I didn't know.

120
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:54,387
I'll do it for you next time.

121
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,737
Come on, change your shoes.

122
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:20,857
The slippers are here.

123
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:24,337
Hello? Qi Qi.

124
00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:27,907
 I texted you. Why didn't you reply? 

125
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:33,817
I was talking to other students and didn't pay attention.

126
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:35,097
Then I completely forgot about it.

127
00:09:35,097 --> 00:09:37,027
 Sorry. 

128
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:38,337
It's fine.

129
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:41,217
Chen Huan Er, there are no more slippers.

130
00:09:41,217 --> 00:09:43,697
Check the cabinet.

131
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,817
Haven't you finished yet?

132
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,760
Yeah.

133
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,457
After our milk tea, we came to my place for tutoring.

134
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,577
We had no choice.

135
00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:56,087
Jing Xi Chi did poorly on his exams this time. We all need to tutor him.

136
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:57,457
Who did you say did poorly?

137
00:09:57,457 --> 00:09:59,547
- Jing Xi Chi, you... 
 - I'm perfectly fine.

138
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:02,097
- Huan Er, who is it? 
  - Qi Qi. 

139
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:03,840
 Let's start with the theory of evolution. 

140
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,817
 Qi Qi, go on talking. 

141
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:08,267
 Jing Xi Chi. 

142
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,787
Is Liao Xin Yan there too?

143
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:11,366
Yeah.

144
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:14,737
Speaking of, when are you coming?

145
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:17,947
Sorry.

146
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:19,217
Well...

147
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:22,497
My tutoring teacher said there's a class later.

148
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,577
I'll join next time.

149
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:52,337
 She really has tutoring classes and needs to go. 

150
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:56,033
 Mixing truth with lies, avoiding the main point, and focusing on trivial details is 

151
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:58,907
 the essence of telling a good lie. 

152
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:03,337
 In terms of lying skills, she's the best. 

153
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:08,067
 She doesn't even need to plan it out like when she writes her essays. 

154
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:13,857
 As long as her desire to escape is strong enough, she'll find a way to lie. 

155
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:23,457
Let's have popsicles.

156
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:25,457
It's so hot. Here.

157
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:28,337
Have you solved your problem?

158
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:30,187
Not yet.

159
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:33,067
Help me analyze it.

160
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,857
It's hard for me to analyze it for you

161
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:36,857
because I don't have any friends.

162
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:42,107
But theoretically, if a friendship requires so much effort to maintain,

163
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:46,097
you might have formed the wrong kind of bond with the wrong person.

164
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:48,577
What does that mean?

165
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:51,977
In other words, if you're always unhappy with someone

166
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:57,307
and have to use all sorts of tricks to keep the relationship going, it's doomed to fail.

167
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:59,427
You just aren't suitable for each other.

168
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,937
Friendship and love are kind of the same thing.

169
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:09,457
But I still think that whether it's friendship or love,

170
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:13,307
we shouldn't give up when we face difficulties.

171
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:16,957
I still need to know why we're growing apart.

172
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:48,427
Qi Qi. Qi Qi.

173
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,937
What is it?

174
00:12:52,817 --> 00:12:55,217
I've got something to tell you.

175
00:12:57,387 --> 00:13:00,427
You can eat first. I'll find you later.

176
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:04,387
Come on.

177
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:11,977
Qi Qi.

178
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:14,787
Qi Qi.

179
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:18,857
Let's talk here.

180
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,267
Sure.

181
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:28,217
Qi Qi.

182
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:32,030
I think you've been a little distant from me lately.

183
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:36,097
Did something happen? Tell me about it.

184
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:39,907
Maybe I've just been too busy.

185
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:42,977
I promised my mom I'd be in the top ten in my grade.

186
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:44,617
I hardly even play with my phone anymore.

187
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:49,427
So, from now on, don't invite me out.

188
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:52,147
What do you mean?

189
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:55,167
Are you saying we can't hang out anymore?

190
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:01,617
Did I do something wrong?

191
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:06,917
I get it. It's because I didn't eat taro cakes with you that day, right?

192
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:13,907
You and I are just from different worlds.

193
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:31,667
You can have many friends, but I can only have one friend.

194
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:39,337
I don't understand what you mean.

195
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:49,307
You have Song Cong, Jing Xi Chi, Liao Xin Yan, and Du Man.

196
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:54,547
What's the difference if I'm not there?

197
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:57,307
But you're my best friend.

198
00:14:57,307 --> 00:15:02,067
Even though we're in different classes, I'm still trying hard to keep our friendship.

199
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:06,337
Trying hard, right?

200
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:09,617
 If a friendship requires so much effort to maintain, 

201
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,697
 you might have formed the wrong kind of bond with the wrong person. 

202
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:18,837
Looks like you took Du Man's advice.

203
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:27,817
How can you guarantee that I'll always be your best friend?

204
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,697
- Qi Qi— 
 - Chen Huan Er.

205
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:35,457
My friendship comes with a bit of possessiveness.

206
00:15:36,387 --> 00:15:38,267
I thought...

207
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:42,527
we'd be each other's only friend.

208
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,307
Only?

209
00:15:46,307 --> 00:15:53,387
Do you mean I can only have you as a friend, and no one else?

210
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:54,907
Yes.

211
00:15:56,817 --> 00:16:00,147
You made a lot of new friends after we were split into different classes.

212
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:02,787
To me, they're just classmates.

213
00:16:11,027 --> 00:16:13,907
Don't come looking for me after class from now on.

214
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:22,787
What do you mean?

215
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,907
If we can't be each other's only friend,

216
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:31,947
I'd rather we just be desk mates and classmates for a while.

217
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,857
I'm going back now.

218
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:38,787
You don't want to be friends with me anymore?

219
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,387
- Class begins. 
 - Get up.

220
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:05,777
 Hello, Sir. 

221
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,507
Hello, students. Please take a seat.

222
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,057
Let's continue with our last class.

223
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:14,217
We'll continue with the linear equation.

224
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:17,377
Please turn to page 70 of your textbook.

225
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:23,507
Look at the first question.

226
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,817
   

227
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:04,997
   

228
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:11,697
 Qi Qi's words are like a riddle. 

229
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:18,147
 I couldn't figure out why our friendship ended so abruptly. 

230
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:24,417
 I even wondered if I did something wrong. 

231
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:32,297
   

232
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,107
Don't look so sad this weekend, all right?

233
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:38,977
People will think you just got dumped.

234
00:18:38,977 --> 00:18:40,867
It's all your fault. You jinxed it.

235
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:44,487
You keep saying that my friendship with Qi Qi has faded.

236
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:48,497
Now... she's really ignoring me.

237
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:53,697
Why do you always blame me for everything?

238
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,257
I'm observant.

239
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:58,687
I've long seen a rift between you two.

240
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:01,947
It's actually quite normal.

241
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:05,217
I always thought that since almost everyone in Tianhe

242
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:07,247
goes to the same school from primary through high school,

243
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,967
the differences wouldn't be obvious.

244
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:11,427
But think about it. The world outside is huge.

245
00:19:11,427 --> 00:19:12,827
The days ahead are long.

246
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:16,297
We'll eventually get out and meet more people.

247
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:20,147
By then, maybe friendships will be temporary.

248
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:22,947
Stop right there. What do you mean by "temporary"?

249
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:25,057
Friends are supposed to last a lifetime.

250
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:27,457
Don't listen to his nonsense.

251
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:32,387
I think Qi Qi is probably just jealous.

252
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:35,727
Let her calm down for a couple of days. She'll figure it out on her own.

253
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:44,057
Instead of discussing the meaning of friendship,

254
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,417
why not talk about something practical?

255
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,097
Something practical?

256
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:58,147
Like how I messed up this test again.

257
00:19:58,147 --> 00:20:00,297
My mom must be worried.

258
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:02,947
Isn't it normal for you to do poorly on tests?

259
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:04,587
It's not that I don't work hard.

260
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:08,257
It was just that the rehearsal was too distracting.

261
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:11,187
Really? Why does Cong always get first place?

262
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:13,587
How can I compare with him?

263
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,087
Why don't you look at your grades?

264
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:16,520
- What's wrong with mine? 
 - You're not any better than me.

265
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,827
All right.

266
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:21,240
If you really can't do it, we'll add another tutoring session tonight.

267
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,637
Look, how many times have I let you borrow Song Cong as your private tutor?

268
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:26,217
You have to study hard.

269
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:28,187
You're ungrateful, Chen Huan Er.

270
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,867
Didn't I lend Song Cong to you first?

271
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,757
Jeez.

272
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,147
Stop eating. You've finished it all.

273
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,697
Here, Cong. Eat more.

274
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,217
Did you take nitroglycerin or something?

275
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:41,360
You hit so hard every time.

276
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,960
- I'll give you some sodium hydride. 
 - Why not use some hydrogen peroxide?

277
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,017
Good job.

278
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:47,267
- You remember the chemical equations. 
 - You underestimate me.

279
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:48,487
Our family has doctors.

280
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:51,287
I remember all my mom's prescriptions.

281
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,080
Cong.

282
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,434
Tonight, what delicious food is Aunt Hao going to make for me?

283
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:03,080
Are you here for tutoring, or to nourish your body?

284
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,697
Of course, he wants to nourish his body.

285
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,977
- Let's go. 
 - Guess I'll nourish my body first.

286
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:10,657
You need a healthy body to study well.

287
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:15,147
   

288
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,240
You didn't tell me in advance that Aunt Hao wasn't home.

289
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,427
I was expecting her to cook for me.

290
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:22,237
I didn't know she was working overtime today.

291
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:24,587
How about coming to my place for a meal?

292
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,257
I have some leftovers.

293
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:27,627
That works too.

294
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:29,280
How about I cook for you?

295
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,500
- Forget it. With your cooking skills... 
 - I'll make scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

296
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,217
You'll end up making scrambled eggshells with tomatoes.

297
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:37,347
You're making a fuss after doing poorly on your exam?

298
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:40,737
How did someone like me, Li Jian Jun, end up with a son like you?

299
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:42,320
Enough. Keep your voice down.

300
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,457
Aren't you afraid the neighbors might hear you?

301
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:46,057
Apologize to your father now.

302
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:47,147
All you do is criticize me.

303
00:21:47,147 --> 00:21:48,840
Why don't you reflect on yourselves?

304
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,360
What did you say? Say it again.

305
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,166
It's your fault for not giving me a good brain. That's why I lost to Song Cong!

306
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,737
Go away!

307
00:21:54,737 --> 00:21:55,867
Why are you hitting him?

308
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:57,840
Go away.

309
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,387
Why are you hitting him?

310
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:01,087
Go away.

311
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:04,497
Uncle Li.

312
00:22:04,497 --> 00:22:06,377
- Hello! 
 - Aunt Li, you're all here.

313
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:09,587
Li Tian, are you free? If you are, come to our house to check the exam answers.

314
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:12,347
Yeah, I have a question I want to ask you.

315
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:14,257
Hurry up. Go get Xi Chi and the others.

316
00:22:14,257 --> 00:22:15,157
Hurry up.

317
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:18,347
Uncle Li, you seem to be in good health lately.

318
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:20,147
Aunt Li, we'll go study first.

319
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:22,737
- Sure. 
 - Bye.

320
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:24,767
Hurry, Li Tian. Let's go.

321
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:26,177
Go.

322
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:31,477
You owe me a life-saving favor.

323
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,457
My parents will be back very late tonight.

324
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:43,887
You can stay here.

325
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:48,667
Song Cong, aren't you eating?

326
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,267
You guys go ahead. I'll eat later.

327
00:22:53,977 --> 00:22:55,587
What are you up to?

328
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:59,657
Did you all see that and plan to make fun of me?

329
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,747
Take this and put it on your face, or it'll get swollen soon.

330
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,008
My dad is big and strong and he's never beaten me up.

331
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:17,957
Dr. Li usually looks gentle and polite, but he's pretty cruel.

332
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:24,687
Thanks for today. I've got to go.

333
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:25,737
Where are you going?

334
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,507
Getting worked up?

335
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:28,917
Just a few words and he's already mad.

336
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:30,387
You're mad, aren't you?

337
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:32,147
Won't you get beaten if you go back now?

338
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:34,857
Isn't it nice to eat and drink at my place?

339
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:41,387
Your relationship doesn't seem that bad.

340
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:44,787
We grew up together. How bad can it be?

341
00:23:45,587 --> 00:23:47,297
This kid, on the other hand...

342
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:52,697
Ever since his dad became the hospital director, he left our group.

343
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,977
You distanced yourself from me, okay?

344
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:57,320
Sure. We distance ourselves from you.

345
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,337
You attend classes all day. Would you have come if I asked you?

346
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:04,127
And if you hadn't insisted on comparing yourself to Cong, would things have turned out like this?

347
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:06,441
The examination system is all about comparison.

348
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,727
How is it my fault?

349
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,047
Jing Xi Chi, in your eyes, am I a joke?

350
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:14,737
I'm just a slow bird trying to fly early.

351
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:18,680
No matter how hard I work, I'll never catch up to Song Cong, right?

352
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,400
- Oh, so you do know you’re a slow learner. 
 - You're the slow learner!

353
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,497
- You said it, not me. 
 - Enough.

354
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:24,547
Hurry and eat.

355
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:31,387
I understand how you feel.

356
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,737
How about this: can you join our tutoring sessions?

357
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:38,007
You two top students and we underachievers make a perfect match.

358
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:39,817
Right, Song Cong?

359
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:44,877
Tian.

360
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:47,217
You can come anytime you want.

361
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:49,907
I can even ask you for help with English.

362
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:52,417
Haven't you always been good at English?

363
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:55,677
My English isn't as good as yours.

364
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:07,497
Besides, if my parents find out I've been getting help from you guys, they'd definitely blow up again.

365
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:08,737
Mama's boy.

366
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:11,387
What's wrong with being a mama's boy?

367
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:15,737
To be honest, you have one thing that ranks first in our compound.

368
00:25:15,737 --> 00:25:16,457
What is it?

369
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:19,117
You are number one when it comes to being obedient.

370
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,727
Have you never thought about resisting?

371
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,497
Just talking back doesn't count.

372
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:26,007
Just talking back got me to this point. Do you think I'm not dying fast enough?

373
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:29,057
Besides, who am I to resist? I won't resist.

374
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:32,760
My mom arranged an elite route for me. Something others can only wish for.

375
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,800
Are you envious of me?

376
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,707
Only a fool like you would rebel.

377
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,920
- Who are you calling a fool? 
 - You.

378
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,747
If I hadn't brought you here, you'd be doomed!

379
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:46,107
- I didn't ask you to bring me here. 
 - Get lost.

380
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:48,017
Go home for your beatings.

381
00:25:48,017 --> 00:25:51,017
Get lost. Come on. Reluctant to leave? Is your butt heavy?

382
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:54,217
- I'll go! I'll go. 
 - Go. Don't come again!

383
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:56,537
Fool!

384
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,707
Li Tian!

385
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:03,427
Have they always been like this?

386
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:05,267
They always have been.

387
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,587
Quiet.

388
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:14,607
Quiet!

389
00:26:16,947 --> 00:26:18,940
Quiet.

390
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,947
Finally, a reminder. 
    

391
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:26,347
Students, you must take this agricultural activity seriously.

392
00:26:26,347 --> 00:26:31,257
This activity is an important opportunity for practical training.

393
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,977
It's not a field trip.

394
00:26:32,977 --> 00:26:35,437
Of course it is a field trip!

395
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:39,247
   

396
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:42,887
Do you think this trip is a little like the one we went on during summer vacation?

397
00:26:42,887 --> 00:26:44,147
A little.

398
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:47,867
But agricultural activity...

399
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,080
Could you stop recording?

400
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,907
Didn't you already take a ton of footage?

401
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:55,057
Mr. Xu specifically told me to document everything for you guys.

402
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,827
I have to get all the shots.

403
00:26:56,827 --> 00:27:00,487
Besides, I used my new phone to film you all.

404
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:02,867
Do you know how many pixels it has?

405
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:06,163
Eight million pixels! Better than a camera.

406
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:08,500
Here, smile. How cute.

407
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,700
Students, let's go.

408
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:16,457
Go, Cong!

409
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:21,311
 Cong, what do you look forward to most about agriculture study? 

410
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:23,660
 Song Cong, come here. 

411
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,965
 The homeroom teacher called for me. Film the others first. 

412
00:27:29,537 --> 00:27:31,757
 Du Man, what about you? 

413
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:34,717
 Li Tian. 

414
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,447
 It's already noon. What's there to look forward to? 

415
00:27:40,447 --> 00:27:42,947
 Jing Xi Chi, are you going to brush me off? 

416
00:27:42,947 --> 00:27:44,854
 What about you? 

417
00:27:44,854 --> 00:27:48,120
 Speaking of which, I'm most looking forward to us cooking together. 

418
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,057
 I heard we can cook with vegetables we pick ourselves. 

419
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:52,547
 That should be quite fulfilling. 

420
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:55,627
 Chen Huan Er, what do you think about this agriculture study? 

421
00:27:55,627 --> 00:27:58,637
 Hold it away. Why do you keep filming? 

422
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:00,567
 Hurry, tell me. 

423
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:02,917
 I'm actually pretty excited about it. 

424
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,457
 I want to try doing farm work. 

425
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:07,767
 I want to cook a meal for everyone. 

426
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:10,017
 I've never cooked before. 

427
00:28:10,017 --> 00:28:12,497
 - I've never cooked. 
 - Is anything even delicious? 

428
00:28:12,497 --> 00:28:14,537
 What would you like to eat? I'll cook for you. 

429
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:16,117
 - Sure, this time... 
 - You can order. 

430
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:19,827
 I want authentic Sishui vegetable dumplings. 

431
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:21,497
 Are the dumplings I make not authentic? 

432
00:28:21,497 --> 00:28:24,187
 Did you make them? Aunt Li Na made them. 

433
00:28:24,187 --> 00:28:26,287
 Did you make them? Did you make them? 

434
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,980
 The ones I make are much better than my mom's. 

435
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,160
 I can try it. 

436
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,710
 It's our school's first time going out together. 

437
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,760
 - So overall, I'm looking forward to it. 
 - Yes. 

438
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,480
 After all, it's our school's last group activity. 

439
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,904
 It'll be interesting and unforgettable. 

440
00:28:40,904 --> 00:28:44,840
 All right, what do you think about this agriculture study? 

441
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:52,219
 I hope everyone can be together and pick vegetables together. 

442
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:54,840
 And then... 

443
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,760
 Like Song Cong said, maybe friendships are temporary. 

444
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,190
 The answer I couldn't figure out was simple. 

445
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,320
 It's really just that we're making new friends. 

446
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,280
 But I'll still think Qi Qi is important. 

447
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:15,650
 Even though after spending more time together, our little group has gained new members. 

448
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,428
Does she really have to go that far? She's still memorizing words while cutting vegetables.

449
00:29:37,428 --> 00:29:39,580
- It's normal. 
 - Look at her.

450
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,200
There must be difficulties at home.

451
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,147
Maybe she's depending on her studies to change her fate.

452
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:48,147
This agriculture study is no joke.

453
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:51,427
I thought we were just going to do some labor work.

454
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:53,537
We have a craft class this afternoon.

455
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:56,157
I was tricked by TV shows.

456
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:59,867
Their high school students are performing in plays, dancing duets, and going to the beach.

457
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:04,737
As for us, we're tilling the soil, digging wild vegetables, and carrying farming tools.

458
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:08,007
Xin Yan, I told you to stop watching that stuff.

459
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:11,327
You're so obsessed. I don't know how to help you.

460
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,667
Xin Yan, you can't do it like this.

461
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:23,107
Look, for leafy vegetables like this, cutting off one-third is usually enough.

462
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:25,217
Just cut it like that, and you're done.

463
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:27,627
What the teacher teaches is standard.

464
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:31,347
But what we usually do is find the stem first. Look.

465
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:32,827
Its one-third position.

466
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:34,347
Cut it.

467
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:36,617
Then cut it neatly.

468
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,583
Huan Er, how do you know this?

469
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,637
I've been doing this since I was a kid.

470
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:45,257
You forgot that I'm from Sishui. I also come from a farming village.

471
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:48,147
That place seems to be pretty close by.

472
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,867
Chen Huan Er.

473
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:52,587
Did you often do this kind of work when you were a child?

474
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:55,240
Yes, I used to work when I was a kid.

475
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,027
- You've never done this, have you? 
 - Never.

476
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:00,737
Huan Er.

477
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:03,737
You must have been happy living in Sishui when you were a kid.

478
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,217
What did you say?

479
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:07,337
You said you were happy?

480
00:31:08,347 --> 00:31:10,337
I'm happy.

481
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,977
 When everyone complains about the hardship and boredom of agriculture study, 

482
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:23,177
 only Jing Xi Chi noticed something was off with Song Cong. 

483
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:31,457
 Growing up, I did a lot of farm work. 

484
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:37,147
 But this time with my classmates was the most memorable. 

485
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:41,297
 Youth really has a magical filter. 

486
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:47,217
 Every time I think back, I still believe it was the best time of my life. 

487
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:48,587
Jing Xi Chi.

488
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:50,347
- Sir. 
 - Don't just play around.

489
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:51,537
Help with the work.

490
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:52,907
Wash the vegetables clean.

491
00:31:52,907 --> 00:31:54,887
Don't worry, Sir.

492
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,217
You're still studying?

493
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,107
L-O-W. Low.

494
00:32:02,107 --> 00:32:04,617
L-O-W.

495
00:32:05,187 --> 00:32:07,387
Good job, Cong.

496
00:32:07,387 --> 00:32:08,977
When did you learn to do this?

497
00:32:08,977 --> 00:32:11,033
Didn't he always want to study medicine?

498
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:15,307
He's eager to perform surgery on people, so he practiced on chickens first, right?

499
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:19,287
What do you all think?

500
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:21,247
Should we have it steamed or braised?

501
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:22,667
It's up to you.

502
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,497
Listen to me. Braise it.

503
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:25,907
I love braised food the most.

504
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:27,727
No one asked you.

505
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:30,097
No one asked me, so I can't choose?

506
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:35,797
They worked, so they get to choose.

507
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:38,427
You didn't do any work. How about you do some work then?

508
00:32:38,427 --> 00:32:40,107
I'll work.

509
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:41,497
Let's braise it then.

510
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:44,777
Sure, I'll let you all taste my cooking.

511
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:48,120
- I want to stew the chicken first. 
 - Don't touch this.

512
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,307
- Let me do it. 
 - I'll prepare the vegetables then.

513
00:32:50,307 --> 00:32:51,537
Sure.

514
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:53,977
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

515
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:57,607
L-O-V-E. Love.

516
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,997
We need to record this for them.

517
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:14,187
The more I see, the more I think...

518
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:16,947
- What? 
 - Something's going on.

519
00:33:16,947 --> 00:33:21,147
Looks like the story of a small-town girl and a top student wasn't just a rumor after all.

520
00:33:21,147 --> 00:33:22,927
I think you guys have something going on.

521
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:24,787
You think about romance all day long.

522
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:26,640
Your phone will be confiscated by the teacher soon.

523
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,920
- Stay out of this. 
 - What?

524
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,697
Sir, someone's playing with his phone!

525
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:32,707
Keep your voice down, you four-eyed boy.

526
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:47,297
Coming.

527
00:33:47,297 --> 00:33:51,387
Students, let's play a round after dinner.

528
00:33:51,387 --> 00:33:52,627
I'm not playing.

529
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:55,497
I'm not playing. I think we should take a nap and rest after eating.

530
00:33:55,497 --> 00:33:58,347
I'm not asking you to play poker. We're playing truth or dare.

531
00:33:58,347 --> 00:33:59,797
- No. 
 - Just draw one.

532
00:33:59,797 --> 00:34:02,460
Whoever got the smallest card loses. Let's play.

533
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,217
- After-meal entertainment. 
 - Let's play for a while.

534
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:05,897
- Have some fun. 
 - Let's play.

535
00:34:05,897 --> 00:34:07,407
Hurry.

536
00:34:10,827 --> 00:34:12,017
Sorry, everyone.

537
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,177
I need to go to the toilet.

538
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,747
Go.

539
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:16,297
Come on.

540
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,235
- Yours is the smallest. 
 - Whose card is the smallest?

541
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:21,947
Your card is the smallest.

542
00:34:23,307 --> 00:34:27,840
- Ask away. 
 - If you could choose your own desk mate,

543
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,907
who in our class would you pick?

544
00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:31,597
Cong, of course.

545
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:33,537
Tell the truth or I'll punish you.

546
00:34:33,537 --> 00:34:34,727
I'm telling the truth.

547
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:36,307
Can't you see how close we are?

548
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,307
Fine, let me rephrase.

549
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:41,550
If you had to choose a girl as your desk mate, who would you choose?

550
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,457
That's your second question. I haven't lost yet. Hurry, put it down.

551
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,097
Sure. Don't play dirty.

552
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:48,217
Look at this guy, trying to cheat!

553
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:56,097
- Your card is still the smallest. 
 - You again.

554
00:34:56,097 --> 00:34:57,360
You...

555
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,127
How can it be, really?

556
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:00,497
- Don't play dirty. 
 - I didn't.

557
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:01,537
Don't play dirty.

558
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:03,097
Accept defeat.

559
00:35:03,097 --> 00:35:04,887
Why are you causing a ruckus?

560
00:35:04,887 --> 00:35:06,617
- Speak. 
 - Hurry.

561
00:35:07,827 --> 00:35:11,017
I really don't have anyone I especially want to sit next to.

562
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:13,387
You must choose one.

563
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:15,387
You then.

564
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:16,597
Xin Yan.

565
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:19,027
All right, next round.

566
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:25,297
Here.

567
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:28,137
Come on, play your cards.

568
00:35:28,137 --> 00:35:31,377
Here, three, two, one. Who is it?

569
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:33,427
Chen Huan Er.

570
00:35:33,427 --> 00:35:36,609
- If it's Huan Er, I'll ask something simple. 
 - Why?

571
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:37,680
You ask her.

572
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,427
I'll ask.

573
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:41,267
Chen Huan Er,

574
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:46,397
who do you admire most in our class?

575
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:54,487
I pick Song Cong.

576
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,127
What are you guys talking about? You're so excited.

577
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:05,177
- Chen Huan Er said... 
 - Nothing.

578
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:08,167
Song Cong, we haven't seen your card.

579
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,727
- Take it out and show us. 
 - Yes.

580
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,497
Your card is the smallest.

581
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:15,497
I... I have to ask you a question.

582
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:17,873
Who do you admire most in our class?

583
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:19,307
Don't ask the same questions.

584
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:21,747
- How boring. 
 - This question is fun.

585
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,407
Didn't you just go to the bathroom? Why are you going again?

586
00:36:32,577 --> 00:36:37,177
Sorry, everyone. My stomach is really upset today.

587
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:38,947
I don't have any tissues.

588
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,177
Does anyone have some?

589
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:42,757
I didn't bring any.

590
00:36:42,757 --> 00:36:44,607
I'll go get some for you.

591
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:46,007
Sure.

592
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:48,560
What's wrong with you?

593
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,657
- I don't know. 
 - Cong, why don't you go first?

594
00:36:50,657 --> 00:36:53,807
We'll have Jing Xi Chi bring it to you later.

595
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:56,177
- Thank you. 
 - Go.

596
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:07,627
Cong said his stomach hurt and went back to the dorm to lie down.

597
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:12,347
You didn't really poison him, did you?

598
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,137
What are you talking about? How come we're fine? Don't scare Huan Er.

599
00:37:17,137 --> 00:37:19,680
I'll go to the fields to see if there's any sweet potato root.

600
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,617
It can stop diarrhea when soaked in hot water.

601
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:23,347
Sweet potato root?

602
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:25,657
You'd better not make it worse.

603
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:28,427
It'll work. My grandpa was a traditional medicine practitioner.

604
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:31,787
When I had a stomachache, he soaked it in hot water and made me drink it.

605
00:37:31,787 --> 00:37:34,617
If you add copper leaf herb and Ailanthus root,

606
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,507
these three ingredients together will work.

607
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:37,947
Let's go.

608
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:49,537
Chen Huan Er, did you find any?

609
00:37:49,537 --> 00:37:51,787
- No. 
 - Still nothing?

610
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:54,497
You're so slow.

611
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:56,407
Are these enough?

612
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,537
What are these?

613
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:01,347
Sweet potato root. The place is full of them.

614
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:03,347
Aren't these sweet potatoes?

615
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,907
Yeah, sweet potato roots.

616
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:07,347
This is the root. Sweet potato root.

617
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:10,737
Sweet potato root isn't the root of a sweet potato.

618
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:15,280
Sweet potato root isn't the root of a sweet potato?

619
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,457
Chen Huan Er, why don't you listen to yourself?

620
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:21,227
Sweet potato root isn't the root of a sweet potato. Did you hear that?

621
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:22,700
- Sweet potato root isn't... 
 - Sweet potato root.

622
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,057
Wait. Sweet potato root isn't the root...

623
00:38:26,057 --> 00:38:29,777
Sweet potato root is actually the name of a herb.

624
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:36,197
Xi Chi, sweet potato is already a root tuber.

625
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:40,347
A root tuber?

626
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:41,867
Let's roast this and eat it tonight.

627
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,907
It should be tasty.

628
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:46,867
Sweet potato root isn't the root of a sweet potato.

629
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:50,457
Sweet potato root isn't the root of a sweet potato.

630
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:52,137
Jing Xi Chi.

631
00:38:52,137 --> 00:38:55,167
Chen Huan Er is so anxious to find medicine for Song Cong.

632
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,840
Are they that close?

633
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,980
What nonsense are you talking about? We're sworn brothers.

634
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,617
If you have time to gossip about others, why don't you help me find the sweet potato root?

635
00:39:06,617 --> 00:39:09,747
Sure, I'll help.

636
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,537
But isn't this the plot of a Chinese fantasy drama?

637
00:39:12,537 --> 00:39:17,017
The little pharmacist would dig three feet to find the herb to save the celestial being.

638
00:39:17,017 --> 00:39:19,787
In the end, he still has to rely on me to save him.

639
00:39:19,787 --> 00:39:21,137
Chen Huan Er!

640
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:23,360
Sweet potato root!

641
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,182
Are you sure it's sweet potato root?

642
00:39:25,182 --> 00:39:28,440
Sweet potato root. The sweet potato root! The herb!

643
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,137
- Are you sure it's sweet potato root? 
 - It's sweet potato root.

644
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:32,747
You mean it's that herb?

645
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:34,457
Look at the root. This root.

646
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:35,927
It's true.

647
00:39:35,927 --> 00:39:37,737
Amazing.

648
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,017
Cong said he wants a hot water bottle. Does anyone have one?

649
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:51,427
Go grab one from my dorm. It's on the bed.

650
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:53,427
You really have everything. I'll go then.

651
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:54,987
Bye.

652
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,610
Is the food I cooked really poisonous?

653
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:05,057
Look at how worried you are about Song Cong.

654
00:40:05,057 --> 00:40:06,907
Come to my dorm later so we can chat.

655
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,907
I'll give you some advice.

656
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,027
What's wrong with Song Cong?

657
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:14,747
It's nothing serious. Song Cong just has a stomachache.

658
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:17,147
Huan Er is about to prepare medicine for him.

659
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,777
Let's hurry; the kitchen is closing.

660
00:40:33,137 --> 00:40:35,227
How's my little princess doing?

661
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:37,787
Here, your hot water bottle.

662
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:40,977
- How much is it? 
 - It's free. It belongs to Xin Yan.

663
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:42,657
- Did you tell them? 
 - Of course.

664
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:45,017
Where else can I get you this hot water bottle?

665
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:47,747
We just got back from digging up a herb for you.

666
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:50,907
Actually, Chen Huan Er is really good.

667
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,567
She's pretty knowledgeable about medicinal herbs.

668
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:55,360
But man, that root was such a pain to dig up.

669
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,736
Do you know that sweet potato root isn't actually the root of a sweet potato?

670
00:40:58,736 --> 00:41:01,577
Do you get it? What's the use of her knowing so much?

671
00:41:01,577 --> 00:41:04,697
- I found it in the end. 
 - Don't let her come.

672
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:10,177
What?

673
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,177
She's preparing the medicine for you.

674
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:15,267
- If you don't let her come... 
 - Go get it for me.

675
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,197
Don't let her come.

676
00:41:19,057 --> 00:41:20,827
Cong...

677
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:52,190


678
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:57,230
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

679
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:03,250
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

680
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:10,220
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

681
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:16,650
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

682
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:23,040
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

683
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:30,850
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

684
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:37,680
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

685
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:44,260
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

686
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:50,960
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

687
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,920
♫  Your promise still echoes in my ears  ♫

688
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,140
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

689
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:04,860
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

690
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,320
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

691
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,590
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

692
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:18,580
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

693
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,380
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

694
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,420
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

695
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,400
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

696
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,650
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

697
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,060
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

698
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:45,240
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

699
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,640
♫  At the right time  ♫
