Zhang Yang!

17
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,270
That was a nice kick!

18
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,140
Zhang Yang.

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,220
This is our new roommate,

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,900
Jing Xichi.

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,280
Hello.

22
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:06,700
Hello.

23
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,140
Hello.

24
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,400
Come on, let's play a match.

25
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,460
I haven't played in a long time.

26
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,270
Come on.

27
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,700
You must know how to play.

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,230
Let's go!

29
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,520
We're just short of one person.

30
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,390
Come on.

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,900
Let's go.

32
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,300
Okay.

33
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,990
I'll try.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,560
Let's go.

35
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:22,830
Huan'er,

36
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,390
which course is your friend studying?

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,670
Computer Science.

38
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,700
Computer Science?

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,620
So he's going to be a programmer, right?

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,510
I don't know what he'll do

41
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,670
in the future.

42
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,140
Aren't programmers

43
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,180
all those

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,950
nerdy types,

45
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,350
wearing black-rimmed glasses,

46
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,390
checkered shirts,

47
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,580
and always looking serious?

48
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,180
Is he nerdy?

49
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,020
I don't know.

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,110
However,

51
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,180
he's very childish.

52
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,950
He's so handsome!

53
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,060
Take a picture for me!

54
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,580
He's so handsome!

55
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,230
Exactly!

56
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,900
- Nice!
- Nice!

57
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,270
Over here! Over here!

58
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,270
Run, quick!

59
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,620
Nice shot!

60
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,300
Great!

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,350
Nice shot!

62
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,500
- Nice shot!
- Defend!

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,180
Wow, impressive!
You're Beckham in China.

64
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,990
Chen Huan'er!

65
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,830
I sent you so many messages,

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
why didn't you reply?

67
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,390
I didn't see them.

68
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,830
I knew it.

69
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,360
Song even thought you were mad at me.

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,340
Come on, we're so close.

71
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,300
Why would you be mad?

72
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,270
Oh, right.

73
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,180
My mother let me
bring you some medicine.

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,980
Here, take it.

75
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,510
Bye.

76
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,550
Let's go.

77
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:45,900
Huan'er.

78
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,070
So is this

79
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,070
your programmer friend?

80
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,070
So is this your little sister, Huan'er?

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,900
We're high school classmates
who live in the same compound.

82
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,390
Dude,

83
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,140
if you keep gossiping,

84
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,220
I'll kick you so hard
you'll call me Dad.

85
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,700
You're so fierce!

86
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,830
That's the spirit!

87
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,900
You can't play football
without a bit of aggression.

88
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,150
Stop staring and let's continue.

89
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,950
Stop looking.

90
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,860
Don't be so reluctant.

91
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,640
Come on.

92
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,320
Pass it to me!

93
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,620
I squeezed too much. Take some.

94
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,300
Thank you.

95
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,687
(Not bad, but I think Tian Chi
from pharmacy course is more handsome.)

96
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,740
Huan'er.

97
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:28,910
Look.

98
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,500
This.

99
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,230
Is this your handsome friend
from Computer Science?

100
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,300
(Not bad, but I think Tian Chi from
the pharmacy course is more handsome.)

101
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,470
(Within three minutes,)

102
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,620
(I want all the information)

103
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,520
(on this football guy.)

104
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,300
(I declare)

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,300
(he is the new
heartthrob of Wuan University.)

106
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,470
(He's just okay.)

107
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,300
(I think Tian Chi
from the pharmacy course)

108
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,220
(is more handsome.)

109
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,910
Yes.

110
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,060
Was he very popular

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,620
at your high school?

112
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,260
Do you think he's handsome?

113
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,990
Of course!

114
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,420
Honestly,

115
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,820
he's pretty good-looking.

116
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,500
Just be honest,

117
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,710
during the three years as his classmate,

118
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,880
did you ever have
any thoughts about him?

119
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,710
Yes.

120
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,380
Every day I wanted to shoot him,

121
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,230
especially today.

122
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,470
A famous psychologist

123
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,790
once said:

124
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,110
The essence

125
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,740
of avoiding your true feelings

126
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,260
is guilt.

127
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,910
That makes so much sense.

128
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,500
Which psychologist said that?

129
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,300
I did.

130
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,350
The student council senior

131
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,470
invited me to a social barbecue.

132
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,110
Why don't you

133
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,670
come with me?

134
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,110
Sure.

135
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,710
Would that be okay, though?

136
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,990
She invited you, not us.

137
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,420
If we go, wouldn't it be...

138
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,110
It's fine.

139
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,500
It's a welcome event, after all.

140
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,880
The more, the merrier.

141
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,150
In that case, I need to sleep early.

142
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,030
So it's settled then.

143
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,300
Where's Dong Huixin?

144
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,710
I haven't seen her all day.

145
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,790
She's really over the top.

146
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,350
Forget it, let's sleep.

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,400
Let's sleep.

148
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:14,910
Good night.

149
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,030
Good night.

150
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,110
(Are you still mad?)

151
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,500
Hello.

152
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,590
Nice to meet you.

153
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
Hope we can get along well.

154
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,150
It's late now.

155
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,380
Let's get to know
each other better tomorrow.

156
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,910
Good night.

157
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,180
Um...

158
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
Do you think it's warm?

159
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,820
Not really.

160
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,500
Left.

161
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,380
Is Yan Mu out again?

162
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,860
He thinks we're
too loud when we play games.

163
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,060
He says it affects his karma.

164
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,380
So he went to the lake

165
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,470
to chant scriptures.

166
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,590
Fine.

167
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,740
Tonight, the student councils
from various faculties

168
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,910
are hosting a big social event.

169
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,580
They're having a barbecue.
Are you coming?

170
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,380
Yes!

171
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,120
Jing, what about you?

172
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,670
No.

173
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:32,900
Jing.

174
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,860
I heard you've been trending
on the school forum.

175
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,260
Shouldn't you take this chance
to meet more people?

176
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,470
Expanding your network

177
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,300
is just as important
as studying seriously.

178
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,190
No need.

179
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,710
Jing.

180
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,470
Just go.

181
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,070
A senior specifically asked me

182
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,110
to bring you over.

183
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,830
If you don't go,

184
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,300
how am I supposed to explain?

185
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,900
Catch.

186
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,400
Then I'm definitely not going.

187
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,500
Come on, Jing.

188
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,620
Do me a favor.

189
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,230
No.

190
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,600
Are you really not going?

191
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,140
No.

192
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,480
Then we're heading out.

193
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,840
Let's go.

194
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,740
Let's go.

195
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,860
What a pity.

196
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,440
(Have you packed? Our dorm doesn't
have air conditioning. Does yours?)

197
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,380
(Also, let's have dinner tonight.)
(Are you still mad?)

198
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,880
What are you doing?

199
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,540
Chen Huan'er.

200
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,740
Hurry up and pack.

201
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,860
I'm done.

202
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,740
What did you pack?

203
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,860
What's wrong?

204
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,540
She means
you should put on some makeup

205
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,470
and change clothes.

206
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,900
Is this not okay?

207
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,190
Chen Huan'er.

208
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,820
Are you really planning
to just show up like this for dinner?

209
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,740
Isn't it just

210
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,860
a casual gathering?

211
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,020
This isn't an ordinary dinner.

212
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,220
It's your first time
meeting the seniors.

213
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,900
You need to make a good impression.

214
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,500
Even if you don't want
to join the student council,

215
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,140
you should

216
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,140
at least tidy up a bit.

217
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,310
Look up.

218
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,590
Lipstick too?

219
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,800
Press your lips together.

220
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,020
Put this on as well.

221
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,190
Fine, you both...

222
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,900
Hurry up.

223
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,470
Let me see.

224
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,220
Are you satisfied?

225
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,590
Yes.

226
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,110
Let's go.

227
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,260
We're running late!

228
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,900
Well.

229
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,260
First of all,

230
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,900
welcome

231
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,260
to today's gathering!

232
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,430
I'll say

233
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,830
a few words.

234
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,260
I really hope you all

235
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,760
consider joining our art department.

236
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,470
Our department

237
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,710
is full of handsome guys

238
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,900
and beautiful girls,

239
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,340
and it's the most popular department
of the student council.

240
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,950
Right.

241
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,860
Since you've spoken,

242
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,710
I'll say a few words
for the sports department.

243
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,470
We are pretty straightforward.

244
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,830
Tonight, I just want everyone

245
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,840
to eat well, drink well,

246
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,740
and have a great time!

247
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,100
Nice!

248
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,740
Great! Great!

249
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,540
Great! Great!

250
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,310
Good!

251
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,230
Good!

252
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,740
Tian Chi.

253
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,620
Cheers.

254
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,260
Cheers.

255
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,100
Nice to meet you.

256
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,020
Don't drink alone.

257
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,800
I'll drink with you.

258
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,310
All right.

259
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,830
Watch your manners.

260
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,710
Be ladylike.

261
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,430
Look at the good stuff I bought.

262
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,430
Here.

263
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,900
Be ladylike.

264
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:53,950
Try this.

265
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,430
Thanks.

266
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:55,990
Huan'er?

267
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,230
Senior Tian Chi?

268
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,140
Why are you here?

269
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,430
I'm in the student council.

270
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,190
I was busy earlier,

271
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,500
but I came over once I was done.

272
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,470
Do you want a skewer?

273
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,070
Here.

274
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,190
Thanks.

275
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,580
Would you like some beer?

276
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,380
I'll pass.

277
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,620
Thanks.

278
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,990
I saw you're studying pharmacy.

279
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,190
Was that your choice?

280
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,500
Do you plan to go

281
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,140
into drug research

282
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,070
or some other field?

283
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,070
I haven't thought that far ahead.

284
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,990
I'll just take it one step at a time.

285
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,560
The semester hasn't even started yet.

286
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,540
What if I can't keep up?

287
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,830
Your answers

288
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,070
are always unexpected.

289
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,830
This beer is pretty good.

290
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,160
It tastes just like juice.

291
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,540
Are you sure you don't want to try?

292
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,020
I...

293
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,380
I'll pass.

294
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,830
Um...

295
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,780
Is Jing really not coming?

296
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,540
I texted him.

297
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,860
He said he's not coming.

298
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,260
I'll text him again.

299
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,350
Okay.

300
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,120
I'll text him again.

301
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,660
Okay.

302
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,500
(Everyone's waiting for you.)

303
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,470
(Hurry and come!)

304
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,140
(I'm not coming.)

305
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,020
You can really hold your liquor.

306
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,350
Drink up!

307
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,740
Drink more!

308
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,260
Come on.

309
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,070
More!

310
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,590
You should slow down.

311
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,140
What's going on with this kid?

312
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,950
She's not answering the phone.

313
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,950
Come on, pick up!

314
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,470
She's...

315
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,720
Still can't get through?

316
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,470
This kid

317
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,780
just won't pick up. I've called

318
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,520
several times.

319
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,140
Could it be

320
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,740
because you and Xichi lied to Huan'er

321
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,070
and upset her?

322
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,190
That kid is so stubborn.

323
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,180
Who does she take after?

324
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:11,860
Goodness.

325
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,160
Who does she take after?

326
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,110
Call Xichi and ask him.

327
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,120
She's probably fine.

328
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,020
Right, good idea.

329
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,950
I'll call Xichi.

330
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,060
(Aunt Lina)

331
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,430
Hello, Aunt Lina.

332
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,430
Xichi.

333
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,230
Xichi.

334
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,500
Is Huan'er with you?

335
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:33,830
No.

336
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,430
Didn't she contact you?

337
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,020
She hasn't messaged me all day.

338
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,860
Could something have happened to her?

339
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,230
What's wrong?

340
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
Is Chen Huan'er unreachable?

341
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,470
I've been calling,
but she won't pick up.

342
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,350
Xichi, can you find her?

343
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,740
Okay.

344
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,620
Don't panic.

345
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,440
I'll ask around.

346
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,230
Okay.

347
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,470
What's going on?

348
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,260
Huan'er.

349
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,230
Huan'er.

350
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,350
Huan'er.

351
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,230
Are you all right?

352
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,190
Do you want some water?

353
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:17,950
These...

354
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,710
Did she drink all of these?

355
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,990
This alcohol has a strong aftereffect.

356
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,110
Is she all right?

357
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,590
Huan'er.

358
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,350
What should we do?

359
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,520
Let her drink some water.

360
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,140
Huan'er.

361
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,260
I feel dizzy.

362
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,620
Chen Huan'er.

363
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,260
Your mother called you.

364
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,040
Where's your phone?

365
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:48,860
My phone...

366
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,020
My phone...

367
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,830
My phone...

368
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,430
It's in

369
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,380
my bag.

370
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,260
Right. It's here.

371
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:57,710
It's here.

372
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,620
It's in the bag.

373
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,110
I found it.

374
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,230
Sorry.

375
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,820
Her alcohol tolerance isn't great.

376
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,830
We'll leave first.

377
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,350
No battery.

378
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,620
My phone's dead.

379
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,820
Charge it when we get back.

380
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,380
Let's go.

381
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,380
We're heading off too, Qiu Li.

382
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,660
We'll leave now.

383
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,120
We're going back to the girls' dorm.

384
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,680
Goodbye.

385
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,260
Hey, pass me the bag.

386
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,780
Keep up!

387
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,470
Be careful.

388
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,350
Watch out.

389
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,310
I'll help her.

390
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,620
Slow down.

391
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,020
- Watch the stairs.
- Is she okay?

392
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,740
How did she get this drunk so fast?

393
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,540
Slow down.

394
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,470
Be careful.

395
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,520
Let's take her there

396
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,260
to rest for a bit

397
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,160
before heading back.

398
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,190
Slow down.

399
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,070
Let's go there.

400
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,710
All right.

401
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,860
Don't touch me.

402
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,180
- I'm all right.
- Be careful.

403
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,860
Other than feeling dizzy,

404
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,260
do you feel unwell anywhere else?

405
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:40,950
I'm okay.

406
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,740
Really?

407
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,710
Yes.

408
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,740
Lu.

409
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,500
I want to go back to use the bathroom.

410
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,680
Number one or number two?

411
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,860
You could go back first.

412
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,760
I'll sit here with her
until she sobers up,

413
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,740
then send her back.

414
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,350
Okay.

415
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,140
Wait.

416
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,540
Leaving her alone here

417
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,460
doesn't seem right.

418
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,950
I really can't hold it anymore.

419
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,380
I really can't.

420
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,590
Aunt Lina.

421
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,540
Don't worry, I found Huan'er.

422
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,860
Her parents know him.

423
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,660
Okay.

424
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,780
I'll take her back first.

425
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,830
Please take care of her.

426
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:14,470
Okay.

427
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,860
All right.

428
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,260
Huan'er, we're heading off now.

429
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,380
I need to go to the bathroom.

430
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,190
It's fine.

431
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,830
Just go back.

432
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,230
Okay.

433
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:20,830
Goodbye.

434
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,990
Okay. Please take care of her.

435
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,420
Goodbye.

436
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,280
I'll leave her to you.

437
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,280
Call me when you're back.

438
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,620
It's okay. I can go back myself.

439
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,990
Can you walk by yourself?

440
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,900
Yes.

441
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,860
Isn't that the dorm right there?

442
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,110
I can make it.

443
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,380
Can you? Are you sure?

444
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:49,990
Get on.

445
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,380
Just get on.

446
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,900
You're poking me. It hurts.

447
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,780
I feel like throwing up.

448
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,380
Just don't throw up on me!

449
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,230
Jing Xichi.

450
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,260
What now?

451
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,150
Take this punch from me.

452
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,910
Can you stop making people
worry about you?

453
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,820
Chen Huan'er!

454
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,190
Drinking with strangers

455
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,400
and getting this drunk,

456
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,230
are you careless

457
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,910
or just stupid?

458
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,300
Yes, I'm just stupid.

459
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,020
I'm an idiot.

460
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,150
That's why I let
you fool me for so long.

461
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,910
I just wanted to joke with you

462
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,740
and give you

463
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,710
a surprise.

464
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,300
A joke is only a joke

465
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,870
when both people

466
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,950
find it funny.

467
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,300
Do you get that?

468
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,870
Fine.

469
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,230
I'll apologize.

470
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,260
I'm sorry.

471
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,340
Okay?

472
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,540
Can you stop being

473
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,190
so childish,

474
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,100
Jing Xichi?

475
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,190
Are you saying I'm childish?

476
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,540
Does going to that social event

477
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,020
and getting drunk

478
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,200
the first time you drink

479
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,150
make you mature?

480
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,870
We're not in high school anymore.

481
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,910
We're in university.

482
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,430
I can't just stay by your side

483
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,340
all the time like before.

484
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,740
Can you stop caring about me?

485
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,260
If I don't, who will?

486
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,470
If Aunt Lina

487
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,190
hadn't called me,

488
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,500
I...

489
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,060
I wouldn't have bothered.

490
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,260
Fine!

491
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,710
From now on,

492
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,500
we'll go

493
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,630
our separate ways.

494
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,740
Don't care about me anymore.

495
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,780
I'll go back myself.

496
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,240
How are you going to walk like this?

497
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,440
Why wouldn't I be able to walk?

498
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,230
I can walk! I...

499
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,230
I can walk.

500
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,260
I... I can walk.

501
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,630
You seem to be on a shaky bridge.

502
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,880
Didn't you say you don't care about me?

503
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,740
Were you drinking fake alcohol?

504
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,910
Hello.

505
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,670
Today is the first class

506
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,780
of Medical Psychology.

507
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,300
I won't be taking attendance.

508
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,580
There's no need

509
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,630
for these formalities.

510
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,500
Everyone

511
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,820
seated in this hall today,

512
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,870
I trust you all

513
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,100
have a certain level

514
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,060
of self-discipline.

515
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,740
Those who chose clinical medicine

516
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,100
aren't here

517
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,470
to enjoy life.

518
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,470
Do we all agree on that?

519
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,740
Enough talk,

520
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,020
let's get straight to class.

521
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,860
My stomach hurts.

522
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,060
You're awake.

523
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,540
Drink some honey water.

524
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,040
You drank too much last night.

525
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,390
Li, thanks for saving

526
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,870
my life.

527
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,720
Next time, don't be so foolish.

528
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,060
If you can't drink, don't.

529
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,780
Anyway, you were pretty impressive.

530
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,190
You could get upstairs on your own.

531
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,630
Last night,

532
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,480
wasn't it you both who brought me back?

533
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,740
Don't you remember?

534
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,670
Chen Huan'er, what are you doing?

535
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,150
This is my bed!

536
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,340
Huang Lu!

537
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,820
Come get her off my bed!

538
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,340
Chen Huan'er!

539
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,670
Tonight,

540
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,100
you're staying with me.

541
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,580
Thanks.

542
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,540
Seriously,

543
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,230
Huan'er,

544
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,780
you're really strong.

545
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,670
Last night, Qiu Li and I

546
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,600
couldn't move you
no matter how hard we tried.

547
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,500
I'm really sorry.

548
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,430
I had no idea

549
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,500
I get this strong

550
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,950
when I'm drunk.

551
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,780
By the way,

552
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
last night,

553
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,780
did I do anything

554
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,710
I shouldn't have?

555
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,020
For that,

556
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,500
you'll have to ask Jing.

557
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,390
Why would I ask him?

558
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,820
He's the one who brought you back.

559
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,950
Was he...

560
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,740
Was he there last night?

561
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,060
What did you two do last night?

562
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,190
Did he do something to you,

563
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,470
or did you do something to him?

564
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,300
No way!

565
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,800
What could possibly happen between us?

566
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,710
Don't overthink it.

567
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,820
As expected,

568
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,950
buddies

569
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,390
can never become a couple.

570
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,340
It's so warm.

571
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,150
Who turned off the aircon again?

572
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,430
Who else?

573
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,540
It was the top student.

574
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,020
I woke up at midnight from the heat

575
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,910
and didn't fall back
asleep until after five.

576
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,780
Every time she
comes back, she turns it off.

577
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,460
If she doesn't like
air-conditioned rooms,

578
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,500
why doesn't she move
to the old dorms in the east?

579
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,630
Oh, right, Huan'er.

580
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,430
Tian Chi

581
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,710
called last night to ask

582
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,780
how you were.

583
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,780
You were already asleep,

584
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,820
so I didn't wake you up.

585
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,230
I charged your phone.

586
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,990
Check your message.

587
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:42,780
Thanks, Lu.

588
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,500
(Are you okay?)

589
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,300
(Huan'er, did you make it back?)

590
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,500
(Thanks, Tian Chi.)

591
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,470
(I'm fine.)

592
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,920
(Classes officially start today.)

593
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,360
(Wishing you all the best.)

594
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,910
(Where are you?)

595
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,740
(Aunt Lina is looking for you.)

596
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,020
(Recent calls: Mom - 5)

597
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,100
Oh no.

598
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,260
No, no, no.

599
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,100
(After a ridiculous drunken night,)

600
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,470
(my university life)

601
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,580
(has officially begun.)

602
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,910
(Honestly, university life isn't)

603
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,300
(very different from high school.)

604
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,490
(I still rush to class
at the last minute every day.)

605
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,580
(The only difference is)

606
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,740
(the lecturer doesn't
know every student by name.)

607
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,230
Today is a general course.

608
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,950
Let's do a random

609
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:50,950
roll call.

610
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,190
Wang Tao.

611
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,950
Yes.

612
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,230
Yang Tao.

613
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,740
Yes.

614
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,870
Sun Changhe.

615
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,340
Yes.

616
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,630
Zhou Haitao.

617
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,190
Yes.

618
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,820
Zhou Ye.

619
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,910
Yes.

620
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,740
Jing Xichi.

621
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,990
Yes.

622
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,100
He's so handsome.

623
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,260
Dong Huixin.

624
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,300
Yes.

625
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,150
Qiu Li.

626
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,910
Qiu Li.

627
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:17,910
Yes.

628
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,910
Huang Lu.

629
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,910
Yes.

630
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,300
Chen Huan'er.

631
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,580
Sir,

632
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,540
I'm here.

633
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,060
Chen Huan'er.

634
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,630
Are you

635
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,880
attending class
on behalf of three people?

636
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,820
You answered

637
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,340
three times consecutively.

638
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,150
I can't even pretend

639
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,020
not to notice anymore.

640
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,230
All three of you

641
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,670
are marked absent.

642
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,740
I...

643
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,780
Next.

644
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,260
Tang Song.

645
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,190
Yes.

646
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,870
Today, we're covering Chapter One,

647
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,230
Marxist Philosophy.

648
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,020
(It's not a great start.)

649
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,190
It has a long history.

650
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,780
The emergence

651
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,820
of Marxist philosophy

652
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,820
brought about a great revolution

653
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,230
in the history of thought.

654
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,820
In the history of human thought,

655
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,230
in terms of scientific validity,

656
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,300
truth,

657
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,020
influence,

658
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,260
and reach...

659
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,940
(What does this have to do with you?)

660
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,780
The significance of Marxism...

661
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,190
Class dismissed.

662
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,540
Um...

663
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,100
Last night,

664
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,710
how did I get back to the dorm?

665
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,150
Don't tell me you
don't remember anything.

666
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,260
You...

667
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,780
You didn't do

668
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,100
anything crazy to me, did you?

669
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
I didn't,

670
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,820
but you did plenty.

671
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,580
Jing Xichi.

672
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,150
Take this punch from me.

673
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,580
You owe me medical expenses,

674
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,260
Chen Huan'er.

675
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,990
I didn't ask for your help.

676
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,780
Besides,

677
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,470
weren't my roommates there?

678
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,840
That's exactly what you said last night.

679
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,020
From now on,

680
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,910
we're going

681
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,020
our separate ways.

682
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,780
Don't care about me anymore.

683
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,150
You're really heartless, aren't you?

684
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,230
Are you still mad?

685
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,230
It's unnecessary.

686
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,950
Huan'er.

687
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,500
Hello,

688
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,580
I'm Zhou Ye,

689
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,390
Jing's roommate.

690
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,470
Look.

691
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,000
It looks like we were meant to be

692
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,540
classmates in this general course.

693
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,260
How about

694
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,340
we add each other?

695
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,100
If you ever need anything,
just call me.

696
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,430
Who said you could call her Huan'er?

697
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,950
Aren't we all one big family?

698
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,060
No need to be so distant.

699
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,960
If she needs anything,
she can come to me.

700
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,180
What's it got to do with you?

701
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,540
Look at you.

702
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,300
There's a club
recruitment this afternoon.

703
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,240
Let's check it out.

704
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,540
No need to trouble yourself.

705
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,360
Well, don't be mad anymore.

706
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,800
This semester just starts.
Are you planning to be mad throughout?

707
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,950
Who would dare be mad at you?

708
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,670
You're a campus celebrity now.

709
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,340
That football video

710
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,430
is viral.

711
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,540
Well, that just proves

712
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,620
talent shines eventually.

713
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,990
Don't get cocky.

714
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,340
Let's go check out the club recruitment.

715
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,230
Is it this way?

716
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,420
Which club do you like?

717
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,020
Not sure yet.

718
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,870
Let's take a look.

719
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,340
Zhou Ye!

720
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,390
Du Wei.

721
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,390
Hello, Du Wei.

722
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,190
Jing,

723
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,380
this is our third-year senior,

724
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:47,740
Du Wei.

725
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,990
She's also from our course

726
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,040
and incredibly skilled.

727
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,540
She's also the head of the art
department in the student council.

728
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,740
She was there yesterday
too, don't you remember?

729
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,480
With so many people, how could I?

730
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,820
Hello, Du Wei.

731
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,990
Jing Xichi,
I've been wanting to meet you.

732
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,230
I'd like to invite you to join

733
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,580
our Computer Competition Team.

734
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,260
Are you

735
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,950
interested?

736
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,020
Of course!

737
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,380
We're definitely interested!

738
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,710
Jing. I've heard a lot
about this competition team.

739
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,100
Everyone in it is a top student.

740
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,900
That's perfect.

741
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,260
We're having a gathering later,

742
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,870
and many people

743
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,540
are curious about your current project.

744
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,500
Come along.

745
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,660
It'll be a great
chance to exchange ideas.

746
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,260
Okay.

747
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,580
I can go to the club recruitment alone.

748
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,020
Then I'll meet you

749
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,740
once I'm done.

750
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,100
Okay.

751
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,190
Sure, go ahead.

752
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,100
Let's go.

753
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,820
Goodbye.

754
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:34,540
Goodbye.

755
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,260
Let's go.

756
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:35,780
Let's go.

757
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,990
I have to tell you,

758
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,320
the Marxist Philosophy professor

759
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,520
took attendance today.

760
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,740
I answered for both of you,

761
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,190
but guess what?

762
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,820
We all got marked absent.

763
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,990
What?

764
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,820
That's so unlucky.

765
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,630
Well.

766
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,540
You two owe me a hotpot meal now.

767
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,060
That's settled. I'm hanging up.

768
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,840
Are you craving for a hotpot?

769
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,020
Tian Chi.

770
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,470
I was just joking with my roommate.

771
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,020
Did you just finish class?

772
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,390
Yes.

773
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,820
I thought I'd check
out the club recruitment.

774
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,960
What a coincidence.

775
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,630
I'm going too.

776
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,390
Let's go.

777
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,230
I'll introduce you
to the different clubs.

778
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
Thank you.

779
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,230
No problem.

780
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,740
There are so many clubs.

781
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,950
University clubs

782
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,870
can be a mixed bag.

783
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,740
If you pick the wrong one,

784
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:34,990
it's a waste of time

785
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,990
and energy.

786
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,710
Do you have

787
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,540
any hobbies?

788
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,580
If you're interested, check us out.

789
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,300
Thanks.

790
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,910
I feel like

791
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,470
I like everything,

792
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,540
but at the same time,

793
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,430
nothing in particular.

794
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,230
You once told me

795
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,820
that you have to try things

796
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,220
to know whether you like them

797
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,020
or not.

798
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,580
Do you remember that?

799
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,500
Of course.

800
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,060
Do you have any special skills?

801
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,260
I know martial arts.

802
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,120
Does our university
have a martial arts club?

803
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,020
Martial arts?

804
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,910
Why are you laughing?

805
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,870
Do you think I'm making it up

806
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,300
or that I can't do it?

807
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,150
No.

808
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,100
I believe you.

809
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,630
Unfortunately,

810
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,900
our university doesn't
have a martial arts club,

811
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,740
but you could consider joining

812
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,480
the Student Union's Sports Department.

813
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,600
It's easy to get in.

814
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,670
All right, everyone,

815
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,910
that's all for this week.

816
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,960
Same time, same place

817
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,640
next week,

818
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,540
don't be late.

819
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,060
(I'm done here.)

820
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,260
(Are you still
at the club recruitment area?)

821
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,420
Here's the application form.

822
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,300
Welcome aboard.

823
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,540
I don't think I've agreed yet.

824
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,700
Joining the competition team

825
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,350
not only improves
your professional skills

826
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,660
but also earns you extra credits.

827
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,720
Why wouldn't you want to?

828
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,990
I'll think about it.

829
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,820
Can I borrow your phone for a moment?

830
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:02,950
I've already

831
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,020
saved my number for you.

832
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,300
If you make up your mind,

833
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,470
feel free to contact me.

834
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,500
(Du Wei)

835
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,430
I've heard

836
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,910
this senior is quite the tough one.

837
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,470
Well, seeing is believing.

838
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,100
Let's go.

839
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,540
Where to?

840
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,940
Check out the club recruitment.

841
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:27,990
Class dismissed.

842
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,580
First,

843
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,500
lower his psychological guard.

844
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,390
Then?

845
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,580
Never admit that you like him.

846
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,300
You're both in Jing City.

847
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,780
You two are wanderers away from home.

848
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,390
There will always be times

849
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,990
when you study together.

850
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,580
That's your chance, isn't it?

851
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,230
Jing.

852
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,390
Is there any club you're interested in?

853
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,640
I haven't decided yet.

854
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,920
I'll take a look first.

855
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,230
Zhou Ye!

856
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,150
Zhou Ye!

857
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,020
Here.

858
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,540
Lin.

859
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,500
You're done.

860
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,150
I sent you a message just now.

861
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,150
Why didn't you reply?

862
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,060
I was busy filling out the form

863
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,910
and didn't see it.

864
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,700
Your friend joined
the sports department.

865
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,320
Consider it.

866
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,020
You can put down that you're good

867
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,540
at martial arts.

868
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,580
Oh, I almost forgot.

869
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,060
Also,

870
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,540
you're a sports lover.

871
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,100
Sports lover.

872
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,630
Write that you want
to use this opportunity

873
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,150
to make new friends.

874
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,150
Sports department?

875
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,470
What's in it for you?

876
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,950
Do you want to lead
the charge during Sports Day,

877
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,470
starting with a 1,500m run?

878
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,580
No.

879
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,040
Tian Chi told me the sports department

880
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
is pretty chill.

881
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,540
I think you're just
blinded by attraction.

882
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,580
Not again.

883
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,710
Li.

884
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,300
Which club did you join?

885
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,860
The student council's art department.

886
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,260
The arts department?

887
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,710
Nice choice.

888
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,950
Don't even try to leave.

889
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,340
Lu.

890
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,540
I have a feeling

891
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,230
that Tian Chi

892
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,500
likes you.

893
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,870
Tian Chi is the most handsome guy

894
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,020
in our faculty.

895
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,580
He's top three in his major

896
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,020
and has published in a core journal

897
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,150
with his supervisor.

898
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,260
He's even recommended

899
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,950
by a professor for a postgraduate spot.

900
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,780
He's such a perfect guy.

901
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,020
What a catch!

902
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,780
Stop talking nonsense.

903
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,580
Who's talking nonsense?

904
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,020
At the start of the semester,

905
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,740
didn't he help you carry your luggage

906
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,150
and give you his contact?

907
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,560
That's just because we went
to the same high school.

908
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,440
We're alumni.

909
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,670
Then why did he

910
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,430
accompany you
to the club recruitment today?

911
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,910
He didn't accompany me.

912
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,300
We just ran into each other.

913
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,630
He ran into so many people,

914
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,580
but why did he only

915
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,430
accompany you?

916
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,340
Li.

917
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,230
Am I right?

918
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,990
Yes.

919
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,310
Look.

920
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,270
People pursuing Qiu Li

921
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,350
are lining up
from the West Campus to the East Campus.

922
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,620
Even she thinks I have a point.

923
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,100
What do you have to say now?

924
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,540
According to

925
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,390
your logic,

926
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,270
shouldn't he

927
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,350
like Qiu Li instead?

928
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,180
Stop right there!

929
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,660
He's not my type.

930
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,270
Why are you turning off the aircon?

931
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,830
It's not that hot.

932
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,680
I think we should just turn on the fan.

933
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,660
Why use a fan

934
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,830
when we have an aircon?

935
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,140
With the aircon on,

936
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,580
the temperature inside gets too low,

937
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,400
but outside it's hot.

938
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,740
If we keep going in and out,

939
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,760
we'll catch a cold.

940
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,920
Plus, it wastes electricity.

941
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,430
Well.

942
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,350
If you don't want
to split the aircon bill

943
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,950
because you're not here often,

944
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,750
I'll pay for it myself.

945
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,350
However, I get to decide

946
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,660
when it's on.

947
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,270
Why do you

948
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,830
always boss people around?

949
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,140
Just because you have money?

950
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,700
What does this

951
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,750
have to do with money?

952
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,280
Can you stop making all of us suffer

953
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,700
just because of you?

954
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,140
It's fine.

955
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,220
It's not that hot.

956
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,420
We don't have to turn it on.

957
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:16,830
Yes.

958
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,390
We can wait until it gets hotter.

959
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,140
Here, eat something.

960
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,950
Don't be angry.

961
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,470
Go ahead

962
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,540
and sweat if you like.

963
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,270
Li.

964
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,000
You...

965
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,470
Your phone.

966
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,620
Let me take this call.

967
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,270
Hello? Qi Qi.

968
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,830
You finally remembered me.

969
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,060
How's your new life?

970
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,390
It's hard to explain.

971
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,910
I thought university

972
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,350
would be pretty chill,

973
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,350
but I didn't expect

974
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,620
so many frustrating things.

975
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,500
What about Jing Xichi?

976
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,220
He's something else.

977
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,720
He actually tricked us for so long.

978
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,750
Exactly.

979
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,100
Even Song...

980
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,840
Let's not talk about him anymore.

981
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,350
Let's stop.

982
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,310
It's okay.

983
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,390
I've let it go.

984
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,830
By the way,

985
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,620
what are you doing?

986
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:22,910
I...

987
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,430
I'm waiting for a classmate to eat.

988
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:28,990
I need to stop.

989
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,260
He just finished class.

990
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,660
He?

991
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,750
Who is he?

992
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,790
Why are you here?

993
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,220
You've been in Jing City for so long

994
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,270
and never contacted me.

995
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,700
I'm just joking.

996
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,270
I'm over

997
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,180
all that.

998
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,790
Since it's just the two of us

999
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,990
studying in Jing City,

1000
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,500
shouldn't we look out

1001
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,390
for each other

1002
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,430
as old classmates?

1003
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,660
Are you free later?

1004
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,830
I'm free.

1005
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,350
Then come with me

1006
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,340
to your university's
screening hall for a movie.

1007
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:13,990
A movie?

1008
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,910
Why not?

1009
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,100
I rarely visit your campus.

1010
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,470
Won't you even show me around?

1011
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,310
Okay.

1012
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,540
Let's go.

1013
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,700
Who's that?

1014
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,900
Why didn't you reply?

1015
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,140
It's Du Wei.

1016
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,790
She asked if I filled
out that application form.

1017
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,140
Speaking of this, I'm curious.

1018
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,140
Isn't that competition team pretty good?

1019
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,540
Why are you so against joining?

1020
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,760
It's too much hassle.

1021
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,910
Not joining is more hassle, okay?

1022
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,020
Du Wei

1023
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,440
is famous for never giving up
until she gets what she wants.

1024
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,060
What's that got to do with me?

1025
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,900
Haven't you noticed
she's got her eye on you?

1026
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,350
Keep going.

1027
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,990
What exactly has she set her sights on?

1028
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,910
Even if I'm the top student,

1029
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,220
that's only among freshmen.

1030
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,430
Even if we actually

1031
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,830
join that competition,

1032
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,220
we'll just end up

1033
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,390
doing the hardest work.

1034
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,270
That's it?

1035
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,430
That's it.

1036
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,580
Well.

1037
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,500
Should I call you naive

1038
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,620
or just plain dumb?

1039
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,870
Haven't you noticed
the way she looks at you?

1040
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,960
It's like she's about to
see right through you!

1041
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,220
So by your logic,

1042
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,620
since you pay
so much attention to her,

1043
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,990
do you like her?

1044
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,180
Can you not say things like that?

1045
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,020
It'll bring bad luck.

1046
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,960
What are you doing?

1047
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,500
I'm working out now.

1048
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,620
I have to strictly control

1049
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,620
my daily fat intake.

1050
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,580
It can only be 30%
of my total daily calories.

1051
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,500
Okay.

1052
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,270
I'll have some more of this then.

1053
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,950
What exactly are you trying to do?

1054
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,310
Let me educate you.

1055
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,060
Based on my fitness plan,

1056
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,180
not only do I need
to control my fat intake,

1057
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,540
but I also have to consume

1058
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,700
exactly 120 grams of protein a day.

1059
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,830
I've already had

1060
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,220
quite a bit.

1061
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,220
I think I'm still short
by 15 or 16 grams.

1062
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,990
What "15 grams"?

1063
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,270
I need protein too!

1064
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,020
Do you think

1065
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,180
only you need protein?

1066
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:29,790
Don't I?

1067
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,870
I put in so much effort...

1068
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,270
