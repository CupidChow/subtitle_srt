1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:20,840


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,220
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,260
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,720
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,710
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,920
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,270
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,640
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,230
   

16
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,790
How are they now?

18
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,400
No idea. I haven't heard from them yet.

19
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,920
Hello, can you take a photo of the three of us?

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,940
- Sure. 
 - Okay.

21
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,100
- Are you done? 
 - Yes.

22
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,950
- Thank you. 
 - Are the photos all right?

23
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,450
- Thank you. 
 - It's okay.

24
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,800
Were you taking photos of me?

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,575
No. I'm taking photos of the scenery.

26
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:35,450
You got it wrong.

27
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,430
Ms. Qi.

28
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,120
You studied law.

29
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,680
You should know that infringing on others' portrait rights is illegal.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,460
Mr. Song, I'm creating art.

31
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,170
You're the one who came into my shot and became my scenery.

32
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,620
Can I take a look at your artwork, then?

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,320
You can only take a look. You're not allowed to delete it.

34
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,310
Okay.

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,760
Here.

36
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,050
I didn't even see it.

37
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,180
Shall I show you again?

38
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,240
You didn't even turn on your phone. How can I see it?

39
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,680
Enough. Let's go up. The mountain is beautiful.

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,640
Hurry up.

41
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,740
 By the way, it's your birthday tomorrow. 

42
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:53,390
 I prepared a gift for you and wanted to give it to you privately. 

43
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,990
 What gift? 

44
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,440
 Since it's a gift, of course I have to keep some mystery. 

45
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,420
 You'll find out tomorrow. 

46
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,900
There doesn't seem to be much to see in this ancient town.

47
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,430
Yeah.

48
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,040
Well... Let's sit for a while.

49
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,520
Sure.

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,500
Let's sit for a while.

51
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,970
I wonder how they're doing.

52
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,620
Yes.

53
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,590
Do you think maybe we should

54
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,990
slow down on that "shared room" plan?

55
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,180
Might be a bit too much.

56
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,350
You're right.

57
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,020
Cong probably wouldn't be okay with it.

58
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:01,792
Even I'm not sure I'd be okay with it.

59
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,610
I meant Song Cong wouldn't be okay with it.

60
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,340
Is it cold?

61
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,630
No.

62
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,110
I told you to wear extra clothes when you go out.

63
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,220
It's so cold outside.

64
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,220
Here, wear mine.

65
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,110
No need, it's okay.

66
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,900
Won't you feel cold if you give it to me?

67
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,430
I'm not cold.

68
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,370
I'm an athlete.

69
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,970
It's really hot today.

70
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,650
Qi Qi.

71
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,110
Song Cong looked happy when he came back today.

72
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,900
What did you do?

73
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,430
We didn't do anything.

74
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,020
We just strolled around.

75
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,260
Maybe people become happy when they're in an open space.

76
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,260
What about you and Jing Xi Chi?

77
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,770
You two have been acting weird since we got back.

78
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,680
Did you argue again?

79
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,570
No.

80
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,290
Haven't we always been like this?

81
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:26,920
It's a little strange.

82
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,660
What's strange?

83
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,260
Go to sleep.

84
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,370
You keep tossing and turning like a pancake.

85
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,770
I'm just not used to new beds. I can't sleep.

86
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,160
I haven't even started on you.

87
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,698
Couldn't you book a twin room?

88
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:25,390
Boss, I would have booked one if there was any available.

89
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,110
You think I want to sleep in the same bed with you?

90
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,880
Go upstairs and share a room with Qi Qi then.

91
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,610
I think you want to share a room with Chen Huan Er.

92
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,630
I haven't started on you two during the day.

93
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,490
What was that with the faucets and shower heads?

94
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,900
Go to sleep, okay? You're naggy and annoying.

95
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,900
What kind of gifts do you think need to be given privately?

96
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,570
Does Qi Qi want to give you a gift privately?

97
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,480
No. No.

98
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,220
I'm just asking.

99
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,750
Well, I think if a girl wants to give you something privately,

100
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,700
it means she's too embarrassed to give it publicly.

101
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:26,370
Right? For example, a hug or maybe... a kiss.

102
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,700
What do you mean, a kiss?

103
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,660
Go to sleep.

104
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,070
It's cold at night. Don't catch a cold.

105
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,480
I've told you everything I need to say. You can decide for yourself.

106
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,740
 Are you okay? 

107
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,980
I probably caught a chill from the night breeze yesterday.

108
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
I have a bit of a cold.

109
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,310
I'm all right.

110
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,050
Cong.

111
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,570
I'm really sorry.

112
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,310
Today is your birthday.

113
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,030
I can't go out and have fun with you.

114
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,070
It's all right.

115
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,700
You don't have to keep guarding me.

116
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,340
It puts me under a lot of psychological pressure.

117
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:30,640
I really don’t want to be the reason you all miss out on enjoying yourselves.

118
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,980
Really.

119
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,910
Go have fun.

120
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,970
Don't mind me.

121
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,790
Yeah, you should go.

122
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,650
I'll stay here alone to take care of him.

123
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,220
Hurry.

124
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,400
Well... Let's go then.

125
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,290
- Go. 
 - Go.

126
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,220
- Here. Cover up. 
 - We'll get going then.

127
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,940
Sure.

128
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,090
Let's go.

129
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,550
Cong.

130
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,490
Have fun.

131
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,950
Have fun.

132
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,201
Keep an eye on him.

133
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:08,021
Let's go.

134
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,910
Not bad.

135
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,500
Your acting is good.

136
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,690
Get up. They're all gone. Hurry.

137
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,030
Get up, Jing Xi Chi.

138
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,480
- Ms. Warrior. 
 - What's the matter?

139
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,030
Spare me. I... I really have a fever.

140
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,100
Stop pretending.

141
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,010
I'm not pretending.

142
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,790
You really have a fever.

143
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,890
- Really. 
 - Lie down.

144
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,490
I'm a patient now. Be a little gentler with me.

145
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,790
Drink some water.

146
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,340
Here.

147
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,610
Drink slowly.

148
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,440
I brought medicine. I'll get it for you in a moment.

149
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,030
Are you hungry?

150
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,850
Yes.

151
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,050
There's a kitchen here. I'll make something for you.

152
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,479
You can only eat something light.

153
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,480
Is preserved egg and lean meat porridge okay?

154
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,620
I can eat porridge.

155
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,082
Sure. Wait here.

156
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,650
Huan Er.

157
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:16,620
Add more preserved eggs for me and sprinkle some pepper.

158
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,980
You have so many requests. Wait here.

159
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,650
Wait here.

160
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,540
Jing Xi Chi, you...

161
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,610
It's good that your fever has reduced.

162
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,790
 If you like someone and they touch you, even accidentally, would you feel uncomfortable? 

163
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,460
 When you like someone, you just want to hug and hold them all the time. 

164
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,340
What are you doing?

165
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,700
What are you doing?

166
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,450
I... I was just sitting here and you suddenly grabbed my hand.

167
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,000
Are you a pervert?

168
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,130
You creep.

169
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,600
I was dreaming.

170
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,930
I dreamt of our politics teacher.

171
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,130
I was begging him not to fail me.

172
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,150
I... I don't even know why...

173
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,970
Sorry.

174
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,583
Look at you. You don't behave even in your dreams.

175
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,930
Our politics teacher is a man. You want to hold his hand?

176
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,490
I was begging him.

177
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,820
Well...

178
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,210
The porridge is ready.

179
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,490
Get up and eat it.

180
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,650
Here.

181
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,760
What are you doing?

182
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,430
Am I not a patient?

183
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,820
I have no energy.

184
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,100
Eat it yourself.

185
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,620
It won't taste good when it's cold. Hurry.

186
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,210
 Have my feelings reached this level? 

187
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,120
 I want to hold her hand even in my dreams. 

188
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,580
 How dangerous. 

189
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,670
Are you okay?

190
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,970
I'm fine.

191
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,700
There's so much pepper.

192
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,850
- What's the matter? 
 - Sit down.

193
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,500
Your gift.

194
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,260
Open it and have a look.

195
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,010
I saw online that the stethoscope is the greatest medical invention of the 19th century.

196
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,930
I think it suits you.

197
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,130
I believe you'll become a brilliant doctor.

198
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,980
Thank you.

199
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,820
I love it.

200
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,530
Try it on.

201
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,120
I was afraid that they would be noisy.

202
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,020
That's why I asked you out alone.

203
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,820
Is it here?

204
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,410
Can you hear it clearly?

205
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,610
Yes.

206
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,370
I want to hear it too.

207
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,950
Okay.

208
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,570
What you're hearing now is the mitral valve area.

209
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,580
It's where the heartbeat is strongest.

210
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,650
And...

211
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:09,060
the second intercostal space on the left side of the sternum is the pulmonary valve area.

212
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,260
Further down...

213
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,890
I want to ask you something.

214
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,260
What is it?

215
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,260
Your heart right now is beating really fast.

216
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:05,210
Do you... also like me?

217
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,980
Thank you.

218
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,610
Thank you.

219
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,450
- Are these enough? 
 - Yes.

220
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,220
- Where shall we sit? 
 - Here.

221
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,160
- Did you bring your gift? 
 - Yes.

222
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,260
Go there.

223
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,250
It's so cold.

224
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,870
Give him a glass.

225
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,590
- Are we drinking? 
 - Have a drink.

226
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,160
You can't drink. You took antibiotics.

227
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,590
Right, I took some.

228
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,260
Is it that serious?

229
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,010
- Did you have a fever? 
 - Yes.

230
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,120
- How high? 
 - 38.5°C.

231
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,210
That high?

232
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,910
- It's better now. The fever is gone. 
 - His fever has subsided.

233
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,340
Huan Er is so caring.

234
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,260
Basic stuff.

235
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,640
Cong.

236
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,350
This is the birthday present I bought for you.

237
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,850
A small can of coffee as a token of my respect.

238
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,340
I heard medical school students stay up late every day.

239
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,250
You can use it to refresh yourself at night.

240
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,820
- You gave me coffee to stay up late? 
 - Yeah.

241
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,670
How stingy.

242
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,910
This coffee is expensive.

243
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,300
- Do you know how much it is? 
 - How much?

244
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,000
You'd better not know. It's expensive.

245
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,460
- I'm really curious. How much is it? 
 - How much is it?

246
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,667
- Several hundred. 
 - Several hundred?

247
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,120
Check out mine.

248
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,390
It's a human anatomy chart.

249
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,885
- Here. Take it. 
 - And you say I'm stingy?

250
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:39,240
You gave him a book. It's his 19th birthday, for crying out loud!

251
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,940
There's knowledge in it! It's a whole academic vibe!

252
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,810
It's his 19th birthday, and you gave him a book.

253
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,780
What's wrong? Are books not okay?

254
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,560
- Sea of knowledge. 
 - No. Pretty good.

255
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,361
You should drink less coffee and rest more.

256
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,580
This is resting?

257
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,810
It's okay. Thank you both.

258
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,670
Thank you both. Thank you.

259
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,670
I like it very much.

260
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,770
Qi Qi, what about you?

261
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,566
What gift did you prepare?

262
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,716
Me?

263
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,740
I gave him a stethoscope.

264
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,890
- Yes. 
 - Nothing fancy.

265
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,940
It's practical.

266
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,420
- A stethoscope is good. 
 - Yes.

267
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,790
- Stethoscopes let you listen to the heartbeat. 
 - A stethoscope is good.

268
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,570
- All doctors need it. 
 - Yes.

269
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,030
- Well... 
 - Let's drink.

270
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,790
- Drink. 
 - Drink.

271
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,660
- Drink. 
 - Drink.

272
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,310
Drink up.

273
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,700
- Drink. 
 - I'll open it for you.

274
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,500
- Yes. 
 - Sure.

275
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,750
 Did you two not have fun today? 

276
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,980
Why do I feel like you two are feeling down?

277
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,080
- Do we? 
 - No.

278
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,900
We had fun. We had fun.

279
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,940
What did you two do today?

280
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,640
- We... We... 
 - We took a walk around that hill in the back.

281
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,210
Then... Well...

282
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,487
- Is that all? 
 - That hill is beautiful.

283
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:52,070
- You two should check it out tomorrow. 
 - Did you take photos?

284
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,070
Yes.

285
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,640
It's just that...

286
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,940
- I'm going to open this, guys. 
 - Open it.

287
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,070
Slow down.

288
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,310
Slow down.

289
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,510
- Sorry. 
 - I'm nervous.

290
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,660
That's a deceptive move.

291
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,510
Here.

292
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,650
- Drink it. 
 - Happy birthday.

293
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,830
Give it to me.

294
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,550
Thank you.

295
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,570
I'll get you hot water.

296
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,610
Waiter, do you have hot water?

297
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,840
Pour him hot water.

298
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,330
I'll bring the pot.

299
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,550
Here's the glass.

300
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,420
- It's okay. Take this. 
 - Okay.

301
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,420
Can I take this?

302
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,600
Sure.

303
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,140
Drink more hot water.

304
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,510
- Here. 
 - We wish...

305
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,890
We wish Mr. Song...

306
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,350
- happy birthday! 
 - Happy birthday!

307
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,290
Thank you.

308
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,590
- What? What's wrong? 
 - You brought boiling water?

309
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,790
I didn't.

310
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,700
No. Is it that hot?

311
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,660
Try it yourself.

312
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,870
- You're adding more? 
 - Fine, I'll pour you some more.

313
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,900
Let it cool for a while.

314
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,270
 Class is starting. 

315
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,940
Mr. Xu is going abroad for further studies. I'll teach the last few classes.

316
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,560
My last name is Qiu, not Chou.

317
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,380
Please don't call me by the wrong name.

318
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,030
A brief analysis on the development of innovative anti-tumor drugs.

319
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,940
The name of this class is a bit long, but it's nothing compared to the gene sequence.

320
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,029
If we laid out all the nucleotides in an adult's cells,

321
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:33,620
it could roughly circle the Earth 2.68 million times.

322
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,070
This number is huge.

323
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,310
Right?

324
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,980
But I've always believed that the greatest knowledge...

325
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,240
 A new semester has begun. 

326
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,840
 The tug of war between Qi Qi and Song Cong continues. 

327
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,850
 But I have a hunch there will be results soon. 

328
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,520
 As for me and Jing Xi Chi, it’s much more uneventful. 

329
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,220
 We're both busy chasing our own paths. 

330
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,830
Jing Xi Chi.

331
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,380
Your website's client system needs an upgrade.

332
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,050
The user experience is so bad.

333
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,280
How did you know I have a website?

334
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,380
How could I not know your little secret?

335
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,470
You'd better check it.

336
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,780
You've got loads of unanswered messages in the backend.

337
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,460
Yeah, I noticed. I'm working on it now.

338
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,220
How about I help?

339
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,020
This is simple.

340
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,980
Look.

341
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,460
Not bad, you even know about this?

342
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,420
Of course. My score isn't much lower than yours.

343
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,260
Thanks.

344
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,110
Do you need help?

345
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,760
Yes. But I have no money.

346
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,030
It doesn't matter. No need to pay me.

347
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,660
With our relationship, just make it up to me when you're rich.

348
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,180
Help!

349
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,620
They all say that choosing courses is easy, but the end of the semester is a disaster.

350
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,140
Looks like our senior is right.

351
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,900
We have to learn something that's easy to get high scores.

352
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,700
This is all from experience.

353
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,870
Never mind.

354
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,870
I'll go to the library tomorrow to study hard.

355
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,660
If I can score 60, I'm happy.

356
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,070
No.

357
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,700
Didn't Professor Qiu say

358
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,070
the scores must be calculated according to the normal distribution?

359
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,770
You need 75 points to pass.

360
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:37,070
Today, let's send off the fairy, Huang Lu, together.

361
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,510
In her final moments, she left us with these words:

362
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,530
Humans should not learn pharmacy.

363
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,887
You're using a programming language to build pre-trained models...

364
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,957
You're quite hardcore.

365
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,030
Hello. I'm Fu Ying from Year 4.

366
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,700
- Hello. 
 - We met before at the orientation.

367
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
Are you free now?

368
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,310
Let's go out and have a chat.

369
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,877
- Sure. 
 - I'll wait for you outside then.

370
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:32,570
Sure.

371
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,770
Let's go.

372
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,770
Hello, Fu Ying. Is there something you need from me?

373
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,110
You founded the Yangwu website, right?

374
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,350
- Yes. 
 - I'm currently interning at a tech company.

375
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,250
Have you ever thought about developing Yangwu into a profit-making website?

376
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,940
I can introduce you to our company.

377
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,660
Thank you, Fu Ying. But I just did it for fun.

378
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,770
You really don't want to think about it?

379
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,110
I'm actually quite optimistic about your website.

380
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,700
- I'll think about it. 
 - How about I give you my number?

381
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,160
Let me know when you've made up your mind.

382
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,040
Sure.

383
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,220
- Let me help you. 
 - Okay.

384
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,830
All right.

385
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,510
- Okay. 
 - I'll wait for your news.

386
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,040
Sure. Well...

387
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,940
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

388
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,590
Qiu Li!

389
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,690
Something happened.

390
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,880
Something big happened.

391
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,870
What happened?

392
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,970
Jing Xi Chi kissed his female senior in the library.

393
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,110
Really?

394
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,450
- Really. 
 - Don't believe her nonsense.

395
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,040
Look.

396
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,650
They didn't kiss each other.

397
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,210
They'll kiss each other soon.

398
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,550
I'm telling you.

399
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,140
They were this close.

400
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,590
Really?

401
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,970
Then what?

402
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,930
Then, he went out with her.

403
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:10,750
Why do you think Jing Xi Chi is so popular with female seniors?

404
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:16,290
What do you think he did with her outside?

405
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,520
Guys!

406
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,110
Look at this good stuff.

407
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,900
What is it?

408
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,740
Real exam papers.

409
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,900
Really?

410
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,030
Yes.

411
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,830
I bought them at a high price from a senior.

412
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,280
It can't be fake. It's exactly the same as the exam questions.

413
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,860
Why would you be so kind to share it with us?

414
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,755
   

415
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:53,590
You're a devoted believer. How could you think that way? Look.

416
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,750
Something's wrong.

417
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,110
What's wrong?

418
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,620
Why are there only questions?

419
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,710
What about the answers?

420
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,570
Here. Let me see.

421
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,770
What are you doing?

422
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,730
Aren't the answers here?

423
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,350
He's the answer.

424
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,420
What answer?

425
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,380
Take a look.

426
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,500
Jing. Flashlight.

427
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,030
What's this?

428
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,550
Exam questions. It's real.

429
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,420
How is it? Is it difficult?

430
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,750
It's quite difficult.

431
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,050
Two questions are beyond the syllabus.

432
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,460
Answers.

433
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,880
My only answer.

434
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,180
Solve it for me.

435
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,700
Sure.

436
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,870
But you have to give me a copy after I solve it for you.

437
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,900
I need it.

438
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,030
Sure.

439
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,310
All right.

440
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,370
 Thank you. 

441
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,350
It's over.

442
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,770
I'm done for.

443
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:28,620
Why is every page full of key points?

444
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,720
Math.

445
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,310
You eventually became something I hate.

446
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,520
I thought it was okay when I was attending the lectures.

447
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,180
Why is it that when I solve it, I end up knowing nothing?

448
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,932
Well... I have a set of exam papers here.

449
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:50,560
It's said to be an actual advanced mathematics exam paper.

450
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,700
- Do you want to check it out? 
 - Good job, Top Student.

451
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Why didn't you take out this good stuff sooner?

452
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,699
This exam paper looks like the real deal.

453
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:02,450
- Let me take a look. 
 - A friend gave it to me.

454
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,870
I didn't think it was reliable. That's why I didn't give it to you.

455
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,110
Just take it as a reference. Don't believe it completely.

456
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,530
You can only feel secure by relying on yourself in exams.

457
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,290
Isn't this Jing Xi Chi's handwriting?

458
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,110
You must have seen it wrong.

459
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,600
No way.

460
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,030
I can recognize his handwriting even if they turn to ashes.

461
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,250
He always writes this word long.

462
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,380
And these dots.

463
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,980
He's always leaving dots when he’s thinking through a sentence.

464
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,310
Did Jing Xi Chi give this to you?

465
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,510
But why did Jing Xi Chi give it to you and not to Huan Er?

466
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,210
Could it be...

467
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,250
Could it be that you and Jing Xi Chi are having a secret relationship?

468
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,650
- No. 
 - You're indeed the oldest here.

469
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,160
So all that stuff with Fu Ying and Du Wei...

470
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,830
- Turns out they're all covers for you and Jing Xi Chi. 
 - No.

471
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,970
Ms. Chen Huan Er.

472
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,730
Do you know that your roommate is dating your childhood friend?

473
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,240
I'm not dating Jing Xi Chi.

474
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,860
That means Jing Xi Chi is pursuing you.

475
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,800
- No. 
 - Tell the truth.

476
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,070
What is it then?

477
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,940
Stop guessing.

478
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,140
It's not Jing Xi Chi.

479
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,380
It's... it's Zhou Ye.

480
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,090
 Zhou Ye? 

481
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,270
Tell us!

482
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,610
When did you two get together?

483
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,180
You can tell them.

484
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,030
Just last month.

485
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,040
I wanted to wait until things were more stable before telling you all.

486
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,290
Don't you like top students?

487
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,750
Well, he was pretty good in high school but...

488
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,690
kind of stopped studying in college.

489
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,600
Looks like when it comes to the person you like, all standards become unimportant.

490
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,550
Enough. Stop speaking.

491
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,420
Here, Hui Xin.

492
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,900
It's okay, Hui Xin.

493
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,730
If you really like top students, I'll pick up my studies again.

494
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,870
It's not like I can't learn, right?

495
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,980
- How sweet. 
 - Shouldn't you encourage him?

496
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,170
Enough. They're making me feel embarrassed.

497
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,150
By the way, this is for you.

498
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,980
Look at her.

499
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,520
- Jeez. 
 - You only remembered me

500
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,900
after Zhou Ye gave it away.

501
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,540
What's their relationship?

502
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,130
- How is it the same as ours? 
 - The two of us...

503
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,550
Don't be ungrateful. Give it to me if you don't want it.

504
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,040
I want it.

505
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,420
She told me yesterday that you wrote it overnight.

506
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,240
Thank you.

507
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,150
I was worried you wouldn't do well on the exam or enjoy your new year.

508
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,580
But I think this exam paper isn't that reliable.

509
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,520
Just use it as a reference.

510
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,760
You still have to study hard on your own.

511
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,940
I feel like I've been reduced to where you have to remind me to study hard.

512
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,250
What are you laughing at?

513
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:36,200
 Your heart right now is beating really fast. 

514
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,610
 Do you... 

515
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,690
 also like me? 

516
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,970
 Are you free tomorrow? 

517
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,780
 Can we meet? 

518
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,250
Actually, it's getting late.

519
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,530
I'm going to head back now.

520
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,090
Qi Qi.

521
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:47,780
I already have the answer to the question you asked me the other day.

522
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,420
After coming back from the ancient town, I considered it for a long time.

523
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:59,730
I think my heartbeat was telling the truth.

524
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,130
Qi Qi.

525
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,760
Let's be together.

526
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,400
♫  The melody in your name  ♫

527
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,400
♫  Is a mark left by pen and paper  ♫

528
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,650
♫  Writing down the meaning of growing up  ♫

529
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:25,630
♫  But back then, I lacked the courage  ♫

530
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,900
You don't know how nervous I was on my way here.

531
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,610
I thought you would reject me.

532
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,420
♫  How many encounters have we had?  ♫

533
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,180
♫  How much effort must I make  ♫

534
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,920
♫  For you to finally notice?  ♫

535
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,460
Sorry for making you worry.

536
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,180
♫  Hiding my secrets deep inside  ♫

537
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,860
♫  Like the feelings in my diary  ♫

538
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,410
♫  Afraid you might read them  ♫

539
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,320
   

540
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,280
Hello, Qi Qi? What's up?

541
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,610
 Huan Er, I want to tell you something. 

542
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,070
Go ahead.

543
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,050
Song Cong and I are a couple now.

544
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,160
What?

545
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,700
Wait. How did you get together? How did it happen?

546
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,730
Who confessed?

547
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,250
How should I put it?

548
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,500
Just tell me the key points, Qi Qi.

549
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,800
Do you remember the last time I asked Song Cong to go to the hill alone?

550
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,250
I gave him a stethoscope.

551
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,860
I kissed him.

552
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,530
I knew something happened between you two that night.

553
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,920
I asked you, and you didn't say anything!

554
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,350
 It wasn't that day. 

555
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,100
 It was after we got back that Song Cong confessed to me. 

556
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:06,350
I just feel super happy now. But it's also kind of... unreal?

557
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,540
I can't explain how it feels.

558
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,830
 I understand. 

559
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,320
 All that matters is that you're happy. 

560
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,920
Honestly, I can smell your love through the phone.

561
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,060
I'm telling you, Liao Xin Yan's dating guide really works.

562
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,170
 I got him in just one month. 

563
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,460
No way.

564
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,290
You used Liao Xin Yan's dating guide?

565
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,350
 I have something else to do, so I'll stop talking. Bye. 

566
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,210
No, Qi...

567
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,420
- Hello? 
 - I've got a bombshell for you.

568
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,940
Go ahead.

569
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,880
- Song Cong and Qi Qi are a couple now. 
 - What?

570
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,630
They're a couple now?

571
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,670
Do you remember the night we were in the mountains?

572
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,000
The two of them...

573
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,610
That night, the two of them...

574
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,000
You know...

575
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,130
What is it?

576
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,980
You know what I mean!

577
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,020
Scumbag.

578
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,120
I knew it.

579
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,780
He didn't even let me finish.

580
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,790
Hello?

581
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,420
 Scumbag. 

582
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,190
- How can you be one step ahead of me? 
 - What are you talking about?

583
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,980
No, weren't you lying next to me that night? When did you go out?

584
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,890
I didn't go out.

585
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,060
You still won't admit it. You're really a scumbag.

586
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,230
 I'm telling you. 

587
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:50,230
As your buddy, since you two have already done it, you must treat her well, okay?

588
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,730
I'm hanging up. Scumbag.

589
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:04,200
   

590
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,290
   

591
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,710
Don't be so cocky.

592
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,870
Extreme joy may lead to sorrow.

593
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,100
That can't happen.

594
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,020
I'm telling you, I've engraved that exam paper in my mind.

595
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,190
Don't you have any doubt about its authenticity?

596
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,480
No, think about it.

597
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,339
If he sold it to me for 50 yuan, I'd doubt it, right?

598
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:32,540
But he sold it to me for 500 yuan. Would he sell a fake one for 500?

599
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,100
All right, let's start the exam.

600
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,090
Pass the exam papers to the students at the back.

601
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,940
Why is it completely different?

602
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,050
That fraud.

603
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,980
Not going to lie,

604
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,020
that test paper Zhou Ye gave us was legendary.

605
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,730
It had nothing to do with the real exam, and it flawlessly avoided every actual topic.

606
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,460
I couldn't even use one formula.

607
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,420
Good thing the questions weren’t too hard. I think I got all the basics.

608
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,270
Should be enough, right?

609
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,500
It's my fault.

610
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,940
I shouldn't have listened to Zhou Ye and given you the exam paper.

611
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,650
What does it have to do with you?

612
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,750
Never apologize for a man's mistake.

613
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,790
That's right.

614
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,150
You only did it because you were worried we'd all fail.

615
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:44,580
If you really want to make it up to us, just help us study hard for the retake.

616
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,310
Yes!

617
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,460
- No problem. 
 - Let's go. I'll buy you a meal.

618
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,940
- Thank you, Li. 
 - What do you want to eat?

619
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,610
Meat.

620
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:05,840
