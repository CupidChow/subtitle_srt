15
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,670
Du Wei, here's the schedule for tonight.

18
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,120
All right, let me take a look.

19
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,240
Hey, the skit might be delayed a little.

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,950
Okay.

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,160
This spot should be fine.

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,340
Try to maintain it for now.

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,380
Du Wei, does this outfit look good on him?

24
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,790
You should button up your blazer.

25
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,120
I can do it myself.

26
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,800
Everyone has been working hard these days.

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Let's take a group photo together.

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,950
All right.

29
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,200
Everyone, move closer to the center. 
    

30
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,690
Jing, look at the camera.

31
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,620
Three, two, one.

32
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,720
Great.

33
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,040
Don't be nervous.

34
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,340
Everyone has worked hard.

35
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,150
Okay.

36
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,480
Yeah. 
    

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,640
Here's the handbook. 
    

38
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,550
You can't find the place?

39
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,550
Okay, I can come and fetch you. Where are you?

40
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,640
Have some water.

41
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,610
Thanks, senior.

42
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,920
The event is about to start, and only two people are here.

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,130
Maybe it's too far away, so they don't want to come.

44
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,180
Huan Er, look!

45
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,320
   

46
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,270
Are they declaring their relationship officially?

47
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,310
   

48
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,270
Reporting in!

49
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,270
Coach Chen, member number one is here to report!

50
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,080
Are you surprised? Is this unexpected? Coach Chen.

51
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,444
- Hello. 
 - Coach Chen,

52
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:53,300
you should protect our dignity as men later.

53
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,970
Why are you just standing there? Are we not welcome?

54
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,800
Welcome, come on in! Please come in.

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,220
Let's find a seat!

56
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,380
   

57
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:32,100
   

58
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,670
   

59
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,241
Now, our Women's Self-Defense Activity Club officially begins its first gathering!

60
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:41,731
Great!

61
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,640
When facing sexual harassment, many women are taught to self-reflect.

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,520
Was I being too flirty?

63
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,450
Was my outfit too revealing?

64
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,960
Did I release the wrong signals?

65
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,281
The purpose of this event is not to promote violence as a solution,

66
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:03,610
but to teach some basic self-defense techniques

67
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,370
so that when facing danger, we can protect ourselves.

68
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,160
Yeah. That's right!

69
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,860
Women's self-defense is all about practicality.

70
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,230
There are no fixed moves or specific environments or timing required.

71
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,760
Everything is aimed at escape as the ultimate goal.

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,150
Now, we need a male volunteer to help demonstrate with me.

73
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,690
Then...

74
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,060
I'll do it.

75
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,860
All right. Zhou Ye, please come on here.

76
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,370
- Zhou Ye, please stand here. 
 - Okay.

77
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,520
In most cases, women will face much stronger attackers.

78
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,940
When we are grabbed...

79
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,420
Come on, Zhou Ye. Grab me.

80
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,280
All right.

81
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,740
We must take advantage of the moment and let him...

82
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,680
Well done! Coach Chen made a good demonstration.

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,990
Did everyone see that clearly?

84
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,060
Yes.

85
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,150
Now, we will pair up and practice.

86
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,860
- Okay. 
 - Grab a mat, everyone.

87
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,640
Hey, don't leave!

88
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,280
We're just observing. 
    

89
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,450
You may continue learning it.

90
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,990
Don't leave.

91
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,720
Don't leave.

92
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,180
That was awkward.

93
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,350
Zhou Ye, your acting was too fake.

94
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,030
You scared them all off.

95
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,400
You...

96
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,670
You guys arranged this?

97
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,370
No, no. Not at all.

98
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,420
Don't be discouraged! Let's practice on our own.

99
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,710
I want to learn that move.

100
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,940
Learn?

101
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,120
Huan Er trained so hard, but not to teach you!

102
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,135
Learn what?

103
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,640
The move was designed to defend against you, and you want to learn it?

104
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,790
Huan Er, don't give up.

105
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,960
We did our best.

106
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,160
It's fine, Huan Er. It's fine.

107
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,690
Is this the Women's Self-Defense Activity Club?

108
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,990
The event isn't over yet, right?

109
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,260
- Yeah. 
 - Come in, everyone!

110
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,100
- Hurry up! 
 - Feel free to sit anywhere.

111
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,465
Just come in and find your seat.

112
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:10,402
- Come in. 
 - Yeah.

113
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:11,740
There are still some seats behind.

114
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,470
- Here! 
 - More people are coming.

115
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,820
Welcome!

116
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,450
Come in.

117
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,620
Friends, feel free to sit anywhere.

118
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,910
Friends, come in.

119
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,670
Come in.

120
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,620
   

121
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,450
 Welcome everyone! 

122
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,060
   

123
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,230
Are you okay?

124
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,160
Did everyone see that clearly?

125
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,872
Now, let's move on to the next demonstration.

126
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,220
What? There's more?

127
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,840
- Yeah. 
 - No, I can't do it anymore.

128
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,200
There's a little more, just...

129
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,114
Let's switch to someone else.

130
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:48,180
- Do me a favor. 
 - No way! I can't do it anymore.

131
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,620
- I... 
 - Then...

132
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,120
My back isn't in good condition.

133
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,130
- Lin, maybe youâ€” 
 - No, no, no.

134
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,500
I'll do it then.

135
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,420
Thank you, Tian Chi.

136
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,940
The upcoming scenario is something women often face.

137
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,740
If an attacker grabs you from behind, what can you do?

138
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,110
Tian Chi, please hold me from behind.

139
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,080
Well... This is not appropriate.

140
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,380
It's fine. This is just a demonstration.

141
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,820
Okay.

142
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,060
   

143
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,180
If an attacker grabs you from behind and...

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,660
   

145
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,700
   

146
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,250
   

147
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,720
   

148
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,620
What are you doing here?

149
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,260
Tian Chi, this demonstration is too risky.

150
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,740
Let me do it instead.

151
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,680
No need to trouble you.

152
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,400
I thought you weren't coming.

153
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,340
Didn't we agree that I'd be your personal punching bag?

154
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,310
I'll do it.

155
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,110
Thanks.

156
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,270
Thank you, Tian Chi.

157
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,580
All right.

158
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,590
Let's begin.

159
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,230
Let's start.

160
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,830
Let's continue.

161
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,830
Chen Huan Er is amazing.

162
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,590
She just crushed two guys at once.

163
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,090
No, it's three.

164
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,690
There's one more, Zhou Ye.

165
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:58,720
   

166
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,260
What's wrong?

167
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,324
- What should I do? 
 - Didn't you see it just now?

168
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:05,540
Grab me from behind.

169
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,090
Okay.

170
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,740
   

171
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:23,110
If an attacker grabs you from behind, and has bad intentions, you must...

172
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,860
That's the triple counter!

173
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,500
   

174
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,660
Are you okay?

175
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,830
- I'm fine. 
 - Come on!

176
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,610
Lock my neck. Yes, choke me.

177
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,920
Watch closely.

178
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,830
   

179
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,860
This is called "Dragon Eye Gouge."

180
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,920
Come on, grab my hair.

181
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,260
Hurry up.

182
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,590
K.O.

183
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,110
Thank you.

184
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,440
- Stay safe. 
 - Be careful.

185
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,660
- Bye. 
 - Take care.

186
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,020
Hope to see you next time.

187
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,850
Bye.

188
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,850
Bye.

189
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,820
Bye.

190
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,640
You're awesome, Huan Er.

191
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,210
You amazed me.

192
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,440
Did you learn it?

193
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,890
Yes, I did.

194
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,240
You're impressive!

195
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,740
- Are you okay? 
 - Of course, I'm fine.

196
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,440
Well, everyone worked very hard today. How about we go out for a meal together?

197
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,220
It's on me.

198
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,150
Hello, Du Wei?

199
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,800
It's my treat! Don't fight with me on this.

200
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,730
All right. Let's take advantage of Lin's generosity.

201
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,780
Where did you learn all that?

202
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,500
- I underwent training before this. 
 - So cool!

203
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,340
- I'll teach you more when we get back. 
 - Sure. Teach me one more time.

204
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,250
Huan Er, I might not be able to join you all for dinner later.

205
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,050
I have to go.

206
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,760
Huan Er, let's go.

207
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,130
Okay.

208
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,490
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

209
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,370
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

210
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,100
All right.

211
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,020
We'll go to wash up first.

212
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,570
Okay.

213
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,140
What's wrong? You seem down.

214
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,760
Nothing.

215
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,590
I think Jing Xi Chi feels a little different.

216
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,350
Do you feel kind of distant from him?

217
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,110
That's normal.

218
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,540
Friends are always temporary.

219
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,710
Even if at some point you were close enough to share the same pair of pants,

220
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:33,350
one day they'll just become a name in your contacts.

221
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,830
Back in high school, someone told me the same thing.

222
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,290
I didn't believe it then.

223
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,040
Now you do?

224
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,410
Not entirely.

225
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,990
We'll grow up, after all.

226
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:57,890
Different majors and different social circles mean there are fewer common topics.

227
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,190
Don't believe me? Think about it: do you still keep in touch

228
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,260
with your elementary or middle school classmates?

229
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,830
Not really.

230
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,260
See.

231
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,930
That's just reality.

232
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,620
But it's not a bad thing.

233
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,190
Some people leave, but new ones will slowly become part of your life.

234
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,230
For instance, you encounter me now, Huan Er.

235
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,990
So... is there something between you and Tian Chi?

236
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,540
Tian Chi doesn't like me that way.

237
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,070
Come on. He went all out helping with the Women's Self-Defense Activity Club event.

238
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,350
And you say he doesn't like you?

239
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,810
He just thinks that the event is meaningful.

240
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,540
You're so oblivious, Chen Huan Er.

241
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,480
Look, Tian Chi is gentle and considerate.

242
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,920
He's also handsome and academically outstanding.

243
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,370
But you really have no affection for him?

244
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,590
- I know he is nice, butâ€” 
 - No buts!

245
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,590
See, you think he is nice too.

246
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,860
So, why not give it a try?

247
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,710
Love is all about practicing love.

248
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,830
Who knows, maybe you'll develop feelings for him over time.

249
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,900
Huan Er, don't just spend your days studying or on duty in the sports department.

250
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,560
Go out and explore more!

251
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,930
Huang Lu...

252
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,310
were you a class president in high school?

253
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,040
What do you mean?

254
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,170
Nothing.

255
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,580
Your phone is ringing.

256
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,870
 Do you have class tomorrow night? 

257
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,950
See, what did I say?

258
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,950
He really likes you.

259
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,990
It's happening.

260
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,220
Love is happening!

261
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,750
What an amazing university life! I love my university life!

262
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,330
So familiar...

263
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,700
 Respected leaders, teachers, 

264
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,560
 and dear students. 
   

265
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,020
 Good evening. 

266
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,720
 Another autumn has come, 

267
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,475
 crisp and refreshing. 

268
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:46,460
 The golden season of October is a good time to sow hope... 

269
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,660
 I'm sorry, everyone. 

270
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,020
 I'd like to take a minute of your time to make a brief advertisement. 

271
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,710
 The Women's Self-Defense Activity Club, 

272
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,540
 hosted by the Sports Department, is holding its first event today. 

273
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,560
 The location is on the second floor of Zhishan Building. 

274
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,840
 The preparation wasn't easy. 
   

275
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,340
 So, if anyone is interested and has time, please go check it out. It's really worth it! 

276
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,780
 All right, let's continue. 

277
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:24,430
 In this festive October, we gather here to welcome our new students. 

278
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,230
 Now, we'll start the 2010 Wuan University 

279
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,560
 Welcome Gala. 

280
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,910
 Let's enjoy the first performance, "The Embark of Youth." 

281
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,640
 Thank you. 

282
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,400
Du Wei, sorry about today.

283
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,610
If the school wants to hold someone accountable, I'll take full responsibility.

284
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,890
Regarding this matter, I've already explained it to the school.

285
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,730
The student council won't pursue it any further.

286
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,110
So, why did you call me here?

287
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,950
Have you heard the piece I just played?

288
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,060
I haven't.

289
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,240
This piece was composed by Liszt, based on a poem by a German poet.

290
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,630
There are two lines in it that I particularly like.

291
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:54,010
The poem says, "There was no bad intention, yet tears were shed upon parting."

292
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,150
Perhaps love is just like a dream.

293
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,380
If you don't grasp it, it will just fade away in a moment.

294
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,370
Is that so?

295
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,440
I guess I didnâ€™t catch all that.

296
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,120
Then...

297
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,810
did you understand...

298
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,950
what I meant?

299
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,440
I did.

300
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,660
Liszt's composition, right?

301
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,540
It sounds wonderful.

302
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,260
I've settled this matter for you.

303
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,230
That means you owe me a favor.

304
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,870
You have to return my favor one day.

305
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,940
Of course.

306
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,990
Of course, I will return it.

307
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,260
Then... how about I treat all the members of the Arts Department

308
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,020
to a meal sometime soon?

309
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,620
I'll be going now, Du Wei.

310
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,836
   

311
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,400
   

312
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,060
 Are they declaring their relationship officially? 

313
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,880
   

314
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,220
You're here so early.

315
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,540
There's still a lot to do.

316
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,710
What are you up to?

317
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,270
Writing a proposal.

318
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,190
You wear makeup?

319
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,340
Aren't you just on duty? Why go all out?

320
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,670
I'm not. I just put on some lipstick.

321
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,230
It's not for duty.

322
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,430
I have dinner plans tonight, so I had to tidy myself up a bit.

323
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,300
Then why don't you ever tidy up when you eat with me?

324
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,840
Why would I need to do it?

325
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,640
So, who are you eating with?

326
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,290
- Your roommates? 
 - No.

327
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,870
Other than your roommates, did you make new friends?

328
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:28,526
Am I not allowed to have new friends?

329
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,300
Tian Chi?

330
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,990
What time are you meeting Tian Chi tonight?

331
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,300
Can I join you guys?

332
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,950
You want to join us?

333
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,480
Don't you have classes?

334
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,020
The class will end earlier.

335
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,370
And I should be able to make it. What time?

336
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,710
By the time you're done, we'll have finished eating.

337
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,720
Besides, Tian Chi asked me out alone to discuss something.

338
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,820
Why would you tag along?

339
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,950
Aren't we best friends?

340
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,640
And what's wrong with me joining?

341
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
I think he's a nice guy.

342
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,100
I'd like to get to know him.

343
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,230
- Can't I? 
 - Are you childish?

344
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,810
Oh, right.

345
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,190
Du Wei looked for you yesterday.

346
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,100
What for?

347
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,640
Something about the welcome gala...

348
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,540
Hello, Tian Chi?

349
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,040
 Huan Er, I sent you the restaurant location for tonight. 

350
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,430
Got it.

351
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,740
I forgot to check. Sorry about that.

352
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,840
See you tonight.

353
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,950
Jing Xi Chi.

354
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,715
- Du Wei. 
 - The Arts Department is organizing a movie night.

355
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:08,680
Do you want to join?

356
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,430
Sure.

357
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,500
See you tonight.

358
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,190
See you tonight.

359
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,300
See, you won't let me come along?

360
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,580
I have other plans.

361
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
Wow, great!

362
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,580
A romance movie?

363
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,390
It should be pretty good.

364
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,990
Do you like this kind of food?

365
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,260
Yes, it's great.

366
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,440
Thank you, Tian Chi.

367
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,870
Sorry for making you spend money.

368
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,950
It's nothing.

369
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,040
I should thank you for helping to promote my friend's brand during the last event.

370
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,759
They are interested in collaborating with you again.

371
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,240
Could you pass that along to your department head?

372
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,720
That's great!

373
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,950
As long as there's sponsorship, our department head will agree to anything.

374
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,850
Huan Er, are you free later?

375
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,580
I am.

376
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,260
Then do you want to watch a movie together?

377
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,040
The student council gave me tickets.

378
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,150
The tickets are given by the student council?

379
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,580
The cinema is just upstairs.

380
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,060
 The Arts Department is organizing a movie night. Do you want to join? 

381
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,190
Sure.

382
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,540
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

383
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,230
You're here.

384
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,990
Why didn't I see any other student council members?

385
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,200
Maybe they don't have dates.

386
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:43,910
Du Wei, I just remembered I have to do something tonight...

387
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,780
- Tian Chi! 
 - You guys are here?

388
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,220
We just finished dinner downstairs and decided to watch a movie.

389
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,230
Good evening, Du Wei.

390
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,190
Where are you sitting?

391
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:02,120
Excuse me, let us through.

392
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,640
Thanks.

393
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,990
Huan Er, you sit here.

394
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,440
What were you about to say?

395
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,990
I was saying...

396
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,880
This movie should be pretty nice.

397
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:29,360
The movie is starting.

398
00:26:30,114 --> 00:26:32,340
Do you usually watch this kind of movie?

399
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,680
I... I prefer action films.

400
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,630
Me too.

401
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,010
What's wrong?

402
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,290
I... I want to put this down.

403
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Do you want some popcorn?

404
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,570
Thank you.

405
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,440
Eat slowly, don't get choked.

406
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,100
Have a drink.

407
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,020
Huan Er, is this popcorn really that good?

408
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,240
Can I have one?

409
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,670
It's finished...

410
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,900
Sorry, sorry. You can eat mine.

411
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,530
- I'll buy another bucket. 
 - No, I'm good.

412
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,240
I've had enough.

413
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,570
Tell us, how was the date?

414
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,230
Hard to say.

415
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,340
What do you mean by "hard to say"?

416
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,920
What's that supposed to mean?

417
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,090
This is for you, Jing.

418
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,040
You fell so badly yesterday.

419
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,810
It's yours.

420
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,300
   

421
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,430
What are you doing?

422
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:14,160
This was bought by Huan Er specifically after our dinner gathering yesterday.

423
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,920
I brought it back for you.

424
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,920
   

425
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,100
She gave this to you yesterday?

426
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,710
Why are you only giving it to me now?

427
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,160
I thought it was just for me.

428
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,020
Did she say who it was for?

429
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,320
Nope.

430
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,870
I was confused too. Why did she give me two bottles?

431
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:40,680
Maybe this one is meant for you.

432
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:45,075
Look at yourself. 
    

433
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,880
   

434
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,760
Is it even yours? How can you just use it?

435
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,040
You weren't the only one who got hurt, though.

436
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,320
Where are you going this late?

437
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,990
I need to use some too.

438
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,580
What's wrong?

439
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,640
Not happy with your date?

440
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,720
It wasn't a date.

441
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,500
Then why are you coming back so late?

442
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,820
What did you eat that took so long?

443
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,720
After dinner, we watched a movie.

444
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,232
And you're saying it wasn't a date?

445
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:35,580
A guy and a girl having dinner and watching a movie together.

446
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,540
It wasn't just us.

447
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,470
Du Wei and Jing Xi Chi were there too.

448
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,770
Du Wei and Jing Xi Chi?

449
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,470
Is there something between them?

450
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,870
Definitely not.

451
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,200
Let me send you a video.

452
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,430
Someone from the Arts Department sent me this.

453
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,780
What video?

454
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,920
Watch it and you'll know.

455
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,670
 Sorry, everyone. 

456
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,960
 I'd like to take a minute of your time to make a brief advertisement. 

457
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,260
 The Women's Self-Defense Activity Club, hosted by the Sports Department, 

458
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,660
 is holding its first event today. 

459
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,740
 The location is on the second floor of Zhishan Building. 

460
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,020
 The preparation wasn't easy. 

461
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,190
 So if anyone is interested and has time, please go check it out. 

462
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,950
 It's really worth it. 

463
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,430
 Please go and check it out. 

464
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:27,480
Oh, that's why so many students suddenly showed up at the event.

465
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,230
There's something going on.

466
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,810
Stop it.

467
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,340
   

468
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,100
   

469
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,680
Hello? What's up?

470
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,420
 Come downstairs. 

471
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,994
Why?

472
00:32:56,994 --> 00:32:58,580
 Just come down, hurry. 

473
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,850
What's going on?

474
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,100
 I'm taking you somewhere nice. 

475
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
 I promise you'll love it. 

476
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,670
So... this is your "nice place"?

477
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,910
Didn't we always say we'd go back to Sishui to watch the sea?

478
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,630
We never made it happen.

479
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,680
So this is a substitute.

480
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,740
The world's smallest ocean is here.

481
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,500
Just wait.

482
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,490
I have something else!

483
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,560
Here, try this.

484
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,110
Wait, Jing Xi Chi. Are you three years old?

485
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,140
Who cares how old I am?

486
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,820
- How to play this? 
 - Just press this.

487
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,720
- It's moving, right? 
 - It's on.

488
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,890
Jing Xi Chi, don't crash into mine!

489
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,500
Stop crashing into mine!

490
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,160
Jing Xi Chi!

491
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,270
- Chen Huan Er! 
 - What?

492
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,770
Your Titanic is about to sink.

493
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,480
Your Jack is about to get sunk by me.

494
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,530
Your Rose is about to get sunk by me too.

495
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,970
Jing Xi Chi!

496
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,500
Is this how you chase after Du Wei?

497
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,870
Taking her to do something so childish?

498
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,670
If you act like a child, this won't work.

499
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,580
And you know better?

500
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:54,409
No wonder you're always slacking off, spending all your time on that nonsense.

501
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:59,350
What? It's okay for you to do whatever you want, but I'm not allowed?

502
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,960
What do you mean?

503
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,870
I just saw you and Du Wei having a great time together at the cinema today.

504
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,790
I also saw you and Tian Chi sharing that popcorn pretty happily, too.

505
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,260
I...

506
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,244
So, what stage are you two at now?

507
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:29,892
Are you still getting to know each other?

508
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:32,100
Or already flirting?

509
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,340
What's wrong?

510
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,180
Are you jealous?

511
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,360
Me? Jealous?

512
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,040
I'm just keeping an eye on you for your mom.

513
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,100
I'm worried that when Aunt Li Na finds out, she'll come and set you straight.

514
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,160
You better think about how much hush money you owe me.

515
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,790
I'm not giving you anything.

516
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:55,470
I tell you, if my mom finds out I'm dating such a high-quality senior, she'd be thrilled!

517
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,750
She wouldn't even worry about my studies anymore.

518
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,690
Yeah, he's an option with high potential.

519
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,100
He's great. Then why aren't you two together yet?

520
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,790
You're literally a match made in heaven.

521
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,520
If you don't end up together, it'll cause great outrage.

522
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,908
- Still saying you're not jealous? 
 - I'm not jealous.

523
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:11,034
- You're jealous. 
 - I'm not.

524
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:13,460
- You're jealous. 
 - I never get jealous.

525
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:27,260
I know about the chaos you caused at the welcome gala.

526
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,140
Don't tell me you did all that because of me?

527
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,830
What else do you think?

528
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,100
Thank you.

529
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,090
You're welcome.

530
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:56,260
Oh yeah, from now on, if you ever want to give me something, just give it to me directly.

531
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,840
You gave it to Zhou Ye, and he secretly used up half the bottle himself.

532
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,630
Okay.

533
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,540
Jing Xi Chi, are you crashing into me again?

534
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,960
Stop crashing into me!

535
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,350
But I want to!

536
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,120
- Why? 
 - Who else would I crash into?

537
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,046
Then, can't you just make it

538
00:37:23,046 --> 00:37:25,660
- move in a straight line? 
 - I'll crash into myself.

539
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,620
- I make you sink. 
 - Let's race and see who's faster.

540
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,060
   

541
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,310
Hello, Du Wei.

542
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,560
 Hello, are you free now? 

543
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,350
What's up?

544
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,440
 Please come down. I have something to tell you. 

545
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,060
If you have anything to say, just tell me on the phone.

546
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,790
 No. We have to talk in person. 

547
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,700
 I'm already downstairs at your dorm. 

548
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,470
 I'll wait for you. 

549
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,470
All right.

550
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,500
Oh my god.

551
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,340
This is insane.

552
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,380
So many people. Let's see what's going on.

553
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,750
Is this good?

554
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,440
What are you doing?

555
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,620
I ordered this especially for today.

556
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,140
Do you know what pink roses mean?

557
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,810
I don't.

558
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,320
That means "a declaration of love."

559
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:16,500
Isn't that your childhood friend and Du Wei?

560
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,700
You really have nothing to say?

561
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,470
Should we go somewhere else to talk?

562
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,990
Sure.

563
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,700
Don't be shy!

564
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,340
 Kiss her before you leave. 

565
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,990
Looks like Jing from Computer Science is about to be taken by Du Wei.

566
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,350
Let's go.

567
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,510
Take your flowers back.

568
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:05,990
So, you dragged me here just to spare my dignity?

569
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,580
Sorry.

570
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,990
Don't worry. I'm not the type to pester endlessly.

571
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:21,730
But I just want to know: did you reject me because you already have someone in your heart?

572
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,450
No.

573
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,950
It's hard to see the truth when you're in the game.

574
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:34,790
Sometimes when two people get too close, they actually lose sight of each other.

575
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,160
You're back, Jing. Get online.

576
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,580
 Humans are creatures of habit. 

577
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,830
 Once they get used to a certain pattern of behavior, they lose the desire to explore. 

578
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:57,300
 And with time, you start to blur how important someone really is to you. 

579
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,850
 Just like you and Chen Huan Er. 

580
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,720
Are we really too close?

581
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,830
Come on, I'm going online.

582
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,070
- Come, come. Hurry up! 
 - I'm coming!

583
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,910
So, what's going on with you and Tian Chi?

584
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,060
Any progress?

585
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,470
No progress.

586
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,020
Just the same.

587
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,060
What do you mean "the same"?

588
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,730
What do you actually think of him?

589
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,020
I think he's a great person.

590
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,440
Huan Er.

591
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,020
What are you doing here, Tian Chi?

592
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,870
Well... we have something to do, so we'll be leaving now.

593
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,580
Where are you going?

594
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,850
Wait up, you two!

595
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,040
Where are you going later?

596
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,450
I plan to go to the library first.

597
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:35,990
It's such a coincidence that I want to go too.

598
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,980
Do you want to go together?

599
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,910
Let's go.

600
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,540
All right.
