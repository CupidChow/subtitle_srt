1
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:20,810


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,160
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,250
   

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,180
   
   

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,860
For all these shampoos and other items, I let Huan Er bring them.

18
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,370
- Buy two more bottles later. 
 - Close it tightly so they don't leak.

19
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,340
- Dad, Mom, I'm home! 
 - My dear, you're back.

20
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,280
You're back.

21
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,360
My dear girl, you've become slimmer.

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
- Have you been too tired lately? 
 - No, I haven't.

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,180
- Why do I think she... 
 - Mom, what are you doing?

24
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,800
See, your mom is so forgetful.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Your admission letter already arrived, and I just remembered to get things ready for you.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,700
Oh, right. You have to report on the 28th.

27
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,990
So soon?

28
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,990
Here, you see.

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,240
   

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,820
 Jing Xi Chi, how about you? 

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,160
 I'm the same as Cong. 

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,823
 What about your second choice? 

33
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,238
 I didn't fill out a second choice. 

34
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,160
 You didn't? How bold you are! 

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,231
 What if you don't get in? 

36
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,701
 What else? I'll just retake it. 

37
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,500
 What are you talking about? 

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,510
 You know how hard this year has been. 

39
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,240
What's wrong?

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,412
Not happy?

41
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:53,180
Do you think the stuff Dad bought is old-fashioned?

42
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,400
He doesn't have an eye for fashion.

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,320
Doesn't look good? I can get you something else.

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,340
No, Dad.

45
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,460
I just feel that... I'm going to university.

46
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:11,540
Leaving home for another city, being away from friends and parents... I feel a bit reluctant.

47
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,605
Tianhe isn't far from Wuan.

48
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,397
That's less than an hour away by high-speed rail.

49
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:18,000
- If you're homesick, come back every week. 
 - Yeah.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,990
When I have time, I'll visit you whenever I can.

51
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,560
Huan Er, your mom is right.

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,790
Just come back if you miss home.

53
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,121
If it gets too hard, it's fine not to go to university.

54
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:31,570
Dad! Can you wish me something good for once?

55
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,200
Oh, yeah, Mom.

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,850
Has Jing Xi Chi received his admission letter yet?

57
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,250
- I don't know. 
 - I do.

58
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,450
How do you know?

59
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,640
I saw it. A delivery man went to their house a few days ago and delivered a letter.

60
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,760
You've got sharp eyes.

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,280
What do you mean?

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,720
 Congratulations on getting into your dream university. 

63
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,700
 I also received the offer letter from Anhui-Wuan University. 

64
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,300
   

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,220
   

66
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,100
   

67
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,140
   

68
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,700
   

69
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,780
   

70
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,160
   

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,860
   
   

72
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,740
   

73
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,470
 Want to meet up? 

74
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,010
 I think celebrating in person is more meaningful. 

75
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,900
   

76
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,570
Why are you here?

77
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:34,160
I was bored at home with nothing to do, so I came to find you.

78
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,930
How was your graduation trip?

79
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,040
It was fine.

80
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,010
I can tell from your response that it wasn't fine.

81
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,000
Luckily, I decided not to go.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,700
I knew it would have been a waste of money and suffering.

83
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,000
All of you are too complicated.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,060
With that money, I'd rather study.

85
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,960
Yeah, it's so complicated.

86
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,430
I...

87
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,110
Never mind.

88
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,010
You should go home. I'm closing up.

89
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,150
Fine.

90
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,150
All right. I'll come by tomorrow.

91
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,910
Don't come here tomorrow.

92
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,180
I won't be here tomorrow.

93
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,550
I have a tutoring job tomorrow.

94
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,420
Huan Er.

95
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,750
Song Cong.

96
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,940
Why are you here?

97
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,450
I just stepped out to get some air.

98
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,920
Congratulations on getting into Yenching University.

99
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,460
Thanks.

100
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,470
Congratulations to you too.

101
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,380
Thank you.

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,260
I was just watering the plants.

103
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,550
I'll get going now.

104
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,150
Huan Er.

105
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,770
Stop avoiding me.

106
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,770
I think there are things I need to clarify with you.

107
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,390
I want to apologize.

108
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,800
What I said that day must have made things awkward for you.

109
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:57,450
I... I drank too much that day and got a little carried away.

110
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,980
It's fine.

111
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,630
You don't have to apologize for that.

112
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,570
Just pretend I never said it.

113
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,860
Well...

114
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,880
Can we...

115
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,410
still be friends after this?

116
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,360
Honestly... It's hard for now.

117
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,310
Please give me some time to process.

118
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,380
All right.

119
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,500
It's okay.

120
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:09,820
If you feel it's awkward, you can just think of me as a neighbor.

121
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,590
I'm leaving.

122
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,430
 I'm at our secret base. 

123
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,400
 Do you want to come? 

124
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,880
 I'm working on the website. I'm not going. 

125
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,040
- Sit here. 
 - All right.

126
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,400
I'll go and order some drinks.

127
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,380
- What do you want? 
 - Anything is fine.

128
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,590
Hello, waiter.

129
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,620
- Hi. 
 - Three orange juices, please.

130
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,340
Thank you.

131
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:21,110
Huan Er, how do you resist buying all those pretty dresses?

132
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,660
I feel like none of the stores have one that suits me.

133
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,590
Which one do you think looks better? The gray one or the white one that I didn't buy?

134
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,250
White...

135
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,470
I think they both look nice.

136
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,840
They look the same to me.

137
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,070
I think white is more elegant.

138
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,330
And I feel like my boyfriend likes that style more too.

139
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,050
You have a boyfriend?

140
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,741
- Xin Yan! 
 - Babe!

141
00:12:56,741 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm sorry. There was a long line at the ice cream store when I bought this.

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,090
- Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 - Thank you.

143
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,850
Oops, sorry. You have a friend with you here.

144
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,040
I only bought one.

145
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,180
I'll go and get another for your friend.

146
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,350
That's so sweet of you. It's so hot outside.

147
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,190
It's fine. Not a big deal.

148
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,070
Just wait for me a while.

149
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,710
Wait a minute.

150
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,590
Help me pick. Which dress looks better?

151
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,230
Gray or white?

152
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,780
I love them both, and I can't decide.

153
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,540
They both look great.

154
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,860
If you like them both, just buy them both.

155
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,540
- I'll pay for it. 
 - I'm not that greedy.

156
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,900
They are similar. One is enough.

157
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,360
You go and buy the ice cream.

158
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,200
I have another friend coming later. Get one more.

159
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,670
All right.

160
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,110
Chen Huan Er! What's with that face?

161
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,140
Nothing.

162
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,620
Huan Er! Xin Yan!

163
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,820
Why are you so late?

164
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,060
I just finished my piano lesson and came straight here.

165
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,448
Did you see my boyfriend just now?

166
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:55,240
- What? 
 - Is he handsome?

167
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,760
- She has a boyfriend now. 
 - The one who just walked out.

168
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,840
Boyfriend?

169
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,110
Why that expression? Is it strange for me to have a boyfriend?

170
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,990
Not strange.

171
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,020
Just...

172
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,230
Just a little too fast.

173
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,110
I got rejected three days ago.

174
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,460
Just three days?

175
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,107
Are you upset because you got rejected by Jing Xi Chi

176
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:23,480
and you want to get back at him?

177
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,140
How is that possible?

178
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,950
I like my boyfriend very much.

179
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,470
Then... When did you meet your boyfriend?

180
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,170
- Yesterday. 
  - Yesterday? 

181
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,380
On a soccer field.

182
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,530
It was love at first sight.

183
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,760
Soccer field?

184
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,140
So...

185
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,950
He's a substitute?

186
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,350
How should I put it... not exactly.

187
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,810
I thought about it, and I just like this kind of athletic guy.

188
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,860
So, do you still like Jing Xi Chi?

189
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,690
Yes, I do.

190
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,540
You like them both?

191
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,350
It's just like with these dresses.

192
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,380
I like them both, just in different colors.

193
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,830
If circumstances allowed, I'd want them both.

194
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,130
That sounds...

195
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,090
reasonable...

196
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,260
How can this be reasonable?

197
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,140
Dresses and people aren't the same.

198
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,850
Why not?

199
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,310
Are you planning to be hung up on Song Cong forever?

200
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,830
You... How did you...

201
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,440
You're way too obvious about Song Cong.

202
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,230
I don't know.

203
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,010
But, Song Cong doesn't like me.

204
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,590
There's nothing between us.

205
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,280
Qi Qi, I already made things clear with him that day.

206
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,160
I knew something was going on between you two.

207
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,040
I could tell from the agriculture study lesson.

208
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,190
No, there's nothing!

209
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,246
Qi Qi, don't misunderstand me.

210
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:01,080
I made it clear to him.

211
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,562
Don't worry.

212
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,400
Whether Song Cong likes or doesn't like you, or whoever he likes,

213
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,590
you will always be my most important friend.

214
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,740
So, since there's nothing between you and Song Cong...

215
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,260
Doesn't that mean you have a chance?

216
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,740
Me?

217
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,540
Think about it. For four years of university life,

218
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,161
you two will be far away from home with no parents around to watch over you,

219
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:27,732
and there will be plenty of chances for you to study together.

220
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:30,470
Isn't that your opportunity?

221
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,360
Tell me more.

222
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,070
First, you have to take the initiative.

223
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,990
In Year 1, you need to seize the moment.

224
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,470
Well, how does she take the initiative?

225
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,430
Make sure he knows you like him.

226
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,140
He already knows.

227
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,490
Then you're halfway there.

228
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,900
That's already halfway?

229
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,380
So, what about the other half?

230
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,590
Since you two are serious about learning this,

231
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,500
I'll share my unbeatable dating strategies with you.

232
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,150
Xin Yan, stop keeping us in suspense. Just tell us.

233
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,260
No desire means strength.

234
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
The ice cream is here.

235
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,540
Thanks, babe. This is my boyfriend.

236
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,120
This is my friend Qi Qi, and this is Huan Er. You just saw her.

237
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,820
Nice to meet you.

238
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,040
Don't just sit there. Try it.

239
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,620
Let me feed you.

240
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,300
Is it sweet?

241
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,760
Sweet?

242
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,780
Want another bite?

243
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,560
Dad, Mom.

244
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,920
- You're back, my dear. 
 - You're back.

245
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm hungry. What did you guys make?

246
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,660
We thought you wouldn't be eating at home, so your dad and I just mixed everything

247
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,500
and made a cold dish along with some Zhajiangmian.

248
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,870
Come, let's eat together.

249
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,280
- Is this enough? 
 - It smells so good.

250
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,580
Is it okay?

251
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,100
How could this not be okay, Mom?

252
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,570
I was planning to eat out with my classmates,

253
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,860
but then I thought that since university is starting soon,

254
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,740
I should enjoy more of my mom's homemade food.

255
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,710
What a liar!

256
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,130
Your classmates must have had other plans and didn't invite you.

257
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,670
- How did you know? 
 - Is it that they had a date

258
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,390
and didn't want you to be a third wheel?

259
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,130
Dad! Mom must have put a GPS on me.

260
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,150
I just guessed.

261
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,920
Wait, wait. What does it mean, Huan Er?

262
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,870
Your classmates started dating?

263
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,300
- Yeah. 
 - No need to act so shocked.

264
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,940
They'll be university students soon. What's wrong with dating?

265
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,591
No. What do you mean by "what's wrong with it"?

266
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,950
Huan Er is still a young lady.

267
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,340
Huan Er, listen to your dad.

268
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,020
In university, the most important thing is to focus on your studies,

269
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,880
not on starting dating. I absolutely won't allow it.

270
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,160
Don't listen to him. I tell you, it's your university life.

271
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,140
It lasts four years. Why not enjoy your youth?

272
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,680
Hold on, don't fill her head with all that, okay?

273
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,060
What do you mean by "enjoy your youth"?

274
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,760
What do you mean by that?

275
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,910
When I was in medical school,

276
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,290
weren't you the one who always appeared at my school and chased after me?

277
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,040
- During your postgraduate years! 
 - Don't mess around.

278
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,410
She's just in her freshman year.

279
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,710
- You're unbelievable. 
 - Absolutely no dating!

280
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,230
Let me ask you something.

281
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,870
Someone likes your classmate.

282
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,430
Does anyone in your class like you?

283
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,940
 Chen Huan Er, I like you. 

284
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,470
No one...

285
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,370
How could anyone like me?

286
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,910
It makes sense. Slurping noodles like that.

287
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,560
You're not ladylike at all. It'd be weird if someone liked you.

288
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,870
Just like you.

289
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,890
Just like you.

290
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,670
Well.

291
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,540
Jing Xi Chi and Song Cong are around you all the time.

292
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,300
Why don't they like you?

293
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,390
That makes sense.

294
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,950
They must not see you as a girl.

295
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,670
Dad.

296
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,190
Mom says I'm not even a girl.

297
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,570
Can't you stop talking? My daughter is wonderful!

298
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,060
- She's beautiful and nice. 
 - Look at the way you eat.

299
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,670
She learned it from you.

300
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,680
Still, no dating!

301
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,400
Don't listen to him.

302
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,120
Dad.

303
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,870
Are you done eating?

304
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,920
It's all yours.

305
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,880
Take this big bowl.

306
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,989
Have some vitamin C after your meal.

307
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:36,390
- Mom, I can't eat anymore. 
 - Eat slowly.

308
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,190
Oh, right. Since it's back-to-school season, book your ticket soon or it'll be too late.

309
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,300
Got it.

310
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,390
By the way, Aunt Hao Mei told me Song Cong is heading to school early.

311
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,100
Is Jing Xi Chi going with him?

312
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,390
I don't know.

313
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,570
Aren't you always hanging out with him?

314
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,630
He's been disappearing lately. I have no idea what he's up to.

315
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:04,530
Huan Er, I have something to discuss with you.

316
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,340
It's your first time going to university.

317
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,850
What about us going with you?

318
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,630
- Yeah, yeah. 
 - No way!

319
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,032
- Why not? 
 - Dad, Mom,

320
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:13,158
none of my classmates go with their parents.

321
00:21:13,158 --> 00:21:14,580
That's fine, we can.

322
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,140
How do you know no one's parents are going?

323
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,700
Xin Yan isn't going with her parents.

324
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,670
- Dad, Mom. 
 - We can go.

325
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,300
At least let me spend time with you.

326
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm going to university to learn to live independently. Really!

327
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,050
Help me!

328
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:42,360
   

329
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,400
 It's almost time to enter university. When are you leaving? 

330
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,400
 Not decided yet. 

331
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,710
 Are you free? Come and meet me at our secret base. 

332
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,430
 He finally remembered me. 

333
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,250
 What's up? 

334
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,332
 I have something to tell you. 

335
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,540
 Let's talk about it when we meet. 

336
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,200
Mom, I'm going out for a while.

337
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,977
Jing Xi Chi, I sent you so many messages, but you didn't reply.

338
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,910
And you're finally willing to contact me.

339
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,570
What happened?

340
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,029
What is this?

341
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:49,870
The money from selling our books.

342
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,720
Qi Qi, Xin Yan, and Song Cong have already taken theirs.

343
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,820
You're the last one.

344
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,150
That much?

345
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,770
Did you call me here just to give me money?

346
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,440
Yeah.

347
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,250
We're going to university soon.

348
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,570
Don't you have anything else to say?

349
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,940
I mean, I haven't seen you these past few days.

350
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,440
I have no idea what you've been up to.

351
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:40,430
I was selling books, working on my website, and handling all sorts of random things.

352
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,050
It's fine.

353
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,300
Anyway, we'll see each other during school breaks.

354
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,470
If you need anything, just call me.

355
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:10,020
Honestly, when I got my admission letter, I was really happy.

356
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,393
But the moment I realized we were all going our separate ways

357
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:17,680
and living in different cities...

358
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,490
I couldn't feel happy anymore.

359
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,050
Do you think...

360
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,680
we will slowly lose touch?

361
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,930
Why?

362
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,950
You'll... miss me?

363
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,780
Yeah. I'll miss you.

364
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,460
All right. I'll get going.

365
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,390
Oh, yeah.

366
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:06,580
Well... Before we part, can I give you a hug?

367
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,360
- I'm leaving. 
 - Okay.

368
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,930
Thank you.

369
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,460
Not a big deal.

370
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,240
We're not that far apart.

371
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,498
I'll come back soon. 
    

372
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:17,880
Driver, can you open the trunk?

373
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,630
Make sure to keep your ID safe.

374
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,060
Keep your wallet secure.

375
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,060
And as soon as you get off the train, call me. Got it?

376
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,300
Yes, I'll text you.

377
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,190
Huan Er, do you have enough phone credit?

378
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,460
If not, I can top it up.

379
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,369
You just topped it up with a hundred yuan yesterday.

380
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:34,180
Remember, when you get there, eat well and buy whatever you need.

381
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,500
Don't worry, I won't let myself go hungry.

382
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,100
- Oh yeah— 
 - Stop nagging.

383
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,640
She still has to catch the train. If you hold her up, she'll miss it.

384
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,150
Wait a second. I want a hug.

385
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,570
- Dad. 
 - Take care of yourself.

386
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,860
One more hug for me.

387
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,430
All right, didn't you say she was in a hurry? Go on, go on.

388
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,340
I'm off. Bye, Mom.

389
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,290
By the way, there's a pack of medicine in your bag.

390
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,500
And remember to wear more layers when it gets cold.

391
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,600
- Drink less cold beverages. 
 - Got it.

392
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,440
- Go on. Driver, please drive carefully. 
 - Be safe.

393
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,000
- Bye, Mom. 
 - Take care of yourself!

394
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,950
- Stay safe. You hear me? 
 - Got it.

395
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,150
Bye!

396
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,490
Dad, take care of Mom.

397
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,260
Don't worry.

398
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,920
I'm just as worried as you.

399
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,119
How about I apply to be a security guard at her school?

400
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,150
- Even if I'm just watching the gates... 
 - Forget it.

401
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,660
You're always traveling abroad, and I never feel that you're worried about her.

402
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,257
She's just going to Wuan now. It's not far away.

403
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:33,830
And you became so worried about her.

404
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,840
It's different. She was at home before. You were here to keep an eye on her.

405
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,929
Now, someone else will be watching out for her.

406
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:42,990
Who? Did you arrange something?

407
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,010
See, you're totally out of the loop.

408
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,400
What?

409
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,590
What are you talking about?

410
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,280
   

411
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,960
   

412
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,910
 ­  

413
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,992
   

414
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:15,580
   

415
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:32,020
   

416
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,000
   

417
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,640
 Did you check in yet? 

418
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,880
Thank you.

419
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:19,380
   

420
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,680
What do you think?

421
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,850
When it matters, you can always count on me to show up, right?

422
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,000
Jing Xi Chi!

423
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,670
Wait, why are you here?

424
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,740
Wuan University. Computer Science.

425
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,340
Student ID: 110101.

426
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,990
Chen Huan Er, we're schoolmates again.

427
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,760
Surprised?

428
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,597
Didn't you apply to Yenching University?

429
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:46,770
I missed the mark by a few points.

430
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,390
Didn't you tell me you only put down one school?

431
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,290
You think I'm silly? I put down more than one!

432
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,220
I lied to you.

433
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,060
What's wrong? Too happy to speak?

434
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,482
Let's go.

435
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:07,420
I'll take you to your dorm. Are the girls' dorms over there?

436
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,340
I can handle it myself.

437
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,500
It's fine, I can help you.

438
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,090
I said, I can handle it.

439
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,360
Are you mad?

440
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,870
I just wanted to mess with you because I wanted to surprise you.

441
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,860
Can you be more mature?

442
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,735
I was worried about you all summer.

443
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:27,820
It wasn't necessary.

444
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,810
Are you really mad?

445
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,630
Chen Huan Er.

446
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,470
- I didn't mean to. 
 - Are you Chen Huan Er?

447
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,689
- Yes, I am? 
 - Hi, I'm Tian Chi,

448
00:30:40,689 --> 00:30:42,060
a senior in the School of Pharmacy.

449
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,950
I'm helping with freshman orientation today.

450
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,980
Are you from Tianhe No.1 High School?

451
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,889
Yes, I am.

452
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:54,960
I'm from Tianhe No.1 High School too. I'm two years ahead of you.

453
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,780
Nice to meet you, Senior!

454
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,900
- And you are? 
 - I'm from Tianhe No.1 High School as well.

455
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,939
I just got into Wuan University's Computer Science.

456
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,020
I'm Jing Xi Chi.

457
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,440
Welcome to Anhui-Wuan University.

458
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,050
Are you heading to the dorms?

459
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,700
Yeah, I am.

460
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,280
I also had to go to the dorm supervisor to check students' information.

461
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,580
- I can take you there. 
 - Thank you, but no need.

462
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,640
- We'll go ourselves. 
 - Thanks, Tian Chi.

463
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,920
Let me help you.

464
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,870
- Thanks. 
 - You're welcome.

465
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,340
We met at the library back then.

466
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,870
I don't know if you still remember.

467
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,120
Really? When was that?

468
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,151
I remember there was a Book Exchange Event.

469
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:36,630
It left quite an impression on me.

470
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,800
I borrowed a book back then and never returned it.

471
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,000
The book I put in the exchange also never came back.

472
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,920
Could it be that you took it?

473
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,360
The book you put in... Was it...

474
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:02,960
   

475
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,300
 Neuropsychology? 

476
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,670
So, it was you!

477
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,150
What a coincidence! I'll return it to you.

478
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,290
- Sorry about that. 
 - It's fine.

479
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,990
Since it's fate that we meet again, I will just give it to you.

480
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,780
Really?

481
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,220
Let's go.

482
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,320
 Aunt, don't worry. Huan Er has arrived at the dorm. 

483
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,810
 You didn't get into Yenching University? 

484
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,400
 Why? 

485
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,340
 I missed it by two points. 

486
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,700
 Then, what was your second choice? 

487
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,230
 - Anhui-Wuan. 
 - Wuan University? 

488
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,900
 Wuan University is pretty good too. You'll be at the same school as Huan Er. 

489
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,680
 Yeah. 

490
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,390
 Can you do me a little favor? 

491
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,710
 Aunt, I got it. 

492
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,990
 Chen Huan Er. I'll definitely take good care of her. 

493
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:57,150
 But, Aunt, can you keep this a secret for me? 

494
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,350
 A guy's got to have some pride. I understand. 

495
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,340
- Who are you? 
 - Hello.

496
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,670
You're also in the Computer Science department?

497
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,710
How do you know?

498
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,200
I just overheard it earlier.

499
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,440
You could hear that from there?

500
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,680
I have sharp ears. I'm a freshman too.

501
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,230
Which room are you in?

502
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,630
- 258. 
 - 258?

503
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,850
- Really 258? 
 - Yes, 258.

504
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,820
- That's destiny, buddy. 
 - What? What destiny?

505
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,960
- Let's go. 
 - My suitcase.

506
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,260
- Just come with me. 
 - Who are you?

507
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,430
- I'll take you there. 
 - Wait...

508
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,870
- Come with me. 
 - Give me my suitcase first.

509
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,400
- Just come with me. 
 - Who are you?

510
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,800
Did you come with that guy from earlier?

511
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,740
No, I came alone.

512
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,710
I saw him drop you off downstairs, so I thought you two were close.

513
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,190
We were high school classmates.

514
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,550
Let's go.

515
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,710
- That's it. 
 - I'll help you bring it inside.

516
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,140
It's fine. I can do it myself.

517
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,910
Hello. I'm Huang Lu.

518
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,020
You can call me Huanghuang or Lulu.

519
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,220
Hi. I'm Chen Huan Er.

520
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,950
Huan Er.

521
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,100
Well... And this is?

522
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,180
This is our direct senior.

523
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,650
Hi, I'm Tian Chi.

524
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,750
Hi, Tian Chi.

525
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,060
Hi.

526
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,100
Well, if there's nothing else, I'll get going.

527
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,870
All right, thank you, Tian Chi. Thanks.

528
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,140
- Bye, Tian Chi. 
 - Bye!

529
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,850
Wow, such a handsome senior.

530
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,660
Is he your boyfriend?

531
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,390
No, no.

532
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,990
We just met downstairs.

533
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,500
He's from my high school.

534
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,100
A potential boyfriend, then?

535
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,020
No, don't simply say that.

536
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,910
Don't be shy.

537
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,320
What's the big deal? Or do you have a boyfriend from high school?

538
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,540
- So, you can't make him yours. 
 - No!

539
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,500
- Really? 
 - Really.

540
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,140
- Really no? 
 - Really.

541
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,200
- Look into my eyes. Really no? 
 - No, no.

542
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,720
- Hi, nice to meet you. 
 - Hi, juniors.

543
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,990
- Hello, senior. 
 - Hello, senior.

544
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,790
Qiu Li, we left your luggage here.

545
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,685
- Thank you. 
 - Well,

546
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:19,790
if there's nothing else, we'll head out. Feel free to contact us anytime.

547
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,885
We're in the same major, so we should help each other out.

548
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:23,540
- All right. 
 - We'll get going.

549
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,600
- We're leaving. 
 - Bye, seniors.

550
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,440
We'll keep in touch.

551
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,790
Hello, I'm Qiu Li.

552
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,620
Hi. I'm Chen Huan Er.

553
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,660
I'm Huang Lu.

554
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,310
We're all roommates now. Let's take care of each other.

555
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,000
Of course!

556
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,640
Oh, right! My roommates, since we're all here,

557
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,540
I brought some specialty snacks from my hometown. Take whatever you like.

558
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,890
That's a lot!

559
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,620
Take a look.

560
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,660
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

561
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,600
Wait... Aren't we missing one person?

562
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,500
Oh, her? She arrived early.

563
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,620
Where is she now?

564
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,060
She went to the library early in the morning.

565
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,350
That early?

566
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,470
It's only the first day.

567
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,750
All right, I'll go unpack. Help yourselves.

568
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,700
Thanks!

569
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,120
Come on!

570
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,650
From today on, we'll be living under the same roof.

571
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,780
He's Yan Mu.

572
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,680
He doesn't talk much.

573
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,240
This is your place.

574
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,970
Are you the one who obtained the highest score in our major?

575
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,870
My student ID is 02.

576
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,730
You scored even higher than me. Why did you come to Wuan University?

577
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,170
I didn't get into my first choice.

578
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,540
Was your first choice...

579
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,950
Wow, we're really in the same boat. Such a coincidence! I...

580
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,720
Come on!

581
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,020
What a coincidence!

582
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,120
Come on, take this.

583
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,600
Since we're so similar, just take this with you.

584
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,980
- Thank you. 
 - Don't mention it. We're too similar!

585
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,561
Buddy, your gear is really something.

586
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:22,180
It's pretty nice.

587
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,760
Listen, Jing, as guys, we need to be delicate too.

588
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,554
I think you also have a good base.

589
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:32,460
But you shouldn't slack off, or you won't be able to get a girlfriend here either.

590
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,100
Thank you.

591
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,150
Wait.

592
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,858
You didn't disinfect it.

593
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:44,920
Are you... a Virgo?

594
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,830
I'm tough on the outside and soft on the inside.

595
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,320
I'm a meticulous person.

596
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,120
It's done.

597
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,970
What did you mean just now?

598
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:01,140
In other words, I'm a "hidden gem" type of guy with rich emotions.

599
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,250
- All right. You, carry on. 
 - Okay.

600
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,650
And our other roommate?

601
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,470
He is Zhang Yang. He went out to play soccer.

602
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,340
You unpack first.

603
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,940
Come on.

604
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,390
Such a coincidence.

605
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,120
Thanks.

606
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,940
Disinfectant. Disinfectant.

607
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,300
- Thanks. 
 - Not a big deal.

608
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,390
 ­  

609
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,250
Song Cong, do you know whose bed is opposite?

610
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,100
- Who? 
 - Lin Jing Yi.

611
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,320
Our school's top scorer.

612
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:03,100
I really want to see what kind of person can achieve such a crazy high score.

613
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,413
 Hello, Cong. What's up? 

614
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:25,340
When are you coming to register?

615
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,180
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

616
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,830
I didn't get into Yenching University.

617
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,270
I'm at Wuan University now.

618
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,880
You applied for a second choice?

619
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,060
Then, why didn't you tell me when I asked if you wanted to come with me?

620
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,470
Because I was afraid that if I told you, you'd tell Aunt Hao,

621
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,900
and then the whole family housing compound would know.

622
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,790
How would I surprise Chen Huan Er then?

623
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,470
Are you sure it's a surprise and not a shock?

624
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,540
You're right.

625
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,790
It probably was a shock.

626
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,950
She's mad at me.

627
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:59,140
 You're so bad, Jing Xi Chi. 

628
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,140
I suggest you properly apologize to her.

629
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,310
All right, I got it.

630
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:06,080
Anything else? If not, I'm hanging up.

631
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,910
Fighting with your girlfriend?

632
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,020
No. It's just my childhood friend.

633
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,570
It's childhood sweethearts then.

634
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,677
 Have you finished unpacking? 

635
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:39,975
 Our dorm doesn't have air conditioning. 

636
00:40:39,975 --> 00:40:41,400
 Do you have one in your dorm? 

637
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,421
 And what about having dinner together tonight? 

638
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:47,520
Who wants to have dinner with you?

639
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,410
What's this?

640
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:07,680
 Huan Er, this is a medicine kit I prepared for you to prevent acclimatization issues. 

641
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,720
 One pack for you, one pack for Xi Chi. 

642
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,400
So, I was the only one who didn't know? Everyone kept this from me?

643
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,310
 I'm Tian Chi. This is my phone number. 

644
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,540
 If you need any help, feel free to ask. 

645
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,560
 Senior Tian Chi, how did you get my phone number? 

646
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,020
 I'm in charge of freshman registration. 

647
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,060
 Your personal information is in the student handbook. 

648
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,140
 Thank you for your help this morning. 

649
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:53,288
 Don't mention it. 

650
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,560
How bad!

651
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,260
They are too bad!

652
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:20,760

OST:

653
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,930
 ­"Yesterday’s Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

654
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:31,971
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

655
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:38,841
♫  Imagining how special your world must be  ♫

656
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:45,271
♫  How many times have I written your name in my heart?  ♫

657
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:51,761
♫  The wishes made upon the stars, how I hope they come true  ♫

658
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:59,371
♫  Looking at myself in the mirror, how many sides do I truly have?  ♫

659
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:06,401
♫  Quietly changing with time, breaking free from the cocoon  ♫

660
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:12,981
♫  A rainbow butterfly dancing under the sunlight  ♫

661
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:19,681
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

662
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:23,641
♫  When will it finally land on your left shoulder?  ♫

663
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:28,761
♫  Before saying goodbye  ♫ 
 ♫  The you from back then  ♫

664
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:33,481
♫  Still free and passionate  ♫

665
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:36,941
♫  If only this summer could last a little longer  ♫

666
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:42,211
♫  Will regrets ever be rewritten?  ♫ 
 ♫  The end of the story  ♫

667
00:43:42,211 --> 00:43:47,201
♫  Has me standing by your side  ♫

668
00:43:47,201 --> 00:43:51,101
♫  Watching your silhouette  ♫ 
 ♫  I am behind you  ♫

669
00:43:51,101 --> 00:43:56,041
♫  Walk a little slower  ♫ 
 ♫  The us from back then  ♫

670
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:59,731
♫  Still didn't know how to tell things apart  ♫

671
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:04,371
♫  In my memories, sweat dampened your face  ♫

672
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:07,781
♫  Still shining just as brightly  ♫

673
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:13,961
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫

674
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:20,000
♫  At the right time  ♫
