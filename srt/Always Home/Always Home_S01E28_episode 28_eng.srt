00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:20,820


2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,680
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,120
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,830
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,260
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
 ♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,780
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,070
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,170
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,620
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,820
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,450
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,260
   

16
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,280
   
   

17
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:55,320
Let me throw it for you.

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,680
No. I can throw it myself.

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,420
Manman,

20
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,950
do you still recognize me?

21
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,770
Song Cong, you go back first.

22
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,360
The rubbish... I...

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,255
Forget it.

24
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,490
Manman, I brought you some fruit. It's all your favorite.

25
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,180
Have a seat anywhere.

26
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,650
Okay.

27
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,770
Actually, I won't sit.

28
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,460
Your place feels cozy.

29
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,800
- Do you live alone? 
 - Yes.

30
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,330
Well...

31
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,020
You... You've grown so tall.

32
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,700
I couldn't even recognize you.

33
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,460
I remember when I left, you were

34
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,680
about this tall.

35
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,880
Well,

36
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:45,020
if there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

37
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,620
Did you... come here for something?

38
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,050
I just wanted to see you, actually.

39
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,410
How... How's your job now? Is everything all right?

40
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,460
Yes.

41
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,640
That's good.

42
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,800
Is the pay okay?

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,111
Can you support yourself?

44
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,800
Yes, I can.

45
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,350
I actually came because... I need a favor.

46
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,910
Recently, I got into a little debt.

47
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,060
I have no one else to turn to.

48
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,680
I can't borrow from anyone.

49
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,200
Wait.

50
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,480
So you came here to ask me for money?

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,640
I couldn't bring myself to say it, but please help me.

52
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,780
50,000 or 100,000 yuan if you can. If not, 20,000 or 30,000 yuan will do.

53
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,466
50,000 or 100,000 yuan?

54
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:49,460
10,000 or 20,000 yuan will do. It doesn't matter how much.

55
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,710
You left me when I was this little.

56
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,060
I had no choice.

57
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,910
- Your dad— 
 - After more than 10 years,

58
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,811
you came back to me for money?

59
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:12,180
Your dad had a mistress at that time, and I couldn't live with him. I had no choice.

60
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,110
I don't know what to say. I've been thinking of you all these years.

61
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,260
Don't blame me.

62
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,312
One month. I'll definitely pay you back in a month.

63
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,708
When you came in,

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,520
I thought you just wanted

65
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,260
to see how your daughter was doing...

66
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,050
- I wanted to see you. 
 - And how she settled in.

67
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,450
I wanted to see you. I was too embarrassed to come.

68
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,060
I...

69
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,470
I really thought you were here to care about me.

70
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,930
I... didn't dare to see you.

71
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,250
You shouldn't have dared to.

72
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,230
How can you have the face to come and see me?

73
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,910
Have you ever cared about me?

74
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,080
- Manman. 
 - Have you ever cared about me?

75
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,450
- Man. 
 - Don't touch me!

76
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,720
 - Sorry. 
 - Don't touch me! 

77
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,940
I was wrong.

78
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,400
Stay away from me.

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,130
Do you hate me so much?

80
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,920
- Let me touch you. 
 - Don't touch me!

81
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,210
I was really wrong.

82
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,370
 Do you hate me so much? 

83
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,380
 - Let me touch you. 
 - Don't touch me! 

84
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,370
How can I get you to forgive me?

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,720
I... I... I'll come and cook for you every day, okay?

86
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,150
I've been thinking about you.

87
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,600
Leave.

88
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,520
Leave!

89
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,270
Leave!

90
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,570
Keep the fruits and eat them.

91
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,240
Are you okay?

92
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:26,077
You heard everything?

93
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
Not really.

94
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,970
So the lady just now was...

95
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,670
My mom.

96
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,330
I've never heard you mention your mom.

97
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,340
Not on good terms?

98
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,611
In over ten years, this is the first time we've seen each other.

99
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,470
When I was a kid, my family was poor

100
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,140
and every time I passed a claw machine, I wanted to play it.

101
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,940
But my mom always told me those were all cheats.

102
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,322
No matter how many coins I put in,

103
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:11,555
I couldn't catch anything.

104
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,730
Then one time I cried so hard,

105
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,220
she comforted me and said

106
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,670
she'd bring me there on my birthday for a good time.

107
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,790
But she left before then

108
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,740
and never came back.

109
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,140
For years after she left, I was asking for my mom every day.

110
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,780
Then, my dad couldn't do anything about it,

111
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,370
so he brought me there to catch dolls.

112
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,350
He told me

113
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,500
he'd take me to my mom if I could catch one.

114
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,600
Did you catch it?

115
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,630
No.

116
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,860
But it didn’t matter anymore.

117
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,630
Why?

118
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,320
Because my dad told me

119
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,717
she ran off with someone else.

120
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,710
But today, she came to me and told me

121
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,530
that my dad was at fault first.

122
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,560
I'm confused.

123
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,540
So she came over here today to tell you that?

124
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,360
No.

125
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,140
She said she had some business difficulties

126
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,360
and needed money.

127
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,210
Funny, right?

128
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,620
First time seeing me after all these years,

129
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,440
and she actually came to ask me for money.

130
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,870
Anyway, whether you admit it or not,

131
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,570
you must still care about her.

132
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,135
How about this?

133
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
You go and play the claw machine again.

134
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,420
If you catch one this time, go and have a nice chat with her.

135
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,380
When I couldn't catch a doll, I thought I was unlucky

136
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,600
and couldn't get what I wanted.

137
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,380
Now I've figured it out.

138
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,440
If something doesn't belong to me,

139
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,630
then I don't want it.

140
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Instead of wasting my time with someone who doesn't deserve it,

141
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,420
I'll trade it for something that makes me happy.

142
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,560
Thanks for buying me a Coke.

143
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:34,400
 So four years of university life are now wrapped up in just these sheets of paper. 

144
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,722
After the thesis defense,

145
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:46,350
the graduation atmosphere suddenly became real.

146
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,780
Time flies.

147
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,400
In a flash, we'll all be going our separate ways.

148
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,010
These four years of university have been

149
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,210
the easiest and most enjoyable of my school life.

150
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,140
Easiest and most enjoyable?

151
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,800
Have you forgotten when you were struggling with Advanced Math?

152
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,900
That was you.

153
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,110
I barely passed the test and was the lucky girl.

154
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,620
You're just like me. I'll bite you.

155
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,911
Say that again if you dare.

156
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,660
How about you, Hui Xin?

157
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,250
You and Zhou Ye...

158
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:21,540
We haven't broken up yet.

159
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,860
But maybe soon.

160
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,190
I still don't understand.

161
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,040
Hui Xin, you're obviously so good

162
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,110
that you deserve a bigger city, and a better stage.

163
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,490
Why are you all looking like this?

164
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,580
Like I'm going to be married off to the mountains.

165
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,110
It's not as bad as it is in my hometown.

166
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,020
It's a good city to live in.

167
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,620
I'll work at a pharmaceutical company as a researcher.

168
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,933
It's a good way to put my studies to good use.

169
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,788
Then you'll have to come to Wuan more often

170
00:14:53,788 --> 00:14:55,890
or we'll all come to you.

171
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,470
Then you must come to see me too. Or I'll get angry.

172
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,440
Sure, Li.

173
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,070
All right, get some sleep.

174
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,190
You guys go ahead and sleep.

175
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,240
Get some rest.

176
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,990
Right, when will Xi Chi come back?

177
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,310
Will he come back for your graduation photos?

178
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,940
He's been busy with the website launch lately.

179
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,370
I don't know if he'll have time.

180
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,977
All right, let's go to bed.

181
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,380
Can you do it?

182
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,970
I can.

183
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,330
Look, is it perfect?

184
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,555
Right?

185
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:43,330
- I'll leave it to you. 
 - Okay, no problem.

186
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,244
Huan Er.

187
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,780
Where is Jing? Is he not coming?

188
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,230
Maybe he can't make it.

189
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,230
All right. Let's not wait for him. Take photos.

190
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,480
Zhang Yang.

191
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,990
Come on, let's take graduation photos!

192
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,030
Let's take graduation photos!

193
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,660
Huan Er, smile.

194
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,300
Be happy.

195
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,230
Come on. Get ready.

196
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,430
Okay, ready.

197
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,150
Look here.

198
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,366
Why are you so slow?

199
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:23,590
You'll get a beating.

200
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,380
- Ready. 
 - Move to the middle.

201
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,090
Come on, get ready.

202
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,230
All right, ready.

203
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,540
Three, two, one.

204
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,380
Chen Huan Er, happy graduation!

205
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,900
 Compared to the chaos of the rest of the world, 

206
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,230
 my graduation season was going very smoothly. 

207
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:57,830
 Jing Xi Chi's appearance also brought my university life to a perfect end. 

208
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,350
One, two, three.

209
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,950
 Happy graduation! 

210
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,230
 As for why Jing Xi Chi was able to come back for the graduation photos? 

211
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,140
 It was because something had changed. 

212
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,400
   

213
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,852
   

214
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,370
Five, four, three, 
    

215
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,480
two, one.

216
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,630
It's live.

217
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,140
Our project is officially live!

218
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,100
Go, go.

219
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,910
Come on.

220
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,800
Congratulations.

221
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,400
Thanks for your hard work.

222
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,340
Thanks for your hard work.

223
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,300
Actually, it's been hard work for all of you.

224
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,390
This is now the result of all of us working together.

225
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,933
- Thanks! 
 - Thanks for your hard work.

226
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,760
Jing, I'll formally introduce you to him.

227
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,520
The project leader of Huan Dao Science and Technology Department

228
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,780
who is also one of the founders, Dr. Gong Hong Liang.

229
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,820
You may call him Mr. Gong.

230
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,190
- Hi, Mr. Gong. 
 - Call me Dr. Gong.

231
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,133
I was a tech major too.

232
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,810
You're Jing, right?

233
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,522
Before I came here, I heard from Jiang Sen that you're still in undergraduate studies.

234
00:18:46,522 --> 00:18:49,850
What a young talent. Congratulations.

235
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,150
Young man, you'll have a bright future.

236
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,100
You flatter me.

237
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,540
- Happy graduation! 
 - Happy graduation!

238
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,422
I've finally graduated.

239
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:09,055
Chen Huan Er, congratulations on getting accepted into your ideal grad program.

240
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,280
And congratulations to you.

241
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,260
Congratulations on the successful launch of your project with more than 500,000 users.

242
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,990
- Dig in now. 
 - Okay.

243
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,200
Come on, give me your bowl.

244
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:25,300
Here you go.

245
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,920
I'm going back to Tianhe in a few days.

246
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,066
I've learned a few Cantonese Stewed Soups from Li.

247
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:38,630
I've bought all the ingredients and I'll cook for you for the next few days.

248
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,886
But if you want it, you have to make a deal.

249
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:45,150
You have to wash your socks by yourself and on time.

250
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,990
 I hope you'll carefully consider the company's decision 

251
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,540
 to bring Yangwu to the headquarters in Beijing. 

252
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,280
 There's more talent, a bigger market, 

253
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,320
 and more opportunities for cooperation there. 

254
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,041
 You should know that compared to Wu'n, you and Yangwu 

255
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,755
 will have a bigger stage and more room for development there. 

256
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,950
Huan Er,

257
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,270
I have something to discuss with you.

258
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,340
What's it? Say it.

259
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,560
The headquarters thinks highly of Yangwu

260
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,094
and wants me to bring the project to join them.

261
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:28,090
They asked me to meet with them at the company this weekend.

262
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,390
Isn't that a good thing?

263
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,888
Jing Xi Chi, you've made a name for yourself. You're on your way to the top.

264
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:38,222
The headquarters is in Beijing.

265
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,540
Well, what do you think?

266
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,820
I'm not sure now.

267
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,740
But the opportunity is certainly a good one.

268
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,844
Look, Mr. Jiang, Fu Ying, and Zhou Ye

269
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,688
want me to think about it carefully.

270
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,340
But if I do decide to go,

271
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,530
it's not three months away...

272
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,260
It'll be three years.

273
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,580
Let's flip a coin and decide.

274
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,440
Are you serious?

275
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,580
Aren't you going to Beijing for an interview?

276
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,940
Heads means going by plane.

277
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,910
And tails means going by train.

278
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,740
I'll go with you.

279
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,430
Whatever you choose, you'll have to go and see it, won't you?

280
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,220
If something goes wrong, we'll run immediately. Okay?

281
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,880
Let's try it. By plane or by train?

282
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,710
Heads. It's expensive.

283
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,780
Why don't we take a train?

284
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,870
Take a plane.

285
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,670
Let's take a train.

286
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,910
The train would be nice.

287
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,440
By train, I can still see the sights with you on the way.

288
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,300
I didn't expect your company headquarters to be so big and luxurious.

289
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,570
Right? This is the first time I've seen it too.

290
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,460
This is a big city indeed.

291
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,780
Don't you think I'm a bit sloppy in this outfit today?

292
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,780
It's all right. Take it easy.

293
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,670
Go upstairs.

294
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:47,644
Aren't you coming with me?

295
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,920
Take this. I'll wait for you here.

296
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,050
I'll get going now. Go.

297
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,922
I'll be right back.

298
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,190
Bye.

299
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,500
Piggy Jing, go for it.

300
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,088
I can do it.

301
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,850
We meet again, Jing.

302
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,780
Dr. Gong, thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to see me.

303
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,430
Jing, what do you think about my offer?

304
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,950
Thank you.

305
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,880
Dr. Gong, well, I'm still considering it.

306
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,870
It's okay.

307
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,400
I've invited you here so you can see the Huan Dao headquarters

308
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,933
and learn about our business structure.

309
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,430
But you have to make a decision soon.

310
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,020
As you can see, there are so many applicants out there

311
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,670
trying to get in.

312
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,000
Sorry. I'll take a call. Wait a minute.

313
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,430
Okay.

314
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,640
   

315
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

316
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,990
I was just about to send you a message.

317
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,660
Are you sure you went to a tech company, and not into some spider cave?

318
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,122
It took you so long.

319
00:24:56,122 --> 00:24:57,870
Come on, there's no spider cave.

320
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,400
How was it?

321
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,145
I spent the afternoon listening to them describe

322
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:04,260
their business and their strategy for the future.

323
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,150
A big company is different indeed.

324
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,530
Their business and layout really opened my eyes.

325
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,720
Well, have you decided to stay?

326
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,740
Not yet.

327
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,300
But I do think

328
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,530
Yangwu would get better development if it was at the headquarters.

329
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,200
That's true.

330
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,150
What's wrong?

331
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,950
Nothing.

332
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,790
I... I think Beijing is quite big.

333
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,680
Let's go back.

334
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,370
You're thinking of going back now?

335
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,610
We're meeting Du Man and Song Cong for hot pot tonight.

336
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,230
Did you forget about it?

337
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,850
Yes. I was too busy.

338
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,488
- Let's go. 
 - Come on, quick.

339
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:17,100
- Are they there yet? 
 - Yeah, already there.

340
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,044
I've sent them a message asking them to wait for us.

341
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,050
Add the vegetables.

342
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,020
This too.

343
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,250
Man.

344
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,850
- Cong. 
 - Come on.

345
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,430
It's almost cooked.

346
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,260
- I'm starving. 
 - Come on.

347
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,720
- Are you tired of interning now? 
 - A little.

348
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,100
- Let me have a bite first. 
 - Come on, have some meat.

349
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,110
It smells so good.

350
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,077
I spend every day in the hospital.

351
00:26:37,077 --> 00:26:39,890
I even smell the disinfectant in this hot pot now.

352
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,150
Dr. Du studies hard when she's studying, works hard when she's working,

353
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,890
and is a top student everywhere.

354
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,190
Dr. Song, with you around, I'm always the second best.

355
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,200
Enough, you brainiacs.

356
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,780
Guess I’m doomed to be surrounded by overachievers my whole life.

357
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,150
You flatter us.

358
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,920
Maybe you'll be the first one among us to achieve your goal.

359
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,890
Then I'll hire you high achievers to work for me.

360
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,870
Who's working for who?

361
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,440
I'll work for you.

362
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,000
- You want some vinegar? 
 - I want a Coke.

363
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,500
When are you getting married?

364
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,060
Who's marrying him?

365
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,890
Chen Huan Er, can you save me some face in public?

366
00:27:29,044 --> 00:27:31,990
Come on. Have a bite.

367
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,364
Come on, open your mouth.

368
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,911
Dig in.

369
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:43,100
Have they always been like this?

370
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:45,720
They've already restrained themselves.

371
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,677
You didn't see how mushy they were when they first got together.

372
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:49,610
This is good.

373
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,330
Not bad.

374
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,114
Stop chatting, guys. Cheers.

375
00:27:54,114 --> 00:27:55,260
- Come on. 
 - Cheers.

376
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,550
- Welcome. 
 - Thank you.

377
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,820
- It's on me today. 
 - Then I'll order more.

378
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,370
Go ahead.

379
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,100
 Manman, I was wrong last time. 

380
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,260
 I'm sorry. 

381
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,060
 I won't ask you for money anymore. 

382
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,870
 As long as you're well, I'm happy. 

383
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,760
Man, it's been a long time since we last met.

384
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,027
You're not going to have a nice chat with me?

385
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,870
What do you want to ask? Go ahead.

386
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,580
I'll ask but you can't be mad.

387
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,340
Is it a coincidence that you and Cong

388
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,670
live next door to each other?

389
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:55,240
24K pure coincidence.

390
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,260
But to be honest, you and Du Man have an amazing destiny.

391
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,230
You went to high school together,

392
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,610
then university together, and now that you graduated,

393
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,060
you're interning at the same hospital.

394
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,340
What's the word now? It's called a mutual destiny.

395
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,740
Sounds like you two!

396
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,920
All we can think about now is work.

397
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,860
Enough. I know you very well.

398
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,377
Is there something new going on at your new hospital?

399
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:27,322
- Are you asking for a beating? 
 - I'll stop asking.

400
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:29,060
Not talking about it.

401
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,190
How was your visit to Huan Dao today?

402
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,240
I haven't decided yet.

403
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,300
But I've been listening to them introduce their structure all afternoon.

404
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:50,950
I think it might not be a bad thing to bring Yangwu here.

405
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,370
If you really want to come, you can stay with me first.

406
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,640
The rent here is not cheap.

407
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,644
We'll see.

408
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:00,340
By the way, did you talk to Huan Er?

409
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,480
What does she think?

410
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,100
Yangwu is his heart and soul.

411
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,500
Of course I have to support him.

412
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,100
But...

413
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,320
It's just that he and I

414
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,120
were never that far apart.

415
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:25,020
So you're afraid you won't pass this first trial?

416
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm sure I can handle it.

417
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,480
I'm mostly worried about Huan Er.

418
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,150
I can sense that she's afraid that our relationship will fade if we're far apart.

419
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,430
Have you ever thought about why you created Yangwu?

420
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,150
I did it in the first place to sell our high school review materials, didn't I?

421
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,500
Who knew it could be possible?

422
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,780
I now think that if there's a chance to give

423
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,430
my mom and Huan Er a better life through Yangwu, why not?

424
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,370
I need to make money.

425
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:06,570
You're looking out for them, but they probably just want you to be happy too.

426
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,100
Instead of making money,

427
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,820
they want you to go after what you really want.

428
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,060
I don't know anything about relationships.

429
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,540
But I think

430
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,360
all relationships

431
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,500
should be mutual,

432
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,460
no matter if it's a family member

433
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,270
or a lover.

434
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,300
Mutual tolerance,

435
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,500
and mutual trust.

436
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:44,440
I think this is the meaning of an intimate relationship.

437
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,230
I agree with you.

438
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,740
Thank you, Du Man.

439
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,540
What for?

440
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,720
Sleep early.

441
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,740
- Okay, let's sleep early. 
 - Let's sleep.

442
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,215
I'll turn off the light.

443
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,100
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

444
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,860
   

445
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,340
   

446
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,940
    
    

447
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,011
   

448
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,620
We're going back to Wuan tomorrow.

449
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,253
Is there anywhere else you'd like to go?

450
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,430
What's wrong?

451
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,150
Jing Xi Chi,

452
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,100
you should stay.

453
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:21,260
If you come back to Wuan with me, you'll have regrets.

454
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,850
But I don't want those regrets to be because of me.

455
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:38,030
What if I make the wrong choice?

456
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,340
If it's wrong,

457
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,820
we'll correct it together.

458
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,300
We're still young.

459
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,920
We still have time, right?

460
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:20,140
I'll pack some thick coats for you.

461
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,177
Remember to wear them at night when you're there.

462
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:23,955
Large diurnal temperature variation.

463
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:26,311
You have to remember to wear coats.

464
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,330
Is this T-shirt okay? I'll pack it for you.

465
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,400
 They just transferred you without prior notice. 

466
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,420
 It was so sudden! 

467
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,180
 Li Qiang, I told you to bring more sweaters, but you didn't. 

468
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,211
 It's just a quick check-in. No need to bring so much! 

469
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,960
Remember to eat more.

470
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,370
What's wrong?

471
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:29,310
I'll come to see you once I'm off on May 1st, okay?

472
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,140
What are you doing? Stop it.

473
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,930
Coming.

474
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,870
Hi! I'm here.

475
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,666
- Leave it to me. 
 - I can do it. Let me do it.

476
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,044
- I'll change my shoes. 
 - Here.

477
00:35:55,044 --> 00:35:56,280
Change them.

478
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,270
You've got it all ready. You're heading out?

479
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,470
- I'm going to work. 
 - Okay.

480
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,950
Here you go. I put the key here for you. Help yourself.

481
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,430
Okay.

482
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,450
- I'm leaving. 
 - Bye.

483
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,580
I'd like to introduce you to these three from the Wu'an Yangwu team.

484
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,440
Jing Xi Chi, Fu Ying, and Zhou Ye.

485
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,930
Today you are officially joining our family.

486
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,620
First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Gong for appreciating Yangwu

487
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,620
and giving our team a chance to learn from so many excellent seniors.

488
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,910
I hope we can work together happily in the future.

489
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,370
Thank you.

490
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,250
Let's save the formalities for later.

491
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:48,180
Next, let me introduce the future development plan of Yangwu.

492
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,960
We are going to expand the scale of Yangwu.

493
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,440
Yangwu used to be a second-hand book dealer.

494
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,960
Now we are ready to integrate

495
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,850
with publishers' direct sales of e-books and physical books.

496
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,880
By the end of this year, we'll complete the transformation to selling all kinds of books.

497
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,020
I've already gone through this plan.

498
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,223
I've also presented it to our planning team.

499
00:37:10,223 --> 00:37:14,690
It's very likely to be approved.

500
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,564
This plan...

501
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:19,266
In response to today's discussion,

502
00:37:19,266 --> 00:37:20,530
hand it over to the teams.

503
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,988
- Dr. Gong. 
 - Let them...

504
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:23,900
Get back to your work.

505
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,060
Dr. Gong, the plan you just mentioned

506
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,910
seems to be a bit different from what you told us at the beginning.

507
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,080
This plan is the result of the joint research

508
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,026
of several colleagues with rich experience in related products at the headquarters,

509
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:40,730
which can be said to be very well-developed and mature.

510
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,220
I know.

511
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,310
But if we revise it according to this plan,

512
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,180
Yangwu will lose its unique character.

513
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,910
It'll become indistinguishable from competitors.

514
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,060
Jing, I'm really optimistic about Yangwu,

515
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,020
but you see its limitations too.

516
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,890
If we don't transform it, with its daily activity, it's hard to break through.

517
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,220
I'm sure you don't want to see it remain a half-formed product, right?

518
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,850
Dr. Gong.

519
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,950
Dr. Gong, well, if I could give you a better plan,

520
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,040
would you consider not transforming first?

521
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,220
Jing, I admire you.

522
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,480
But in business, a company needs a product to make a profit.

523
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,080
You've read the terms and conditions of the acquisition by Huan Dao, right?

524
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,120
The headquarters has the right to make decisions.

525
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,730
I know.

526
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,100
But... I still don't want to betray the original vision.

527
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,444
All right, tell me. What was your original vision?

528
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:49,760
Dr. Gong, sorry, I can't answer you right now.

529
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,910
But definitely not turning it into a selling platform.

530
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,830
Can you give me a few days? I will definitely give you an answer.

531
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,830
Okay.

532
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:03,680
I'll give you half a month but you need to give me a plan that will convince everyone.

533
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,520
Okay.

534
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,020
But if you can't convince the decision-making team,

535
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,960
you'll have to leave Huan Dao.

536
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,370
Think about it.

537
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,430
Opportunities come with risks and costs.

538
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,990
Come.

539
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,144
Professor Qiu.

540
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:45,411
Let me introduce her to you.

541
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:48,370
This is my graduate student this year, Chen Huan Er.

542
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,540
She's from our school too.

543
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,100
This is Gao Ang.

544
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,950
He's your senior who's in the first year of his PhD.

545
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,520
From now on, if you have any questions, ask him.

546
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,870
- Hi, Gao Ang. 
 - Hi.

547
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,270
Gao Ang, lead Huan Er.

548
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,560
Don't worry, sir.

549
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,800
- Do your work. 
 - Okay.

550
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,971
Thank you, Professor Qiu.

551
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,606
Sit here.

552
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:16,020
Okay.

553
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,790
I'll help you pick a good spot when we're really in the experimental phase.

554
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,350
Okay.

555
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,430
Huan Er,

556
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,990
I heard you went to the lab today.

557
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,580
How did you know?

558
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,470
Gao Ang told me.

559
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,660
I was going to go today, but something came up

560
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,020
and I took the day off.

561
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,990
You wanted to go too?

562
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,080
We're in the same lab.

563
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,020
I just wanted to say we'll be seeing each other,

564
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,120
so I hope you don't mind.

565
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,220
Mind what?

566
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,370
We used to...

567
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,500
We never had anything between us.

568
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,660
You're thinking too much.

569
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,140
That's good.

570
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,100
I'll be going.

571
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,700
Okay.

572
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,122
According to the current data, Yangwu's main problem

573
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:45,588
is due to the low user viscosity caused by the single service.

574
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:48,040
So even if the number of registrants increases,

575
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,860
it won't solve the problem of the number of visitors.

576
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,991
But our website is at most a marketplace for second-hand books.

577
00:41:54,991 --> 00:41:57,900
Who would have nothing better to do than to visit a second-hand bookstore every day?

578
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,400
Among all of our users, the frequency of visits is not high,

579
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,270
but some of them can maintain a frequency of one to three visits a day.

580
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,840
I suggest doing research to analyze user psychology.

581
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,400
Then, based on the research results, we can discuss how to improve user viscosity.

582
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,750
Jing, you really want to go against the leaders?

583
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,066
After all, I created Yangwu with my own hands.

584
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,690
I don't want to give up on it.

585
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,430
Besides, how can we know if we don't try?

586
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,140
What do you think?

587
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,180
I... Of course I'm okay with it. I'm with you.

588
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,270
Anyway, if I really lose my job because of this,

589
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,960
you'll have to support me.

590
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,966
Fu Ying, what do you think?

591
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:45,960
As for me, you couldn't afford to support me anyway.

592
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,720
Get to work.

593
00:42:53,190 --> 00:43:03,160


594
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,560
