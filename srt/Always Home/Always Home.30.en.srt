(In my dreams,)

18
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,230
(I ask these trees over and over again)

19
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,900
(if they've seen my dad.)

20
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,860

(I realize)

26
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,140
(that perhaps the rustling)

27
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,390
(of every leaf as the wind blows)

28
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,700

32
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:30,111
(to keep me from being afraid
of the road ahead,)

33
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:32,860

(Market Status and Trends
of Second-hand Books)

35
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:24,030
(Yangwu is
a Secondhand Book Trading Website.)

36
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,300
This concept

37
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,955
was born out of a bookcrossing event

38
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:27,860
I did in high school.

39
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,380
That long-ago event

40
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,260
proved the simplicity and sincerity

41
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,060
of human feelings.

42
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,710
But when we enter the society,

43
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,590
in this multi-dimensional world

44
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,550
of convenient transport
and communication,

45
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,740
we find that the distance between people

46
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,311
is getting further and further away.

47
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,150
I've always believed

48
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,888
that people are not isolated islands.

49
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,300
We spend our lives

50
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,866
searching for a family to snuggle with,

51
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:51,910
to warm up to,

52
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,940
as well as companions
to reflect our souls.

53
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,990
They are the stars of the night sky,

54
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,860
(the lighthouse of the sea,)

55
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,420
(and the everlasting sun.)

56
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,910
(They are the proof that we are alive,)

57
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,180
(and the meaning of our existence.)

58
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,740
(It's when we start)

59
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,060
(to burn for each other)

60
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,910
that the world becomes so bright

61
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,820
and colorful.

Therefore,

64
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,620
a book is not just a book.

65
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,110
It's the port

66
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,820
of communication between people.

67
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,030
It is a shelter for the lonely,

68
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,620
a haven for the wandering,

69
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,820
a home where warm lights

70
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,940
are always on

71
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,888
and the door is open
for the return of the wanderer.

72
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,820
Fu Ying,

73
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:43,350
I don't need this anymore.

74
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,820
For you.

75
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,910
You...

76
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,990
How is it?

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,311
Have you got the results
from the meeting?

78
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,500
What

79
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,110
are you doing?

80
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,860
I'm moving

81
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,380
to the 10th floor.

82
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,030
The 10th floor?

83
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,300
So our plan is approved?

84
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,710
To be precise,

85
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:13,866
she'll go to the 10th floor,

86
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:15,180
and I'll go to the ground floor.

87
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:16,888
What are you doing on the ground floor?

88
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,500
Take a cab and go home.

89
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,940
The plan

90
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,420
didn't get approved.

91
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,060
You don't have to blame yourself.

92
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:33,470
It's not our problem

93
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,844
that the plan didn't get approved.

94
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,590
A long time ago,

95
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,860
I wanted to tell you.

96
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,350
No matter how well

97
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,180
our plan is done,

98
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,155
it will still be rejected
by the company.

99
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,030
Huandao is a

100
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,060
very mature organization.

101
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,470
Every project that is incorporated

102
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,610
into the company's territory

103
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,259
and every piece of content
that is produced

104
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,355
is closely related to the company's
future development.

105
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
It's never going to shift

106
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,711
at the will of some of us newcomers
to the company.

107
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,860
So,

108
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,260
they've been making us

109
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:59,180
waste our time from the beginning?

110
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,710
The company already gave us

111
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,790
a one percent chance.

112
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,260
It's just
that we're all ordinary people.

113
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,990
And miracles

114
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:08,888
don't always happen to ordinary people.

115
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,990
I still don't quite get it.

116
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,620
And you...

117
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,470
Want to ask me why I got to stay?

118
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,060
And got a promotion?

119
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,380
Well, actually, I got an offer letter

120
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,030
from headquarters before you got here.

121
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:22,600
I was offered the position

122
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,777
of department manager.

123
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,150
So,

124
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,940
Fu Ying, you're the spy.

125
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,711
You're such a good actress.

126
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,420
But I don't understand

127
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,740
why you've been working hard

128
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,550
with us for a month,

129
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:36,860
doing...

130
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,150
Doing this for nothing.

131
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,420
I have no idea.

132
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,820
Maybe I was still harboring illusions.

133
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,300
That we're

134
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,550
the one percent that survived.

135
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,470
It's not for nothing.

136
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,910
I'm just trying

137
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,180
to pull off one last

138
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,710
silly romance

139
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,230
with my companions.

140
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,740
Fu Ying,

141
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,820
thank you.

142
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,500
What about you?

143
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,590
Do you want

144
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,150
to fight to stay again?

145
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,790
Xichi, I'm sorry.

146
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:28,500
It's impossible for me to stay.

147
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,180
Why?

148
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,070
To sum up,

149
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,070
in the future, Yangwu

150
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,900
will not only be able

151
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:37,239
to trade second-hand books,

152
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,860
but will also be able
to build a community

153
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:39,822
based on interests

154
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,620
and meet more

155
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,780
like-minded people.

156
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,350
After all this time,

157
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,430
this is what

158
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,260
you've come up with?

159
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,190
Huandao is not a charity organization.

160
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,710
According to your plan,

161
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,620
we need to invest

162
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,710
a lot of time

163
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,555
and manpower to manage the website.

164
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,900
If the cost-effectiveness
of the website is so low,

165
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,500
what is the use of keeping it?

166
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,740
Young man,

167
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,990
having an idea and trying it out

168
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,140
is a good thing.

169
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,500
How about this?

170
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,990
I'm giving you one more chance.

171
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:06,230
You can follow the original...

172
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,860
No need.

173
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,710
What did you say?

174
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,110
I said,

175
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,780
I don't need it.

176
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,540
I'm quitting.

177
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,740
You're all about money.

178
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,020
Doctor?

179
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:23,900
Engineer?

180
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,190
Technician?

181
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:27,466
To put it bluntly,
you're just a capitalist.

182
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,380
You are a wolf in sheep's clothing.

183
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,260
Zhou Ye,

184
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:32,844
do you know what you're talking about?

185
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,830
Young man,

186
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,780
I'd advise you to hold back your temper.

187
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,620
Don't think too highly of yourself.

188
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
You're just nothing.

189
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,190
Calm down.

190
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,350
I...

191
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,350
Let go!

192
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,540
You...

193
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,430
Go away!

194
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,070
I'll beat you to death!

195
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,140
Come back here!

196
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,780
Starting today,

197
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,140
I am the first person
to straighten out the workplace.

198
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,710
I'm the man

199
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,830
Huandao can never have.

200
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,222
Do I stand by you?

201
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,070
Bring me the box.

202
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,830
This one?

203
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:19,733
What do you need this for?

204
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,990
I'm leaving with you.

205
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,110
Actually, the boss

206
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:27,022
doesn't necessarily want you to leave.

207
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,710
It's me who can't stay any longer.

208
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,430
After all, it's just that Huandao and I

209
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,822
don't share the same philosophy.

210
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:43,244
Then I wish you both the best of luck

211
00:10:43,244 --> 00:10:44,555
in finding your own paths.

212
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,620
Thank you, Fu Ying.

213
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,780
Fu Ying,

214
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,711
take good care of yourself.

215
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,860
Pack up.

216
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,380
The following

217
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,244
are some of the data produced
by our team.

218
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,990
The treated cells

219
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,310
were stained

220
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,830
and the percentage of apoptosis

221
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,710
was detected by flow cytometry.

222
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,540
Among them,

223
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,380
A and B

224
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,110
represent the reference

225
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,950
of control group and treated group...

226
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,666
Is there anything wrong with these data?

227
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,740
No.

228
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,990
I did it all by myself.

229
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,020
Nothing can go wrong.

230
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,500
Look at it carefully.

231
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:21,990
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

232
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:27,830
Senior Gao...

233
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,540
What's the matter?

234
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,590
Chen Huan'er,

235
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,110
what's going wrong?

236
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,620
The data should be the old version.

237
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,900
He must have opened the wrong file.

238
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,230
Even if you opened the wrong one,

239
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,860
can't you tell
if your own experimental data

240
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,190
is correct or not?

241
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,830
Tell me.

242
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,780
How much

243
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,710
did you participate in this experiment?

244
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,780
I...

245
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,230
Well...

246
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,230
Chen Huan'er,

247
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,230
tell me.

248
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,380
Professor Qiu,

249
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:00,511
the data was prepared

250
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:01,777
by me and Tian Chi.

251
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,710
Senior Gao Ang

252
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,620
usually just gives guidance.

253
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,470
You can't even understand

254
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,260
the basics,

255
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,470
so how can you mentor

256
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,430
your juniors?

257
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,140
Get down.

258
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:16,860
Chen Huan'er, present it.

259
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,830
Yes.

260
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:26,900
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,070
Let me correct

262
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,355
our experimental data for you.

263
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,260
You have no idea

264
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,740
how embarrassing it was today.

265
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,470
So many people were in the hall.

266
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,470
Anyway,

267
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,380
Gao Ang

268
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,990
got what he deserved.

269
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,110
That's good.

270
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,950
I don't need to teach him
a lesson for you?

271
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,430
Don't bother

272
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,500
to do that for me.

273
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,780
I can still handle it.

274
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,590
I'm going to have a feast today.

275
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,710
I'm going to treat myself.

276
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,190
Can you add a pair of chopsticks?

277
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,577
Add a pair of chopsticks?

278
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,590
What do you mean?

279
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,733
Look to the right.

280
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,540
Piggy Jing!

281
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,590
Why are you here?

282
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,380
Zhou Ye and I

283
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,830
left Huandao together.

284
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,780
From now on, we

285
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,444
won't need to be separated anymore.

286
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,780
What do you mean?

287
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,540
That means

288
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,110
I'm now

289
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,070
unemployed.

290
00:13:27,244 --> 00:13:29,266
I'll have to rely on you
to support me from now on.

291
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,860
Okay.

292
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,110
Then you have

293
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,422
to be good to me from now on.

294
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:34,140
No problem.

295
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,380
Right,

296
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,110
where are you staying tonight?

297
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,540
I'm still renting

298
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,590
the same house as before.

299
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,500
The owner never got round
to renting it out,

300
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,990
so I got it.

301
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,020
Okay.

302
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,590
Wait here for me for a while.

303
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:49,466
Where are you going?

304
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,710
I'll pack.

305
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:53,500
What are you packing for?

306
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,830
Why?

307
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,380
You don't want to live with me?

308
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,710
Go now.

309
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:00,190
I'll wait for you here.

310
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,710
Wait for me.

311
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,110
Okay.

312
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,470
Wait for me.

313
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,950
We're back.

314
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,070
We're all back.

315
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,710
It's pretty clean this time.

316
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,470
Of course.

317
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,755
Your little sheep slippers.

318
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,590
Let me unpack your things.

319
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,430
I can do it myself.

320
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,110
Listen.

321
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,780
During the day,

322
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,350
I'll go to school,

323
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,950
and you and Zhou Ye will work here.

324
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:36,888
I need to get Zhou Ye
a punch card machine.

325
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:37,933
He likes slacking off.

326
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,310
He's very motivated now.

327
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,830
He's determined to humiliate Huandao.

328
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,900
Really?

329
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,020
Give it to me.

330
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:47,933
You even bring this?

331
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:48,688
Don't look at it.

332
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,740
You let me set it up

333
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,780
in the dormitory...

334
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,830
So I brought it all back.

335
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,140
Alright. Get me a glass of water.

336
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,710
Okay.

337
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,310
Quick.

338
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,540
Why is the power out?

339
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:13,540
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

340
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,780
There are candles in the house.

341
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,466
I'll look for the candles
and light them.

342
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,310
Coming.

343
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,140
The candles are lit.

344
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,380
I'm coming in.

345
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,830
Come... Come in.

346
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,230
Well,

347
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,844
I'll leave the candle here.

348
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm going out now.

349
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,070
You...

350
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,350
Can you

351
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,950
not go yet?

352
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,990
I'm scared.

353
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,470
Okay.

354
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,780
Jing Xichi.

355
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,500
Jing Xichi.

356
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,540
Yes?

357
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,740
Nothing.

358
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,740
I just want to say your name.

359
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,430
Jing Xichi.

360
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,860
Is "Xi" a polyphonic word?

361
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,830
It can also be pronounced as "Qi".

362
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,070
Qichi.

363
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,470
I'm poor and drifting, and I've got
to drink to drown my sorrows.

364
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,380
Doesn't "Qichi"

365
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,710
mean adrift?

366
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,830
In addition to what you said,

367
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,740
there's actually another saying.

368
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,260
Under Heng Gate,
you can have fun and rest.

369
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:00,822
Have you ever heard of it?

370
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,200
No.

371
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,540
It's from the Classic of Poetry.

372
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,260
It means

373
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,870
that as long as your heart is calm,

374
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,260
no matter how bad

375
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,540
the situation is,

376
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,390
you can use it

377
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,150
as a shelter from the wind and rain.

378
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,340
I see.

379
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,260
Why does everyone call you

380
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,710
Xichi instead of Qichi?

381
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,060
When people see

382
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,390
the word "Qichi",

383
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,430
they think of adrift.

384
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:31,990
My mom thought it was bad luck,

385
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,820
so she said she'd call me

386
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,990
Xichi instead.

387
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,300
I got it.

388
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,390
Aunt Lin wants you

389
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,060
to be able to find a home

390
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,710
wherever you go,

391
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,060
right?

392
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,780
So...

393
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,177
Have you found it now?

394
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,780
Jing Xichi.

395
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,870
We...

396
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,710
We went through a long detour.

397
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,340
We're finally back together.

398
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,990
They haven't arrived yet, have they?

399
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,060
It's been a while.

400
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:05,244
Go over there and take a look.

401
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:07,466
Year of the Monkey.

402
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:08,340
We have the same one.

403
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,430
It hasn't changed much

404
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,500
since we were here.

405
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,740
Huan'er.

406
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,500
Huan'er, Jing Xichi.

407
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,060
Feifan.

408
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,910
Feifan.

409
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,740
Feifan.

410
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,150
Bei.

411
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:17,800
Bei.

412
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,620
It's been a long time.

413
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:21,300
- Why do you two...
- You two...

414
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,470
We've been together for a long time.

415
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,870
- Not that long.
- More than two years.

416
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,190
That's quite long.

417
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,100
When can we

418
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,870
attend your wedding reception?

419
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,740
Yes.

420
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,870
Soon.

421
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,910
Okay.

422
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:34,977
I've missed you so much.

423
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,540
Mee too.

424
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:36,910
It's been a long time.

425
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,100
Let's get together

426
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,422
with old classmates sometime.

427
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:41,150
We've got to go.

428
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,020
Okay.

429
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,280
Keep in touch in the group chat.

430
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:43,955
Keep in touch.

431
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,580
Bye.

432
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,390
Bye.

433
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:46,190
What a coincidence.

434
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,020
Yeah.

435
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,355
We ran into our classmates.

436
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,350
They haven't changed much.

437
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,230
Top Student.

438
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,540
What a coincidence.

439
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,990
We're here.

440
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,580
Huan'er.

441
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,533
We've got to go now. Bye.

442
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:54,911
Okay.

443
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:56,050
- Bye.
- See you next time.

444
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:56,630
Bye.

445
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,990
What a coincidence.

446
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,060
Xinyan.

447
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,500
You're all dressed so beautifully.

448
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,630
It's been a long time.

449
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:04,060
Wait, it's not that.

450
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,222
We can see you every day.

451
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:06,370
Jing Xichi displays affection

452
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:07,444
on social media every day.

453
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:08,580
Xinyan, where do you work

454
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,710
in that outfit?

455
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,910
I've passed

456
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,260
the civil service exam this year.

457
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,200
They sent me to the countryside
for training.

458
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:15,288
I got back from the county,

459
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:16,688
and had time to get changed.

460
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:18,580
Xinyan has a stable job from now on,

461
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,060
okay?

462
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,260
Come in.

463
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,430
We're all inside.

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,390
Come on, let's go sit down.

465
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,870
Let's go.

466
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,710
Sorry I'm late.

467
00:20:26,822 --> 00:20:27,866
I was delayed by something.

468
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:28,422
It's alright.

469
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,230
What is it?

470
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,060
Why don't you tell me?

471
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:33,500
It's been a long time.

472
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,733
- It's been a long time.
- It's been a long time, Tian.

473
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,444
What would you like to drink?
I'll order.

474
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,470
Let me do it.

475
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,630
Let me order.

476
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,710
No, let me do it.

477
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,720
I'd like to have some tea.

478
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,200
Song, we'd like to have hot drinks.

479
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:43,688
Okay.

480
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,422
I thought you didn't like hot drinks.

481
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,777
You want a hot drink, right?

482
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,300
You two are so sweet.

483
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,190
How is it?

484
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,710
Just like that.

485
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,911
We're good together.

486
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,710
So sweet. Nice.

487
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,422
Don't you watch
my social media everyday?

488
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,800
Didn't you say you wanted
to collect all the zodiac signs?

489
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:00,710
I didn't know better

490
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,390
when I was a kid.

491
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,060
Here you go.

492
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
My heart's locked up now.

493
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,977
No time for love,
and even no time to eat.

494
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,190
You're really busy.

495
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,150
Independent woman.

496
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,555
Let me do it.

497
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:09,990
Li Tian,

498
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,390
what are you wearing?

499
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,390
Are you married?

500
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,500
This is

501
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,740
an engagement.

502
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:15,990
When did you get engaged?

503
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,540
Why didn't you tell us?

504
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,190
Who said back then

505
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,580
that wise men don't fall in love?

506
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,511
Have you got your
relationship figured out yet?

507
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:23,150
You're engaged?

508
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,190
Shouldn't he wear the ring

509
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,290
on this finger for marriage?

510
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,060
It's an engagement.

511
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,500
With my dad's status,

512
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,910
he didn't want to announce it,

513
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,340
so I didn't tell you.

514
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,088
I'll give you invitations
to the wedding,

515
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:35,933
so you have to come.

516
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:36,839
Who's the bride?

517
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,890
Someone from your hospital?

518
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:38,888
Yes, who is it?

519
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,630
Secret.

520
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,020
- Secret?
- Secret?

521
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,950
To protect her.

522
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:44,511
It's like hiding a beauty in his place.

523
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,500
What about you two?

524
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:47,740
We're both doing internships.

525
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,470
Doing internships.

526
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,222
You two are in the same hospital

527
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,130
and there's no chemistry
between the two of you?

528
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,155
Yeah.

529
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,990
We are comrades in arms.

530
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,870
Colleagues.

531
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,020
Neighbors.

532
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,190
Okay.

533
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,100
Sorry I'm late.

534
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,500
Qi Qi.

535
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,870
You didn't reply to my messages.

536
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,340
I thought you weren't coming.

537
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:07,580
It's a class reunion, isn't it?

538
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,422
I'll come. I just wanted
to surprise you.

539
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:10,511
This is Du Man.

540
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:11,260
Hi. I'm Du Man.

541
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:11,990
Qi Qi.

542
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,710
Hi,

543
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,288
I'm Qi Qi.

544
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:14,369
The one who switched classes.

545
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,460
Yes, we met in school before.

546
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:15,820
I know.

547
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,870
Du Man was my deskmate.

548
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,820
Yes, Du Man.

549
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:20,710
How are you doing abroad?

550
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,630
Not bad.

551
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,340
Are you still writing now?

552
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm publishing

553
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,577
my first book next year.

554
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,866
We'll definitely support you.

555
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,311
I'll ask my juniors to get one.

556
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:28,950
Okay.

557
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,288
We'll give you a boost in sales.

558
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,540
Don't spend the money.

559
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,230
I'll give you as much as you want.

560
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,260
Generous.

561
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,500
You're Princess Qi Qi indeed.

562
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,266
I'll give a copy to everyone
in my office.

563
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:39,666
Okay.

564
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,622
You go ahead and chat.

565
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,710
Well,

566
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,060
do you have a boyfriend now?

567
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,390
Yes.

568
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,430
Why didn't you tell me?

569
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,300
Didn't I come back here to tell you?

570
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,870
Congratulations.

571
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,390
Thank you.

572
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:57,340
Where did you meet

573
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,488
your boyfriend?

574
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,340
I met him

575
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,710
at an art exhibition abroad.

576
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,710
He's a music student.

577
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,710
Then...

578
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,470
What? You're envious again?

579
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,910
I want to fall in love too.

580
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,230
I want to fall in love.

581
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,340
Go ahead.

582
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,500
Come on.

583
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,500
Look.

584
00:23:11,555 --> 00:23:13,488
Are these our books
from the Bookcrossing Event?

585
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:14,320
They look familiar.

586
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:15,150
"The Fountainhead"?

587
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,190
(I wish I could...)

588
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,340
It really is.

589
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,430
Look.

590
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,540
It really is.

591
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,910
At that time,
after I broke up with Song Cong,

592
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,020
I donated this book

593
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,540
through Yangwu.

594
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,230
Song Cong,

595
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,950
I remember you said the other night

596
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,020
that you wrote this line

597
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,430
for a friend.

598
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,300
Now, can you tell me

599
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,740
who this friend is?

600
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,540
Sure.

601
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,430
Who?

602
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,340
He's sitting here.

603
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,780
He's sitting here?

604
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,150
Seriously?

605
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,300
I wrote it.

606
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,540
You wrote it?

607
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,910
You're something, huh?

608
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,688
I didn't write it.

609
00:23:54,688 --> 00:23:55,800
I let him write it for me.

610
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,777
Yes, I wrote it for him.

611
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:57,260
Then whose

612
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,740
"Catcher in the Rye" do I have?

613
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,780
You're the one who took it?

614
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,910
This is Song Cong's.

615
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,470
This is Song Cong's?

616
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:02,910
Yes.

617
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,780
So, at that time,

618
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,390
I thought you liked Song Cong.

619
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,950
Who liked him?

620
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,540
How come I didn't know anything?

621
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,430
That's why I was so annoyed

622
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,230
with you.

623
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,844
I wasn't looking for him because...

624
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,500
To argue?

625
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,400
That means

626
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,710
she stole your book.

627
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:20,288
And he said I had no character.

628
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:21,360
You do have no character.

629
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,740
Do you want to look

630
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,340
for your own book, Bro?

631
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,500
What's wrong with mine? I...

632
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,740
Who did he give that book to?

633
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,580
He gave... He gave it to Huan'er.

634
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,990
Yes. I'm so pissed off.

635
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,260
It's because of your spell

636
00:24:32,397 --> 00:24:34,027
that I'm still studying.

637
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:35,644
You could not have studied so well

638
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:38,630
without my Five-years of Past Exams
and Three-year of Mock Questions.

639
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,430
Knowledge brings wealth.

640
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,820
It brings me a handsome guy.

641
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,710
I got him.

642
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,020
Gosh.

643
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,190
I can't stand it.

644
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,100
And we even had a falling out.

645
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,060
That's because of Du Man.

646
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,500
What's it got to do with me?

647
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,710
You don't know, do you?

648
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,230
It's been so long.

649
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,630
And we were kids.

650
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,755
We didn't know that much.

651
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,390
Do you remember

652
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,470
when we went boating?

653
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,780
We shared a boat.

654
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,470
You had your own boat then.

655
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,430
Jing Xichi.

656
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:05,780
It's all your fault, Jing Xichi.

657
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,870
It was very cold that day.

658
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,740
You had to race.

659
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,540
It was cold that day.

660
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,950
He even ran her over in the water.

661
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,380
Yeah, he chased me and ran me over.

662
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,820
I fell into the water.

663
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,020
Do you remember

664
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,780
the sports day?

665
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,580
That day, you ran...

666
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,780
1,500 meters.

667
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,950
I felt my heart

668
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,820
pounding,

669
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,710
and then I fainted.

670
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,630
At that time, I

671
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:24,060
was going around the whole class,

672
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,870
and begging everyone
to help me run for me,

673
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,820
but no one participated.

674
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,500
At that time...

675
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,150
It's me.

676
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,300
Only me.

677
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,340
Then, I asked you...

678
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,060
I asked you to go.

679
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,150
And the Class 6 next door.

680
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:35,910
Yes.

681
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,540
The Class 6.

682
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,340
Fight with them.

683
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,910
You're even holding a

684
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,910
small hand flower.

685
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,150
How can you remember so much?

686
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,190
I remember it very well.

687
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,470
On the sports day.

688
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,340
I was so touched.

689
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,950
At that moment,

690
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,444
I had just come back from a run,

691
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:52,688
and then I saw you guys

692
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,540
standing up for me,

693
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,280
and I

694
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:54,910
knew

695
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,910
these were my sisters, and besties.

696
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,910
Do you remember

697
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,340
the blackout when we were about

698
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:05,870
to graduate?

699
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:07,150
Yes, the night of the blackout.

700
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:07,740
Right?

701
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,630
And there was Xu.

702
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,190
Xu.

703
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,740
Xu said something.

704
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,355
When I went back to my room, I cried!

705
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:13,430
Did you go back and cry?

706
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,430
Really, Jing Xichi?

707
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,710
You cried?

708
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,990
I... I didn't cry.

709
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,500
Wait.

710
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,990
I switched classes then.

711
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:21,740
So what did Mr. Xu

712
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,710
say that day?

713
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,630
What Xu means is

714
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,870
that, actually,

715
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,430
there's no standard in life.

716
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,340
Grades don't matter.

717
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:28,950
Yeah.

718
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,555
There are no standard answers in life.

719
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,470
Yes.

720
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,430
So is your life now

721
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,950
what you want it to be?

722
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:57,711
Yes, it's what I want.

723
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:01,950
Yes.

724
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,740
Me too.

725
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:15,950
For me,

726
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,230
yes.

727
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,060
I think so.

728
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,390
Yes.

729
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,340
The present is the best.

730
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,710
Yes.

731
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,910
It's all good to look ahead.

732
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,755
As long as you don't regret it.

733
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,300
Yes.

734
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,740
Life is like a blank sheet of paper.

735
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,130
The paper is blank.

736
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,630
Fill it in with whatever colors you want

737
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:48,377
and it becomes your own painting.

738
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,100
Right?

739
00:27:54,955 --> 00:27:56,622
You're not busy these two days, are you?

740
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,820
In a couple of days,

741
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,100
come to my house.

742
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,910
What's up?

743
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,820
What's up?

744
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,190
You'll know it by then.

745
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:05,870
What's it?

746
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,340
Good or bad?

747
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:08,710
We won't go to help you move house.

748
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:12,620
(Wealth and peace)

749
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,260
Hello, future Li Tian.

750
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
Have you gone

751
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,740
to university in Cambridge by now?

752
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,950
If not,

753
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,780
don't blame current me too much

754
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,950
because I've done my best.

755
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,500
Got it.

756
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,710
I have a good news

757
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,100
and a bad news.

758
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,260
Let me start with the bad news first.

759
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,500
I didn't go

760
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,150
to Cambridge,

761
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,990
and I gave up on English Literature.

762
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,910
But I don't blame you

763
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,710
because the good news is

764
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:08,630
I'm still in love

765
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,710
with my life.

766
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,430
I've realized

767
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,100
that there's more

768
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,630
to life

769
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,910
than what I imagined

770
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,500
when I was a kid.

771
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,390
Hello, future Qi Qi.

772
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,710
I'd like to ask you,

773
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,540
have you become your mother's pride?

774
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,340
Have you gained
your mother's approval?

775
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,710
Whether you have or not,

776
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,060
it doesn't matter.

777
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,630
You should be

778
00:29:42,844 --> 00:29:44,822
in charge of your own life now, right?

779
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,390
You...

780
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,580
Are you happy now?

781
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:54,710
I don't know if I have become

782
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,710
my mother's pride,

783
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,430
but

784
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,100
it doesn't matter now.

785
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,300
I think

786
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,300
she must have approved of me

787
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,100
because I can understand her now.

788
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,300
Of course

789
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,100
I'm in charge of my own life.

790
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,260
As for me being happy now...

791
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,100
Yes.

792
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,950
At least happier than when I was a kid.

793
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,111
Hello, future Du Man.

794
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,870
Are you making new friends now?

795
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,300
It's normal if you don't.

796
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,150
People are lonely.

797
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,780
The world changes all the time.

798
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,430
Remember to look ahead.

799
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,150
Speaking of friends,

800
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,390
I've found a lot of new friends

801
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,950
among my old classmates.

802
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,990
Every day of my internship
at the hospital is so busy

803
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,710
that I seem

804
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,260
to be able to ignore the loneliness.

805
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,780
That's good, actually.

806
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,300
The world is still changing,

807
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,340
and so am I.

808
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,820
Life

809
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,630
is all about

810
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,820
being bored and persevering
at the same time.

811
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,020
Play the claw machine when you're free.

812
00:31:27,222 --> 00:31:29,111
You'll get a surprise once in a while.

813
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,555
Hello, future Liao Xinyan.

814
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:38,990
I want to ask you a question.

815
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,950
Are you in love?

816
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,710
Are you in love with a handsome man?

817
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,540
If he changes his mind first,

818
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,230
will you break up with him?

819
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,340
Remember,

820
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,820
always be the strongest in love.

821
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,670
Don't lose.

822
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,100
If it's possible,

823
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,150
collect all the signs of the zodiac.

824
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,020
That's it.

825
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,740
Liao Xinyan,

826
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
I were in love.

827
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,150
That's a handsome man.

828
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,150
Every breakup,

829
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,430
it's me who dumps them.

830
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,540
Don't worry.

831
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,020
I've tried

832
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,150
everything I wanted to try.

833
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,580
Now,

834
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,390
I can finally focus

835
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,190
on my career.

836
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,540
Besides,

837
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,190
you must not

838
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,470
confess to Jing Xichi.

839
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,780
It's really awkward.

840
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,230
Hello, future Song Cong,

841
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,022
You should have accomplished

842
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,155
your own goal by now.

843
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,470
Don't think too much.

844
00:32:44,688 --> 00:32:45,740
You can definitely become

845
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,910
what you want to be.

846
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,780
The more precious something is,

847
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,060
the less you can get it

848
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,990
just by working for it.

849
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,780
Growing up for me means

850
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,060
accepting that I'm ordinary and common.

851
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,390
I'm sorry I failed the wonderful person
you were back then.

852
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,870
And I've suffered for it.

853
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,780
However,

854
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,710
I'm finally ready

855
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,111
to say goodbye to you now.

856
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,430
I'm so lucky to have met you.

857
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,990
Leave the rest of your life to me.

858
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,540
I'll walk the path for you.

859
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,910
Hello.

860
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,600
Hello, future Chen Huan'er.

861
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,020
I don't know how you're doing

862
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,950
in the future

863
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,780
or

864
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,870
if you've found your dreams

865
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,300
and goals.

866
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,950
But I

867
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,390
haven't yet.

868
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,990
In fact, I'm quite anxious

869
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,910
to see that everyone

870
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,260
has their own goals

871
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,950
and dreams.

872
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,910
Do you think

873
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,990
life is meaningless

874
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,180
if you don't find

875
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,220
your dream and what you want

876
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,950
to do

877
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,620
in life?

878
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,310
That's it.

879
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,580
Bye.

880
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:27,830
Hello,

881
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,180
little Huan'er.

882
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,220
I know you're probably

883
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,700
panicking about not being able

884
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,140
to find your goal

885
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,100
and meaning in life.

886
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,950
But Jing Xichi is right.

887
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,540
Let's play it by ear.

888
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,660
Life is not a test.

889
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,540
There are no standard answers.

890
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,020
Everyone will answer differently.

891
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,140
I have

892
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,020
my dad

893
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,470
and mom

894
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,580
around me.

895
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,470
The people I love

896
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,377
and the people who love me

897
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,540
are all here.

898
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,180
I'm very happy.

899
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,020
(Song Cong,)

900
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,140
(I remember you used to say)

901
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:28,266
(that friends are meant
to be in certain phases.)

902
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,100
(Do you still think so?)

903
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,700
(Maybe some of our friends)

904
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,500
(can only accompany us
on a short journey.)

905
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,750
(But our lives )

906
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,990
(are complete because
of this little journey.)

907
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,870
(Those)

908
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,020
(who have been in our lives)

909
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,500
(will be part of our souls)

910
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,660
(for the rest of our lives.)

911
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:39,910
(Xichi.)

912
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
(Huan'er, come out now.)

913
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:42,755
(It's time to make dumplings.)

914
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,540
(Let's go.)

915
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,270
(Coming.)

916
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,750
Let's go. Let's make dumplings.

917
00:38:20,644 --> 00:38:21,580
It's no use running.

918
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,470
I'll be sure to get you on tape.

919
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,270
None of you will escape.

920
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,790
It's 3 PM today,

921
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,470
17 September 2008.

922
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:35,800
It's a beautiful day.

923
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,310
The sun is shining.

924
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:40,133
It's quiet outside the family
housing compound again.

925
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,888
I wonder what everyone is doing.

926
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,180
Li Tian

927
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,620
must be studying.

928
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,750
He's been trying to surpass Song.

929
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:50,870
I sometimes want to tell him

930
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:51,866
to let himself go,

931
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:53,333
to stop being so hard on himself.

932
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,870
Song.

933
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,390
Song must be thinking about life.

934
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,180
I'm really puzzled too.

935
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,890
What on earth
does he have to think about

936
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,870
all the time every day?

937
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,750
Chen Huan'er

938
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,750
is carefree.

939
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,910
She must be either sleeping

940
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,350
or having a good time

941
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,060
because of something.

942
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,180
Silly girl.

943
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,950
If I could,

944
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,750
I'd like time to stop right now.

945
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,990
They always say

946
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,750
that change is a constant in life.

947
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,100
So

948
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,750
houses get torn down,

949
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:38,390
friends get separated,

950
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,620
and even

951
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,430
the closest people leave.

952
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,390
But I always think

953
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,270
that even if that day comes,

954
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,100
the traces

955
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,870
of those people

956
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,020
and things

957
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,830
will follow me,

958
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,750
and accompany me

959
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,350
all the way to a faraway place.

960
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,140
Even if I've already forgotten

961
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,750

963
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,910
Anyway,

964
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,950
some things will change

965
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,350
and some things

966
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,310
will never change.
