2
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:41,660
♫  No matter if it's a rainy day or a sunny day  ♫

3
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,200
♫  As long as you are by my side  ♫ 
 ♫  Even the sunlight becomes dazzling  ♫

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,910
♫  Thinking too much, blindly guessing  ♫ 
 ♫  Why not find a day to meet  ♫

5
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,340
♫  Saying too much, there's no "what if"  ♫ 
♫  Might as well go on an adventure  ♫

6
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,760
♫  I stand in the shadows  ♫

7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,100
♫  Reaching out, waiting for your rescue  ♫

8
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,250
♫  Between you and me  ♫ 
 ♫  Even if the world collapses  ♫

9
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,140
♫  No matter how far the distance  ♫

10
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,600
♫  Nothing can stop our meeting  ♫

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,590
♫  Stepping through the long dark night  ♫ 
 ♫  You are standing at the finish line  ♫

12
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,900
♫  Protecting you is my tiny wish  ♫

13
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,250
♫  Goodbye to the shy me of the past  ♫

14
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,420
♫  Because of you, I have become a little braver  ♫

15
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,370
   

16
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,200
   
   

17
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,680
The best mom.

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,280
I love you.

19
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,350
I'll use this one.

20
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,890
Mom, aren't you on the night shift? Why are you back so early?

21
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,370
Are you sure it's your mom?

22
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,500
Dad! Dad!

23
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,950
Weren't you coming back? Why did you suddenly come back?

24
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,982
It's your mom's birthday. I wanted to surprise her. How could I not come?

25
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:17,570
Dad! Listen. I've got everything ready.

26
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,920
That's great!

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,790
- Hurry, give it to me! 
 - Let me wash my hands first.

28
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,700
You have no idea how hard it is for me to take time off.

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,920
What happened, Dad?

30
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,670
Huan Er.

31
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,920
Why are my mouth-rinsing cup, toothbrush, and towel gone from the washroom?

32
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,940
Where did they go?

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,070
Mom said the washroom was too crowded there, so she put them away.

34
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,070
- Let me call and ask her. 
 - Don't!

35
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,450
Don't call her. If you do, the surprise will be ruined.

36
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,280
Yeah, you're right!

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,850
You see, I hardly ever come home, and now I feel like this isn't even my house.

38
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,140
Dad, I'll go and buy you a new set.

39
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,130
- Don't! Forget it. 
 - It's just downstairs.

40
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,920
It's late now. It's not safe.

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,180
I have a solution.

42
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,660
What is it?

43
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,990
I'll rub my teeth with my fingers; that'll do.

44
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,720
Dad, don't be disgusting.

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,450
Your mom is unreasonable for putting all my stuff away.

46
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,690
Luckily, no one noticed.

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,570
Oh my god.

48
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,730
Huan Er, is there any milk left?

49
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,920
This milk expired days ago.

50
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,800
Dad, try looking for it again.

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,940
Doesn't your mom cook for you?

52
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,320
I've just found five or six bottles of expired stuff here.

53
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,830
Also, this spatula wasn't cleaned properly after being used.

54
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,640
Is your mom mistreating you at home or what?

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,600
How am I abusing her?

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,240
Wherever you came from, go back there!

57
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,260
 Mistreating her? If you're not happy, take her away! 

58
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,420
- Look, this is expired. 
 - I'm playing both the mom and dad roles.

59
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,890
- It's not easy for me. 
 - Do you think it's easy for me?

60
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,490
Please, come back to the topic. This milk is expired.

61
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,600
So what? I'll use it as fertilizer for the plants! I didn't give it to her to drink!

62
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,070
- Are you just arguing for the sake of it? 
 - You're barely ever home all year,

63
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,260
and you have the nerve to lecture me?

64
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,900
What do you mean? Why am I never home?

65
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,860
I work hard all year. I raise the kid and take care of her.

66
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,500
I live like a widow. Is it easy for me?

67
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,670
You've gone overboard. A widow? Then, who am I here?

68
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,640
- I'm just like a widow. 
 - Aren't I out there earning money?

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,860
Earning money? Give it to me.

70
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,600
- I gave you all the money! 
 - That little bit?

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,710
I gave you money and you bought such a thing?

72
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,756
- Why can't I buy this? 
 - This could poison someone.

73
00:04:28,756 --> 00:04:29,840
What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,580
 All you buy is expired stuff. 

75
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,320
 How was I supposed to know it was expired? 

76
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,860
 I don't want to argue with you anymore. I just got off my night shift. 

77
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,720
 I'll sleep first, then I'll argue with you later. 

78
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,500
 Stay or leave, it's up to you. 

79
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,990
You scared me half to death!

80
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,070
Morning. You wake up so early.

81
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,790
Morning.

82
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,060
Why are you up so early?

83
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,300
What else?

84
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,704
Taking out the trash.

85
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:09,080
Oh yeah. You have to take out the trash.

86
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,970
It's still early. Why are you in your pajamas

87
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,720
and standing in front of my house?

88
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,450
I...

89
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,960
I woke up early too.

90
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,700
Go on. Keep making things up.

91
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,480
Hold on, Chen Huan Er. That look on your face...

92
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,930
You really see me as just a brother, right?

93
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,570
I...

94
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,920
I just...

95
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,690
wanted to ask you for tutoring.

96
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,500
You...

97
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,358
want me... to tutor you?

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,670
You're talking nonsense in the morning. Are you sleepwalking?

99
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,920
- Are you... 
 - Ouch! It's painful.

100
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,720
My parents had a fight.

101
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,910
I just wanted to come here and hide for a bit.

102
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,790
Is that okay?

103
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,000
 Cong, come to my house! Chen Huan Er needs you. 

104
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,280
Wait, should I change my outfits too?

105
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,560
Otherwise, I'm going to look out of place with you two.

106
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,890
Are you okay?

107
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm fine now.

108
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,550
What's so funny?

109
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,890
Nothing, go on.

110
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,380
Sorry for waking you both up so early.

111
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,490
I just don't understand why my parents suddenly started fighting.

112
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,610
They used to argue, but never this bad.

113
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,130
Why are they fighting?

114
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,610
I don't know.

115
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,440
When I woke up and started washing up,

116
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,852
my dad was making breakfast and my mom returned from her night shift.

117
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:38,570
Then suddenly they started fighting.

118
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,450
It feels like they argue because of me.

119
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,860
Didn't you ask them why they were fighting?

120
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,180
How am I supposed to ask?

121
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,450
Fair point...

122
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,520
What about your parents?

123
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,500
What do they usually fight about?

124
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,230
My parents?

125
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,050
My parents...

126
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,370
Anything from international wars to the most trivial things.

127
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,250
As long as they breathe the same air, they'll find a reason to argue.

128
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,990
Usually, within a minute, my dad finds a way to coax my mom.

129
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,940
And soon after he calms her down, within another minute, they'll start fighting again.

130
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,460
Sometimes, it gets really dramatic.

131
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,820
In our house, there's no fighting.

132
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,450
Never?

133
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,400
Never.

134
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,180
Every day, it's just my dad who gets scolded.

135
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,970
Now that you mention it, I think my family isn't so bad after all.

136
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,860
But what I really don't get is...

137
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,620
if they can't stand each other so much,

138
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,680
why did they choose to be together when they were young?

139
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,610
Haven't you heard the saying?

140
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,640
Many people say that before having kids, parents have a good relationship.

141
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,020
Who told you this nonsense?

142
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,190
So, according to you, why did our parents have us?

143
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,610
To suffer?

144
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,250
Who knows?

145
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,470
All beings endure suffering.

146
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,690
Oh, right. Let me show you something I found last night.

147
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,270
- Where is it? 
 - What is it?

148
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,710
This and this.

149
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Do you get it?

150
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,090
So basically, your dad and your mom are actually fine.

151
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,060
Wait, does that mean...

152
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,430
Your dad, and your mom?

153
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,990
Are you crazy?

154
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,400
My mom?

155
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,160
My mom?

156
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,350
My mom?

157
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,070
How could that possibly be my mom?

158
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,400
 All right, move a little this way. 

159
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,060
 - This way? 
 - Yeah, this background. 

160
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,380
 All right. 

161
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,160
 One, two... 

162
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,960
 No more film. 

163
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,230
 Sorry about that. Let me check if I have a spare roll. 

164
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,230
 Hold on. 

165
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,330
 No rush. Take your time. 

166
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:43,710
 Yi Fan, why do I feel he has other intentions toward you? 

167
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,960
 Xi Chi. 

168
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,250
Good morning, Mom.

169
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,800
- Morning, Aunt Lin. 
 - Morning.

170
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,780
You three slept in this room last night?

171
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,779
Mom, what are you thinking?

172
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,900
How could it be possible to fit three of us on my bed?

173
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,800
They just got here.

174
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,360
Just got here? Then you probably haven't had breakfast yet.

175
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,900
What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.

176
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,160
- Mom. 
 - What's wrong?

177
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Can I ask you a question?

178
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:35,400
Uncle Song... back when he was younger, did he... ever like you?

179
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,190
What?

180
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,070
You're back for B and C again?

181
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,230
What a special style you have!

182
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,020
Why are you here?

183
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,159
Delivering photos to Jing Xi Chi.

184
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,590
I have something for you.

185
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,140
Regarding the last math problem, I thought about it.

186
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,010
I think that not everything needs an answer.

187
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,360
What if the answer isn't what you want?

188
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,860
Study it carefully.

189
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,040
This is all I can do to help.

190
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,350
Jing Xi Chi.

191
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,860
I'm here. Open the door.

192
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,234
   

193
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,530
 ­  

194
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,950
Dad, Mom doesn't like surprises.

195
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,480
If you do this, will she take it seriously?

196
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,340
You don't get it.

197
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,640
Your mom's been in the hospital for a year. She's seen all kinds of chaos and drama.

198
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,260
Ordinary surprises don't work on her.

199
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,540
I tell you, you must follow my orders later.

200
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,740
As soon as your mom comes home in a sorrowful mood,

201
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,780
we rush up and give her a big hug.

202
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,860
That's what we call a surprise. What do you think?

203
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,340
- All right. 
 - Let's do it.

204
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,890
Let's go.

205
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,580
   

206
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,080
   

207
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,260
Didn't you say she went to the hospital for a quick visit?

208
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,000
We've been waiting for so long. Why isn't she back yet?

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,700
I don't know.

210
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,800
My back hurts. Keep an eye out for me. I need a break.

211
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,920
All right. Go ahead, Dad.

212
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:52,400
Dad! She's here! She's here!

213
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,380
Hurry!

214
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,140
Move!

215
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,200
Hide! Hide! Hide!

216
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,880
   

217
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,920
   

218
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,680
Chen Lei! Give me back my daughter!

219
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,690
What's happening?

220
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,020
- Oh no, we messed up. 
 - Oh my goodness.

221
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,540
- Mom! Mom! 
 - Li Na! Li Na! Li Na!

222
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,110
Chen Lei!

223
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,290
Huan Er!

224
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,710
Li Na!

225
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,000
Li Na!

226
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,590
- Mom! Mom! 
 - Li Na!

227
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,280
Mom!

228
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,110
Why did you come back? Why did you even come back?

229
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,920
Get your filthy hands off me! I tell you...

230
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,660
Take this!

231
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,090
You two are too much! You scared me a lot.

232
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,370
- What is this? 
 - Look!

233
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,080
Why don't you hang a banner for me too?

234
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,492
- Oh, right, Dad! 
 - We forgot the banner.

235
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:06,700
I'll get a banner next time!

236
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,790
- Hurry up! 
 - Sit down!

237
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,950
You two are too much!

238
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,610
- Mom, don't be angry. 
 - We were just joking.

239
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,050
Huan Er, put this on your mom. Come on, come on.

240
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,950
- I'm not wearing that! 
 - Come on, put it on!

241
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,880
So pretty! How beautiful!

242
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,920
Look here. Ready?

243
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,140
- I don't want! 
 - Just take a look. Just take a look.

244
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,900
One, two, three.

245
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,860
 Sister, after thinking about it, I want to change back to the previous cake. Can I? 

246
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,550
 Sure! 

247
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,110
Honey, happy birthday!

248
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,450
Dad picked this one out himself.

249
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,830
This looks pretty nice.

250
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,100
Look.

251
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,840
Come on, let's celebrate the birthday.

252
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,920
Look at you. How could you take it seriously?

253
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,500
Wasn't it just a joke?

254
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,380
What joke? That was a scare, okay?

255
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,950
Fine, a scare. Sorry, sorry.

256
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,090
Light the candles.

257
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,860
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

258
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,020
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

259
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,120
♪  Happy birthday to me  ♪

260
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,040
Make a wish, make a wish.

261
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,580
Make a wish. Mom, make a wish.

262
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,730
Blow out the candles.

263
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,530
All right.

264
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,330
- Mom. 
 - Look how nice it is.

265
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,760
I prepared a birthday present for you.

266
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,090
- Look. This is the one I prepared. 
 - There's even a birthday gift!

267
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,570
Mom, open it and see.

268
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,320
Inside... you're the star of every photo.

269
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,090
You learned this from Jing Xi Chi, right?

270
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,020
Not very original.

271
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,130
- Yeah. 
 - I went through our family photos,

272
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,090
but I couldn't find many pictures of you both.

273
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,300
You were always busy taking pictures of me.

274
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,170
From now on, I'll take more pictures of you both.

275
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,900
Oh, you're mistaken.

276
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,680
Your mom used to have more than a dozen photo albums. They were all lost when we moved.

277
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,600
All that's left is...

278
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,130
♪  Happy birthday!  ♪

279
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,500
Mom, do you like it?

280
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,900
- Does it look nice? 
 - How about this one?

281
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,160
Isn't it nice?

282
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,890
Come on, let's eat cake.

283
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,990
Don't just eat cake.

284
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,530
I'll cook some noodles.

285
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,630
Let me do it. You don't have to.

286
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,790
You just stay and cut the cake. Let me do it. I'll do it.

287
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:54,810
 Just as I expected, my parents' argument ended without any danger this time. 

288
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:02,000
 Now I finally understand that only when love is deep enough can one argue 

289
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,850
 with such confidence. 

290
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,010
 That's their unique kind of romance. 

291
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,440
- Why did you call me here? 
 - You'll know when you see it.

292
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,530
I'm full. I don't feel like moving.

293
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,720
- Hurry up. 
 - I feel bloated.

294
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,870
Go up there! Sit there.

295
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,670
Here. Sit here.

296
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,520
What are you doing?

297
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,000
Close your eyes.

298
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Close your eyes.

299
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,000
Have you already closed your eyes?

300
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,620
Don't open your eyes unless I tell you to.

301
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,180
Don't open your eyes. You must not open your eyes.

302
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,810
- Are you cheating? 
 - No.

303
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,130
No peeking! Close your eyes.

304
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,640
- I got it. 
 - No peeking.

305
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,270
Chen Huan Er!

306
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,720
No peeking!

307
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,130
I'm watching you. Don't try to peek.

308
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,240
I'm watching you. Don't open your eyes yet. I'm still watching you.

309
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,090
- What exactly are you up to? 
 - You'll find out soon.

310
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,080
Stop talking.

311
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't open your eyes.

312
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,660
Stretch out your hand.

313
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,540
Stretch out your hand.

314
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,300
No peeking. You still can't open your eyes yet.

315
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,970
- Wait a while. 
 - I didn't peek.

316
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,440
Don't open your eyes.

317
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,160
What's that sound?

318
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,770
Open your eyes.

319
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,220
This...

320
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,236
Didn't they say they don't sell this cake in slices?

321
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:43,460
This is just a small problem that won't defeat me.

322
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,920
Look at you. You wanted to eat it, didn't you?

323
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,480
Since you want to eat it, of course you should have it.

324
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,390
How did you settle this?

325
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,090
 Hi. 

326
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,440
 Could you get me the cake from the display rack and cut it into three pieces? 

327
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,160
 Okay, wait a moment. 

328
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,140
 - What's the big deal? 
 - Why did you call me over? 

329
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,727
 What are you doing? 

330
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:16,870
 Back at Sishui, didn't Aunt Hao like eating cake? 

331
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,400
 Take this cake back for her. She'd be so happy. 

332
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,710
 But you guys didn’t invite me there. Why drag me into this? 

333
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,400
 I'm not accepting your bribe. 

334
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,470
 Buddy, I'm not bribing you. 

335
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,870
 I was just thinking of you. 

336
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,240
 Look, Dr. Li worries about you every day. 

337
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,820
 Shouldn't you do something to show your filial piety? 

338
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,560
 Am I right? 

339
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,280
 I've finished packing. 

340
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,870
 Thank you. 

341
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,230
 - You two, remember to pay. 
 - What? 

342
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,910
 158 yuan. 

343
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,990
 Do you have... 

344
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,110
 How much do you have? 

345
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,350
 38 yuan. 

346
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,000
 Not enough. 

347
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,200
 Still 20 yuan short. 

348
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,260
 Just 20 yuan more. 

349
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,290
 I have no more left. 

350
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,360
 - We'll just take one. 
 - Can we pay next time? 

351
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,230
Why do you ask so many questions? Just eat it.

352
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,390
There's even a candle.

353
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,870
It's not my birthday today.

354
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,020
Who cares if it's your birthday or not?

355
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,820
I say it's your birthday, so it is.

356
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,998
Happy birthday.

357
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,360
Don't cry.

358
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,110
Close your eyes.

359
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,750
Make a wish.

360
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,060
Make a wish.

361
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,760
Blow out the candle after making a wish.

362
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,780
Thank you.

363
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,910
It must be very delicious.

364
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,360
Eat it.

365
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,230
Why is there only one?

366
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,060
I bought this for you. I'm not eating. You eat it.

367
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,130
Here, hold it. Eat it.

368
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,160
How is it?

369
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,870
- This is delicious, right? 
 - It's so good.

370
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,740
- You try a bite too. 
 - I don't want to.

371
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,920
- Just try one. 
 - I find you gross.

372
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,020
I don't even mind you, and you mind me?

373
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,230
Try it, it's really good.

374
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,880
Is it good?

375
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,080
- It's really delicious! 
 - Yummy, right?

376
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,160
No wonder it's so expensive.

377
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,870
Is this pricey?

378
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,440
Not really. I got it covered. Eat up.

379
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,320
Then, take another bite.

380
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,810
Mom, I got you a cake. Try it.

381
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,720
Son, you finally know how to care for your mom.

382
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,460
All right, I'll go and cut it. We'll eat it together.

383
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,060
- You're back. 
 - Mom.

384
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,514
What did you buy?

385
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:35,580
The cake shop had a discount, so I bought some for you.

386
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,260
We just ate. Isn't that a waste of money?

387
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,806
- Look. 
 - Let me see.

388
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:42,020
Song Hang.

389
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,620
- This is nice. 
 - Dad, come and have some.

390
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,150
 Are you done taking photos? 

391
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,380
 Yeah, it's done. 

392
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,340
 Your camera is nice. It's made in Germany, right? 

393
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,640
 - Let's go dancing. 
 - Hurry. 

394
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,780
 This is nice. 

395
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,430
 Let's go. 

396
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,670
 Just loosen up a bit when we're there, okay? 

397
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,540
 There he is. 

398
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,720
 You came so early. 

399
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,810
 I came a bit earlier to save a seat for you. 

400
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,090
 You're here, Yi Fan. 

401
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,950
 He's calling you Yi Fan now? 

402
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,260
 Don't just stand there. Let's go dance. 

403
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,000
 Come on! Come on! 

404
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,960
 I'll go and buy something to drink. 

405
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,540
 Song Hang, what do you want? 

406
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,300
 - I'll go with you. 
 - All right. 

407
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,430
 You usually dress like a gangster. 

408
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,150
 Why are you dressed so properly today? 

409
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,910
 Didn't you say that running around playing soccer doesn't lead to much of a future? 

410
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,840
 So, I decided to apply to the fire department. 

411
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,780
 I was joking. 

412
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,390
 Why did you take it seriously? 

413
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,300
 I wasn't joking. 

414
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:13,850
 Yi Fan, if I get into the fire department, will you seriously consider me then? 

415
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,020
 The photos from last time are done. 

416
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,710
 I brought the ones with you in them. 

417
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,100
 You even carried them along with you? 

418
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,518
 That day, when I went to your workplace to drop off photos for the juniors, 

419
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:51,670
 I actually brought yours too. 

420
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,740
 But it looked like you had swapped shifts. 

421
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,060
 You weren't there. 

422
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,130
 So... 

423
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,020
 The pictures are so nice. 

424
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,480
 You university students take photos differently. 

425
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,670
 It's nothing. 

426
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,860
 Thank you. 

427
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,500
♫  Love ya love  ♫

428

♫  Until she suddenly wakes up and learns to love  ♫

434
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,260
How are you doing at your workplace? Is your stomach still hurting?

435
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:03,430
Listen to me, drink some warm water when you're free.

436
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,330
Listen to the doctor's advice.

437
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,300
I may be your wife, but I'm also a doctor.

438
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,560
All right, I got it.

443
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:56,721
 Hey... what do you think love was like for our parents back then? 

444
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:59,840
 Maybe we'll understand it someday. 

445
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,140

460
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,810
- Huan Er. 
 - Dad!

461
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,514
You're back. Did you get wet in the rain?

462
00:30:11,514 --> 00:30:13,620
- Not really. 
 - Really? Your clothes are soaked.

463
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,980
- Go home and change. 
 - Uncle Chen.

464
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,560
- Hello. Go home and get changed. 
 - Bye, Uncle Chen.

465
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,240
Don't catch a cold.

466
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,460
All tidied up? The rain stopped.

467
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,480
- Didn't I tell you to change? Aren't you cold? 
 - It's fine, Dad. I didn't get too wet.

468
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,540
Huan Er, I want to ask you something.

469
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,500
It's so late already. What were you doing with that boy from the Jing family?

470
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,530
He brought me something to eat.

471
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,400
Dad, I've eaten so much.

472
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,520
I feel like my stomach is going to explode.

473
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,920
I can't take it, Dad. I need to go to the washroom.

474
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,050
Mom, are you done yet?

475
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,740
Mom, hurry up!

476
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,120
My stomach hurts.

477
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,330
I can't hold it, Mom.

478
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,820
Li Qiang, bring a bed sheet.

479
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,570
I just washed it. It's clean and dry now.

480
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,660
There's definitely one over there. No need to bring that.

481
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,060
Just listen to me.

482
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,560
The bed sheets over there are always worn out and not as good as the ones at home.

483
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,200
What if you have an allergic reaction?

484
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,880
Dad, where are you going?

485
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,950
I'm going on a work trip.

486
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,390
Nonsense.

487
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,060
Your dad has been transferred.

488
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,630
Look how bad your department is.

489
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,920
They just transferred you without prior notice. It was so sudden!

490
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,240
I don't even know what to pack now.

491
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,770
You got transferred, Dad?

492
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,190
To Tonglin.

493
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,260
Uncle Yang got promoted to deputy director,

494
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,521
so they transferred me over there.

495
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:59,660
If I do well, I might get promoted to deputy director too.

496
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,990
I heard the sports university in Tonglin is quite good.

497
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,430
I'm near the place. Let me check it out for you first.

498
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,920
Got it.

499
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:17,370
Li Qiang, I told you to bring more sweaters, but you didn't.

500
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,670
It's just a quick check-in. No need to bring so much!

501
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,070
You're always so stubborn with me. How stubborn you are.

502
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,850
- Take care of your mom for me. 
 - Don't worry.

503
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,280
I'm getting older now.

504
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,300
I won't be going out to the field as much anymore.

505
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,260
Once you start college, I'll transfer back,

506
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,740
and we can all be together more often.

507
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,820
- Oh, about your soccer— 
 - I know.

508
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,900
Keep doing it until the end.

509
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,580
I have to go now.

510
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,640
   

511
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,120
You've grown taller.

512
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,720
- Really? 
 - You look like an adult now.

513
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,480
I'm off.

514
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,960
Bye.

515
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,700
Where is Uncle Jing going?

516
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,340
My dad was temporarily assigned out of town.

517
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,990
When will he be back?

518
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,400
Don't know.

519
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,200
Where did you go?

520
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,810
I bought a set of practice questions.

521
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,390
Let's go.

522
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:43,770
 I used to think I was the only one afraid to ask when Dad would come back. 

523
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:48,240
 But I realized it's not just fear of the answer being too far away. 

524
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,500
I'm home!

525
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,470
Huan Er, you're back.

526
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,710
Dad.

527
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,480
Oh, right. Don't touch the kitchen door just yet.

528
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,820
I just fixed it and put some oil on it.

529
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,100
Why did you suddenly fix the door?

530
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,060
Whenever you push this door, it creaks.

531
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,900
If your mom comes home from a night shift for a nap,

532
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,660
the creak will definitely wake her up.

533
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,850
 I guess I was also worried that Dad, who already had so much on his mind, 

534
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,700
 might hear it and feel even worse. 

535
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:25,400
I'm leaving tomorrow, so I better get this done quickly.

536
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,140
Oh yeah, I bought you some oranges.

537
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,620
They're really sweet. Try one now.

538
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,380
I'll try it.

539
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,180
- It's so sweet. 
 - Right?

540
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,320
- Try one. Try one. 
 - I'll have one.

541
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,134
Sweet or not?

542
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:39,830
- Sweet. 
 - Sweeter than me?

543
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,580
Nothing's sweeter than my precious daughter.

544
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,700
Dad, you're sweating so much.

545
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,080
It's fine.

546
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,800
Let me wipe it off for you.

547
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,800
I'm getting VIP treatment. I have a little helper while working.

548
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,200
All done.

549
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,660
Look, this is too loose.

550
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,250
I told Mom she doesn't need to put your stuff away next time.

551
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,920
It's okay, whatever is convenient for you two.

552
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,355
Dad.

553
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:12,620
Let's take a photo together.

554
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,060
Why the sudden idea to take a picture?

555
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,040
Well, I'm an adult now.

556
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,390
I just want to keep a memory.

557
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,280
- Can we? 
 - Sure, we'll take one later.

558
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,670
Wait a moment. Your neck is covered in sweat.

559
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,540
 I've realized I'll never ask that question aloud. 

560
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:46,370
 Parents choose their dream careers and live the lives they want. It's their freedom. 

561
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:51,370
 I can't choose my parents, but I can choose what kind of child to be. 

562
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,390
 I choose to let them feel at ease. 

563
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:17,580
   

564
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,560
 My memory of senior year is simple: silence. 

565
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,620
 A sudden, overwhelming silence. 

566
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,810
 No more noise during breaks. 

567
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,870
 No more whispering during self-study sessions. 

568
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:44,860
 Everyone is working hard toward their future. 

569
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,676
No one wants to attend PE class.

570
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:56,270
I'll go by myself then.

571
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,181
   

572
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:04,040
   

573
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,070
Xi Chi!

574
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,830
I passed my physical test.

575
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,380
Congratulations.

576
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,240
Your future is promising now.

577
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:50,440
Honestly, if I hadn't been competing with you all this time,

578
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,770
I might not have been able to go through it.

579
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,791
Let's have another battle someday.

580
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:58,740
After all, there aren't many opponents I actually respect.

581
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,820
Look at you bragging.

582
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,160
All right.

583
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,720
I got it.

584
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,190
Don't give up.

585
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,620
I'm leaving.

586
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,280
I've been looking for you two for a long time. It turns out you're sitting here.

587
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,850
Come on.

588
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:50,520
Recently, I had someone bring me some supplements from New Zealand.

589
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,280
Kids are under a lot of academic stress lately. These are good for the brain.

590
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,260
Each of you, take one.

591
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:04,210
Sister Li, you do know that supplements shouldn't be taken care of carelessly.

592
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,290
Even medicine is three parts poison.

593
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:11,040
For kids, just some basic vitamins will do. Understand?

594
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,120
Am I right, Yi Fan?

595
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,040
What's wrong with you? Something on your mind?

596
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,940
It's nothing. I'm just hesitating over whether I should ask you for

597
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,230
a good tutoring school recommendation.

598
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,150
Of course. Any level, any price range, you name it.

599
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:33,370
Feel free to ask me. What happened? Are you thinking of getting Xi Chi a tutor?

600
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,370
It's just...

601
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,700
A while ago, I went to ask the sports university professors.

602
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:45,420
With Xi Chi's current level, if he doesn't pass the sports university assessment,

603
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,810
his only options would be schools for sports management or other related fields.

604
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,000
In that case, it would limit his career choices.

605
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,790
So, I've been thinking it might be better for him to aim for a comprehensive university.

606
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,430
- What do you all think? 
 - That's true.

607
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,040
- It makes sense. 
 - The entrance exam is a big deal in life.

608
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,440
As parents, we should plan for our kids.

609
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,120
- Exactly. 
 - I'll help you ask around.

610
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,910
Thanks so much.

611
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,020
I see you should take two more boxes.

612
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,011
Give them to your kid to boost their brain power.

613
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:21,180
He needs more.

614
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,500
Since your kid is not that intelligent, he should eat more of this.

615
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,690
- You... 
 - You just take one box first.

616
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,210
I'm saving this last one for my kid.

617
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,490
Anyway, I'll head off now.

618
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,740
I'll save it for Dr. Li, then.

619
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:54,920


620
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,760
 "Yesterday's Clear Sky" by Yang Xizi 

621
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,810
♫  The falling leaves outside the window gently glide past your sight  ♫

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,800
♫  Looking forward to the day  ♫ 
 ♫  When we meet again  ♫
